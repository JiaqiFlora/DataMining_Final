Why was 1984 set in 1984?,"I've been doing some Internet research, and the only thing that people agree on is that we don't know. There are, however, three theories. One (slightly convoluted) theory is that he took the date from Alexander Chayanov's Путешествие моего брата Алексея в страну крестьянской утопии (My Brother Alexei's Journey Into the Land of Peasant Utopia), which is set in 1984, through a connection with Yevgeny Zamyatin, the author of We, a novel which inspired 1984. However, this is not a very likely theory.[1] The most common theory: However, I found another theory that I personally found much more believable:  According to Wikipedia, Eileen wrote the poem End of the Century, 1984 for the 50th anniversary of her school, in 1934. The 100th anniversary would then be 1984.  Wikipedia says: Although the poem was written a year before she met Blair, there are some similarities between the futuristic vision of Eileen's poem and that in Nineteen Eighty-Four, including the use of mind control, and the eradication of personal freedom by a police state. As @RaisingAgent mentioned in the comments, Eric Arthur Blair is George Orwell's real name. See a related question. As she died in 1945, when Orwell was working on 1984, it seems quite possible that he would name it after her poem, in her memory. Several parts of the poem by Eileen Blair are reminiscent of a dystopian world, such as 1984: Every loss is now a gain

How do we know Humpty Dumpty was an egg?,"I am going to contradict the other answer. Humpty Dumpty may not have been an egg at conception, but he was certainly one by 1835, thirty years before Lewis Carroll wrote Alice in Wonderland. There was a long satirical poem published in 1835, Child Capone's Nonage, by A Monk, which you can find on Google books, which has a footnote which starts: “Humpty-dumpty sat on a wall,
Humpty-dumpty had a great fall:
Not all the King's horses and all the King's men
Could set Humpty-dumpty right agen.” This nursery rhyme upon an egg, which every body remembers, represents, under a beautiful allegory, the easy lapse of a child from his early position of virtue, and the vast difficulty of reclaiming him at school and college, even though these may have been founded and endowed by kings. It's not clear to me whether the footnote is serious or not — I expect not. Let me remark that the riddle is not quite as hard to guess as it might seem to modern readers.  Before the riddle branded Humpty Dumpty as an egg forever, Humpty Dumpty meant a short, fat person. For example, Google books finds the 1828 book The Dialect of Craven, in the West-Riding of the County of York by Mark-William Carr, with the definition: HUMPTY-DUMPTY , Short and broad. ""He's a lile humpty-dumpty fellow"" and an egg is indeed short and broad. So, even though the word ""humpty-dumpty"" originally meant a short, plump person rather than an egg, it may be that the poem originated as a riddle whose answer was an egg."
Snoopy can balance on an edge atop his doghouse. Is any reason given for this?,"Charles Schulz seems to have addressed this question only once, in the 25th anniversary book ""The Peanuts Jubilee"". I haven't found this anywhere online (including the Peanuts Wikia) so I thought I'd upload it and share it here. The more Snoopy moved into his life of fantasy, the more important it became for his doghouse to remain in side view. You simply cannot have a dog doing and thinking the things that Snoopy does on a realistic doghouse. The image is much more acceptable when the doghouse is drawn only from the side. When necessary, it almost loses its identity completely. Snoopy's typewriter could never balance on the peak the way it does and, of course, Snoopy himself is somewhat of a mystery when one examines his sleeping pose closely. I once inquired of a veterinarian how birds stay on tree limbs when they fall asleep. He told me that their claws receive a message from their brain after they have fallen asleep, which tightens a certain muscle, keeping them from tumbling off the branch. He said a similar thing occurs to horses, allowing them to sleep while standing. Humans do not have this ability. When I am asked how Snoopy remains on top of his doghouse after falling asleep, I am now able to say that his brain sends a message to his ears, which lock him to the top of his doghouse.
 Sources here and here  A commenter on Reddit pointed out that Charles Schulz references this in the April 29, 1963 strip: "
What is Hobbes?,"Bill Watterson has spoken about this on a number of occasions. The very short answer is that his strips obey the rule of funny, that Hobbes is a toy when it suits the story for him to be a toy and real when it suits the story that he's real (for example in the strip below where Hobbes ties Calvin up in a way that he couldn't have accomplished on his own).  WEST: Well, in a way that says more about Calvin than Hobbes because Hobbes is implicitly, explicitly just a product of his imagination. WATTERSON: But the strip doesn’t assert that. That’s the assumption that adults make because nobody else sees him, sees Hobbes,
in the way that Calvin does. Some reporter was writing a story on
imaginary friends and they asked me for a comment, and I didn’t do it
because I really have absolutely no knowledge about imaginary friends.
It would seem to me, though, that when you make up a friend for
yourself, you would have somebody to agree with you, not to argue with
you. So Hobbes is more real than I suspect any kid would dream up. WEST: Well, at the risk of getting into psychobabble, a lot of psychologists would say that children create imaginary friends to play
out family dramas. So an argument can be just as much a part of an
imaginary world as, you know, a sort of sentimental, gooey friendship
can be. WATTERSON: Yeah, well, I would hope that the friendship between Calvin and Hobbes is so complex that it would transcend a normal
fantasy. The resolution of the question of whether Hobbes is real or
not doesn’t concern me or interest me, but, hopefully, there’s some
element of complexity there that will make the relationship
interesting on a couple of levels. The Bill Watterson Interview"
Has copy protection ever been used in physical books?,"Look at it this way - the reason why companies need DRM is because digital files can always be copied verbatim, i.e. bit for bit. Companies cannot prevent files from being copied and re-distributed so they need DRM - a system that alters the files in a way that the contents can only be accessed under specific circumstances, e.g. by entering a license key, inserting an official CD, etc. With hard copies, copying ""files"" is significantly harder, because one has to get a hold of the physical copy of the product. What was equal to hitting the 'download' button, now requires taking a stroll to the library, or paying money for an actual copy.  Oh, and some more diligent copy centres will not allow you to copy more than a certain per cent of the book. While this doesn't apply to every country, it may still be an obstacle. Coming back to your actual question, what you are describing is called, per Wikipedia, the ""analog hole"". While it may be nigh-impossible to decipher a DRM-protected book, or crack a DRM-protected game, once you have a physical copy of an object there is a number of ways you can copy it. Off top of my head, I can already think of a ""lamp + tripod + DSLR camera stand"", which is not very hard to construct, but is good for practical purposes. Combine this with optical character recognition, and you have a fault-proof home-made analog piracy system. Why fault-proof? Because digital cameras use the same working principle as the human eye, so DRM, in this case, will be more of a double-edged stick than it is with digital content. There are multiple technologies available, that make traditional scanning and copying impossible. For instance, there is a technology that will make ""VOID"" texts appear on scanned copy: All of our paper products are protected by AuthentiGuard Pantograph 4000TM. This patented technology involves the printing of hidden text messages (""VOID"", ""COPY"", ""UNAUTHORIZED COPY"", etc.) into the background of a document. Text information or other artwork is placed onto this paper. Then, when this ""original"" is copied of scanned, the hidden word pattern becomes visible on the duplicate. The end result - a clearly distinguishable copy that can not pass off as the original.  Same company sells special paper for books as well, though I was unable to find examples of it being used, On a more light-hearted note, there is a book that is printed with a special kind of ink: it is sold in an air-tight package, as the ink starts to fade upon contact with air. It is called El Libro Que No Puede Esperar - The Book That Can't Wait, This provides a good incentive to actually read the book, before it becomes blank paper. "
Did Arthur Conan Doyle code Holmes and Watson as a gay couple?,"They cared deeply about each other as friends, but there was never anything romantic in it. Holmes was asexual. He wasn't just uninterested in women, he was uninterested in romance. All emotions, and [love] particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained teasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. -- ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" ""[...] love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all things. I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgment."" -- The Sign of Four, Chapter 12 Watson was heterosexual, and indeed married during much of his friendship with Holmes. As I listened to the words and realised what they meant, a great shadow seemed to pass from my soul. I did not know how this Agra treasure had weighed me down until now that it was finally removed. It was selfish, no doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realise nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us.
  ""Thank God!"" I ejaculated from my very heart.
  She looked at me with a quick, questioning smile.
  ""Why do you say that?"" she asked.
  ""Because you are within my reach again,"" I said, taking her hand. She did not withdraw it. ""Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a man loved a woman. Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my lips. Now that they are gone I can tell you how I love you. That is why I said, 'Thank God'.""
  ""Then I say 'Thank God', too,"" she whispered as I drew her to my side.
  Whoever had lost a treasure, I knew that night that I had gained one. -- The Sign of Four, Chapter 11 ""Now, Watson, the fair sex is your department,"" said Holmes, with a smile, when the dwindling frou-frou of skirts had ended in the slam of the front door. -- ""The Adventure of the Second Stain"" Watson frequently encouraged Holmes to show an interest in women, including while they were alone - a thing he would hardly have done if they were intended to be a homosexual couple. ""You would not call me a marrying man, Watson?""
  ""No, indeed!""
  ""You'll be interested to hear that I'm engaged.""
  ""My dear fellow! I congrat-""
  ""To Milverton's housemaid."" -- ""The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton"" (I'm sure there were more examples of this, but none are coming to mind just now) I also found a very interesting, lengthy, and rather heartfelt article from the Sherlockian Sherlock fan site, which goes into this issue in some detail. Guessing the sleuth’s sexual preference is not a novel thing, despite of the fact that in the original Canon dr. Watson is married three times, and even Holmes remarks in The Second Stain that his friend knows a lot about women („Now, Watson, the fair sex is your department.”) [...] Roger Johnson, editor of the Sherlock Holmes Journal, observed that in Arthur Conan Doyle’s original stories ""Watson is something of a ladies' man, but a faithful husband to his wife. And Holmes is essentially asexual, with no erotic interest in women or men."" [...] Doyle’s detective was not homosexual, and he did not changed this later, when he was rich and famous, though he could have written stories under a pen name. He was not too interested in erotic themes, but love between men and women often appears in his works. With the figure of Sherlock Holmes he wanted to focus on spiritual values. Some may think it odd that Holmes does not have any romantic relationships, but he explains in the Canon that thinking and his profession are the most appreciated things in his life, and he thinks emotions like love would only withdraw him from them. [...] Legendary Sherlock Holmes actor Jeremy Brett, who lived together with a male partner for a while, said that there was a genuine friendship between Holmes and Watson, but nothing more. Sadly in the modern age relationships changed so enormously that most people simply cannot understand how such kind of friendship can exist. Jeremy Brett had a humane and fair attitude to the topic. It was clear to him that Doyle did not want gay characters, and he respected this. In his interviews he always emphasized that the relationship of the duo was devoid of any romance, what they felt for each other was honest friendship."
Why is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy referred to as H2G2?,
"Where did the idea of a ""true name"" come from?","I've listed a few of the best-known examples of this trope dating back to centuries before the idea of a ""trope"" was even in circulation. This is by no means an exhaustive list. Judaism. For thousands of years, religious Jews have avoided speaking the name of God. In the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia, it is suggested that all Hebrew proper names are 'true' names, more than simply labels, but saying something about the essential nature of the named person: Like other Hebrew proper names, the name of God is more than a mere distinguishing title. It represents the Hebrew conception of the divine nature or character and of the relation of God to His people. It represents the Deity as He is known to His worshipers, and stands for all those attributes which He bears in relation to them and which are revealed to them through His activity on their behalf. A new manifestation of His interest or care may give rise to a new name. So, also, an old name may acquire new content and significance through new and varied experience of these sacred relations. And Wikipedia tells us a little more about the practice of not speaking the name of God: although there is nothing in the Torah to prohibit the saying of the name[9] and Ruth shows it was being pronounced as late as the 5th century BCE[10]—it had ceased to be spoken aloud by at least the 3rd century BCE during Second Temple Judaism[12] Egyptian mythology. As mentioned by Mithrandir, the concept of a person's true name granting power over them appears in tales of Egyptian mythology from thousands of years ago. From Wikipedia, cited to Geraldine Harris, Gods & Pharaohs from Egyptian Mythology: Isis frequently schemed against Ra, as she wanted her son Horus to have the power. In one myth, Isis created a serpent to poison Ra and only gave him the antidote when he revealed his true name to her. Ra now feared Isis, as with his secret name revealed she could use all her power against him and have Horus take over the throne. Traditional folk tales. The well-known folk story of Rumpelstiltskin revolves around this idea: the miller's daughter rashly promises her first-born child to the strange little man, and he will only allow her to keep the child if she can tell him his name. From this translation: “I  will  give  you three days,” said he, “and if at the end of that time you cannot tell my  name,  you  must  give  up  the  child  to  me.”  Then  the  Queen spent  the  whole  night  in  thinking  over  all  the  names  that  she  had ever  heard,  and  sent  a  messenger  through  the  land  to  ask  far  and wide  for  all  the  names  that  could  be  found. [...]
  The  third  day  the  messenger  came  back again, and said, “I have not been able to find one single new name; but as I passed through the woods I came to a high hill, and near it was  a  little  house,  and  before  the  house  burned  a  fire,  and  round the fire danced a comical little man, and he hopped on one leg and cried,  ‘Today  do  I  bake,  tomorrow  I  brew,  The  day  after  that  the Queen’s child comes in; And oh! I am glad that nobody knew That the  name  I  am  called  is  Rumpelstiltskin!’"" [...]
  And  then  she  said,  “Then  perhaps  your  name  is Rumpelstiltskin!” “The devil told you that! the devil told you that!” cried the little man, and in his anger he stamped with his right foot so hard that it went into the ground above his knee; then he seized his left foot with both his hands in such a fury that he split in two, and there was an end of him.  The TV Tropes page entitled ""I Know Your True Name"" lists Ursula le Guin's Earthsea series as the Trope Codifier - the work which, while it wasn't the first to use the idea, was more popular than preceding works and provided the template for most or all later uses of the trope. He saw that in this dusty and fathomless matter of learning the true name of each place, thing, and being, the power he wanted lay like a jewel at the bottom of a dry well. For magic consists in this, the true naming of a thing. So Kurremkarmerruk had said to them, once, their first night in the Tower; he never repeated it, but Ged did not forget his words. ""Many a mage of great power,"" he had said, ""has spent his whole life to find out the name of one single thing - one single lost or hidden name. And still the lists are not finished. Nor will they be, till world's end. [...] That is the language dragons speak, and the language Segoy spoke who made the islands of the world, and the language of our lays and songs, spells, enchantments, and invocations. Its words lie hidden and changed among our Hardic words. We call the foam on waves sukien: that word is made from two words of the Old Speech, suk, feather, and inien, the sea. Feather of the sea, is foam. But you cannot charm the foam calling it sukien; you must use its own true name in the Old Speech, which is essa. [...] No one knows a man's true name but himself and his namer. He may choose at length to tell it to his brother, or his wife, or his friend, yet even those few will never use it where any third person may hear it. In front of other people they will, like other people, call him by his use-name, his nickname - such a name as Sparrowhawk, and Vetch, and Ogion which means 'fir-cone'. If plain men hide their true name from all but a few they love and trust utterly, so much more must wizardly men, being more dangerous, and more endangered. Who knows a man's name, holds that man's life in his keeping. -- A Wizard of Earthsea: The First Book of Earthsea (emphasis mine) In fact, although it's best known from her Earthsea quartet, le Guin had used the same idea in some of her earlier stories, lesser-known precursors set in the world of Earthsea. The Rule of Names, a short story published four years before A Wizard of Earthsea and available in full as a PDF here, seems to be the first le Guin work to introduce her idea of true names: ""Now you know the Rules of Names already,  children.  There  are  two, and  they're  the  same on  every island in the world. What's one of them?"" ""It  ain't  polite  to  ask  anybody  what  his  name  is,""  shouted  a fat, quick boy, interrupted by a little girl shrieking, ""You can't never tell your own name to nobody my ma says!"" ""[...] When  you  children  are  through  school  and  go through the  Passage,   you'll   leave   your   childnames   behind   and   keep   only your truenames, which you must never ask for and never give away. Why is that the rule?"" The  children  were  silent.  The  sheep  bleated  gently.  Mr.  Underhill answered the question: ""Because the name is the thing,"" he said in his shy, soft, husky voice, ""and the truename is the true thing. To speak the name is to control the thing. Am I right, Schoolmistress?"" -- The Rule of Names (emphasis mine) So much for fantasy, but the same idea also crops up in science fiction. In the short story ""The Nine Billion Names of God"" by Arthur C. Clarke, we can see an intermediate step - a literary Archaeopteryx, if you will - between the ancient religious idea of the holy and powerful ""true name of God"" and the idea of true names as they appear in modern speculative fiction: ‘Well, they believe that when they have listed all His names – and they reckon that there are about nine billion of them – God’s purpose will be achieved. The human race will have finished what it was created to do, and there won’t be any point in carrying on. Indeed, the very idea is something like blasphemy.’ ‘Then what do they expect us to do? Commit suicide?’ ‘There’s no need for that. When the list’s completed, God steps in and simply winds things up … bingo!’ ‘Oh, I get it. When we finish our job, it will be the end of the world.’   [...]   “Wonder if the computer’s finished its run? It was due about now.”   Chuck didn’t reply, so George swung round in his saddle. He could just see
  Chuck’s face, a white oval turned toward the sky.   “Look,” whispered Chuck, and George lifted his eyes to heaven. (There is always a last time for everything.)   Overhead, without any fuss, the stars were going out. -- ""The Nine Billion Names of God"" Of course, we've already seen that neither le Guin nor Clarke were anywhere near the first to use these ideas, and perhaps not even the first in popular speculative fiction. But as the most popular/famous authors to do so, they likely had the largest effect on the subsequent development of the trope. Certainly the effect of le Guin's particular interpretation of it can often still be seen in modern fantasy novels to this day. I'm unsure how influential Clarke's sci-fi interpretation has been (indeed, it might be hard to distinguish between influence from his story and influence directly from Jewish religious beliefs), but in any case ""The Nine Billion Names of God"" is probably the most famous sci-fi appearance of the ""true names"" trope, so I thought it was worth a mention.

Why was The Call of the Wild banned?,"Let's go back to the plot of The Call of the Wild. Rereading it, there are a few main incidents that jump out at me as part of a larger trend: There's a common pattern here: fighting back. For a sled dog, life in the Yukon means fighting for your position and sometimes your life, as per The Law of Club and Fang. Additionally, abuse by masters requires self-defense. Buck quickly learns that he needs to protect himself if he wants to survive. In a way, Buck symbolizes the author himself. In his essay, ""How I Became a Socialist"", London wrote I was a rampant individualist. It was very natural. I was a winner. Individualism is terrifying for those in power. Individualism leads to fighting back against injustice, and that in turn can lead to revolution. In the 1920s - two decades after The Call of the Wild was published - Italy and Yugoslavia were ruled by dictators, Benito Mussolini and Alexander I, respectively. For both, rebellions would serve as their downfall later in their reigns, after various periods of time. The Call of the Wild could inspire revolution, and so was dismissed as ""too radical"". Banning it was a natural extension. The ban on The Call of the Wild was not an isolated incident. Since his rise to power, Mussolini took decisive action against writings of all kind. As Guido Bonsaver's Censorship and Literature in Fascist Italy explains, the dictator first targeted journalists, newspapers and periodicals in the 1920s. He only engaged in large-scale book-banning campaigns starting around 1931. Now, lest you think that the characterization of The Call of the Wild as too radical is preemptive, let me note that London's The Iron Heel (as well as various works by Maxim Gorky) were gathered and favored by anti-Fascists in Italy (p. 37). In other words, Mussolini had good reason to believe that London's works were actually inspiring revolution. I'm less familiar with The Iron Heel, but I'll take a shot at analyzing it. It focuses on a period stretching from 1912 to 1932 - really, leading up to and encompassing Mussolini's rise to power and early years. Socialism managed to become popular on both the United States and Europe, eventually leading to essentially the overthrow of governments. Once again, we see a popular uprising attacking the status quo, be it fascism or otherwise. This would be rightly worrisome for Mussolini and, later, Hitler. The Iron Heel and The Call of the Wild were not the only of London' works to essentially oppose the Nazi regime, even after his death in 1916. The Sea-Wolf, published in 1904, was written - according to London in The Letters of Jack London (p. 1513) - to attack the Übermensch (""super-man"") philosophy espoused by, among others, Friedrich Nietzsche. (London's Martin Eden also was strongly critical of the same ideas.) In the case of The Sea-Wolf, the embodiment of Nietzsche's super-man is Wolf Larsen, the captain of a schooner named the Ghost. Larsen is We see plenty of parallels between the life of the protagonist (Humphrey van Weyden) on the Ghost and Buck's struggle for survival in The Call of the Wild. It's an environment not suited for the weak or meek, where both the captain and crew can turn against you. While van Weyden is favored by Larsen, especially after not taking part in a mutiny, he is clearly a rival of the captain, just as Buck was a rival of Spitz. The difference here is that Larsen is truly a super-man - and he is portrayed as cruel and cold. Essentially, the book would later be used to attack the Nazis' master race doctrine. Add on the indirect promotion of individualism and socialism, and London becomes a cocktail for revolution against the dictatorships of Europe."
Why is there so much technical detail of whaling included in Moby-Dick?,"There are multiple purposes behind the novel structure of Moby-Dick. In the first instance the author was himself a whaleman, having spent 18 months as an ordinary seaman aboard the whaler Acushnet in 1841–42. In his experience the literature of the day, such as Miriam Coffin or The Whale-Fisherman by Joseph Hart, did not portray whaling accurately but rather sensationalised it. He wished to provide his readers with a more realistic account. In doing so, he also gave the reader the information necessary to better understand and appreciate the passages of whaling described in the novel. With the reader forewarned, he is able to keep the narrative passages tense and exciting. It is interesting that, early in the novel, the Pequod meets virutally no whales and that the chases become longer and more involved as the story progresses. This may be because Melville felt he needed to give the reader more and more technical information before they could fully appreicate these encounters, but understood the science would need to be spaced out among the narrative. In describing it to the reader, the science also serves another useful narrative function. It indicates that on whaling voyages, long periods of time pass when nothing much happens at all. By padding out of the story with scientific digressions serves as a useful narrative metaphor for waiting. The level of detail provided also mirrors one of the novel's central themes: obsession. Although Ishmael is the narrator and Ahab the obvious obsessive, the amount of science indicates that Ishmael is also an obsessive. His obsession is the business of whaling itself. Finally, Melville made good use of these passages in serving as metaphors for other themes of the novel where he felt it appropriate. For example in the chapter The Line, which describes how the whale line is stored and used in the boat, it ends by using the line as a metaphor. ""All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters
  round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden
  turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present
  perils of life."""
What is Tom Bombadil's importance in The Lord of the Rings?,"Bombadil is indeed an anomaly, and does not appear to fit very well into Tolkien's overall narrative. He comes from nowhere (although he has been there all along, unobserved), and disappears equally abruptly from the story. Unless the author has given us some hints about the character's relevance, we are reduced to speculation, so let us just consider the mechanics of the story. Tolkien has to get the four hobbits from Crickhollow to Bree, where they will meet Aragorn, unharmed, and without Gandalf to protect them; and yet they need to have some adventures on the way, otherwise the story becomes uninteresting. Gandalf's absence is Tolkien's biggest problem, and so Bombadil is basically a (slightly unreliable) stand-in for Gandalf. The hobbits are in no position to face the nine riders on their own. Neither can they just walk through the Old Forest and have a pleasant hike to Bree. So, we have Old Man Willow, which Bombadil rescues the hobbits from, and then the barrow wights, where he rescues them again, and in between these two escapades, a pleasant interlude in Bombadil's house, with Goldberry and plenty of food and rhyming verse. I have a suspicion that Tolkien had some attachment to Bombadil. Maybe Bombadil represents the author, since he is older than any other living thing in Middle Earth, and is unaffected by the power of the One Ring, and presumably, he is also unaffected by the destruction of the ring at the story's climax. Only an author has this much power to do as he pleases in his own stories. Tolkien is, perhaps, pulling a Hitchcock on us, since the director liked to make cameo appearances in his own films. In the Council of Elrond, Gandalf is right when he says that they cannot give the Ring to Bombadil, since he would probably just lose it. With the Ring in his own pocket, Tolkien loses the plot."
Does Dr. Manhattan have free will?,"My answer is no by his own design. My understanding is that he deliberately created a universe where all of his actions stay fixed, while other people have some free will. Note that my answer is based on Before Watchmen comics, and very little on Alan Moore's words. But firstly, he does not see himself as Jon Osterman anymore. Remember the line from Watchmen #12 (emphasis respected): It didn't kill Osterman... Did you think it would kill me? Or from Dr. Manhattan #1 (emphasis respected):   I am not Jon, but Jon became me. His perspective informed me, his perspective--    -- created me? Is that possible? What happened in that moment, that surge of energy that resulted in my birth? If I am a quantum effect, what was the quantum cause?   Whatever it was, did it happen before the incident, or during the incident?  But my main argument comes from Before Watchmen: Doctor Manhattan. 
In this prequel, there existed multiple quantum realities, each of them being a reflection of different choices people made. It all starts Dr. Manhattan going back in time to the point Jon Osterman was destroyed in the intrinsic field chamber. Manhattan expected to see his creation, but instead Osterman left the chamber unharmed. Apparently, Dr. Manhattan had somehow caused a disturbance in the timeline, causing the reality to splinter.  Here and further, all images are from Before Watchmen: Dr. Manhattan #3    [Dr. Manhattan] The only way this could happen... The only way one quantum reality could splinter and fracture into an infinite number of possibilities with me at the center... Is if I somehow became the quantum observer.
  I didn't realize it because I had only followed the stream of my existence up to a certain point, never going back to a moment before the incident the field chamber.
  Until I climbed the mountain high enough to see everything around me. 
  At some point I did something, saw or touched something that tore this quantum reality and created another. The effect then rippled back and forth along my timeline from the moment of my re-creation, creating new realities every time I made a decision.
  But how? When did I--
  [Janey's words from a flashback] ""Jon, I think I'd like to go home now, please.""   Dr. Manhattan had altered the reality during the first meeting of Crimebusters. When he had to be paired with Rorschach, he paired himself with Silk Spectre.    [Dr. Manhattan]: What's in the box?
  [Captain Metropolis]: Our first is Dr. Manhattan, whose presence here tonight honors all of us--
  [DM]: It's all a matter of perspective.
  [CM]: ... and the one he's partnered with tonight is--
  [DM]: And perspectives can be changed... with the slightest nudge.
  [CM]: --is--  This choice had caused the timeline to fracture at multiple points, with Dr. Manhattan being at the centre - as he is the cause. What does th' main man do? He goes an fixes the points in time (TM) that would've otherwise lead to nuclear Armageddon. He fixes his own choices, so that ""others can still make theirs"".   [Jon's father, from flashback] ""... There's nothing broken so bad that you can't put it back together again with enough effort.""
  [Dr. Manhattan]: As I look at the random moment that brought Janey and me together, I know what I must do to fix the delicate clockwork mechanism I have broken.
  Once I became the quantum observer, every time I made a choice it fractured reality, over and over. So the only way to reunite the timelines is by erasing all those choices.
  The irony is not lost on me.
  I am the most powerful being in the known universe. I can do anything.
  But for the world to be what it needs to be, what it must be, I must sacrifice my own choices, my own free will, so that they can have choices.  He summarises it all himself in this panel:   Like my mother, I must give up all of my choices so that they can make of this reality what they wish.
  In this new, united timeline, whatever I have done in the future is done. The decisions are made, and cannot be changed. they are as irrevocable as the choices I made in the past.
  Because all those moments are the same moment, one moment, eternal and simultaneous.
  So I must freeze that moment, that eternity, like fly frozen in amber.
  I am limitless.
  But I must become limited... and thus let this one world, this one reality, survive intact.   Therefore, if we count Before Watchmen continuity as canon, we have a pretty good explanation why Dr. Manhattan doesn't have free will: the universe where he doesn't have free will was the only universe where 1) he prevented nuclear war and 2) other people have free will.  To add an example from Alan Moore's comics, here's a panel from Watchmen #4, page 16:
  Janey: So, what you're saying is you knew he'd get shot? Jon, I... I mean, if you're serious, I mean, why didn't you do something?   Dr. Manhattan: I can't prevent the future. To me, it's already happening.   J: Jon, what are you saying? That you know the future? About everything? About us?   DM: In 1959, I could hear you shouting, here, now, in 1963. Soon we make love...   J: Just like that? Like I'm a puppet? Jon, you know how everything in this world fits together except people. Your prediction's way off, mister.   DM: No. We make love right after Wally arrives with the earrings I ordered for you...   J: Shut up! You're messing up my mind, Jon! Sometimes I think you're messing everything up!
  I mean, all this new technology, all because of you! Things are happening too fast. Things shouldn't... Was that the doorbell?   Wally: Janey? The mailman delivered this to me by mistake. Sorry I didn't drop it by earlier. Say hi to Jon for me.   Janey: Uh... Uh, sure. Thanks, Wally.   As further reading, I suggest A Timely Encounter: Dr. Manhattan and Henri Bergson by Christopher M. Drohan, Free Will and Foreknowledge: Does Jon Really Know What Laurie Will Do Next, and Can She Do Otherwise? by Arthur Ward, and I'm just a Puppet Who Can See the Strings: Dr. Manhattan as a Stoic Sage by Andrew Terjesen, all collected in Watchmen and Philosophy, edited by William Irwin and Mark D. White."
History of Spoilers,"Although comments above point to earlier examples (e.g., Les Diaboliques and The Mousetrap), I would argue that the ""spoiler"" first became a modern phenomenon, at least in American popular culture, with the Alfred Hitchcock's famous advertisements surrounding his 1960 film Psycho. The unexpected murder of Janet Leigh's character, and of course the final reveal of the murderer's alternate personality, were protected with a famous anti-spoiler marketing strategy.  You can see this anti-spoiler marketing in this short doc: https://youtu.be/DjRzj_Ufiew These strategies included: If you're looking for any specific works on the history of spoiler-aversion, I'd recommend C. Namwali Serpell's Seven Modes of Uncertainty, specifically the second chapter, ""Enfolding."" The chapter offers a nice review of the thought around spoiler aversion, and the second footnote there has this: Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) did a lot to get the idea of spoilers off the ground. His stringent restrictions on the revelation of the film's secret twists were advertised widely, and for the first time in film history, audiences weren't allowed to come into the theater after the movie began. ""It is required that you see Psycho from the very beginning,"" read posters depicting a comically stern Hitchcock tapping his watch. Hitchcock was probably inspired to develop these techniques because of Henri-Georges Clouzot's Les Diaboliques (1955), the end of which included an ""anti-spoiler"" message. A decade later, Doug Kenney wrote a piece for National Lampoon called ""Spoilers,"" which revealed the plots of famous films. (330-331) Namwali Serpell's chapter goes on to focus on the spoiler in literature, specifically Ian McEwan's 2001 novel, Atonement, as it relates to the literary mode of uncertainty he terms enfolding.

Did Gaiman and Pratchett troll an interviewer who thought they were religious fanatics?,"I haven't found a transcript or recording of the interview itself, but I did find a transcript of a different interview where the two spoke about this interview: Neil Gaiman: ""The first radio interview we did in New York, the interviewer was asking us 'Who is Agnes Nutter? What is her history? Is Armageddon happening?"" and so on and so forth. After a while, we twigged he hadn't realized this was fiction. He thought he'd been given two kooks who'd come across these old prophecies and were predicting that the world was going to be ending."" Terry Pratchett: ""Once we realized, it was great fun. We could take over the interview, since we knew he didn't know enough to stop us."" Edit, later. Here are some more links confirming that this occurred (stolen from this answer to a very similar question on SF&F.SE): a mention of the interview in a reprinted edition of *Good Omens, a mention of the interview on Neil Gaiman's blog Also, here's a quote from a Neil Gaiman interview in 2015 (which I found in the SF&F duplicate): “[Terry] said ‘Well, you remember we were on the Good Omens author tour in February 1990’ … He said ‘We were in New York and we went to that ABC affiliate radio station, and the interviewer had not actually read the book … so when we started telling him about Agnes Nutter … we started explaining about this 17th century witch who all of her predictions were true … He did not realise this was fictional. We realised he had not read the book, and the engineers in the control room behind the glass panel who we could see and he could not, were lying on their backs kicking their legs against the walls.’ And I said, ‘Of course I remember. I was willing to let that go on for the entire interview’. To answer the title question: Yes, this interview occurred. No transcript or recording appears to be available, however. (Also, go upvote Jos's answer - they got confirmation from  Gaiman himself!)"
How did Wonka's Golden Ticket sweepstakes ensure that children would win?,"Strictly speaking, an adult does find one of them. One of the women working at the factory of Veruca Salt's father is the person who opens the particular candy bar with the Golden Ticket. But Mr. Wonka is explicit, as hobbs correctly notes, in saying that only five children would be allowed on the tour (with one or two guardians apiece). So while technically this Rosie the Walnut-Sheller would be allowed into the factory, it would be whatever child she brought with her who would be taking the tour (and competing for the prize)."
What message is Bradbury trying to convey in Fahrenheit 451?,"The book deals with a lot of themes about censorship, so naturally you would think censorship is one of his main points or themes he is trying to convey in the book. Strangely enough, censorship was not what he intended the book to be about. According to Bradbury, the book is about media and how it dumbs down the nation. I wasn't worried about freedom, I was worried about people being turned into morons by TV. We've never had censorship in this country, we've never burned books... Fahrenheit's not about censorship, it's about the moronic influence of popular culture through local TV news, the proliferation of giant screens and the bombardment of factoids. All the popular programs on TV, the competition programs, they don't give you anything but factoids. They tell you when Napoleon was born, but not who he was. So it doesn't matter about the date. You should never memorize dates, to hell with it. So we moved into this period of history that I described in Fahrenheit 50 years ago (source: Bradbury on Censorship/Television) In fact, he even gets angry when readers insist the book is about censorship. Weller: have you encounted academic misinterpretation of your work? Bradbury: I was lecturing at Cal Fullerton once and they misinterpreted Fahrenheit 451, and after about half an hour of arguing with them, telling them that they were wrong, I said, “Fuck you.” I've never used that word before, and I left the classroom. (Source: Listen to the Echoes) Even though a lot of the book seems to be about censorship, you can see elements of ""Media dumbing people down"" in it. For example, Montag has trouble getting along with his wife because she is consumed with media. TV, telephone, plays, etc. Clarisse seems to be one of the few characters that isn't caught up in the cycle of endless consumption. She plays outside, and is very curious. Beatty says about her: Beatty smiled. ""Here or there, that's bound to occur. Clarisse McClellan? We've a record on her family. We've watched them carefully. Heredity and environment are funny things. You can't rid yourselves of all the odd ducks in just a few years. The home environment can undo a lot you try to do at school. That's why we've lowered the kindergarten age year after year until now we're almost snatching them from the cradle. We had some false alarms on the McClellans, when they lived in Chicago. Never found a book. Uncle had a mixed record; anti?social. The girl? She was a time bomb. The family had been feeding her subconscious, I'm sure, from what I saw of her school record. She didn't want to know how a thing was done, but why. That can be embarrassing. You ask Why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed, if you keep at it. The poor girl's better off dead."" Beatty directly states that the firemen came about when the nation started caring more about quick and shallow consumption (TV) than deep, slow, meaningful consumption (books). Here's a pretty long quote where Beatty is talking to Montag about the origins of the firemen: Beatty puffed his pipe. ""Every fireman, sooner or later, hits this. They only need understanding, to know how the wheels run. Need to know the history of our profession. They don't feed it to rookies like they used to. Damn shame."" Puff. ""Only fire chiefs remember it now."" Puff. ""I'll let you in on it."" Mildred fidgeted. Beatty took a full minute to settle himself in and think back for what he wanted to say.  ""When did it all start, you ask, this job of ours, how did it come about, where, when? Well, I'd say it really got started around about a thing called the Civil War. Even though our rule-book claims it was founded earlier. The fact is we didn't get along well until photography came into its own. Then--motion pictures in the early twentieth century. Radio. Television. Things began to have mass."" Montag sat in bed, not moving. ""And because they had mass, they became simpler,"" said Beatty. ""Once, books appealed to a few people, here, there, everywhere. They could afford to be different. The world was roomy. But then the world got full of eyes and elbows and mouths. Double, triple, quadruple population. Films and radios, magazines, books leveled down to a sort of paste pudding norm, do you follow me?"" ""I think so."" Beatty peered at the smoke pattern he had put out on the air. ""Picture it. Nineteenth-century man with his horses, dogs, carts, slow motion. Then, in the twentieth century, speed up your camera.  Books cut shorter. Condensations, Digests. Tabloids. Everything boils down to the gag, the snap ending."" ""Snap ending."" Mildred nodded. ""Classics cut to fit fifteen-minute radio shows, then cut again to fill a two-minute book column, winding up at last as a ten- or twelve-line dictionary resume. I exaggerate, of course. The dictionaries were for reference. But many were those whose sole knowledge of Hamlet (you know the title certainly, Montag; it is probably only a faint rumour of a title to you, Mrs.  Montag) whose sole knowledge, as I say, of Hamlet was a one-page digest in a book that claimed: 'now at least you can read all the classics; keep up with your neighbours.' Do you see?  Out of the nursery into the college and back to the nursery; there's your intellectual pattern for the past five centuries or more."" ... ""Speed up the film, Montag, quick. Click? Pic? Look, Eye, Now, Flick, Here, There, Swift, Pace, Up, Down, In, Out, Why, How, Who, What, Where, Eh? Uh! Bang! Smack! Wallop, Bing, Bong, Boom! Digest-digests, digest-digest-digests. Politics?

"Was the title ""The Lord of the Rings"" picked on purpose to be ambiguous?","The phrase “the Lord of the Rings” is ambiguous in the same way in English: it might, in theory, refer either to the One Ring, which rules the other rings, or to Sauron, who can use it to rule all the rings. However, the text does not make use of this ambiguity. The phrase “the Lord of the Ring(s)” appears four times in the text, and three times it’s clear that Sauron is intended: ‘Yes, I knew of them. Indeed I spoke of them once to you; for the Black Riders are the Ringwraiths, the Nine Servants of the Lord of the Rings.’ J. R. R. Tolkien (1954). The Fellowship of the Ring, book II, chapter 1. London: Allen & Unwin. ‘But in any case,’ said Glorfindel, ‘to send the Ring to [Bombadil] would only postpone the day of evil. He is far away. We could not now take it back to him, unguessed, unmarked by any spy. And even if we could, soon or late the Lord of the Rings would learn of its hiding place and would bend all his power towards it.’ [II.2] Here Bilbo’s hand ended and Frodo had written: THE DOWNFALL
OF THE
LORD OF THE RINGS AND THE
RETURN OF THE KING J. R. R. Tolkien (1955). The Return of the King, book VI, chapter 9. London: Allen & Unwin. In the fourth case Pippin uses the phrase as a joke, and Gandalf quickly corrects him: ‘Hurray!’ cried Pippin, springing up. ‘Here is our noble cousin! Make way for Frodo, Lord of the Ring!’ ‘Hush!’ said Gandalf from the shadows at the back of the porch. ‘Evil things do not come into this valley; but all the same we should not name them. The Lord of the Ring is not Frodo, but the master of the Dark Tower of Mordor, whose power is again stretching out over the world!’ [II.1] When the characters want to emphasize the role of the One Ring in controlling the other rings, they use the phrase “Ruling Ring” instead: ‘It has been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself.’ [I.2] ‘For in the days of Isildur the Ruling Ring passed out of all knowledge, and the Three were released from its dominion.’ [II.2] ‘[Saruman] came and laid his long hand on my arm. “And why not, Gandalf?” he whispered. “Why not? The Ruling Ring? If we could command that, then the Power would pass to us.”’ [II.2] ‘Alas, no,’ said Elrond. ‘We cannot use the Ruling Ring. That we now know too well. It belongs to Sauron and was made by him alone, and is altogether evil.’ [II.2] ‘But what then would happen, if the Ruling Ring were destroyed as you counsel?’ asked Glóin. [II.2] ‘The Ringwraiths are deadly enemies, but they are only shadows yet of the power and terror they would possess if the Ruling Ring was on their master’s hand again.’ [II.4] If Tolkien had chosen the title with an eye to its ambiguity, I would have expected him to make use of the ambiguity somewhere in the text, but he does not: he maintains a consistent distinction between “the Lord of the Rings” and “the Ruling Ring” to convey the two senses. This suggests that the title was not chosen on purpose to be ambiguous."
"Why does ""Watchmen"" use the 9-panel grid?","He has said so in his Twitter, in response to a thread discussing the origin of the 9-panel grid: Actually, I chose the nine panel grid and sold it to Alan. Gave him great control & its restriction challenged me to compose more creatively
 Dave Gibbons on Twitter  In Watching the Watchmen, Gibbons mentions the 9-panel grid again, and notes that it was influenced by Steve Ditko, the comic artist who created the character Rorschach was based on, as Comicsalliance reports. Dave Gibbons also mentions Ditko in another tweet from the above thread. The control part is understandable - 9 panels means a lot of scenes one can be fit on just one page. It makes the progression of the plot easy, by describing more than one action without the need for the reader to flip the page (or use two pages - see below). It also makes following the plot easier - one simply has to read from left to right, top to bottom. Some even suggest that a grid is similar to the poetic meter. This is sometimes overlooked in modern comics, where panels overlap and details stick out: 
Death Vigil, volume I, chapter (issue) 1, page 28. Am I supposed to be reading from left to right first, or top to bottom? Such layouts as this may be confusing for readers like me, who cannot be sure which way the page is supposed to be read, so they read it the wrong way, and sometimes get spoilers. With a strict grid, on the other hand, it's impossible to follow a reading order other than the one intended by the creators. This grid is great from the artistic perspective on multiple levels. For instance, there are a lot (and I mean a lot) of ways of using a 9-panel grid: 
Image courtesy of Tom Carpenter I asked a question on Mathematics Stack Exchange: In how many different ways can a 9-panel comic grid be used? Turns out 9 panels allow for 322 variations, which is more that a 6-panel grid and a 4-panel grid allow  - 32, and 8 variations, respectively (for comparison, 6-by-3 grid, i.e. 2 pages, allows 314662 variations, while 16-panel grid allows 70878). This gives the writer and the artist sufficiently many ways to divide the page in any shape that is most suitable for the story:   
 Watchmen #4 and #7; here and afterwards, click on the image for full resolution. As this website points out, this grid has the benefit of a central panel - one that could be the focus of the page, and that would be the summary or the main idea of the whole page. On the other hand, 9 panels could also be divided in the following way:  
Watchmen #5 Notice that the colours of the panels alternate:  Or in case of the second page, it's the colour purple and the triangle symbol that form the pattern. I found this contrast an interesting detail and similar to techniques in films and books, i.e. when the camera shoots alternate between a close-up of the actor, and wide shots of the scenery, or when a chapter told from a character's perspective, and then from narrator's or other characters (e.g. The Martian and The Witcher). Finally, the 9-panel grid allowed the creators to explore the potential of 2-page ""splash"" scenes, such as this one:  Appendix 1: I don't know how much exactly the 9-panel grid influenced Alan Moore's script, but there's a panel with With Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, moderated by none other than the ubiquitous Neil Gaiman, which offers at least some information on their creative process. Appendix 2: It looks like the latest crossover between the mainstream DC Rebirth universe and Watchmen also used a 9-panel grid, to indicate the connection between the two comics:

Why is a raven like a writing desk?,"Good question! It's open to many possible interpretations. Lewis Carroll intended it to be little more than a joke, with no real answer, but his readers bugged him so much that eventually he proposed an answer, which he included in the preface to the 1896 (some sources say 1897) edition of Alice in Wonderland: Enquiries have been so often addressed to me, as to whether any answer to the Hatter's Riddle can be imagined, that I may as well put on record here what seems to me to be a fairly appropriate answer, viz: 'Because it can produce a few notes, tho they are very flat; and it is never put with the wrong end in front!' This, however, is merely an afterthought; the Riddle, as originally invented, had no answer at all. (source for this quote; emphasis mine) It's important to note that: Originally, it was supposed to be a little funnier than that. Carroll spelled 'never,' as 'nevar' — 'raven' spelled backwards — but a proofreader erased the inverted pun before it was published. (source) But since the riddle as originally written was intended to have no answer, the solution provided by Carroll in later years is no more canonical than any other. So an answer to your question would be incomplete without mentioning some of the many other solutions which have been proposed over the years, several of which are (IMHO) better than Carroll's: Because Poe wrote on both. –- Sam Loyd, Cyclopedia of Puzzles (1914) Because it slopes with a flap. –- Cyril Pearson, Twentieth Century Standard Puzzle Book Because there is a b in both, and because there is an n in neither. –- Aldous Huxley, “Ravens and Writing Desks”, Vanity Fair, September 1928 Because it bodes ill for owed bills. –- Francis Huxley, The Raven and the Writing Desk (1976) Because one has flapping fits and the other has fitting flaps. –- Peter Veale Because one is good for writing books and the other better for biting rooks. –- George Simmers Because a writing desk is a rest for pens and a raven is a pest for wrens. –- Tony Weston (the above bullet points taken from this blog post)"
The author of a literary work disagrees with critics about meaning—who's right?,"Deliberately steering clear of academic criticism, since that's what you asked for (granted, not what you answered and therefore presumably not the intended meaning of the question. Badum tish.): the author has said that they didn't mean for their work to suggest that. There are various ways you could nevertheless be right: On the other hand, the reader cannot claim any absolute objective authority any more than the author can. If you somehow misread the word ""Transylvania"" as ""Transsiberia"", then it's going to subtly alter your genuine experience of the opening passage of Bram Stoker's Dracula, but there's not much mileage in writing your English class report on the basis that the Count is Russian. Similarly if it turns out I have an alibi for all those murders, then you're not looking so smart after all, regardless of what my text implies. Line these conclusions up as supporting or opposing genuine techniques of criticism, or not, as you please! Informally, though, if you read Fahrenheit 451 and conclude that Bradbury was trying to make readers think disapprovingly of government censorship, then you're making a statement about Bradbury and you're probably wrong (since I doubt he was lying). If you read Fahrenheit 451 and conclude that it will in fact make readers think disapprovingly of government censorship, then you're making a statement about readers and you're probably right at least as often as not. If you wanted for some reason to make statements ""purely about the text"" then you must avoid both traps."
Does Snape talk in code?,"The Language of flowers, or floriography, goes back much further than Victorian times. It was used or alluded to in Shakespeare's plays (see also this question) and even the Hebrew Bible. It's unknown whether J.K. Rowling knew about it - she's never commented publicly on the wormwood/asphodel theory - but other characters in the Harry Potter books do have appropriate flower-based names: for instance, Petunia symbolises anger and resentment.

Let's take a look at the wider context surrounding this quote (the full passage is available here): ‘Potter!’ said Snape suddenly. ‘What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?’ This is the line under consideration. To gather evidence as to whether or not it's significant, let's look at what else Snape says in the same exchange. ‘Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?’ Well, this is certainly foreshadowing. The bezoar becomes much more important in book 6, when Harry uses it (on the advice of the Half-Blood Prince, whom he little realises is Snape himself) to win a Potions contest in Slughorn's class, and then later uses it to save Ron's life. ‘What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?’ This is probably a foreshadowing of book 3, when the werewolf Lupin comes on the scene and Snape, when taking one of his classes, attempts to teach the students about werewolves in the hope that they'll recognise Lupin as one. So Snape definitely has significant lines in this scene. It makes sense that his wormwood/asphodel line is also somehow significant.

There's also an article on Pottermore, a site which is affiliated with J.K. Rowling and for which she often provides new pieces of her own writing, which talks about this issue: The Victorian language of flowers was used back in the 1800s to send meaningful messages, convey deep secrets and share moments. Nearly every flower has a special meaning and, in times when some words could not be spoken aloud, bouquets would say a 1,000 words. There are hidden meanings throughout all the Harry Potter books, but what do we learn about Lily, Petunia and Severus when we examine their stories with this language in mind? Asphodel and wormwood If his first words to Harry are anything to go by, the language of flowers suggests that Snape deeply regrets Lily Potter’s death. ‘What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?’ The answer can be found in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince when Professor Slughorn asks the class to brew the Draught of Living Death. Interestingly, this is after Harry found Snape’s copy of Advanced Potion-Making and followed his instructions to prepare the perfect draught. Asphodel is a type of lily and means ‘remembered beyond the tomb’ or ‘my regrets follow you to the grave’ while wormwood is often associated with regret or bitterness. Assuming that Rowling approves Pottermore articles even if she didn't write them herself, this is more evidence from the authorial-intent angle. Still, of course, even if she didn't intend this symbolic interpretation originally, it's so neat that she would surely have no issues pretending (or letting it be generally assumed) that she did.

The asphodel/wormwood line was also used by fans as evidence for a Severus-Lily relationship even before book 7 came out. While not offering much evidence that the symbolism was intentional, this does show that it was clear enough to put the idea of Severus's love for Lily into people's minds even before such a thing was ever part of canon. There were a few hints or things that made people consider [Severus/Lily]. In Snape's first Potions class, he talks about the combination of two ingredients, Asphodel and Wormwood. Wormwood is a very bitter root, and Asphodel is a type of lily. Snape says these two create the Draught of Living Death, and in DH, there are a few instances where Snape's eyes suggest he's, to use a somewhat melodramatic phrase, dead inside. -- CoS forums And this LiveJournal post written before the publication of book 7: We know from book 1 that Snape likes (or is good with) riddles and is a master of double entendre and insinuation. Many times his words are couched with hidden meaning. In their first meeting in Potions class, Snape picks Harry out as ""our new celebrity"" and asks him what he would get by adding asphodel to an infusion of wormwood. Asphodel symbolically means death, esp. death of someone beloved to the person who offers asphodel. Asphodel is also a lily. Wormwood symbolically means bitter sorrow. So in essence, Snape is asking Harry if he knows what death wrapped in bitter sorrow is. Or put another way, he might be trying to tell Harry that he loved her and that he bitterly regrets Lily's death. 
Finally, for further reading including a detailed analysis of the symbolism of asphodel and wormwood in both real-world floriography and other works of literature, you may be interested in this blog post."
Why is Aragorn so weird to Pippin when they make their final farewell before going back to the Shire?,"TL;DR: In this scene Aragorn confirms to Pippin that their relationship remains one of liege-lord and vassal within the feudal system of Gondor and Arnor. This confers high status and honour upon Pippin, as well as obligation: in fact, these are two sides of the same relationship. When Aragorn says that his “realm lies also in the north” he is referring to the kingdom of Arnor. The history as described during the Council of Elrond: Of Númenor he [Elrond] spoke, its glory and its fall, and the return of the Kings of Men to Middle-earth out of the deeps of the Sea, borne upon the wings of storm. Then Elendil the Tall and his mighty sons, Isildur and Anárion, became great lords; and the North-realm they made in Arnor, and the South-realm in Gondor above the mouths of Anduin. J. R. R. Tolkien (1954). The Fellowship of the Ring, book II, chapter 2. London: George Allen and Unwin. After the War of the Last Alliance, Gondor flourished but Arnor did not: ‘In the North after the war and the slaughter of the Gladden Fields the Men of Westernesse were diminished, and their city of Annúminas beside Lake Evendim fell into ruin, and the heirs of Valandil removed and dwelt at Fornost on the high North Downs, and that too is desolate. Men call it Deadman’s Dike, and they fear to tread there. For the folk of Arnor dwindled, and their foes devoured them, and their lordship passed, leaving only green mounds in the grassy hills.’ The Fellowship of the Ring II.2. Although Gondor flourished at first, eventually “the line of Meneldil son of Anárion failed” and the kings were replaced by ruling Stewards, of whom Denethor was the last. This means that Aragorn, who “is descended through many fathers from Isildur Elendil’s son”, is now the heir to the crown of Gondor and of Arnor, a claim that he hopes to use to establish feudal rule over the former territory of Arnor. What is this feudal rule that Aragorn hopes to establish? Feudalism was a form of government in medieval Europe that operated by personal relationships of fealty. A feudal lord owned a territory that was too large to administer in person, and there was no system of civil administration on which he could depend, so he installed trusted vassals as tenants on parts of his territory. The vassals swore fealty to their liege-lord and there was a mutual relationship of support and security between them: the vassals were expected to support their lord by providing military service, and the lord was expected to support his vassal through gifts of land and treasure, and to protect the vassal if he was threatened by invasion, raids, or rebellion. Describing the origin of the feudal system in Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire, Marc Bloch wrote: [Charles Martel and his successors] wanted to establish order and Christian peace through their reams. They wanted soldiers to spread their dominion far and wide and to carry on the holy war against the infidel, an enterprise both conducive to the growth of their own power and beneficial for souls. The older institutions appeared inadequate for this task. The monarchy had at its disposal only a small number of officials: but these were in any case not very reliable men and—apart from a few churchmen—they lacked professional tradition and culture. Moreover, economic conditions precluded the institution of a vast system of salaried officals. Communications were slow, inconvenient and uncertain. The principal difficulty, therefore, which faced the central government was to reach individual subjects, in order to exact services and impose the necessary sanctions. Thus there arose the idea of utilizing for the purposes of government the firmly established network of protective relationships. The lord, at every level of the hierarchy, would be answerable for his ‘man’ and would be responsible for holding him to his duty. Marc Bloch (1939). Feudal Society, volume 1, p. 157. Translated by L. A. Manyon (1961). University of Chicago Press. Thus vassals governed their own territories by subinfeudation, appointing their own sub-vassals to form a feudal hierarchy. This system was held together by personal relationships: ties of family and marriage, campaigning together in times of war, hunting, feasting, gift-giving, and so on. Vassals sent their sons to serve with their lord, and their daughters to serve their lord’s wife, in order to acquire these connections. As kings they had to get supporters and above all create an army. So they attracted into their service—frequently in return for gifts of land—many men who were already of high rank. Former members of the military following, establishied on property granted by the ruler, did not cease to be regarded as his vassals; and his new followers were considered to be bound to him by the same tie, even if they had never been his companions-in-arms. Both groups served in his army, followed by their own vassals, if they had any. But, since most of their time was spent away from their master, the conditions under which they lived were very different from those of the household warriors of but a short time before. Each one of them was the centre of a more or less widely scattered group of dependants whom he was expected to keep in order; if necessary, he might even be required to exercise a similar supervision over his neighbours. Thus, among the populations of the vast empire, there became distinguishable a relatively very numerous class of ‘vassals of the Lord’—that is, ‘of the Lord King’ (vassi dominici). Enjoying special protection of the sovereign and being responsible for furnishing a large part of his troops, they also formed, through the provinces, the links of a great chain of loyalty. Bloch, pp. 158–159. With this model in mind, we can see what is happening in the exchange between Aragorn and Pippin. Aragorn has just been crowned king of Gondor, and he also claims the crown of Arnor by his descent from Isildur. In Gondor, there seems to be a well-established system of feudal loyalty, as we can see from the description of the feudal levy summoned by Denethor: The men of Ringló Vale behind the son of their lord, Dervorin striding on foot: three hundreds. From the uplands of Morthond, the great Blackroot Vale, tall Duinhir with his sons, Duilin and Derufin, and five hundred bowmen. From the Anfalas, the Langstrand far away, a long line of men of many sorts, hunters and herdsmen and men of little villages, scantily equipped save for the household of Golasgil their lord. From Lamedon, a few grim hillmen without a captain. Fisher-folk of the Ethir, some hundred or more spared from the ships. Hirluin the Fair of the Green Hills from Pinnath Gelin with three hundreds of gallant green-clad men. And last and proudest, Imrahil, Prince of Dol Amroth, kinsman of the Lord, with gilded banners bearing his token of the Ship and the Silver Swan, and company of knights in full harness riding grey horses; and behind them seven hundreds of men at arms, tall as lords, grey-eyed, dark-haired, singing as they came. J. R. R. Tolkien (1955). The Return of the King, book V, chapter 1. London: George Allen and Unwin. Aragorn has secured his hold over these lords of Gondor through his bravery and leadership in the War of the Ring. But in the case of Arnor his rule is much less secure: the Rangers of the north are his loyal kinsmen, but Arnor is a vast land. Aragorn needs all the help he can get while he cements his rule by rebuilding the strongholds of Annúminas and Fornost Erain and installing loyal vassals there. A peaceful and loyal Shire will be an useful bulwark of the kingdom during this period of uncertainty, and so he reminds Pippin of the oath of fealty he swore: ‘Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor, and to the Lord and Steward of the realm, to speak and to be silent, to do and to let be, to come and let go, in need or plenty, in peace and war, in living or dying, from this hour henceforth, until my lord release me, or death take me, or the world end. So say I, Peregrin son of Paladin of the Shire of the Halflings.’ The Return of the King V.1. But as discussed above, the obligation goes both ways: if Pippin, as a vassal of the king of Gondor, is obliged to provide service to his lord, then Aragorn, as Pippin’s liege-lord, is obliged to support him in turn. It seems very likely that after the coronation of Aragorn, his vassals, including Pippin, swore fealty to him, and Aragorn swore his part of the obligation using similar words to those of Denethor: ‘And this do I hear, Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord of Gondor, Steward of the High King, and I will not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is given: fealty with love, valour with honour, oath-breaking with vengeance.’ The Return of the King V.1. This two-way relationship means that Aragorn, in reminding Pippin of his duty, also confers on him the honour and status as the personal representative of the king. We can see hints of this status in VI.6, where on the journey north “Pippin rode with the knights of Gondor”, establishing personal relations with his peers of the realm. We can see Pippin making use of this status when he returns to the Shire: ‘I am a messenger of the King,’ he said. ‘You are speaking to the King’s friend, and one of the most renowned in all the lands of the West. You are a ruffian and fool. Down on your knees and ask pardon, or I will set this troll’s bane in you.’ The Return of the King VI.8. In the appendices we find that Aragorn uses his personal relationships with the members of the fellowship of the ring to help cement his control of the Shire and the lands to the west of it (the Westmarch): 1434 Peregrin becomes the Took and Thain. King Elessar makes the Thain, the Master† and the Mayor‡ Counsellors of the North-kingdom. […] 1436 King Elessar rides north, and dwells for a while by Lake Evendim. He comes to the Brandywine Bridge, and there greets his friends. He gives the Star of the Dúnedain to Master Samwise, and Elanor¶ is made a maid of honour to Queen Arwen. 1451 Elanor the Fair marries Fastred of Greenholm on the Far Downs. 1452 The Westmarch, from the Far Downs to the Tower Hills, is added to the Shire by the gift of the King. Many hobbits remove to it. 1462 At his [Sam’s] request the Thain makes Fastred Warden of Westmarch. † Merry, the Master of Buckland. ‡ Sam, the Mayor of the Shire. ¶ Daughter of Sam and Rose. The Return of the King, Appendix B. Note Aragorn’s use of gifts of treasure (the Star) and land (the Westmarch) to his vassals, and his recruitment of Elanor (his vassal’s daughter) to his court to ensure that these relationships persist into the next generation. Elanor’s husband is then appointed lord of the Westmarch, extending Aragorn’s control over this region of Eriador through ties of loyalty and kinship. The question wonders what motivated Pippin to offer his fealty to Denethor. But Pippin explains this clearly: it is a repayment of a debt he owes to Boromir, who died at Amon Hen in an attempt to save the hobbits. He cannot repay the debt to Boromir, but he can repay it to Boromir’s father. Pippin flushed and forgot his fear. ‘The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow,’ he said; ‘and Boromir was pierced by many. When last I saw him he sank beside a tree and plucked a black-feathered shaft from his side. Then I swooned and was made captive. I saw him no more, and know no more. But I honour his memory, for he was very valiant. He died to save us, my kinsman Meriadoc and myself, waylaid in the woods by the soldiery of the Dark Lord; and though he fell and failed, my gratitude is none the less.’ Then Pippin looked the old man in the eye, for pride stirred strangely within him, still stung by the scorn and suspicion in that cold voice. ‘Little service, no doubt, will so great a lord of Men think to find in a hobbit, a halfling from the northern Shire; yet such as it is, I will offer
it, in payment of my debt.’ Twitching aside his grey cloak, Pippin drew forth his small sword and laid it at Denethor’s feet. The Return of the King V.1."
Should I read The Silmarillion before or after reading The Lord of the Rings?,"You should read The Silmarillion after reading The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  To start off with an analogy: The Silmarillion starts on such a gigantic scale that if you begin with it everything else is going to seem confusing, petty, or irrelevant. If you want to understand the history of the American Civil War, you don't start with the Big Bang. It's a collection of stories that illustrate how Arda (""The World"") was created by Eru Iluvatar; His Children, the Elves and Men; events during the Years of the Trees; and the main bulk of the book: events of the First Age concerning The Silmarils way before The Lord of the Rings begins.  There are also chapters on some events in the Second and Third age. A full description can be found on Wikipedia. It's a trilogy focusing on the events of the Third Age; mainly focusing on the Rings of Power and the adventures of the Fellowship. The books encompasses Middle-earth in the Third Age and is the highlight of all of Tolkien's works. The title of the novel refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth. From quiet beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters, not only the hobbits Frodo Baggins, Samwise ""Sam"" Gamgee, Meriadoc ""Merry"" Brandybuck and Peregrin ""Pippin"" Took, but also the hobbits' chief allies and travelling companions: the Men Aragorn son of Arathorn, a Ranger of the North, and Boromir, a Captain of Gondor; Gimli son of Glóin, a Dwarf warrior; Legolas Greenleaf, an Elven prince; and Gandalf, a Wizard. More information can be found on Wikipedia and by watching the movies. Publication order – The Lord of the Rings was published first The Lord of the Rings was published on: July 29, 1954. The Silmarillion was published on: September 15, 1977. That's a two decade gap. Most authors recommended readers to read their books in the order they were published.  Tolkien's world is mostly centered around Hobbits The Lord of the Rings is centered around the adventures of Hobbits and their companions. It's all about how Hobbits came to become so famous, all thanks to Bilbo and Frodo. It is depicted through the eyes of the Hobbit Frodo Baggins (some chapters dedicated to Sam, Pippin and Merry), while The Silmarillion.... is not. There's barely any mention of ""Hobbits"" in The Silmarillion at all. You can't start reading Tolkien's books without knowing anything about Hobbits! The Lord of the Rings is an easier read to begin with For TLotR: It's all about bringing the Ring into the Mountain.  The Silmarillion? You have one chapter about Elves, one about Men, one about the Ainur (Valar and Maiar), suddenly jumping to Turin's adventures, Beren's love story, the dark-elf Maeglin; all this throughout the whole book. There's no consistent narration in The Silmarillion; the story is jumping all over the place. While The Lord of the Rings was written by JRR Tolkien alone, The Silmarillion was written (majority) by him and his son Christopher, giving rise to the issue of inconsistent writing styles. Christopher himself notes in the Foreword of The Silmarillion: As the years passed the changes and
  variants, both in detail and in larger perspectives, became
  so complex, so pervasive, and so many-layered that a final
  and definitive version seemed unattainable. Moreover the
  old legends ('old' now not only in their derivation from the
  remote First Age, but also in terms of my father's life)
  became the vehicle and depository of his profoundest
  reflections. In his later writing mythology and poetry sank
  down behind his theological and philosophical
  preoccupations: from which arose incompatibilities of tone.  [...] A complete consistency (either within the compass of
  The Silmarillion itself or between The Silmarillion and
  other published writings of my father's) is not to be looked
  for, and could only be achieved, if at all at heavy and
  needless cost. Moreover, my father came to conceive The Silmarillion as a compilation, a compendious narrative, made long afterwards from sources of great diversity
  (poems, and annals, and oral tales) that had survived in
  agelong tradition; and this conception has indeed its
  parallel in the actual history of the book, for a great deal of
  earlier prose and poetry does underlie it, and it is to some
  extent a compendium in fact and not only in theory. To this may be ascribed the varying speed of the narrative and
  fullness of detail in different parts, the contrast (for example)
  of the precise recollections of place and motive in the
  legend of Túrin Turambar beside the high and remote
  account of the end of the First Age, when Thangorodrim
  was broken and Morgoth overthrown; and also some
  differences of tone and portrayal, some obscurities, and,
  here and there, some lack of cohesion.  Now, in The Lord of the Rings, we follow Frodo and friends through their journey to Mount Doom and beyond. We witness them mature and grow psychologically. In The Silmarillion however, we are introduced to a main character at the start of the chapter, but by the next chapter, we follow the story of another character. This transition prevents any kind of ""attachment"" to form between reader and character, hence The Silmarillion is a much harder read. The Silmarillion really just resembles a ""The Lord of the Rings appendix"" I'm sure not many read the TLotR appendices before The Fellowship of the Ring. Why? You bought The Lord of the Rings to read about a fantastical adventure, probably not to read a bunch of abbreviated post-book fillers. The Silmarillion is that kind of a read. The whole book doesn't focus on one character, it's more of one-chapter-one-main-character, not unsimilar to an appendix.  The Silmarillion contains spoilers for The Lord of the Rings. Seriously major spoilers There's this one chapter at the end of The Silmarillion that completely summarises the events of the Third Age, which also includes a nice summary of the War of the Ring. The intention of the author (and editor) is clear: Read The Lord of the Rings first, and then read The Silmarillion to have a complete summary of what happened. ...you get to know more about Hobbits, which are the centre of Tolkien's imagination.  ...you build stamina as you pursue Tolkien's books. Easy reads to hard reads. ...you aren't going to be spoiled by the Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age chapter at the end of *The Silmarillion. ...you get to learn more about Middle-earth gradually. To once again cite the analogy I read to reinterate my points: The Silmarillion starts on such a gigantic scale that if you begin with it everything else is going to seem confusing, petty, or irrelevant. If you want to understand the history of the American Civil War, you don't start with the Big Bang. –Ernest W. Adams To summarise:  By reading all about the War of Wrath, the resultant sinking of Beleriand and the imprisonment of the Dark Lord Morgoth in the First Age first, you'll realise how insignificant the defeats of the Third Age is in comparison to the First Age. Sauron is merely the servant of Morgoth and Gondor doesn't get sunk after the War of the Ring. You don't want to spoil your Tolkien experience by making the amazing events of TLotR seem insignificant by reading The Silmarillion first.

"In 1984, why did O'Brien wait so long?","Most likely he wanted to crush Winston's spirit. Look at it this way: Winston has an affair with Julia.

The Party doesn't just want to stop him, they want to crush his spirits also. From the book: Winston shrank back upon the bed. Whatever he said, the swift answer crushed him like a bludgeon.

"Meaning/translation of title ""The Light Fantastic"" by Terry Pratchett","In-universe the ""light fantastic"" is an actual, factual thing. There was no real need for the torches. The Octavo filled the room with a dull, sullen light, which wasn’t strictly light at all but the opposite of light; darkness isn’t the opposite of light, it is simply its absence, and what was radiating from the book was the light that lies on the far side of darkness, the light fantastic. It was a rather disappointing purple colour. The Light Fantastic Pratchett, in the Discworld Companion notes that this is not to be confused with Octarine (which is the ""Colour of Magic"") and splits from ordinary light. Light, nature of. As far as can be determined, there are now four distinct types of
light on the Disc. For the sake of discussion they could be called
common light, meta-light, dark light and ‘the light fantastic’. Meta-light is almost an idea rather than a phenomenon. It is the light by which darkness can be seen, and therefore is always available, everywhere. If it didn’t exist, darkness could not be visible. It is widely used in the film industry for shots in caves and mines. ... The light fantastic is perhaps best evidenced by the dull, sullen light which fills the room where the OCTAVO is kept. Not strictly light at all but the opposite of light. Darkness is not the opposite of light, it is simply its absence. The light fantastic is the light that lies on the far side of darkness. Ordinary light passing through a strong magical field is split into not seven but eight colours, and the eighth – OCTARINE – is generally associated with things magical. It can be described in terms of other colours about as readily as red can be described in terms of green, yellow and blue, but if some description is really insisted on then octarine is a rather disappointing greeny-purple-yellow colour."
Was there a reason Victor Hugo chose 24601 as the number for Jean Valjean?,"This is part of a pattern of similarities between the character of Jean Valjean and the author himself: both are of similar age, have similar habits and similarly austere lifestyles, and even share the same dreams. This is according to David Bellos's The Novel of the Century: The Extraordinary Adventure of Les Misérables, which concludes Part Three with: But Hugo put in a secret sign to remind himself and maybe those who knew him well that there were deep links of identity between the dutiful and persistent ex-convict and himself. Hugo was born on 26 February 1802, but because he was a slightly premature baby, he always believed he had been conceived on 24 June 1801. Valjean's prison number on his first incarceration at Toulon is 24601. -- p. 162 (emphasis mine) As a bonus, Valjean's second prisoner number was apparently also chosen for its special significance to Hugo: it refers to the month of his daughter Léopoldine's death. From footnote 46 in Kathryn Grossman's Figuring Transcendence in Les Miserables: Hugo's Romantic Sublime: Gaudon demonstrates that this image, which represents genius in one of the poet's earliest carnets (8 July 1820), is a sign of his ""deep identification"" with Valjean (Temps 547). As further evidence that the hero is an alter ego, Gohin cites the two numbers assigned to him in prison. The first, 24601, refers to the supposed date of Hugo's conception (24 June 1801), while the second, 9430, alludes to Léopoldine's death in September 1843 (""Une histoire"" 47; see also 52). -- p. 165 (emphasis mine)"
"Why do many Korean folk tales start with ""back when tigers smoked""?","That went a lot further down the rabbit-hole than I expected. There doesn't seem to be a lot of agreement on the origin of the phrase. It wouldn't seem like it would be a very old reference, since tobacco was introduced to Korea in the early 1600s. This Reddit post claims that it comes from an earlier phrase about eating the tobacco and might actually have originally been referencing catnip. Overall, I've found two main theories. First, it may have simply been an indication of a highly fictional story, since obviously tigers don't smoke normally. Secondly, some people tie it directly to a kind of democracy and liberty. When tobacco was initially introduced to Korea, practically everyone smoked, and it was considered medicinal, but during the Joseon period, it became a practice restricted to the aristocrats, smoked in absurdly long pipes that required servants to light the pipe from the other end. Invoking tigers (part of Korea's mythological tale of how the nation came to be) smoking invokes an idea of when everyone was equal, even humans and animals. For example, from the previously mention Reddit Post: While it is often said ""back when tiger used to smoke"" to denote something that happened ages ago as in myths and legends. If you want to get real technical about it. Tabbacco didn't enter Korea until 1618. There are lot of articles mentioning it wasn't originally back when tigers 'smoked' but 'ate' as in ate catnip. A different article points out that the reason why back when tiger used to smoke is because according to ""Hamel's Journal and a Description of the Kingdom of Korea, 1653-1666"" everybody regardless age and gender would smoke in Korea. Until it started getting class restricted and lower class was no longer allowed to smoke infront of higher classes. So, according to this theory phrase is refering to back when equality still existed. Whatever the case, I think it's a cool phrase regardless. Lastly, the saying has an additional layer of meaning now because wild tigers are extinct in South Korea (North Korea claims to still have them), killed off in the early 20th century by hunters and the occupying Japanese."
Is Judaism represented in the Narnia books?,"Note: This does not in ANY WAY represent my own religious views. It's possible that C.S. Lewis meant for the Dwarfs to represent the Jews. At the end of The Last Battle, the Dwarfs refused to be 'taken in' by Aslan. It's possible that C.S. Lewis meant for this to represent the Jews refusing to believe in Jesus. The Jews didn't believe in Jesus. They don't think that he fulfilled the requirements to be the Mashiach (Messiah). I think I read that Christians believe that they'll get hell for that. And, in Narnia, the Dwarfs are refusing to believe in Aslan, leaving themselves to be stuck sitting there, believing that they are in a barn, for eternity. There's also the fact that the Dwarfs are often presented with beards (quotes eventually), and Jews often wear their beards long. After posting this, I had been doing some research on what Lewis thought of Judaism. I found Lewis's Trilemma, in which he says: I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept his claim to be God. That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. ...As this is almost exactly what Judaism believes, that he was deified by his followers, he seems pretty critical of them. On this webpage, they make some points: First, in Luke 23:1-2, the Jews opposed Jesus being their Savior because they were  fearful of Him.  They feared Him because He did not follow their laws and how could their Messiah not respect their ways.
  ...
  Similarly, the dwarves were blinded by their fear like they were being held in a dark stable and could not escape. They could not see the paradise that Aslan created and that there were no doors at all on this stable.  Secondly, the Jews did not believe in Jesus even though he saved lives and performed miracles in front of them.  (John 12:37)  In the book, Aslan performed a miracle in front of the dwarves.  He made banquet food appear out of nowhere but the dwarves believed that the food was donkey food.  Thirdly, to believe in God, one must give up all control.  In the Bible, Jesus tells Nicodemus that he must give up all his worldly possessions to have salvation in Him.  Nicodemus cannot give up this control.  (John 3:1-21)  In the book, the main problem for the dwarves is that they do not want Aslan to control them. So, ways in which the Dwarfs could represent Jews: Their belief in Aslan's return. The Dwarfs have always been a little reluctant to believe in Aslan, or at least his return. Remember in Prince Caspian? ""Oh, Aslan!"" said Trumpkin cheerily but contemptuously. ""What matters much more is that you wouldn't have me.""
-Prince Caspian, chapter 6 ... ""But they also say that he came back again,"" said the Badger sharply.
  ""Yes, they say,"" answered Nikabrik, ""but you'll notice that we hear precious little about anything he did afterward. He just fades out of the story. How do you explain that, if he really came to life? Isn't it much more likely that he didn't, and that the stories say nothing more about him because there was nothing more to say?""
-Prince Caspian, chapter 12 And the Jews don't believe that Jesus came back to life. Not believing in miracles performed right in front of them.  Aslan raised his head and shook his mane. Instantly a glorious feast appeared on the Dwarfs' knees: pies and tongues and pigeons and trifles and ices, and each Dwarf had a goblet of good wine in his right hand. But it wasn't much use. They began eating and drinking greedily enough, but it was clear that they couldn't taste it properly. They thought they were eating and drinking only the sort of stuff you might find in a stable.
-The Last Battle, chapter 13 Apparently Jesus did miracles and they still didn't believe that he was the son of God.1 | 2  They are afraid of being 'taken in' and being controlled. ""Well, at any rate there's no Humbug here. We haven't let anyone take us in. The Dwarfs are for the Dwarfs.""
  ""You see,"" said Aslan. ""They will not let us help them. They have chosen cunning instead of belief. Their prison is only in their own minds, yet they are in that prison; and so afraid of being taken in that they cannot be taken out. But come, children. I have other work to do.""
-The Last Battle, chapter 13 And apparently from the source I mentioned before, some guy did something like that in the Christian Bible?1 He had to give up his money to do something, and he didn't want to? In the Bible, Jesus tells Nicodemus that he must give up all his worldly possessions to have salvation in Him. Nicodemus cannot give up this control. (John 3:1-21) In the book, the main problem for the dwarves is that they do not want Aslan to control them. Also, the Dwarfs have always been old Narnians, even if they've had a rocky history with Aslan. They believe that Narnia is 'not a human country'. This is reminiscent of the Jews believing in one God, but not in Jesus. (Remember the note at the top? Not my views at all.) Tl;dr: It's fairly likely that C. S. Lewis intended for the Dwarfs to represent Judaism from his point of view. 1My knowledge of Christian theology is very sketchy. 2  In the Gospel of John, Jesus is said to have performed seven miraculous signs that characterize his ministry, from changing water into wine at the start of his ministry to raising Lazarus from the dead at the end.

Why has Bill Watterson ('Calvin and Hobbes') been retired for so long?,"Extensive interview quotes follow. Skip to the end for a summary.

In an interview from 1989, when Calvin & Hobbes was still going strong, Watterson explains that he was never aiming to become hugely successful or popular, that he writes within firm self-imposed limits which he doesn't want to leave, even if that makes his writing more difficult. Well, in the last three years, have the fantasy sequences gotten easier? You seem to be doing less of them these days. Is there a reason? WATTERSON: At first it was fun simply to juxtapose fantasy with reality [...] That was originally a fun device, but the burden on the strip has been to make each switch more clever. The juxtaposition alone can get predictable if it’s just done over and over in the same way. Each time it’s got to be done with some unpredictability: some cleverness to it so that it doesn’t become moribund. So, yes, I’m doing fewer because it’s getting more and more difficult. But I still try to do the fantasies as they interest me. There’s a limitation to them. They’re fun to read and they’re certainly fun to draw, but they don’t have the emotional weight to them that an interaction between two interesting characters does. In the same interview, Watterson seemed very cynical about the idea of licensing his work to other forms of media, claiming that this would degrade quality to an extent which wouldn't be acceptable to him, the creator. You’ve rejected licensing your strip’s characters. Why? WATTERSON: Basically, I’ve decided that licensing is inconsistent with what I’m trying to do with Calvin and Hobbes. I take cartoons seriously as an art form, so I think with an issue like licensing, it’s important to analyze what my strip is about, and what makes it work. [...] I’m not interested in removing all the subtlety from my work to condense it for a product. The strip is about more than jokes. I think the syndicate would admit this if they would start looking at my strip instead of just the royalty checks. Unfortunately, they are in the cartoon business only because it makes money, so arguments about artistic intentions are never very persuasive to them. I have no aversion to obscene wealth, but that’s not my motivation either. I think to license Calvin and Hobbes would ruin the most precious qualities of my strip and, once that happens, you can’t buy those qualities back. I’m sure some of the readers will say to all this,  “Come on. The comic strip is a popular art form.” What’s wrong with indulging the public’s interest? WATTERSON: Nothing, so long as it doesn’t compromise the art itself. In my case, I’m convinced that licensing would sell out the soul of Calvin and Hobbes. The world of a comic strip is much more fragile than most people realize. Once you’ve given up its integrity, that’s it. I want to make sure that never happens. Instead of asking what’s wrong with rampant commercialism, we ought to be asking, “What justifies it?” Popular art does not have to pander to the lowest level of intelligence and taste. All of this points towards a man who, when he became unable to continue his comic strip with a standard of quality that he felt was acceptable, would point-blank refuse to let it be continued at all. Neither to carry on himself, continuing to make money but allowing his standards to fall, nor to permit anyone else to continue in his place. This is also touched upon in another interview (date unknown, but still during Calvin & Hobbes's heyday): Do you see yourself doing this forever? WATTERSON: I'd like to, yeah, if the market will bear it. Calvin and Hobbes exclusively? WATTERSON: Yeah, I'm really enjoying the work. I feel that the characters have a lot of potential. I'd like to have the opportunity to draw this strip for years and see where it goes. It's sort of a scary thing now to imagine; these cartoonists who've been drawing a strip for twenty years. I can't imagine coming up with that much material. If I just take it day by day, though, it's a lot of fun, and I do think I have a long way to go before I've exhausted the possibilities. Do you think you'll ever need a ghost? WATTERSON: No, that's against what I believe about comic strips. In fact, I'd go even further and say I don't think a strip should ever be continued after the death or retirement of a cartoonist. Well, you know, a lot of the very good ones used assistants. WATTERSON: Yeah, Pogo did. Schulz has a good comment on that: ""It's like Arnold Palmer having someone to hit his chip shots."" I spent five years trying to get this stupid job and now that I have it I'm not going to hire it out to somebody else. The whole pleasure for me is having the opportunity to do a comic strip for a living, and now that I've finally got that I'm not going to give it away. It also gives me complete creative control. Any time somebody else has their hand in the ink it's changing the product, and I enjoy the responsibility for this product. I'm willing to take the blame if the strip goes down the drain, and I want the credit if it succeeds. So long as it has my name on it, I want it to be mine. I don't know, if you don't have that kind of investment in it...I guess that's the difference between looking at it as an art and looking at it as a job. I'm not interested in setting up an assembly line to produce this thing more efficiently. There are certainly people who could letter the strip better than I do; I don't enjoy lettering very much, but that's the way I write and that belongs in the strip because the strip is a reflection of me. If cartoonists would look at this more as an art than as a part time job or a get-rich-quick scheme, I think comics overall would be better. I think there's a tremendous potential to be tapped. Admittedly this is from long before he quit writing Calvin & Hobbes, but when asked whether he'd stick with that strip exclusively, his answer was yes. This may be part of the reason why he hasn't continued writing since: he preferred to have his name associated with one successful product than risk going downhill in the future for the sake of cashing in. I also found a much more recent interview (2013) where Watterson talks about what he's done since finishing Calvin & Hobbes. This is perhaps the most relevant in answering your question. There is a tendency to rehash and regurgitate properties with sequels and remakes. You had an idea, executed it, then moved on. And you ignored the clamor for more. Why is it so hard for readers to let go? WATTERSON: Well, coming at a new work requires a certain amount of patience and energy, and there’s always the risk of disappointment. You can’t really blame people for preferring more of what they already know and like. The trade-off, of course, is that predictability is boring. Repetition is the death of magic. Although he hasn't continued writing since Calvin & Hobbes, he's still been creating art, in the form of paintings. He explained that he doesn't display this because he can't handle the level of publicity and fame that Calvin & Hobbes gave him. According to your collection introductions, you took up painting after the strip ended. Why don’t you exhibit the work? My first problem is that I don’t paint ambitiously. It’s all catch and release—just tiny fish that aren’t really worth the trouble to clean and cook. But yes, my second problem is that Calvin and Hobbes created a level of attention and expectation that I don't know how to process. (Bold emphasis mine in all the above quotes.) 
There is at least one source which may contain more info to answer your question: the book Exploring Calvin and Hobbes, which contains far more lengthy interviews with Watterson than any of what I've quoted above. But I haven't found a copy of this book, and the interviews above seem to paint a reasonably clear picture already of the answer to your question:"
George Orwell's 1984 banned for contradictory reasons?,"The reality is that, from the perspective of a pro-government stance, 1984 promotes the idea that the government shouldn't be involved in your private lives, and that it's a quick step from government monitoring to government abuse and overreach. It promotes civil disobedience, and fighting for human rights and liberties in your own personal way. It promotes skepticism of government action: that the things governments do to purportedly help you actually hurt you in subtle ways. It promotes the idea that wars are simply fought because frivolous wars are good for social order, structure, and economy. It promotes the idea that the government not only wants to, but does, control and influence what you see and hear. No pro-government ideology wants to promote those ideas within its own culture. It's no surprise they were banned - in Russia and certain places in the US for roughly the same reasons. For Russia, the ""anti-communist"" reason makes a whole lot of sense. 1984 is really less about capitalism and communism, and more about totalitarianism. Russia, at the time, held many of the structural and cultural problems that 1984 hyperbolized and fought against. Russia, logically, banned imports of the book for roughly this reason.  However, importantly, the US did not ban these books in the same way Russia did. It wasn't sweeping, national, and unilateral: it was usually very local to specific school districts, and affected far fewer people.  1984 was published in the US at about the time of the second world war, in the year 1949. This was around the time when the US was at war with and/or gearing up for war with communist nations. The red scare was still very real, and proxy wars with communist nations were about to become the new hit fad. This was a time when ""commie"" was an insult and McCarthyism was alive and well. If you wanted to get a book banned, all you really had to do was suggest that it was a) going to have some serious influence, and b) promoted communism.  In the case of the US, it was usually individuals or small groups of individuals responsible for local bans. These bans were often raised, for example, by parents against school districts. The US itself can't ban books (with love: the First Amendment), and frequently overturns school boards on this point (it's a blog, but it's a case law blog). Instead of a national law, specific school boards, like the one in Jackson County, FL, banned the consumption of these books. (It's also on the ALA's frequently-challenged books list.) So it was on a far more individual, county-to-county basis. "
Did H. G. Wells use an emoticon in “The Time Machine”?,"TL;DR: The colon is a typographical error, not an early emoticon. One way to investigate this kind of question is to use full-text search on a suitable corpus. For example, we could search the Internet Archive for nearby words, sorted by publication date and see which editions have the colon. (Note that some care is needed in interpreting the results, because the digitization process does not always capture an accurate publication date.) A complication is that Wells wrote several versions of The Time Machine: The earliest draft of the story was called The Chronic Argonauts and was serialized in the Science School Journal, the students’ magazine of the Royal College of Science, in 1888. It had only the bare idea of ‘time travelling’ and a few lines of dialogue in common with the later versions. Wells subsequently made two further drafts, which are lost, and early in 1894, in response to a request by W. E. Henley, he returned to the story and rewrote it as a series of loosely connected articles for the National Observer. The first of them appeared in March, and six more were published between March and June, but the series was discontinued after Henley gave up the editorship. These article have a fairly close resemblance to the story as we now know it, particularly the first of them, but contain only a fraction of the material. […] At the end of the year Henley took over the editorship of the New Review and arranged for the novel to be serialized
there: it appeared in five instalments from January to May 1895. At the end of May The Time Machine was published as a book by William Heinemann, and this version is still in print. It is largely, though not entirely, the same as that serialized The New Review. Some years later Wells made a few minor changes in the text, which mainly consisted of removing the chapter headings and running various chapters together; and this revised text was included in the Atlantic Edition of his works [1924]; it has since been reprinted in The Short Stories of H. G. Wells [1923] and the Everyman’s Library edition of The Wheels of Chance and The Time Machine. Bernard Bergonzi (1960). ‘The Publication of The Time Machine 1894–5’. The Review of English Studies 11:41, pp. 42–43. The 1895 text lacks the “(as we thought it)” parenthesis, which appears for the first time in the 1923 revised text. The following table gives a selection of editions of the 1923 version of the story, in date order. You’ll see that the colon is missing from the early editions, and appears for the first time in the 1957 Berkley edition. (For the first time in this corpus, that is: there may be other editions for which the Internet Archive does not have digitized copies.) The subsequent appearance of the colon in the Bantam and Signet editions suggests that these two publishers copied their text from the Berkley edition (or all three copied it from a shared source)."
Is there any textual evidence to support that Dumbledore was gay?,"In terms of explicit confirmation, the answer is a very solid no. At no point did any character, nor the omniscient narrator, identify Dumbledore's sexuality in simple terms.  Various writers have identified incidents and passages that might act as subtle indicators toward his sexuality. Note that all of these were spotted post-facto and some require a very ungenerous interpretation. Dumbledore's love of knitting patterns, a typically feminine pre-occupation. ‘No, I was merely reading the Muggle magazines,’ said Dumbledore. ‘I
  do love knitting patterns. Well, Harry, we have trespassed upon

I've highlighted the smutty parts. ‘Oh, now, I’m glad you mentioned Grindelwald,’ says Skeeter, with a tantalising smile. ‘I’m afraid those who go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore’s spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell – or perhaps a Dungbomb. Very dirty business indeed. All I’ll say is, don’t be so sure that there really was the spectacular duel of legend.

I've highlighted the parts that suggest that he's a sexual deviant ‘Oh yes,’ says Skeeter, nodding briskly, ‘I devote an entire chapter to the whole Potter–Dumbledore relationship. It’s been called
  unhealthy, even sinister. Again, your readers will have to buy my
  book for the whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore
  took an unnatural interest in Potter from the word go. Whether
  that was really in the boy’s best interests – well, we’ll see. It’s

Did Shakespeare write his own stage directions?,"Actually, yes! Shakespeare wrote a number of stage directions, though they were never exactly... thorough. For example, at the opening of Hamlet, Shakespeare writes: FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO. Stage directions written by Shakespeare are usually like this: short, sweet, and to the point, if present at all. The reason for this is pretty simple: he didn't really need to write down stage directions when he himself was the director! Most of the time, they appear to be more... notes, or reminders.  This actually puts a number of... stranger and odder stage directions into a more interesting light. There are stage directions like:  Exit pursued by a bear (A Winter's Tale)
Enter a messenger with two heads and a hand (Titus Andronius) However, it appears that much of the time, the company itself wrote in stage directions: After writing out a manuscript, Shakespeare (or a professional scribe) made a copy of it in which obvious errors were corrected. The two versions had special names: the original manuscript was the ""foul papers"" because of the blots and crossouts on it. The new version was called a fair copy. It was submitted to the Master of Revels, a government censor who examined it for material offensive to the crown. If approved, the fair copy became known as a prompt copy, which the actors used to memorize their lines. The acting company bought the prompt copy, gaining sole possession of it, after paying the writer. The company then wrote in the stage directions (exit, enter, etc.). It appears that Shakespeare wrote in some small (and often humorous) stage directions as reminders, and then the remainder of the stage directions were filled in by the publisher before being passed to the actors for memorization."
How many of Poe's stories are interconnected?,"There are a few connections between Poe's works, generally via one story being directly or indirectly referenced in another one published later. However, there are two instances of multiple stories having the same universe, and sometimes the same characters: A Predicament and How to Write a Blackwood Article, and The Landscape-Garden, The Domain of Arnheim and Landor's Cottage. In 1838, Poe published Ligeia, a short story about a man struggling to come to terms with the illness and then death of his first wife (Ligeia), and then the death of his second wife in the same manner. Five years later, Poe published The Conqueror Worm, an extremely dark poem focusing on the inevitability of death, likely largely drawn from his own experiences with mortality - as was the case with much of his works; Poe drew quite a lot of inspiration from the lives and deaths of those he loved. Two years later, in a republication of Ligeia, he added The Conqueror Worm to it - written, or rather spoken in a fit of madness, by Ligeia herself. Shortly after finishing speaking the poem, she dies, after a brief addendum. The two works obviously do not take place in the same universe; one is simply a part of another. However, I feel that such a connection is worth including. This was the only other explicit connection I could find between Poe's works (though the characteristics of Dupin are not limited to that character alone). The theme of humans facing the horror of death does permeate much of Poe's writing, and it is perhaps a large part of his legacy. As for why Poe included the poem in the revised version of Ligeia - well, there are many interpretations. Wikipedia states Because it emphasizes the finality of death, it calls to question Ligeia's resurrection in the story. Also, the inclusion of the bitter poem may have been meant to be ironic or a parody of the convention at the time, both in literature and in life. This is certainly a valid interpretation - and one I agree with, because, to be frank, Ligeia is really about whether or not death can be overcome. Granted, some feel that Ligeia did in fact conquer death, but the same basic reasoning is used: Poe included the poem to just emphasize the human struggle with mortality. As an interesting side note, the name ""Ligeia"" also appears in Poe's poem Al Aaraaf (1829). You brought up a pair of short stories, published together under different names in 1838. Both have the same protagonist, who refers to herself as the Signora Psyche Zenobia. The plots are otherwise remarkably bizarre and separate from one another; the former is about the odd decapitation of said protagonist, while the latter is something of a social commentary on horror and suspense writing, which was of course Poe's specialty. If I'm interpreting them correctly, A Predicament is the story of how the Signora Psyche Zenobia inadvertently (I believe) carries out her assignment from How to Write a Blackwood Article: to die and record her thoughts on the matter. The details I leave to anyone who wishes to read the stories in full. This is another peculiarly connected group of poems. You may know of Poe's 1827 poem Tamerlane, published in his collection entitled Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827). What's curious is that Poe actually signed some of his poems as ""Tamerlane"", for reasons I cannot explain. They include I have been unable to figure out if there is any reason behind Poe's choice of pseudonym, or if he intended these poems to be additions to Tamerlane and Other Poems. They are not strictly stories, but I felt it might be interesting to include them, given that Tamerlane itself is a long enough epic poem to be on the same level as a story. It is possible that Poe intended the connection to be similar to that between Ligeia and The Conqueror Worm. In 1842, Poe published The Landscape-Garden, which he subsequently extended greatly into The Domain of Arnheim (1846-1847). The original short story centers around a (very wealthy) young man named Ellison, who wants to shape the landscape like an artist, with the country his canvas. The newer version actually explains how Ellison goes on to create Arnheim, a castle that fulfills his vision. Finally, we have a tenuous connection with Landor's Cottage: A Pendant to The Domain of Arnheim. Though neither Ellison nor Arnheim itself are mentioned by name in this story, it becomes obvious that this story is set in the same universe as the previous two - just later in time. The unnamed narrator is walking through rural New York State, and comes across what remains of Ellison's creation. I think this may finally be what you were looking for: multiple stories set in the same universe."
Did Lenore merely leave or is she dead?,"As Poe writes himself in his Philosophy of Composition, an essay about competent poetic writing based on his own analysis of The Raven (full text available here): I had now gone so far as the conception of a Raven, the bird of ill-omen, monotonously repeating the one word ""Nevermore"" at the conclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone, and in length about one hundred lines. Now, never losing sight of the object- supremeness or perfection at all points, I asked myself- ""Of all melancholy topics what, according to the universal understanding of mankind, is the most melancholy?"" Death, was the obvious reply. ""And when,"" I said, ""is this most melancholy of topics most poetical?"" From what I have already explained at some length the answer here also is obvious- ""When it most closely allies itself to Beauty: the death then of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such topic are those of a bereaved lover."" (emphasis mine) It should be noted, however, that the authenticity of ""The Philosophy of Composition"" has been called into question, with one biographer describing it as ""a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization than literary criticism."" (Hat-tip to BESW for informing me of this.) So, although other critics do believe ""The Philosophy of Composition"" is what it pretends to be, we must acknowledge that it's not necessarily reliable as a source, and look additionally to the poem itself. From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
Nameless here for evermore. It's only the angels that speak her name now, and ""here"" (in the mortal world?) she is nameless for evermore. This suggests she's with the angels, i.e. dead. Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"" The speaker believes the raven has come from Pluto, and asks it about Lenore. This suggests she too is there, in the ""Plutonian"" land of the dead. Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."" He speaks of seeing Lenore again only in Aidenn, or Paradise. None of these quotes quite confirms that Lenore is dead - she could be gone and yet the speaker hopes to see her again when both are dead - but it's at least strongly suggestive. Together with the Philosophy of Composition, I'd even venture to say it's conclusive."
How could sixty cents of $1.87 be in pennies?,"Assuming that ""The Gift of the Magi"" is set in the US at around the time of its publication in 1905, there was a three-cent piece which was still minted until 1890. That's the closest non-multiple-of-five-cents coin to the period, although there was also a two-cent coin which stopped being minted a little earlier, according to the following helpful chart from the US Mint:  If the story is set around 1905, then three-cent pieces might well still have been regularly in circulation, even if they weren't being minted any more. It makes sense for Della to count up the total precisely, down to the cent - hence the exact figure of one dollar and eight-seven cents - so that she'd know how much she had and what she might be able to buy with it. But there's no particular reason for her to remember if it was exactly fifty-seven cents or sixty-two cents that were in pennies: around sixty cents of her total being in pennies would be a precise enough figure to get the point across."
Is Babar an African or Asian elephant?,"Inasmuch as Babar is from a specific continent, he's either from Europe or from Africa-as-perceived-by-Europeans-in-the-1920s. Which is not exactly Africa, but definitely not Asia. Babar's adventures spanned many books and had multiple authors and illustrators over decades, starting with Cécile and Jean de Brunhoff and continuing with their son Laurent. They started out as bedtime tales that Cécile told to her children, which her husband Jean elaborated on and turned into illustrated books. As they are children's tales, they do not necessarily take place in the real world and they do not have the kind of internal continuity that you can expect from some science-fiction franchises. In the first book, Histoire de Babar, Babar lives happily in a forest (p. 3, p. 4–5) until his mother is killed by a hunter (p. 6, p. 7). Other animals in the “forest” include not only monkeys but also a giraffe (p. 11). The depiction of the forest is clearly not realistic (it's more of a savannah with palm trees), but inspired from imagery of Africa, with animals gathering around a water hole. The hunter is a stereotypical safari hunter with a pith helmet. This is definitely happening in Africa as seen by its colonizers. Out of story, Laurent notes that the stories may have been partly inspired by tales from cousins who lived in Kenya, and by visits to a zoo which had animals from France's colonies in Africa. (Granted, the zoo also had animals from elsewhere around the world.) (source: 80 ans de Babar – quelle histoire ?, via RFI) Later, when Babar comes back to his native land, we get to see many other animals (p. 41, p. 42), most of which are native to parts of the African savannah (lion, gazelle, hippopotamus, dromedary, …). Babar becomes king of his village (p. 43), an African social structure (as seen through the eyes of Europeans). In between, Babar is in the city. The city has French architecture (p. 9 ff.) and is home to white-skinned humans with a dress code similar to contemporary France (p. 10 ff.). This is a European city, but Babar could walk to it. In a later book, Babar et ce coquin d'Arthur, Arthur crosses overland from a kangaroo tribe to his homeland. This shows that the world of Babar does not have clearly defined continents as such. It does, however, have an America with specific features of the United States (Babar en Amérique). Although the city is depicted as European, it has an African interpretation: the city represents the European civilization (humans, clothes, buildings, shops, books, etc.) which has reached the savage lands where Babar was born (animals, no clothes, no buildings, etc.). In the minds of a 1930s French reader, colonization evokes first and foremost Africa. The depiction of elephants is more African than Asian, as all adult elephants have tusks, not just males (Babar's mother p. 3, Celeste p. 25, mothers p. 30). They have large ears which are not the rounded ears of Asian elephants (p. 6, p. 9 p. 30, …). The head is usually drawn as twinned-domed with a ridge at the top which is characteristic of Asian elephants (p. 14–15, p. 28–29, p. 35), but not always (Babar p. 11, p. 36–37). The lack of indent may either be due to a lack of detail in some images or due to the fact that the illustrator did not consider it significant. Jean de Brunhoff was likely working from multiple models, some African, some Asian. From what I can tell, Laurent kept the tusks and ears (which are how the French public expects elephants to look) but not the head ridges (which most readers would not pay attention to). I don't know why the English Wikipedia page mentions shiitake mushrooms. This is either something that was added in the English translation or a plain mistake. In the original (p. 34), the species of the mushroom is not mentioned in the text (it's just a “bad mushroom”), and the picture is a fly amanita which probably the stereotypical poisonous mushroom in French culture (and perceived to be more deadly than it really is)."
What is the symbolism of Atticus killing the mad dog?,"This scene is meant to reveal more about Atticus to Scout.  When he kills the mad dog--and does so expertly, with one shot--it shows Scout that there is more to him than a lawyer and a father.  He knows how to shoot and he's good at it. “Take him, Mr. Finch.” Mr. Tate handed the rifle to Atticus; Jem and I nearly
  fainted. This illustrates my point well; Jem and Scout have no idea about him, really.  This also develops Atticus's character for the reader.  He can shoot and he's good at it, but he hates to and he hasn't in thirty years.  It can also be seen as a symbol for the entire Tom Robinson trial."
Why is Snape so fond of Malfoy?,"It's subtle and perhaps a bit of a stretch, but I think we can infer that Snape likes Draco for a similar reason to why he dislikes Harry. He dislikes Harry because Harry's father treated him badly at school. And he likes Draco because Draco's father treated him well at school. I'm mostly getting this from the following passage in the chapter ""The Prince's Tale"" in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: At last, when only a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor
  McGonagall called Snape. Harry walked with him to the stool, watched
  him place the hat upon his head. “Slytherin!” cried the Sorting Hat. And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from
  Lily, to where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius
  Malfoy, a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, patted Snape on the
  back as he sat down beside him. . . This implies that Lucius and Snape's friendship goes all the way back to Snape's first days at Hogwarts. Yeah, it is technically possible that a pat on the back doesn't mean much and they could have not spoken to one another for years after this, but you have to think about why this passage is being included in the first place. I think it is included to establish an early positive relationship between Lucius and Snape.  Sirius Black also alludes to Snape's friendship with Lucius during his argument with Snape at Grimmauld Place in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix:  ""Tell me, how is Lucius Malfoy these days? I expect he's delighted
  that his lapdog's working at Hogwarts, isn't he?"" ""Speaking of dogs' said Snape softly, ""did you know that Lucius Malfoy
  recognised you last time you risked a little jaunt outside?"" Despite the fact that Sirius seems to believe that Snape is working for Voldemort, he alludes specifically to Lucius Malfoy in this passage and seems to reference a long term association between the two. Snape also has a somewhat strange reaction to Harry naming Lucius Malfoy as a Death Eater in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: ""I saw the Death Eaters! I can give you their names! Lucius Malfoy.""
  Snape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him, Snape's eyes
  flew back to Fudge. Why the sudden movement here? Snape already knows that Lucius is a Death Eater, so it can't be surprise. I think it more likely that Snape's first impulse here is to deny the accusation or to silence Harry somehow because he doesn't want Lucius named (despite the fact that he probably knows Lucius is guilty). But he thinks better of it.  Finally, Narcissa refers to Snape as Lucius's ""old friend"" in the ""Spinner's End"" chapter of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: ""Severus ... please ... You are, you have always been, Draco's
  favorite teacher ... You are Lucius's old friend ... I beg you ... You
  are the Dark Lord's favorite, his most trusted advisor .. Will you
  speak to him ... persuade him."" In fact, I think that the fact that Narcissa chooses to come to Snape at all in this chapter and not to any of the many other Death Eaters that she could have spoken with shows that she believes that Snape would be willing to help Draco. And she seems to believe this partly because Snape is Lucius's old friend.  It is possible that the favoritism toward Draco is feigned on Snape's part because Snape does do the whole double agent thing -- but I don't think so. Snape's treatment of Harry shows that he holds onto things. He mistreats Harry because Harry's father bullied him, but he also saves Harry's life because Harry's mother was special to him.  And I think Lucius's friendship at Hogwarts might have meant a great deal to a young Snape. Think of the images that we get of young Snape -- poor, clothes don't fit right, often alone, kind of weird, kind of geeky, bad home life. To have an older rich kid who is also a Prefect take an interest in him probably would have been a very big deal to Snape.  And I think that Snape would have retained some feelings of friendship towards Lucius despite the fact that Lucius supports Voldemort and Snape does not. Snape is someone who is motivated primarily by personal loyalty rather than high-minded ideals. He doesn't turn on Voldemort because he disagrees with Voldemort's ideology (although at least later on he does seem to disagree with Voldemort's ideology). He turns on Voldemort and works for the other side because Voldemort went after Lily.  In short, Snape favors Draco because Lucius was his old friend and Snape has a rather difficult time separating children from their parents. "
"Has the phrase ""Elementary, my dear Watson"" ever truly appeared in a Sherlock Holmes book?","The phrase ""Elementary, my dear Watson"" with the same arrangement of the words, has never been expressed even once in any Sherlock Holmes story. The closest you can get, however, seems to be in the story titled ""The Adventure of the Crooked Man"": “I have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear Watson,” said he. “When your round is a short one you walk, and when it is a long one you use a hansom. As I perceive that your boots, although used, are by no means dirty, I cannot doubt that you are at present busy enough to justify the hansom.” “Excellent!” I cried. “Elementary,” said he. “It is one of those instances where the reasoner can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his neighbour, because the latter has missed the one little point which is the basis of the deduction. And in ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"":1 “Interesting, though elementary,” said he, as he returned to his favourite corner of the settee. “There are certainly one or two indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several deductions.” The first, or what seems to be the first occurrence of the exact phrase, appears to have been in the newspaper ""Richmond Times Dispatch"" in 1909:2 The possibility of signaling to the planet Mars is merely a question of elementary mathematics.… It is such a simple little problem that any one should be able to take a pad and pencil and work it out in ten minutes. “Elementary, my dear Watson,” as Sherlock Holmes was wont to say. “Elementary.” A very close phrase was said even earlier, by the ""Northampton Mercury"" in 1901, however, it was actually in a parody of Sherlock Holmes, with the characters named ""Shylock Combs"" and ""Poston"":3 One winter’s morning, a few years after my marriage, I was lying by my hearth, smoking a red herring, and nodding over the Encyclopedia Britannica, for my day’s work had been a hard one. Since first meeting Shylock Combs my practice as a doctor had, as a matter of course, rapidly declined. My presentation clock had chimed 4.47 a.m., and I was in the act of blowing out the gas when I heard the clang of my front door speaking tube. Thinking it must be the milkman I went into the hall, opened the door, and, to my astonishment, Shylock Combs stood upon my step. “Ah, Potson,” he said; “I hoped I should not be too early to catch you. I perceive the wind has changed round to N.N.E. by S.W. again.” I was astounded, as he had not had time to observe the thermometer in my bedroom. He noticed my amazement and smiled that wonderful smile of his. “Elementary, my dear Potson,” he said; “I observed the left-hand side of your moustache inclined about 47 5/8 degrees towards the west, and coming as I did from Butcher-street I at once deduced from which quarter the wind was blowing.”3 (all emphasis is mine) 1  August 27 2013, Today I Found Out 2 August 24 1909, The Times Dispatch, “Signaling to Mars: An Elementary Problem, Says Professor Pickering, of Harvard”, (Acknowledgment to Rochester Post-Express), Quote Page 6, Column 7, Richmond, Virginia.

"What does Mark Twain mean by ""cheers and a tiger""?","It's mentioned in the The Hawaiian Archipelago (1831–1904). Essentially three cheers followed by a loud growl from the crowd (the ""tiger""). On the king's appearance, the cheering was tremendous,—regular British
cheering, well led, succeeded by that which is not British, “three
cheers and a  tiger ,” but it was “Hi, hi, hi, hullah!” There's another description mentioned here from an article called The Artilleryman's Glossary, apparently dating from the 1870s. THREE CHEERS AND A TIGER - when ""Three cheers and a tiger"" was called
for, there is division as to what that represented. There is no
apparent dispute that the first portion - the ""Three cheers"" -
represented three ""Hurrahs!"". The ""tiger"" portion of that is argued as
either a growl from the crowd, slowly rising in volume and pitch until
it became a roar of approbation; while others contend that it the
addition of the chant ""Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi!"" at the end of the third
""Hurrah!"", the series of ""Hi!""'s also rising in both volume and pitch. Evidently the Princeton University cheer used to include a ""tiger"". Multiple cheers evolved throughout the latter half of the 19th century, including ""The Tiger,"" ""The Rocket,"" ""The Princeton Cheer"" and ""The Tiger and Rocket,"" which morphed and intertwined over time, including: Rah! Rah! Rah! S-s-s-t! Boom! A-h-h-h!
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Tiger! S-s-s-t! Boom! A-h-h-h!
Hooray, hooray, hooray! Tiger siss-boom-ah, Princeton! And we also have an example within the story itself EVERYBODY. (Except Stephenson, who bows with hand on heart) Hip—hip—hip: hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! GR. Der Tiger—ah-h-h!"
"Meaning of a 19 century joke printed in a newspaper, with punchline ""Oh, mother, what a good job the cat’s a black one""","Your guess is correct; ""How lucky it is that the cat is a black one"" is an accurate restatement of the phrase. ""good job"" is a particularly British term for ""lucky"". So that leaves the question: why would it be lucky that the cat is black? In all likelihood, this has to do with the tradition of wearing black clothes to a funeral or when mourning. There's a long history of wearing black while mourning in the English-speaking world; rumor has it that the tradition can be traced back to the Romans wearing black togas to funerals. In any case, the mourning family is discussing what's required. The mention of black clothes would have come up. The child, not fully grasping that the cat doesn't necessarily wear clothes or attend funerals, remarks that it's lucky that the cat is already black, which saves the trouble of getting black clothes (or dye) for the cat."
Why did Sir Arthur Conan Doyle decide to kill off this character?,"I'm going to quote from a book called The Best of Sherlock Holmes, by Wordsworth Classics: However, even before the ink was dry on the manuscript of 'The Copper Beeches' its author had wearied of Sherlock Holmes. In fact, by the end of 1891 he had written to his mother,one of Sherlock's greatest admirers, stating that he was thinking of 'slaying Holmes in the last [story]. He takes my mind from better things.' His mother prevailed upon him to change his mind, which for a time he did. The 'better things' to which Conan Doyle referred were his historical novels, which he considered to be 'serious literature' compared with his catchpenny detective stories. Also, on a practical level, churning out twelve ingenious plots in a year was hard, demanding labor. So we see that he was getting burnt out, and he wanted to do other things. Conan Doyle's disenchantment was growing when he was approached by the editor of The Strand for a further twelve stories. In order to put him off he asked for what he considered to be a ridiculously high fee of fifty pounds a story, fully expecting to be turned down... ... After he killed him off, the fans weren't so happy. One lady even sent him a letter calling him a brute. Conan Doyle's reaction [to the criticism in response to him killing Holmes] was somewhat different. Maybe with that letter of abuse from that irate lady in mind, he expressed grim satisfaction: 'Thank God, I've killed the brute.' So he felt that it was too much work and he was too tired of writing Holmes stories, so he killed him off. So why did he bring him back in The Empty House? Well, before he decided that Holmes wasn't dead, he heard a story in 1901  that made him think about a family who was being haunted by a dog... For years he disregarded all pleas to resurrect Holmes, but in 1901 when he heard a friend's account of some legends of Dartmoor he conceived a mystery story about a family supposedly haunted by a spectral hound. He was very pleased with the idea of this story, which in a letter to his mother he described as 'a real creeper'  - a phrase he was later to repeat when selling the story to Greenhough Smith of The Strand. In developing the plot, Conan Doyle realised that he would require a detective hero to be involved with the strange events and eventually to solve and explain the mystery. He was sensible enough to see that there was little point in creating a new character for this task when he already had one he'd made earlier: Sherlock Holmes. So, one suspects, with some reluctance, Conan Doyle converted his ghostly-dog saga into a Sherlock Holmes adventure and called it The Hound of the Baskervilles. However he was adamant that this story did not herald a permanent return - Sherlock Holmes was still dead - and that this investigation took place prior to Reichenbach. So he brought back Holmes for a short while, but it was set before he died. The fans reacted... Now that Sherlock Holmes had appeared in print once more, readers and publishers alike hoped that the author could be persuaded to relent and drag the fellow up from his watery grave for more adventures. ... By 1903, Conan Doyle was a much more relaxed and confident man and the idea of writing further detective stories was no longer abhorrent to him, so when the New York publisher of Collier's Magazine offered him four thousand dollars per story he at last gave in. TL;DR:"
Are there any recorded discrepancies between The Odyssey as oral tradition and The Odyssey as Homer transcribed it?,"Much of the structure of this answer is based on the very clear history of The Odyssey and The Iliad written by Nicolas Bertrand in a 2009 Article (PDF). The primary sources discussed are the following, and I will try to reference them more closely in successive edits, but this is a process that takes time, as I relied on translations to write the original answer): What's a text? This is a question that needs to be answered to be able to understand this question fully. What you're asking is basically, why we don't we have a diff /homer.txt /oral.txt? There is nothing like a signed version of The Odyssey. Whatever version you read was probably compiled (I'm not saying translated, I mean compiled) in the 19th century. This implies that if we want to compare the version you're reading with oral tradition, we need to identify which version you're reading - a problem one seldom has with texts from post-medieval era, and has to a much latter degree with texts that post-date the diffusion of codices by Ancient Rome. At the birth of the Odyssey (and the Iliad) is a long-lasting oral tradition. This sophisticated tradition has few current-day equivalent in Europe, but luckily enough, in the early 20th century, Perry and Lord, who were as curious as the OP but had no access to the Internet, went on asking living bards for their input on what the Oral Odyssey (this is my term, not theirs) could have been: epske pjesme, the oral epic tradition in Yugoslavia, was still lively and they had many interviews with practicing bards that confirmed their intuition (intuition shared with a third guy called Arend, working separately, who apparently preferred libraries to the Balkans). What they got from their discussion confirmed two great intuitions those guys had: The Odyssey and The Iliad were not written to be... written. They were written down after being composed to be learned by heart. This was first identified by identifying then studying structures called ""Homeric verses"": those are rhyme structures repeated with similar semantic content (generally a character and an associated adjective). The canonical example of this is ""Swift-footed Achilles"". One would have three or four such structures for each character, that he could rely on when coming back to the character. They have an evident mnemonic function, which tells you a lot about how close to Oral tradition the version we can read is, but they are also a great ""writing"" tool: they are prepared to fit in Homeric verses well, allowing to keep the flow whenever the story takes a new twist. Those structures are actually very old and are sometimes shared with Sanskrit (making it ridiculous to argue that we're talking about western culture here)! Even if you go away from the language itself, the oral character of the story is evident: all boat landings, all fights, share a common structure so that poets only have to remember the scheme once, and decline it according to what's important in a given example. Of course, seeing this from only a single version of the story (whichever ""Homer"" version you found) can be difficult, but it's confirmed by the study of the above mentioned epske pjesme. This kind of system speaks very much against The Odyssey being written by a single man. It also says a lot about the stability you may expect between versions: they will all share the same structure, and big discrepancies would therefore be about omitting or detailing a given event in the story (small discrepancies between oral tradition and a written text not being very likely to survive time...) The same studies on Yugoslav poets that ""proved"" the existence of a mnemonic framework throughout The Odyssey and The Iliad were studied long enough that we know how little they vary: several years apart, poems built around similar verse and story structure were recorded. This allows for poet to compose quickly and efficiently improvisations on a given structure. What ""modern"" users of the same technique tell us is that this was used to give out acts, various and varied performance of a given theme, with both great consistency and great diversity. Now that we know for sure that those were oral texts, how did we get down to the single version we read today? First, it's a transcription. The best way to see the Odyssey or the Iliad is as a movie. A movie is not a script, it's not even the sum of all scenes of the script that were played out once. It's a collage of chosen bits that were recorded and distributed. Of course the base material (the actual scenes recorded) is important, but you can't go back to them from the written (recorded) piece. Nor is it realistic to think we recorded a single performance of a poet: both ""books"" are far too long for that. Once we agree The Odyssey is just a movie, we need to know when it was shot. The question is: who put The Odyssey on paper? First option: The Scriptist. There was a predating cultural substrate, but the guy who wrote done the two poems also composed them. The main argument for this is in my opinion weak, ie that poems of such wisdom and complexity could not have been conceived without the help of writing Second option: The Oralist. The poems were dictated (by one or more poets). The tenants of this option (among which Lord and Powell) witnessed that the texts that were dictated to them by the Yugoslav poets were much better when dictated than when recorded, as it forced the poets to pace themselves and extend the sentences. We can use the analogue of theater actors knowing they are recorded for a movie, asking to shoot a scene again or including bonuses that are not in their usual performance. Retaining this option gives for a very affirmative answer to your question: the two poems are not different per se from the oral tradition, but they consist a more organised and exhaustive version of the  poetic wisdom that brought them to life. Third hypothesis: The texts transitioned slowly from oral to written to written and unified. This is Nagy's hypothesis. He gives a very precise timeline (which in my opinion is quite irrelevant here) but the basic idea is to have the text put down in three phases. At first, as described above (just a writing framework and tool), then more and more ""standard"" versions would circulate. In a third time, some of these performances would be recorded in a written form. In a fourth time, those written down would be aggregated and standardized before, ultimately, a ""fixed"" version appears (for The Odyssey, we can date this to Aristarchus's edition in 150 B.C.) I think this last option is preferable: we should be able to imagine an oral tradition that is slowly merged into a nascent, written tradition, before for both political and cultural versions a central version emerged, that would then vary only slightly - ""corruptions"" and ""cleaning"" periods, basically through spread (for corruptions) and study of many versions to make a clean one (for cleaning or bottlenecks). The text you know comes at one of those bottlenecks, and its incredibly long history as a ""single"" cultural object explain no variations of it have gained wide tract. Notable exceptions to this are details of the Trojan Horse that survived in other texts/the popular culture, and a lot of mythology that we know in contradictory/more detailed version, because both these elements had a cultural significance to those over time that transmitted the text to you, from Athens scholars to Roman and Egyptians to Arabics and Byzantines, to Italian scribes of the 15th century, to French scholars of the 19th and British scholars of the 20th... You know of one version because every effort has been made to present a coherent, written version of a text that was initially probably a collection of oral performances."
Why don't Mr. Bennet's daughters get to inherit the Longbourn estate?,"TL;DR: The Longbourn estate is ‘entailed’ to male heirs only, whereas Rosings is not. Austen sets out the financial situation of the Bennets in detail: Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his.  Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds. [Chapter 7] Mr. Bennet’s main asset was thus an estate of land at Longbourn, which generated an income of £2,000 a year by renting it out to tenant farmers. The estate was ‘entailed’, meaning that in law Mr. Bennet was a ‘tenant in tail’: he could make use of the estate while he was alive, but he was not allowed to sell the land, and he could not dispose of the estate in his will. Instead the estate would pass at his death to the next male heir in line of the landowner who originally created the entail. Since Mr. Bennet had no male heirs, the estate would pass to his cousin Mr. Collins (except in remote circumstances, such as Mrs. Bennet dying, Mr. Bennet marrying again and having a son). The entail only covers the Longbourn estate, and does not include Mr. Bennet’s other property, and so if he had been more prudent, he could have saved money out of his income from the estate in order to support his family after his death: Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him. [Chapter 50] However, he did not do this, because his plan for providing for his family was to ‘cut off’ (or ‘bar’) the entail: When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son.  The son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Lacking a son, he was apparently unable to carry out this plan: Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Austen does not give explicit details of the legal and financial situation of the de Bourgh family, but there are some clues. First, we learn that Lady Catherine de Bourgh is a widow and her daughter Anne is the “heiress of Rosings”: [Mrs. Bennet] “I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?” [Mr. Collins] “She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.” “Ah!” said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than many girls.” [Chapter 14] It seems that Rosings is not entailed: [Lady Catherine] “Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think.  For your sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family.” [Chapter 29] We can therefore guess that Sir Lewis de Bourgh disposed of Rosings in his will, either by leaving the whole estate to his widow, or else by giving his widow a life interest, with the estate reverting to their daughter on Lady Catherine’s death. Entails were widely considered unjust (especially by owners of entailed estates who wished to raise money by selling off parts of the land), and were effectively abolished by §176 of the Law of Property Act 1925. Black’s Law Dictionary explains how the entail could have been barred: barring of entail. The freeing of an estate from the limitations imposed by an entail and permitting its free disposition. This was anciently [that is, prior to the Fines and Recoveries Act 1833] done by means of a fine or common recovery. So why did Mr. Bennet believe that, lacking a son, he was unable to bar the entail, given that the procedure of common recovery was available to him? Some legal scholars think that Austen’s account of the legal situation of the Bennets was not realistic on this point. According to Peter Appel: At the time that Austen wrote, it would have been extremely unlikely that a landed family like the Bennets would have used the entailment standing alone as the legal means of keeping Longbourn within the family. More likely, they would have used a device known as the strict settlement. It was also extremely rare (although not impossible) that a strict settlement would have been arranged to cut off close relations like the Bennet daughters. If the restriction on Longbourn was an entailment standing alone—which would have in all likelihood cut off any provision for the Bennet daughters—then the current life tenant (i.e., Mr. Bennet) could have ‘barred the entail’. This term means that Mr. Bennet could have stopped the property from going to Mr. Collins through a fairly simple legal proceeding. After that, he could have left it to whomever he wished: Jane, the eldest daughter; Elizabeth, his clear favorite; or all five of his daughters in whatever shares he chose. Peter A. Appel (2013), ‘A Funhouse Mirror of Law: The Entailment in Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice’, Georgia Journal of International and Comparative Law 41, p. 609. What are we to make of this discrepancy? There are various possibilities: Austen was using dramatic license to exaggerate the legal predicament of the Bennet family. The characters’ descriptions of the entail were somewhat loose or inaccurate (as might be expected, since they are not lawyers) and in fact Mr. Bennet was not the tenant in tail of Longbourn, but only had a life interest in the estate, and so common recovery was not available to him. This situation could have arisen if Mr. Bennet’s grandfather had owned the estate in fee simple, and if Mr. Bennet had been living at his grandfather’s death. Then his grandfather, in his will, could have given life interests to both Mr. Bennet’s father and Mr. Bennet, with the remainder left in fee tail male. (This would be a form of ‘strict settlement’ as discussed above.) Austen was using the discrepancy to comment on the character of Mr. Bennet: Nevertheless, the more intriguing scenario for contemplating the relationship between law and society is if both Austen and her readers knew that an entail in England could be barred. If this were the case, two interrelated implications immediately leap forth. First, the character of Mr. Bennet must be reread. This point is probably of more interest to Austen scholars and fans. Most readers generally sympathize with Mr. Bennet because he is largely surrounded by folly, because he is witty, and because he favors Elizabeth, the heroine, and recognizes her intelligence. These features—especially that he can find intelligence in a woman, and particularly in the early nineteenth century—are attractive to a modem audience. They make him seem urbane and progressive. A Mr. Bennet who could, but did not, provide for his daughters, however, becomes a much less appealing character. Why would Mr. Bennet not disentail the property if he could? Perhaps it was simply not done, or not an option to a family of the social class or status ofthe Bennets. Appel (2013) Why were entails created? The purpose was to maintain the concentration of power and wealth (as embodied in an estate of land) by preventing it from being sold off or divided up among many heirs. Why were entails so often restricted to male heirs? No doubt there was a substantial degree of sexism involved, but additionally, prior to the Married Women’s Property Act 1870, a woman in England lost control over her property after marriage: she could not sell, lease, or mortgage her estate without her husband’s consent. For the landowner creating the entail, this risk of loss of control could be avoided by specifying that only male heirs could inherit. What about the family name? A landowner who was concerned about the preservation of his surname could require, when creating an entail, that a male heir succeeding via a female line must adopt his surname. For example, Jane Austen’s own brother Edward changed his surname to Knight as a condition of inheriting the estate of his relative Catherine Knight. Perhaps the ancestor of Mr. Bennet who created the Longbourn entail was not so concerned; alternatively, Mr. Collins may be required to change his name, but this is not mentioned in the novel."
Was Odysseus considered unfaithful to his wife in the Odyssey?,"No.  To begin with, the question Has Odysseus been unfaithful to his wife? would not make sense to the people of ancient Greece. Such a question presupposes that the Greeks had a concept of marital love and fidelity similar to ours, which they didn't. As Stephanie Coontz has pointed out, the idea of marriage as a partnership based on romantic love is a product of the 18th century: For most of history it was inconceivable that people would choose their mates on the basis of something as fragile and irrational as love and then focus all their sexual, intimate, and altruistic desires on the resulting marriage....[O]nly rarely in history has love been seen as the main reason for getting married. When someone did advocate such a strange belief, it was no laughing matter. Instead, it was considered a serious threat to social order. Marital love in Greek society was not thought of as an enduring romantic and emotional bond between two equals, with sexual fidelity a marker of their trust in and satisfaction with each other. The Ancient History Encyclopedia says: [With girls being] Married at the typical age of thirteen or fourteen, love had little to do with the matching of husband and wife. Of course, love may have developed between the couple but the best that might be hoped for was philia - a general friendship/love sentiment; eros, the love of desire, was to be found elsewhere, at least for the male. If marriage for the ancient Greeks was not an erotic [from eros] bond, then this raises two questions: (1) What was marriage for them? and (2) What was an erotic bond for them? Let's look at each in turn. With regard to the first question, Nicholas Rauh explains that among landholding Greeks, women were married off to neighboring men to consolidate land ownership, to bear children, and to look after the household: To insure the sanctity of the marriage relationship and the purity of the family line, freeborn Greek children underwent a highly restricted, segregated upbringing, at least insofar as sexual interaction with the opposing gender was concerned. Within the social stratum of freeborn landholding citizen elites, young people of opposite genders remained rigidly segregated. As with other ancient cultures, the freeborn daughters of respectable landholding families entered into contractually arranged marriages with males from neighboring families for purposes of procreation and to maintain the economic foundations of both families. Dowries and gifts of land parcels accompanied the coming of age in Greek society. Religious taboos, such as the need to produce a male heir to preserve the ancestor cult, added the additional requirement that the Greek bride be a virgin at the time of her marriage. Typically, young freeborn females of respectable society would experience no sexual experimentation, no dating as we know it, prior to marriage. They would be kept carefully cloistered in the private recesses of the family household and even more carefully chaperoned in public. They were generally required after puberty to hide their features whenever they were in public, donning costumes similar to those worn by females in contemporary Islamic society. Virginity prior to marriage was a requirement of the marriage contract, and chastity and modesty after marriage were norms not only expected of, but imposed on respectable Greek females. Married women were expected to maintain the household, to spin and weave clothing for the family (as well as for retail sale), to direct household servants, to attend to the highly demanding tasks of cooking, cleaning, and domestic hygiene, not to mention, the raising of the family's young. In view of the limited technologies available for these tasks the number of laboring hours devoted to them was considerable. These requirements inevitably induced families to arrange marriages for female children early on in life. On the whole, young freeborn women of property holding families would be married as soon as they reached puberty to begin the process of child bearing and to maintain the domestic quarters of the newly formed family. This is a classic example of what Gayle Rubin, in her celebrated 1975 essay of the same title, called ""the traffic in women"": a man gives his daughter or sister as a gift to another man, so as to augment the status of both men as well as maintain the social economy. The woman in this scenario is property. Before her marriage, she belongs to her father or brother; after, to her husband. Sexual fidelity was de rigeur for Greek women because adultery allowed another man access to the husband's property; and this raises the further, more threatening possibility that the children who inherit that property may not be his own. This would destroy the social economy entirely.  This role of women would explain why, as Coontz mentions, marriage based on love would be considered ""a serious threat to social order"". Marriage was the means by which social bonds were consolidated, status maintained, property acquired, and its orderly transfer ensured. Erotic love cares about none of those things, being based on individual desire rather than social needs. So it had no place in marriage. If marriage was not for the fulfillment of sexual desire, then it is understandable that, as we saw earlier, men formed erotic relationships ""elsewhere"". Where was that? Rauh lists three outlets for men's sexual energies (quote has been edited for length): So the sort of ritual we expect around romantic love—a man chasing a reluctant love object, wooing that object with poetry and gifts, eventually overcoming that reluctance—was associated in ancient Greece with homosexuality, not with one's eventual marital partner. Coontz says that the Greeks even considered this sort of homosexual love the noblest of all: In some cultures and times, true love was actually thought to be incompatible with marriage. Plato believed love was a wonderful emotion that led men to behave honorably. But the Greek philosopher was referring not to the love of women, ""such as the meaner men feel,"" but to the love of one man for another....Some Greek and Roman philosophers even said that a man who loved his wife with ""excessive"" ardor was ""an adulterer.""  Certainly in The Iliad, the love we see that's closest to our current ideals of romantic love is the one between Achilles and Patroclus.  So much for the men. What about the women? Very, very little is known about the erotic life of Greek women of the land-holding classes. The women depicted in the sexual couplings abundant on Greek pottery are likely servants or courtesans rather than women of the household. The few fragments we have from Sappho are probably not representative; but one could use those fragments to speculate that with husbands being at best affectionate friends, and other men being taboo, perhaps women too found their erotic fulfillment with each other rather than with men.  It's easy to see that Homer's epics share this view of the marital relationship. In the Iliad, the whole point of the Trojan War is to recover a woman stolen from Menelaus. Menelaus does not revile Helen as an adulteress. Rather, he and the other Greeks see her as his property, and Paris as a thief who must be punished. Since Menelaus is brother to Agamemnon, who is the most powerful king in Greece, Agamemnon must help him; and as Agamemnon's vassals, all the other Greeks are drawn into the war too. By stealing Helen, the Trojans have destroyed the very fabric of Greek society, and the only way to restore it is by forcefully retrieving her.  We see in the Odyssey that Helen is back at Menelaus's side, still his queen. She isn't discarded as no longer a worthy partner, someone who has betrayed his trust through her elopement with Paris. As the daughter of Zeus and the most beautiful woman on earth, she is still extremely valuable property, and Menelaus still values her. (And let us remember that Helen didn't really choose to run off with Paris. She had no choice; Aphrodite gifted her to him. A woman's erotic preferences are beside the point.) What does this tell us about the relationship between Odysseus and Penelope? Well, for Penelope, as for all Greek women of her class, maintaining her own fidelity is a big deal. It's not that her fidelity marks her exceptional love for Odysseus; it's that it shows how wonderful a wife she is. She runs his household impeccably, not allowing anybody to despoil his property—including herself. One of the main complaints against her suitors is that they are ruining Odysseus's home and fortune by their extravagant demands on her hospitality. That she is able to hold them off with her wit and skill makes her an exceptional woman, well worthy of praise. But to be praised as a good wife in this context is to be recognized for her role as custodian of Odysseus's property: for Odysseus himself, if he's alive; for his son Telemachus, if he's not.  And for Odysseus? Of course he sleeps around. It would be odd if he didn't. How strange to believe that he would or should reserve his erotic energies for his wife! Calypso even comments on the double standard: men are expected to play around; if a woman does the same, it needs to be squelched immediately:   You gods are the most jealous bastards in the universe—
  Persecuting any goddess who ever openly takes
  A mortal lover to her bed and sleeps with him.  The unspoken subtext is Zeus himself has no problem sleeping with mortal women all over the place; but let me take a mortal lover, she says, and he comes down on me like a ton of bricks. So if Odysseus's little dalliances with Circe and Calypso go unremarked on by Penelope when he eventually makes his way back to her, it's because they are, in that world, unremarkable. They say nothing about the strength of their marriage. Curiously, though, the Calypso episode does reveal something about the strength of their marriage. It shows that Odysseus's commitment to the marriage is as strong as Penelope's. He grows increasingly unhappy over the time he's forced to share Calypso's bed. He's been there seven years, and he starts to itch. He longs to go home, and is delighted to get his demob. Calypso offers him divinity in exchange for his staying back with her. This is his response: Goddess and mistress, don't be angry with me.
  I know very well that Penelope,
  for all her virtues, would pale beside you.
  She's only human, and you are a goddess,
  Eternally young. Still, I want to go back.
  My heart aches for the day I return to my home.  It is true that Penelope is mortal, and bound to have aged in the twenty years they've been apart. Calypso, on the other hand, is a goddess, eternally young and beautiful. But Odysseus is honey-tongued, a trickster, a master of words. Does he really think that Penelope is no match for Calypso? Or is he merely saying that to placate the goddess? Who knows.  But we do know that he does really want to go home. He wants to reclaim his lands, his son, and his wife. If Penelope is loyal to her marriage, then according to his lights, so is Odysseus. His homesickness may not be romantic, exactly, but it does show that he is committed to the values of his society. Better to live and die as a Greek freeborn landholder, than to be immortal but enslaved to a goddess, eternally young and beautiful though she may be.  We probably think that this whole story shows how terrible Penelope's lot was. The little woman, fighting against the odds to save her home and her child, faithfully waiting for her philandering husband to return home: is there anything more clichéd? And to have that woman presented as a heroine: is there anything more antithetical to our sensibilities? True. And yet, how impoverished a reading that can see only all that's abhorrent in this scenario. Penelope would find our reading strange. To turn down immortality and choose to go home instead: when Odysseus has done that, then Penelope would find it hard to cavil that he hasn't kept it in his pants. "

Why is the UK called Airstrip One?,"I'm pretty sure it's a satirical jab at the perceived takeover of Britain by the United States. Just as in real life the US has filled Britain with its airbases, in the world of 1984 the entire country is seen as just a minor offshoot of US military power, a mere ""airstrip"" for the USAF to launch their warplanes from. We already know that the United States has taken over Britain; this is stated explicitly at the very start of Chapter III (War is Peace) of Emmanuel Goldstein's magnum opus: The splitting up of the world into three great super-states was an event which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth century. With the absorption of Europe by Russia and of the British Empire by the United States, two of the three existing powers, Eurasia and Oceania, were already effectively in being. (emphasis mine) This would also fit with Orwell's generally anti-American attitude. 1984 has no mercy: it rips into the Soviet system of 'communism' but also into the west, the US and Britain. As Mark notes in a comment, the name ""Airstrip One"" is also a clear reference to the way Britain is sometimes referred to in real life as an unsinkable aircraft carrier for the United States. (This phrase likely dates back further than the publication of 1984; one of Wikipedia's citations is to this Time Magazine article from 1950.) The only other relevant quote I've found is this from Chapter 3: Even the names of countries, and their shapes on the map, had been different. Airstrip One, for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been called England, or Britain, though London, he felt fairly certain, had always been called London. ... which confirms that Airstrip One is indeed the country we now call Britain or England. But very little is known about life in the world outside of London in 1984, beyond broad generalities, so it's unlikely that there's a canonical answer to this in-universe."
Did J. K. Rowling base platform 9 3/4 on the Gump?,"If she did, she hasn't admitted it. In her writing on Pottermore she states: King's Cross, which is one of London's main railway stations, has a very personal significance for me, because my parents met on a train to Scotland which departed from King’s Cross station. For this reason, and because it has such an evocative and symbolic name, and because it is actually the right station to leave from if you were heading to Caledonia, I never knew the slightest indecision about the location of the portal that would take Harry to Hogwarts, or the means of transport that would take him there. King's Cross Station by J.K. Rowling Emphasis is mine, but she says that her own life experiences were the inspiration. As far as it being a hidden platform, the whole Wizarding society is hidden, so naturally their train platform would be as well. Rowling has been known to shrug off influences in the past as well.

"In Brave New World, what caste is Lenina Crowne?","In Chapter 4, Lenina expresses her disgust for the Gammas as she passes by Gammas boarding monorails after work: ""My word,"" said Lenina, ""I'm glad I'm not a Gamma."" Later, when talking with Henry, it's clear that she is not an Epsilon - and likely an Alpha or a Beta: ""I'm glad I'm not an Epsilon,"" said Lenina, with conviction. ""And if you were an Epsilon,"" said Henry, ""your conditioning would have made you no less thankful that you weren't a Beta or an Alpha."" Lenina's character throughout the book is consistent with that of someone from the upper classes. She expresses clear disdain at the lower classes, while still docilely going along with the way the World State wants things to go (remember, she uses soma). While many Alphas fit that profile, Lenina's less-imaginative attitude seems to fit a Beta more than an Alpha. It's true that all the major characters in Brave New World are Alphas and Betas, and so we don't know what Gammas, Deltas or Epsilons really think, we should still be able to extrapolate. It seems like Lenina is a Beta. However, when talking with Fanny while getting dressed (Chapter 3), Lenina is quite clearly wearing green - the color of Gammas! The following excerpt from the conversation between the two is interspersed with a history lesson from Mustapha Mond and the sound of sleep-teaching. All emphasis is mine. ""Do I look all right?"" Lenina asked. Her jacket was made of bottle green acetate cloth with green viscose fur; at the cuffs and collar. ""Eight hundred Simple Lifers were mowed down by machine guns at Golders Green."" ""Ending is better than mending, ending is better than mending."" Green corduroy shorts and white viscose-woollen stockings turned down below the knee. ""Then came the famous British Museum Massacre. Two thousand culture fans gassed with dichlorethyl sulphide."" A green-and-white jockey cap shaded Lenina's eyes; her shoes were bright green and highly polished. My guess is that this an oversight on Huxley's part (though the outfit is mentioned once later). I think it's also possible that Lenina decided to dress a bit nicer - after all, she's going out with Henry Foster (to Fanny's dismay). She may not even have been wearing the same green as the Gammas; her jacket is ""bottle green"" while their clothes are ""leaf-green"". Finally, let's take Lenina's job into account. She works as a technician at the Hatchery - a position that needs some intelligence and skill, but is, for the most part, repetitive and monotonous. An Alpha would not be needed to do such work, but a Delta or Epsilon could not do it, and even a Gamma might not be a good choice. The skill needed seems to point to Lenina being a Beta. Also, as Gallifreyan pointed out, Linda is also a Beta, and presumably had a job similar to Lenina's. In short, Lenina's comments, personality and job all point to her being a Beta of some sort."
What's it called when a short quote appears at the beginning of a chapter?,"As Spagirl commented, it is an epigraph.  As the great and powerful Oz Google puts it (borrowing from dictionary.com, which in turn borrows from Oxford dictionary), an epigraph is a short quotation or saying at the beginning of a book or chapter, intended to suggest its theme And as Wikipedia puts it In literature, an epigraph is a phrase, quotation, or poem that is set at the beginning of a document or component. The epigraph may serve as a preface, as a summary, as a counter-example, or to link the work to a wider literary canon, either to invite comparison or to enlist a conventional context.

"Since when has Shakespeare's ""Scottish play"" been considered unlucky?","The superstition that Macbeth is unlucky and must not be named is often supposed to date from the very first performance, or very shortly thereafter. However, a documented belief in this alleged curse can be traced back only as far as the early 1970s. The Royal Shakespeare Company provides some background on the attributed origins of the superstition: According to folklore, Macbeth was cursed from the beginning. A coven of witches objected to Shakespeare using real incantations, so they put a curse on the play. Legend has it the play’s first performance (around 1606) was riddled with disaster. The actor playing Lady Macbeth died suddenly, so Shakespeare himself had to take on the part. Other rumoured mishaps include real daggers being used in place of stage props for the murder of King Duncan (resulting in the actor’s death).    (""Curse of the Scottish"") Sometimes this fable is embellished with the claim that Macbeth was first performed before King James, who was so displeased by its presenting witchcraft on stage that he banned the play for five years. For example, a 1998 Washington Post story by David Berre says: At the first performance in 1606, before King James I, the boy actor who was to play Lady Macbeth came down with a fever, and the author himself had to take the part at the last minute. And Shakespeare's attempt to please the king, who was both a Scot and a published expert on witchcraft, sorely misfired. The play was immediately banned for five years. There is no historical or scholarly evidence whatsoever for any of these claims: Nor is there any evidence that in the play's long performance history from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, actors thought of the play as unlucky or cursed in any way. From Shakespeare's time until the turn of the 20th century, performers and audiences do not appear to have regarded Macbeth as a cursed play. Any mention of this alleged curse is conspicuously absent even where one would expect it to take center stage: in accounts of disasters that accompanied performances of the play. Recent retellings of such events, however, put the curse trappings on full display, misleading readers into believing that the disasters were attributed to the curse when they occurred. For example, in 1849, supporters of two rival actors playing Macbeth, the American Edwin Forrest and the English William Charles Macready, famously clashed to the point of causing riots in New York City. Yet a contemporary pamphlet describing the event has not even a whisper suggesting that the play itself is considered unlucky (""Account""). Nigel Cliff's 2007 book on the Astor Place Riots, however, milks the legendary curse for all its worth: Given the curse that had long ago attached itself to Shakespeare's story of ambition prompted by darkness to ruin, it was an intrepid choice at the least. Macbeth was known as the Scottish play, because even to speak its name was enough to invoke the black magic of the weird sisters and and compel all sorts of long-winded recantations. Leaving the theatre, swearing, and spinning around three times was the favored purgative; variations included spitting over your shoulder, petitioning Shakespeare while quoting Hamlet, or just cursing like crazy. As superstitions went, this one had an impressive track record. The first Lady Macbeth, the leading boy actor of Shakespeare's company in 1606, supposedly died on the opening night, leaving Shakespeare to don drag and finish the part. James I, whom the play was designed to flatter, hated it and banned it for several years. In Amsterdam, one Macbeth switched a stage dagger for a real one and killed not just King Duncan but the actor playing him Troops were called in one night in 1721 when the actors started attacking the audience with their swords. Just the year before, Covent Garden had opened its season with the black natured thing, and seven nights later the theatre went up in smoke.    (p. 36) Cliff's breathless litany of disaster is farrago served up as fact. His assertion that actors and producers universally considered Macbeth unlucky even before 1849 is not tethered to reality by so much as a footnote. By contrast, Alexander Leggatt, in William Shakespeare's Macbeth: A Sourcebook soberly notes: So far as we can tell earlier actors—David Garrick, W. C. Macready, Henry Irving—produced the play with no sense that they were courting any special danger.    (p. 2) Leggatt's inclusion of Macready among the actors mentioned is noteworthy in this context, since he was one of the principals of the Astor Street Riots. So where did the notion that the play itself was unlucky come from? The story that the boy actor playing Lady Macbeth died unexpectedly just before (or partway through) the first performance is believed to have originated from the fertile imagination of novelist and theatre critic Max Beerbohm. In the Saturday Review for October 1, 1898, he wrote: According to Aubrey the play was first acted in 1606, at Hampton Court, in the presence of King James. It is stated that Hal Berridge, the youth who was to have acted, the part of Lady Macbeth, ""fell sudden sicke of a pleurisie, wherefor Master Shakespere himself did enacte in his stead.""    (p. 434) ""Aubrey"" is John Aubrey, the 17th C. biographer who wrote Brief Lives. However, the quotation Beerbohm supplies is found nowhere in Aubrey's work, and is the former's own invention. In 30 Great Myths about Shakespeare, Laurie Maguire and Emma Smith note: Aubrey's anecdote about Hal Berridge's illness is the origin of the myth that Macbeth is unlucky in the theatre. The boy-actor's name has a nicely Shakespearean flavor, sharing its first part with Henry IV's wayward son. The actor, however, is entirely fictional. So too is the incident—no actor was taken ill, and Shakespeare was never forced to setp into the role. Aubrey made no such comment as the one quoted.    (p. 150–151). Later in the review, Beerbohm makes up from whole cloth an equally synthetic quotation from Pepys. Beerbohm's deplorable inventiveness aside, it is worth noting that he makes no mention of any curse around Macbeth. On the contrary, he points out that ""Of all Shakespeare's plays, 'Macbeth' is, perhaps, the most often enacted."" The idea that a curse attaches itself to Macbeth does not, then, appear to have been in circulation even as late as 1898. There is no record of this notion prior to the 20th century. Maguire and Smith go on to claim: And so Beerbohm inaugurated a tradition in which it is unlucky to play in, or even be associated with, a production of Macbeth. Actors consider it bad luck even to refer to the play by name, preferring instead the descriptive euphemism ""The Scottish Play"".    (p. 151) Legatt, editor of the Sourcebook, concurs with Maguire and Smith that the legend postdates Beerbohm: Though there are unsupported legends of the curse at work even in the play's first production, including a story that at the first performance the boy actor playing Lady Macbeth fell ill and Shakespeare himself took over, the verifiable stories of misfortune, and the superstition itself, cannot confidently be traced before the 1920s. The sense that evil forces are at work in Macbeth may be a product of the aftermath of the First World War, whose horrific death toll produced a new interest in the spirit world, as those who had lost loved ones tried to contact them through ouija boards and table-tapping. Those beliefs have faded (though not vanished); the belief in the Macbeth curse remains.    (p. 1–2) Legatt illustrates this belief by quoting an anecdote about a 1926 production of the play starring the real-life married couple Ian Casson and Sibyl Thorndike. The production was plagued with mishaps, and at one point Casson told Thorndike: ""Sybil, the Devil does work in this play—there is horror behind it—we must do something positive against it.""    (p. 1) The couple then proceeded to read the 91st Psalm, which invokes God's protection: I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. This one anecdote is hardly dispositive, since it could show only that Casson thought this particular production marked by misfortune. Curiously, Leggatt does not provide any other sources from the 1920s or thereafter that show the growth of this curse myth, simply saying in a footnote, ""I owe this observation to Russell Jackson."" No further information is provided. Leggatt's claim notwithstanding, documentary records attesting to the superstition during the period 1930–1970 are hard to come by. A search through the Google Books corpora causes one to question whether Macbeth was regarded as unlucky and fearfully called ""the Scottish play"" prior to the 1970s. The Google Ngram for ""Scottish Play"" shows that the phrase was barely used prior to the late seventies, and has seen a spike in usage since then:  The usage of ""Scottish play"" prior to the 1970s appears to be merely descriptive, referring indifferently to Macbeth or any other play set in Scotland. Beginning around 1973, however, references crop up that mention the superstition. An issue from that year of Broadside, the newsletter of the Theatre Library Association, includes the following: Because of the number of mishaps and tragedies connected with it over the four hundred years of its existence, actors never refer to it by name or even quote it offstage. It is usually referred to as ""that play,"" or ""the Scottish play."" And paranormal researcher Peter Underwood writes in 1975: The curse of bad luck is firmly believed by many actors, and no play is considered to be more unlucky than Macbeth, a play that seems always to have had a curse on it. More than one actor has thrown things at a visitor who quoted from the play, especially in a dressing room of a theatre where the play is being performed. So powerful is the apparent curse (the origin of which I have not discovered) that many actors maintain that bad luck will follow if the play is even mentioned by name and old actors usually refer to Macbeth as ""the Scottish play"".    (p. 65–66) Subsequent references to the superstition and the alleged curse lie thick and fast in the literature. Even accounting for a lag between its origin in theatre lore and its being reflected in print sources, it seems unlikely that the superstition regarding Macbeth dates back to the 1920s, with a fifty-year gap before it is documented. It is far more plausible that the superstition itself arose some time in the late 1960s or early 1970s. At any rate, there is no solid evidence of this superstition's being widely held prior to then. A negative piece of evidence can be found in Dennis Bartholomeusz's excellent study of performances of the play down the ages, Macbeth and the Players. Bartholomeusz analyzes the documentary record of the play onstage from Shakespeare's time down to his day. He interviews many performers about their experiences and their interpretations of the play. One assumes that if the play were considered notoriously unlucky, this would have come up in the performers' conversations with Bartholomeusz. However, none of the players so much as mention the curse. Published in 1969, Macbeth and the Players provides a terminus post quem of sorts for the origin of this belief. There remains the question of why this superstition should have attached to this play. Macbeth lends itself to a curse legend for many readily understandable reasons. The play itself is a powerful representation of supernatural forces and their ability to let evil loose upon the world. Legatt writes: And yet the superstition about Macbeth, even if it is more recent than legend would have it, embodies a truth about the play. There is no work of Shakespeare's, and arguably no work of Western art, that evokes such a powerful sense of evil. The dialogue is full of invocations of the powers of darkness ... and one can sympathize with the belief current among actors that those invocations are genuine, and actually work.    (p. 2) Besides, since Macbeth is among the most performed plays of the most performed playwright in the world, the law of numbers ensures that instances of performances running into bad luck abound. A feature in Penguin UK's October 2018 newsletter quotes Anjna Chouhan of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust: ""It tends to run for longer than, say, Cymbeline. When you have more performances, it's statistically more likely that things will go wrong.""    (""Curse of Macbeth"") And the spooky nature of Macbeth allows those mishaps to be attributed to the play itself. Contrast this with Henry VIII. Andrew Dickson narrates how a stage cannon set off during the third or fourth performance of the play's initial run at the Globe in 1613 set fire to the roof and caused the theatre to burn down to the ground. Yet nobody refers to it as ""the Tudor play."" While the ""Scottish play"" superstition is not well attested before the 1970s, user Andrew pointed out in the comments to this answer that there is a tradition of considering some music associated with the play unlucky. An 1888 issue of the Pall Mall Gazette carried a feature asking actors about superstitions. Edward Terry replied: Old stagers used to consider the whistling or singing of Locke's music in ""Macbeth"" unlucky.    (""Signs"" p. 1) Terry began his career in 1863. ""Old stagers"" for him would have been those performing in the 1850s or earlier, so this belief goes back to at least the mid-nineteenth century. More details concerning this belief are provided in a 1913 story in the Yorkshire Evening Post: Dread of Macbeth Music. Another superstition of the old days which still survives in a measure was the actors' dread of Locke's music for ""Macbeth,"" and anyone caught humming, whistling, or singing any of it was immediately threatened. Indeed, very few actors dared to transgress, fearing the consequences, not so much of their colleagues' wrath, but rather of the certain disaster that would follow. An exception was young Amery Sullivan, son of the famous Barry Sullivan, who deliberately whistled the music whenever he chanced to be in the presence of an abnormally superstitious old member of his fathers' stock company. But Amery at times deemed it safer to keep out of the old man's way.    (""Stage"" p. 5) The Locke with the unfortunate music is Matthew Locke (1621–1677). He is known to have composed the music for William Davenant's Restoration era rewrite, along operatic lines, of Macbeth. Roger Fiske notes that while some of Locke's music for the play has indeed come down to us, the complete score formerly attributed to him is now accepted as being by Richard Leveridge. Aside from the two references provided by Andrew, I have been unable to find any documentation about why this music for Macbeth was considered unlucky, or what the dire consequences of singing, humming, or whistling it were. Of course, as Marc Bonanni explains, whistling is itself another theatrical superstition, only with a rather more plausible backstory. It bears mention, however, that the stories about the music's being unlucky do not encompass the play as a whole. The 1913 Yorkshire Evening Post article mentions several other stage superstitions, including not singing Francesco Paolo Tosti's ""Good-bye"" onstage, not signing contracts on a Friday, etc. But when it specifically cites Macbeth, it does so only in the context of the music. There is no suggestion that the play itself is cursed. Comments upon a prior version of this answer spurred an extensive revision. Thanks to Gareth Rees, Andrew, ShadowRanger, and IMSoP for their feedback, and for providing additional information and resources to help improve this answer."
Is Sherlock Holmes religious?,"The single strongest piece of evidence is surely this, from A Naval Treaty: ""Thank you. I have no doubt I can get details from Forbes. The authorities are excellent at amassing facts, though they do not always use them to advantage. What a lovely thing a rose is!"" [Holmes] walked past the couch to the open window, and held up the drooping stalk of a moss-rose, looking down at the dainty blend of crimson and green. It was a new phase of his character to me, for I had never before seen him show any keen interest in natural objects. ""There is nothing in which deduction is so necessary as in religion,"" said he, leaning with his back against the shutters. ""It can be built up as an exact science by the reasoner. Our highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to rest in the flowers. All other things, our powers our desires, our food, are all really necessary for our existence in the first instance. But this rose is an extra. Its smell and its colour are an embellishment of life, not a condition of it. It is only goodness which gives extras, and so I say again that we have much to hope from the flowers."" which on its face is a declaration of religious faith, though not necessary any sort of orthodoxy. I think the main thing that gives the impression that Holmes wasn't religious is his highly analytical, evidence-seeking character. Nowadays, this usually goes along with religious skepticism. Less so in Doyle's time, though. And the analytical evidence-seeking sort of skeptic these days is usually a very scientific sort of skeptic ... and it doesn't seem hard to imagine (e.g.) that someone as uninterested in pure science as Holmes is portrayed as being (recall that he didn't know the earth went around the sun rather than vice versa) might be unfamiliar with the palaeontological evidence that life on earth is very old, or with the evolutionary ideas that make ""arguments from design"" so much less impressive now than they were a couple of hundred years ago. The other evidence is, I think, much weaker. Holmes speaks of ""going down to chapel"" in The Adventure of the Gloria Scott but I think that tells us nothing. He was at university at that point, probably Oxford or Cambridge. The Oxbridge colleges have chapels; they are universally called chapels rather than (e.g.) churches; and in Holmes's time I believe attendance was compulsory. So the fact that he went doesn't mean he was religious, and the fact that he called it ""chapel"" doesn't mean he was Catholic. Holmes shows himself familiar with the story of David and Bathsheba in The Crooked Man but that's a very famous story, and would have been more universally known then than now. Holmes tells a criminal ""You will have to answer ... at a higher court than the Assizes"" in The Boscombe Valley Mystery, which certainly could indicate belief in an afterlife and some sort of post-mortem judgement -- but it could also just be intended to scare the criminal. Holmes praises ""patient suffering"" in The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger, which would fit well with a Christian (perhaps more specifically a Catholic) background, but the idea that suffering has merit is pretty widespread (and I suspect was more so in the 19th century when Christianity was more deeply ingrained in the culture than it is now). In The Adventure of the Cardboard Box, Holmes says ""What object is served by this circle of misery and violence and fear? It must tend to some end, or else our universe is ruled by chance, which is unthinkable. But what end? There is the great standing perennial problem to which human reason is as far from an answer as ever."" whose first half seems to indicate something like religious belief and whose second half seems to indicate the contrary. I think we can infer that he was neither the sort of atheist who is convinced that our universe is in fact ruled by chance (and necessity), nor the sort of believer who thinks it's perfectly obvious that the answer to that ""perennial problem"" is given by their own religion. But there's plenty of territory in between, both religious and irreligious. Holmes did some work for the Pope, but there's no indication that he did it out of a sense of religious obligation rather than because he was being paid to do it. He's described as having worked for any number of other eminent figures. From time to time Holmes says ""my God"" and ""breathes a prayer of gratitude"" and so forth. Anyone, religious or not, could do those things, and both religious and irreligious people frequently do. This isn't the sort of question that should expect a definitive answer. (Especially as it's not unknown for people's religious position to change, as Doyle's certainly did.) If I had to guess at what Doyle would have said if pinned down, it's that Holmes was convinced (on what he considered empirical grounds) that there must be some sort of divinity behind the universe, but that he thought everything beyond that unknowable and uncertain. But there's nothing resembling a statement of that (or any other) particular view in the canon, and my guess is based as much on what I think Doyle's own position was as anything else. I think he could have made Holmes a Catholic, or an Anglican, or a Huxleyesque agnostic, without any internal contradictions."
Why are place names obscured in Charlotte Brontë's The Professor?,"Is this peculiarity specific to Brontë, or a wider convention? It's most definitely a wider convention. There are hundreds of books from the same era - not only in English literature; Dostoevsky did it too - which obscure place names, personal names, or even dates in this way. And it seems there are almost as many different reasons for doing so: the more I research this topic, the more possible explanations I find. I'll summarise some of the potential reasons here and then give a list of links for further reading. To make it feel as though the author is reporting real events which need to be redacted. Imagine if the novel was about real people and places; some of the names might then need to be redacted in order to preserve the anonymity of those involved. By including such redactions in fiction, the author is giving the readers a subtle impression of authenticity - and perhaps even  of scandalousness: ""ooh, what's being described here is so exciting that they can't even reveal the names involved! this must be juicy gossip!"" Sometimes this conceit of preserving the anonymity of (fictional) people or places is even mentioned explicitly. In Treasure Island, for instance, the coordinates of the island are often mentioned but never explicitly stated; supposedly this is because the story is a true one and the narrator wants to prevent anyone else from finding the island and going to seek the treasure. To avoid having to do detailed research into a real place. If the author had used the names of real locations, they would have had to either research those locations and make sure to get every detail correct, or report on them inaccurately. The former would have been a lot of work, and the latter might have been seen as undesirable or bad writing. (Personally I enjoy reading books which describe real places accurately, and I try to do the same in my own writing. But then I have the advantage of Google Maps and Street View, enabling me to actually look around a town and describe its layout and buildings; Victorian-era authors were less fortunate in this regard.) Nobody wants to be inundated with angry letters from readers about how these two streets don't actually join or how there's no family of this name in this village. Another possibility, of course, would have been to make up imaginary place names and use those instead. Naturally, this has also been done by many authors, and in many different ways. Leaving aside the obvious case of fantasy fiction set in entirely imaginary worlds, even an imaginary location has to be set somewhere in the real world. Thus we have the fictional Midlands town of Middlemarch, the fictional English county of Barsetshire, the fictional Northern town of Coketown - and that's in 19th-century English literature alone. To make the novel more broadly appealing by avoiding specifying its setting. A novel set in a particular, specified, place or time might be most appealing to readers who know the place well or live in the same time, but by avoiding specifics, an author might enable everyone (or at least, a wider group of people) to identify with the story equally well. If a book is set in Manchester, then people who don't live in Manchester must perforce view the story from a distance, and people who hate Manchester might not even read it; if it's set in X——, then hey, that could be my town! (Again, this argument is one that appeals to me personally. One of the main reasons fantasy is my favourite genre is that it throws off the shackles of real society and doesn't affect the prejudices of readers. If I read a book in which, say, the hero is part of a real-world organisation which I dislike, that's likely to spoil it for me; but in a wholly imaginary world, my prejudices will affect my experience less.) As a little nod and interesting tidbit for readers 'in the know'. Sometimes a location can be redacted but still described so that anyone who's familiar with its general surroundings can work out exactly where it is. I've heard that this is possible in Crime and Punishment - street names have been censored, but anyone who knew St. Petersburg could easily tell which street was being described. This enables some readers to get an extra buzz from 'sharing a secret' with the author, while not lessening the experience for those who aren't in the know. Some authors also achieved this effect by describing real places but giving them fictional names. Thomas Hardy was a notable example: for anyone who knows England, his ""Christminster"" is very obviously Oxford, his ""Casterbridge"" is Dorchester, and so on (see also this post). Another example is Elizabeth Gaskell's Cranford, a thinly veiled sketch of her childhood home Knutsford. Sometimes this makes the first point above a more real issue: descriptions are redacted because they actually are of real people and places, not just because the author wants to give that impression. An amusing example of this is in Lorna Moon's novel Doorways in Drumorty, which uses the fictional town of Drumorty to paint a picture of her own home town of Strichen; the residents of Strichen were so scandalised that her book was banned in the local library there!

"Did Poe plagiarise someone else's work when writing ""The Raven""?","There have been several major accusations that Poe plagiarized The Raven from a number of different works, many in other languages. However, those claims have little to no evidence to back them up, and they have been dismissed by most as being attempts at attention. We have no reliable evidence of any sort that Poe committed plagiarism here. In the late 19th century, one major but unsubstantiated claim was made against Poe, saying that The Raven was either taken from (or inspired by) two an older work: The Parrot. In 1878, Colonel John A Joyce included a short section in his book, Edgar Allan Poe, that claimed that he had spoken with an Italian named Leo Penzoni. Penzoni told him that his grandfather (often also called Leo Penzoni) wrote a poem entitled The Parrot seven decades before, and published it in The Milan Art Journal in 1809. Here is the first verse, in the English translation: I sit and pine so weary
in midnight sad and dreary.
Over long forgotten volumes
of historic love-lit lore;
And while winking, lonely blinking
I thought I heard while thinking
A rush of wings revolving above
my oaken door,
""What's that,"" said I, disturbing my
melancholy sore—
'Tis my lost one, sweet ""Belmore"" Compare this to the first verse of The Raven: Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
            Only this and nothing more.” Similar connections can be found throughout the rest of both poems. It would seem, then, that Poe indeed plagiarized from Penzoni. There are, however, three major problems with Joyce's claim: In short, there's no evidence to back up Penzoni's story. I've found bits and pieces pointing towards another—more damning if it's true—possible target of plagiarism. I originally found them made in this blog and this blog. They state that a poet named Jefferson Tiberius Faulkmore wrote a poem entitled The Magpie in 1829, publishing it in The Hartford Cabinet of Literature & Science (supposedly later the Hartford Literary Journal), a year after his death. According to the stories, the story was brought to Poe's attention in 1842 by a man named Rufus Wilmot Griswald, and Poe wrote him a letter in return. It included this passage: Of particular interest in the Cabinet was Faulkmore’s “Magpie”, which is as fine a poem, in both the style of its versification & expression and its originality, as I have recently encountered. I wonder at its omission from your “Poets of America”.  That it has been published just once, years ago, and forgotten is as unfortunate for the public as it must have seemed for the poet.  Are you certain that it has not seen publication elsewhere?  Do you know what became of Faulkmore? If you want my opinion, these claims are absolute rubbish. I can find no independent verification that The Hartford Cabinet of Literature & Science or even Faulkmore or Griswold themselves ever existed. I include it here only as a curiosity; I'd be interested to see if anyone can find something truthful on them. I suspect not. A more academic study of certain claims is included in Outsourcing The Raven: Retroactive Origins, by Eliza Richards (the same paper is the source of the next few anecdotes and quotes about plagiarism). It seems to be acknowledge that Poe took the rhythm of The Raven from Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Geraldine's Courtship, published in 1845. Even Poe stated this outright: According to Ingram, Thomas Buchanan Read informed Robert Browning that Poe had said that his entire poem was suggested by Barrett's single line ""With a murmurous stir uncertain, in the air, the purple curtain."" Poe advertised rather than hid Barrett's influence by discussing her poem in a Broadway Journal review just weeks before ""The Raven"" was published. Looking at the text, the similarities between the two works does appear, in rhythm if not wording. There were certain other—though less substantial—cases where Poe may have been inspired by another work. Thomas Holley Chivers, in 1850, claimed that Poe stole the meter from To Allegra Florence in Heaven, written for his young (dead) daughter. Here is an excerpt from To Allegra: Holy angels now are bending
To receive thy soul ascending
Up to Heaven to joys unending,
And to bliss which is divine. Another poet, Henry Hirst, claimed that Poe stole inspiration for The Raven from his To a Ruined Fountain in a Grecian Picture. I'm a bit more skeptical that there is any significant similarity between the two, save the inclusion of a raven: Forms of chiefs and maidens bright
Whom the never-dying raven
Hath forgotten, nameless even
In the poet's lay of might. Finally, there were two independent and somewhat ridiculous claims: That Poe actually translated, word for word, an ancient Chinese poem by Kia Yi (see Chinese Legends and Other Poems), and that he translated an unknown Persian poem (whose very existence I have yet to confirm). In both cases, he supposedly copied them verbatim and published the poem under his own name, as The Raven. The interesting part about the claim about Kia Yi's poem, Fu-Niao (Bird of Fate), is that it mentions that month of November - a month that, as far as I know, was not used by the Chinese in 200 B.C.! It could be a translation change, but it could also indicate that liberties have been taken. In short, there have been a wide variety of people saying that they—or someone else—wrote The Raven before Poe did. However, all of them suffer from some or all of the following problems: I think, then that the available evidence indicates that Poe did not plagiarize The Raven."
When and why did the Brothers Grimm start collecting fairy tales?,"First off, if anybody fancies reading these fairy tales, here is a good copy of it. It's mostly translated from the final edition of the original Brothers Grimm books, but with a small part from the first edition.1 To start, the Brothers Grimm grew up in a well-to-do family in Hanau, Germany.  Jacob was born in January 1785 and Wilhelm in February 1786, but their father (a jurist) died in 1796, when the brothers were only 10 and 11. With his death, the family plunged into poverty.  With the aid of their aunt, Jacob and Wilhelm were able to attend a very good school in Kassel however. Some scholars speculate that Jacob and Wilhelm's low status in society drove them to be the best they could be, to ""prove something"" to their high-born peers.2 This school, called the Friedrichsgymnasium, focused primarily on languages and music. After graduating they attended the University of Marburg, where the Brothers' studies of folklore really took off. Under their law teacher, they started studying medieval folklore extensively.3 After graduating, Jacob went back home to support the family in 1805. They had been living in extreme poverty.  He found a full-time job soon after, in 1808, as a court librarian in Westphalia. Wilhelm joined him soon after.  The position didn't pay much, but it afforded ample time for research. Jacob published 13 books from then until 1830, some in combination with his brother.  Between 1812 and 1864, 17 editions of Kinder- und Hausmärchen (Children's and Household Tales) were published, and have been reprinted countless times since. 1: The present translation is based in part on the first edition of the KINDER– UND HAUSMÄRCHEN published in two volumes in 1812 and 1815. The first 211 tales in this translation are based on the seventh and final edition published in 1857.  (preface, The Complete Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm) 2: Zipes, Jack.

Isn't Gríma Wormtongue a very revealing name?,"TL;DR: ‘Wormtongue’ is a deliberately negative name given by his enemies, so it can’t be faulted for being pejorative, even if it’s not as unflattering as it might seem to modern ears. But ‘Gríma’ itself isn’t much better! As Mary points out, ‘Wormtongue’ is a nickname applied to Gríma by his opponents (which, Gandalf implies, is everyone but Théoden). We’re not told exactly how Gríma—a sly schemer in a kingdom where warlike deeds are prized—came to be so influential, but it certainly seems to be due to his cunning with words. His depressing speech to Éowyn in the movie is actually Gandalf’s description of her in the book, but we do get some other examples of Gríma swaying people with words, and even an almost-complimentary response from Gandalf when he calls him ‘bold and cunning… he plays a game with peril and wins a throw.’ So the name Wormtongue is well earned. Keep in mind that a ‘worm’ doesn’t have to be an earthworm, tapeworm, or anything else we call a ‘worm’ in modern English. Historically any narrow creeping or crawling animal (snakes, slugs, caterpillars) could be termed a ‘worm’. In legend and Tolkien, it’s used for dragons, too, and Smaug certainly had a gift of cunning speech. Here, though, I think the reference is more likely to be to a snake; Gandalf calls Gríma a snake more than once. So ‘Snaketongue’, or maybe ‘Dragontongue’, is perhaps a less ‘Evildude’ rendering of the nickname. But with all that said… the name Gríma itself is not very positive. Like other examples of the Rohirric language, it’s a real word borrowed from Old English. It means ‘mask’ or ‘secret’, also ‘spectre’, and most positively ‘helmet’ (but we know Helm was a Rohirric name with positive connotations, and it seems unlikely that Gríma would be treated as a synonym). It gets even worse when we consider his father’s name, Gálmód, meaning ‘wanton’! (So bad, in fact, that I’ve encountered the theory that it wasn’t really his father’s name, and that ‘son of Gálmód’ was an insult Gandalf made up.) And this is all in keeping with Gríma’s likely inspiration in the character of Unferth, from Beowulf, whose name Tolkien interpreted as ‘un-peace’ or ‘quarrel’. A sly advisor to the king, opposing the hero(es), bearing an unflattering name? Sounds familiar…"
Why are haiku usually of 17 syllables?,"Before diving into the history of haiku, there's a precursor step. The Japanese language is broken up into symbols that are what we'd typically write in English as digraphs. Most sounds in Japanese consists of a consonant and a vowel combined. To illustrate this, have a haiku: ふ る い け や
  (fu ru i ke ya)
  か わ ず と び こ む
  (ka wa zu to bi ko mu)
  み ず の お と
  (mi zu no o to) 5 symbols, 7 symbols, 5 symbols. So when we talk about ""syllables,"" this meant something much more specific in Japanese. And this happened to be something of importance to Japanese poetry. Of course, this haiku is easier to read if we split it up by words: ふる　いけ　や / かわず　とびこむ / みず　の　おと
  furu ike ya / kawazu tobikomu / mizu no oto
  Ah, the ancient pond / as a  frog takes the plunge / the sound of water. This all is a slight simplification, though. Japanese has digraphs, like きょ, which we write as trigraphs in English: kyo, as in Kyoto. But these still count as one phonetic unit (called ""on"" in Japanese), and that's what notation like ""5-7-5"" counts. (Haiku tends to be written with kanji, anyway, which changes the raw symbol count. But writing it like I did above serves to show clearly where the on are.) With the poetic basis for understanding the structure of the haiku out of the way, let's talk history.  The origins of haiku lie in religious practices, Shinto and Buddhist alike, as well as general poetic practices and culture. Songs frequently followed a form called waka. This form essentially boiled down to a combination of two other forms: choka, which follows 5-7-5-7...5-7-7, and sedoka, which follows 5-7-7-5-7-7. This precursor to haiku was just a culturally ingrained pattern - not unlike the four chord song [language warning]. It's just a shared recognizable pattern for music and poetry. And many forms for poetry diverged from there.  The form called tanka is a specific form of waka, and is so frequently used interchangeably that it has muddied the meaning of waka. However, the tanka form is a refinement and restriction on the general pattern of waka: it follows the form 5-7-5-7-7 specifically. This form is often considered the precursor to what we now call haiku.  Many poets laid their hands on shaping this form in between tanka and haiku. Enumerating them all is beyond the scope of this answer. Significant contributors were Matsunaga Teitoku, a wandering poet who wrote a plethora of prose and poetry, and Issa, who wrote often on the state of Japanese society.  But the direct precursor to haiku is Masaoka Shiki, who took the form that had evolved over time, and focused in on 5-7-5. He is the person who gave it the name ""haiku,"" largely under the banner of tanka reform. He wrote well over 25,000 haiku. It is largely the popularization of Shiki's writings in Japan that led to the prominence of the form elsewhere in the world. His commentary presented it as a simpler, cleaner aesthetic - its compressed nature, he wrote, could sketch life and reality much more easily than any more complex form could. This is a strong appeal to principles in Japanese culture, and is the ultimate aesthetic choice backing haiku.  It was then spread through popular poets and poetry to English-speaking countries - except instead of Japanese phonetic units, they naturally counted in English syllables. The popularization of haiku spread from there into the 1950s, giving us the form we know it in today."
English short story where a wife makes an investigation officer eat the murder weapon,"This was a short story by Roald Dahl that was initially rejected. She owes it to the child to escape discovery if she can. She prepares the leg of lamb that she used as a weapon and places it in the oven to somewhat destroy the evidence. Then she considers an alibi. After practising a cheerful mask and some innocuous remarks to make in conversation, she visits the grocer and chats blandly with him about what to make for Patrick's dinner. Upon her return to the house and to the room where her husband lies dead on the floor, she acts surprised and meaningfully cries. She then calls the police.
When the police (who are all friends of her husband) arrive, they ask Mary questions and look at the scene. Considering Mary above suspicion, the police conclude that Patrick was killed by an intruder with a large blunt object likely made of metal. After they make a fruitless search around the house and surrounding area, Mary is reminded that the leg is just about done and offers it to the policemen. She points out that they have already been working through and past the dinner hour, and that the meat will otherwise go to waste; they hesitate, but accept. During the meal, as Mary sits nearby but does not join them, the policemen discuss the murder weapon's possible location. One officer, his mouth full of meat, says it is ""probably right under our very noses"". Mary, overhearing them, begins to giggle.- Lamb To The Slaughter - Wikipedia This seems to match your description pretty well."
"Origins of quote: ""Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.""","This looks like a spoof of the quote from The Lord of the Rings, by J.R.R. Tolkien: Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger. It comes from The Fellowship of the Ring: 'But it is said: Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger. The choice is yours: to go or wait.'
  'And it is also said,' answered Frodo: 'Go not to the Elves for counsel for they will answer both no and yes.'
  'Is it indeed?' laughed Gildor. 'Elves seldom give unguarded advice, for advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise to the wise, and all courses may run ill.'
The Fellowship of the Ring, chapter 3 As for where the dragon part is from, I found a book called Dragonswan, by Sherrilyn Kenyon. The first line is: Be kind to dragons, for thou art crunchy when roasted and taste good with ketchup. (Google Books). These quotes appear to have been merged. Okay, nobody knows where this first came from, but here's something from July 27, 1999, in the Salon magazine: All this, and he has a wickedly weird and original sense of humor. “Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards,” Marceau once said, “for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.” It's also apparently in the 24th of February, 1999 issue of the Plainview Daily Herald, according to this website, but their archives appear to be down (and the Wayback Machine is turning up blank). The Quote Investigator Twitter account responded to a request for help with an even earlier use of the quote, from Usenet (July 10 1989): Do Not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for you are crunchy and go

There are archives available here, for now.

"Are quote marks used selectively in ""The Handmaid's Tale"" or do I have a bad scan of the book?","After doing a fair bit of digging on the question, I think I've come to an answer, and it's one supported by a couple sources: Quotation marks denote real dialog. Absence of quotation marks denotes dialog in memory. She uses quotes when she's writing about dialog in the present, as it's happening. When the dialog is happening in the past, however - i.e. in her memory - then the quotes are missing. In the example you've posted here, the quotes occur around the block you've selected in the present tense, but not the block in the past tense. It appears to be a reasonably well-noted and very intentional part of the book. I found this reference, and while debatably authoritative, it does concur: In the novel, when the main character, that is, the narrator is reproducing a speech which took place in the past she uses direct speech without quotation marks... Whereas when Offred is repoducing a conversation which is taking place at the time of the narration, she uses direct speech within quotation marks... I also found a far more authoritative source, Jacqueline Pelliccio from Rutgers University, who notes that the absence of quotation marks in characters' memories are indeed intended to cast doubt on the integrity of the dialog: Without the confines of quotation marks, some of the character dialogue becomes integrated right into the storyline of the novel, mixing individual characters’ ideas with opinions of the narrator as well as with larger themes of the novel as a whole. The potential of a message to have different speakers allows for multiple interpretations of the passage, all of which may be important. ...Those in positions of authority use language to limit the ideas of the subordinates as a way to ensure stability in the system of power. ...Luke asks her a question he intends to answer himself, “Do you know what it came from? Said Luke. Mayday? . . . It’s French, he said. From m’aidez. / Help me” (Atwood, 44). There are no parentheses around Luke’s speech so the reader cannot formally tell where it ends, therefore “Help me”  can be taken as Luke speaking to his wife, the narrator addressing the readers, or Offred pleading to her past self. This methodology consistently gives passages multiple meanings, where one could easily gloss over it without any recognition. It appears that this may have been done to tie memories more closely to the narrator, rather than conveying them as independent scenes. The lack of quotation marks is for depicting personal thoughts and feelings, as well as dialog as it appears in her memory. This would fit well with one of the book's underlying themes of gaslighting. Memory is unreliable, and is in the eye of the beholder. Quotation marks are a sign that what's being written is exactly what's being said, and removing them when the narrator begins to discuss memories is a subtle way of instilling doubt: it's just her word, only. There is no record."
Why does Mr. Poe cough so much?,"The children remembered Mr. Poe because he always had a cold and was
  constantly excusing himself fromthe table to have a fit of coughing in the next room. The top quote is from Book 1 (The Bad Beginning) and the next is from Book 2 (The Reptile Room). The driver of the car was Mr. Poe, a family 
  friend who worked at a bank and always had 
  a cough.  It seems he is just sickly, and is constantly at a state of having a cold--which seems like a rather unfortunate event to me.  Or he has constant year-round mild allergies and hasn't found a fix for them yet.  "
"What is the benefit in the Prologue ""spoiling"" the play in Romeo and Juliet?","You have to remember, the audience is well aware that a tragedy usually ends in the deaths of many of the main characters; therefore, I would argue that the enjoyment of the play is derived from an exploration of a set of themes that require the audience's understanding of the direction the play is moving in, in order to allow for emphasis to be placed on these themes (rather than the plot). The enjoyment of the play does not come from learning that everyone dies in the end.  ""Oh, it was a tragedy! I see, what a clever play. I did not see that coming!"""
"What's the significance of ""Oranges and Lemons"" in 1984?","This is really more of an extended comment, than an answer. But my feeling about that rhyme is that part of the reason why Orwell used it in the story, was as another example of Winston being ""betrayed"" by something he trusted. Basically one of the themes of the book is inescapable doom, and even the things that seemed good and seemed ""on his side"", O'Brien and Charrington for example, turn on him in the end. The book clearly shows that Winston was fascinated by the vanished (or vanishing) past, symbolised, for example, by the paperweight. For him, the past represented a better place, or at least a different place (since he didn't actually know what it was like - see his attempt to find out from the drunk prole). At any rate, the past was a place that was free of the influence of the Party. It was a time before the Party came to be, and therefore (at least in Winston's mind), it was a purer, more innocent time. And hence his fascination with trying to find out more words to the rhyme. But in the section where the Party finally ""arrests"" Winston and Julia (for lack of a better word), Charrington quotes the end of the rhyme, namely, the ""chop off your head"" part to them. To quote the novel: And then another quite different voice, a thin, cultivated voice which Winston had the impression of having heard before, struck in; 'And by the way, while we are on the subject, ""Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head""!' And of course, Charrington, in disguise as the harmless/kindly shop owner, had originally mentioned the rhyme to Winston. How it goes on I don't remember, but I do
  know it ended up, ""Here comes a candle to light you to bed, Here comes a
  chopper to chop off your head."" It was a kind of a dance. They held out
  their arms for you to pass under, and when they came to ""Here comes a
  chopper to chop off your head"" they brought their arms down and caught you. So, it was as if the Past of which he was so fond, and which he valued precisely because of its absence of the Party, has betrayed him as well. No doubt Orwell had multiple reasons for using that rhyme - it's very old - but he made it fit well into the plot of the story. Incidentally, this usage of this 18th century rhyme, in a mid-20th century novel, is probably its best known use in literature."
Bilbo’s song of Eärendil in “The Fellowship of the Ring”,"This answer grew too long for a single post, so I’ve split it in two, with history and analysis in this part, and detailed line notes in the other part. Bilbo’s poem retells the myth of the half-elven hero Eärendil, who lived long ago, in the First Age of Middle-earth. He was a sailor who voyaged into the western seas, seeking the land of the gods (Valinor) to ask their help in the war against the dark lord Morgoth. His wife Elwing gave him a Silmaril, a magical jewel, and with the help of its light he found the way to Valinor and delivered his plea. The gods lifted Eärendil and his ship into the sky, and the light from the Silmaril became the planet Venus (the evening and morning star). This poem has puzzled many readers! Even if the outlines of the story are clear, it is full of names and references and details that are mysterious. Readers who have been paying careful attention will recall the name “Elbereth” from Gildor’s song in book I, chapter 3, and the names “Eärendil”, “Elwing”, and “Silmaril” from Aragorn’s telling of the tale of Tinúviel: ‘For of Beren and Lúthien was born Dior Thingol’s heir; and of him Elwing the White whom Eärendil wedded, he that sailed his ship out of the mists of the world into the seas of heaven with the Silmaril upon his brow. And of Eärendil came the Kings of Númenor, that is Westernesse.’ J. R. R. Tolkien (1954). The Fellowship of the Ring, book I, chapter 11. London: Allen & Unwin. But these are the barest of references, and the other names in the poem are obscure. Where are “Arvernien” and “Tarmenel” and “Tirion”? Why is Elwing “flying” when she comes to him? Who is the “Elder King”? Who are “they” who teach him melodies and build him a new ship? There is no way within the novel to figure these things out, not even with the help of the appendices. However, that is just what you would expect if you went to a far-off country: the people there would have a history full of people and places and events that you had never heard of. So the effect of these unexplained references is to give a sense of depth and richness to the setting, to suggest that the world extends beyond the pages of the novel. The poems and stories in The Lord of the Rings also reveal something of the character of the people who tell them. The reason why the tale of Tinúviel is so important to Aragorn is that he sees a reflection of his own situation in that of Beren. Similarly, we might ask why the character of Eärendil appeals to Bilbo. Perhaps it is because Bilbo has always been attracted to adventure and exploration, even if such an inclination is not quite respectable for hobbits: As [the dwarves] sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and jealous love, the desire of the hearts of dwarves. Then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick. He looked out of the window. The stars were out in a dark sky above the trees. He thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns. J. R. R. Tolkien (1937). The Hobbit, chapter 1. London: Allen & Unwin. As The Lord of the Rings progresses, we encounter more references to the characters and events of these stories, cementing the impression of a cohesive world, in which figures out of legend can emerge into the present of the story, giving them a mythic grandeur. For example, soon after Bilbo recites his poem, Elrond reveals his connection to that story: ‘Eärendil was my sire, who was born in Gondolin before its fall; and my mother was Elwing, daughter of Dior, son of Lúthien of Doriath.’ The Fellowship of the Ring, book II, chapter 2. (This explains why Aragorn had to said to Bilbo that it was “cheek to make verses about Eärendil in the house of Elrond”.) And much later, at a moment of great peril, Sam will link his own story to the stories of Beren and Lúthien and Eärendil, and be heartened: ‘Beren now, he never thought he was going to get that Silmaril from the Iron Crown in Thangorodrim, and yet he did, and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours. But that’s a long tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it—and the Silmaril went on and came to Eärendil. And why, sir, I never thought of that before! We’ve got—you’ve got some of the light of it in that star-glass that the Lady gave you! Why, to think of it, we’re in the same tale still! It’s going on. Don’t the great tales never end?’ J. R. R. Tolkien (1955). The Return of the King, book V, chapter 8. London: Allen & Unwin. The name ‘Eärendil’ has a special significance in Tolkien’s mythology, because it inspired him to embark on the whole project. In 1913, Tolkien was an undergraduate at Oxford, studying Old English language and literature, and he was struck by these lines of alliterative verse: Eala earendel,     engla beorhtast,
ofer middangeard     monnum sended,
ond soðfæsta     sunnan leoma,
torht ofer tunglas,     þu tida gehwane
of sylfum þe     symle inlihtes! Hail shining light, brightest of angels,†
Over middle-earth sent to men,
And true light of the sun,
Brighter than stars, you ever enlighten
All seasons from yourself. Anon (c. 800). Crist. † “engla” also means “English”. Tolkien’s biographer described the effect of these lines on the young man: Earendel is glossed by the Anglo-Saxon dictionary as ‘a shining light, ray’, but here it clearly has some special meaning. Tolkien himself interpreted it as referring to John the Baptist, but he believed that ‘Earendel’ has originally been the name for the star presaging the dawn, that is, Venus. He was strangely moved by its appearance in the Cynewulf† lines. ‘I felt a curious thrill,’ he wrote long afterwards, ‘as if something had stirred in me, half wakened from sleep. There was something very remote and strange and beautiful behind those words, if I could grasp it, far beyond ancient English.’ Humphrey Carpenter (1977). Tolkien: A Biography, p. 72. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. † Crist was formerly attributed to Cynewulf due to the surviving manuscript being bound together with Cynewulf’s poems, but these are no longer thought to be by the same writer. [In September 1914] he wrote a poem. It was headed with the line from Cynewulf’s Crist that had so fascinated him: Eala Earendel engla beorhtast! Its title was ‘The Voyage of Earendel the Evening Star’, and it began as follows: Earendel sprang up from the Ocean’s cup
    In the gloom of the mid-world’s rim;
From the door of Night as a ray of light
    Leapt over the twilight brim,
And launching his bark like a silver spark
    From the golden-fading sand
Down the sunlit breath of Day’s fiery Death
    He sped from Westerland. The succeeding verses describe the star-ship’s voyage across the firmament, a progress that continues until the morning light blots out all sight of it. This notion of the star-mariner whose ship leaps into the sky had grown from the reference to ‘Earendel’ in the Cynewulf lines. But the poem that it produced was entirely original.‡ It was in fact the beginning of Tolkien’s own mythology. Carpenter, p. 79. ‡ Carpenter is mistaken when he writes “entirely original”: the poem is a pastiche of Percy Bysshe Shelley’s ‘Arethusa’ (1820) which begins, “Arethusa arose / From her couch of snows”. Starting in the winter of 1914 Tolkien wrote three more poems about Earendel, adding place-names and other mythological details: West of the Sun, east of the Moon†
Lies the haven of the star,
The white town of the Wanderer
And the rocks of Eglamar.
There Wingelot is harboured,
While Earendel looks afar
O’er the darkness of the waters
Between here and Eglamar—
Out, out, beyond Taniquetil
In Valinor afar. J. R. R. Tolkien (c. 1915–1920). Extract from ‘The Shores of Faery’. In Christopher Tolkien (1984), The Book of Lost Tales 2, p. 272. † An allusion to the Norwegian fairy story, ‘East of the Sun and West of the Moon’. Tolkien took the name ‘Wingelot’ for Earendel’s ship from ‘Guingelot’, the name of the boat belonging to the mythological figure Wade. Evidently the story of Wade’s boat was once a familiar piece of English folklore, for Chaucer mentions a ‘Tale of Wade’ in Troilus and Criseyde and alludes to “Wade’s boat” in The Canterbury Tales, but the story has been lost. The other names are original to Tolkien, and it seems that he was already working on a project to create a mythological canvas to explain the background for his Earendel poems. The idea had its origins in his taste for inventing languages. He had discovered that to carry out such inventions to any degree of complexity he must create for the languages a ‘history’ in which they could develop. Already in the early Earendel poems he had begun to sketch something of that history; now he wanted to record it in full. […] And there was a third element playing a part: his desire to create a mythology for England. He had hinted at this during his undergraduate days when he wrote of the Finnish Kalevala: ‘I would that we had more of it left—something of the same sort that belonged to the English.’ This idea grew until it reached grand proportions. Carpenter, p. 97. Tolkien began at least eleven versions of the story of Eärendil. Since the story of Eärendil was the earliest of Tolkien’s writings about Middle-earth, and he returned to it so many times, it is something of a puzzle that he never completed a version in prose. When, after the success of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien revised the Silmarillion for publication, he got as far as ‘The Wanderings of Húrin’ (which became the first part of the chapter ‘The Ruin of Doriath’ in the completed Silmarillion) and then broke off. His son Christopher wrote: We come here to the furthest point in the narrative of the Elder Days that he reached in his work on The Silmarillion (in the widest sense) after the Second War and the completion of The Lord of the Rings. There are bits of information about the succeeding parts—not much—but no further new or revised narrative; and the promise held out in his words “Link to the Necklace of the Dwarves, Sigil Elu-naeth, Necklace of the Woe of Thingol” was never fulfilled. It is as if we come to the brink of a great cliff, and look down from highlands raised in some later age onto an ancient plain far below. For the story of the Nauglamir and the destruction of Doriath, the fall of Gondolin, the attack on the Havens,† we must return through more than a quarter of a century to the Quenta Noldorinwa, or beyond. Christopher Tolkien (1994). The War of the Jewels, pp. 297–298. London: HarperCollins. † Part of the story of Eärendil. I’ve speculated elsewhere that this may have been a psychological difficulty—the story of the fall of Gondolin was written in 1916–1917 while Tolkien was on sick leave from the Western Front, and perhaps the memories of that time were too difficult to revisit. But another possible source of difficulty is Tolkien’s changing conception of the nature of the mythology. The idea that the planet Venus is the apotheosis of the mariner Eärendil belongs to a pre-scientific kind of mythology, and this was fundamentally incompatible with the kind of rational and detailed ‘subcreation’ represented by The Lord of the Rings and Tolkien’s subsequent developments of the mythology: [My father] had come to believe that […] that the cosmos of the old myth was no longer valid; and at the same time he was impelled to try to construct a more secure ‘theoretical’ or ‘systematic’ basis for elements in the legendarium that were not to be dislodged. Christopher Tolkien (1993). Morgoth’s Ring. London: HarperCollins Bilbo’s song of Eärendil has another source, Tolkien’s poem ‘Errantry’. It went through many versions, but the earliest manuscript begins like this: There was a merry passenger,
a messenger, an errander;
he took a tiny porringer
and oranges for provender; J. R. R. Tolkien (c. 1930). ‘Errantry’, lines 1-4. In Christopher Tolkien (1989). The Treason of Isengard. London: HarperCollins. The poetic form was original to Tolkien: It is for one thing in a metre I invented (depending on trisyllabic assonances or near-assonances, which is so difficult that except in this one example I have never been able to use it again—it just blew out in a single impulse). J. R. R. Tolkien (22 June 1952). Letter to Rayner Unwin. Number 133 in Humphrey Carpenter, ed. (1981). The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien. London: George Allen & Unwin. Tolkien’s claim, “I have never been able to use [the metre] again” might seem rather surprising in the light of the fact that ‘Erranty’ has the same rhythm (iambic tetrameter) and rhyme scheme as Bilbo’s song. But we’ll see later that ‘Errantry’ and Bilbo’s song are really two versions of a single work. It is of course a piece of verbal acrobatics and metrical high-jinks; and was intended for recitation with great variations of speed. It needs a reciter or chanter capable of producing the words with great clarity, but in places with great rapidity. […] The piece has had a curious history. It was begun very many years ago, in an attempt to go on with the model that came unbidden into my mind: the first six lines, in which, I guess, ‘D’ye ken the rhyme to porringer’ had a part. J. R. R. Tolkien (1967). Letter to Donald Swann. In Christopher Tolkien (1989). The Treason of Isengard. London: HarperCollins. The verse that Tolkien refers to here is a piece of Jacobite doggerel:     O what’s the rhyme to porringer?
    Ken ye the rhyme to porringer?
King James the Seventh* had ae dochter,†
    And he ga’e her to an Oranger.‡
    Ken ye how he requited him?
    Ken ye how he requited him?
The lad has into England come,
    And ta’en the crown in spite o’ him. Anon (1828). Jacobite Minstrelsy, p. 28. Glasgow: R. Griffin. * James VII and II † Mary II ‡ William of Orange. ‘Errantry’ was published in The Oxford Magazine in 1933. In this version the opening lines were: There was a merry passenger
a messenger, a mariner:
he built a gilded gondola
to wander in, and had in her
a load of yellow oranges
and porridge for his provender;
he perfumed her with marjoram
and cardamom and lavender. J. R. R. Tolkien (1933). ‘Errantry’, lines 1-8. In The Oxford Magazine, 52:5, 9 November 1933. At this stage the poem had no connection to the mythology: it was a whimsical piece of metrical invention whose “knights of Faerie” have little or no resemblance to the elves of Middle-earth. But he continued to revise the poem (“there are no less than fifteen manuscript and typescript texts”), and the “merry passenger” became the mariner Eärendil. Tolkien later ingeniously fictionalized his own revisions of the poem into revisions supposedly made by Bilbo: No. 3 [Errantry] is an example of another kind which seems to have amused Hobbits: A rhyme or story which returns to its beginning, and so may be recited until the hearers revolt. Several specimens are found in the Red Book, but the others are simple and crude. No. 3 is much the longest and most elaborate. It was evidently made by Bilbo. This is indicated by its obvious relationship to the long poem recited by Bilbo, as his own composition, in the house of Elrond. In origin a ‘nonsense rhyme’, it is in the Rivendell version found transformed and applied, somewhat incongruously, to the High-elvish and Númenorean legends of Eärendil. Probably because Bilbo invented its metrical devices and was proud of them. They do not appear in other pieces in the Red Book. The older form, here given, must belong to the early days after Bilbo’s return from his journey. Though the influence of Elvish traditions is seen, they are not seriously treated, and the names used (Derrilyn, Thellamie, Belmarie, Aerie) are mere inventions in the Elvish style, and are not in fact Elvish at all. J. R. R. Tolkien (1962). The Adventures of Tom Bombadil. London: Allen & Unwin. One of the puzzles I noted at the start of this answer is why Elwing is “flying” when she meets Eärendil? This is rather more puzzling than Tolkien intended it to be: he had revised this part of the poem to include more context and detail, but the revised manuscript was mislaid and an earlier version went to the publishers instead. But the history of this, perhaps the most protean, in its scale, of all my father’s works, does not end here. It ends, in fact, in the most extraordinary way. This text C was not the last, although the published form of the poem was achieved in it. Another typescript (D) was made, doubtless at the same time as C, and given the title ‘The Short Lay of Eärendel’;† In this, a new element entered at the beginning of the fourth stanza (There flying Elwing came to him): the attack of the four surviving sons of Fëanor on the Havens of Sirion, Elwing’s casting herself into the sea, bearing the Silmaril, and her transformation into a seabird, in which guise she flew to meet Eärendel returning. […] What actually happened one can only surmise. I believe the most likely explanation to be that the texts D, E, F were mislaid, and that at the crucial time the version represented by C went to the publishers, as it should not have done. It looks also as if these lost texts did not turn up again until many years had passed, by which time my father no longer remembered the history. Christopher Tolkien (1989). The Treason of Isengard. London: HarperCollins. † The long Lay being the poem in alliterative verse begun in 1920 and never completed. In version F the fourth stanza begins: In might the Fëanorians
that swore the unforgotten oath
brought war into Arvernien
with burning and with broken troth;
and Elwing from her fastness dim
then cast her in the waters wide,
but like a mew† was swiftly borne,
uplifted o’er the roaring tide.
Through hopeless night she came to him,
and flame was in the darkness lit,
more bright than light of diamond
the fire upon her carcanet. J. R. R. Tolkien (c. 1940). In Christopher Tolkien (1989). The Treason of Isengard. London: HarperCollins. † A seagull"
"Origin of the phrase ""Open Sesame""","Most likely from the Hebrew word ""סיסמה"", which translates to ""password"". The pronunciation of the word out loud is (approximately, going off information a native speaker told me) ""seez-ma"" or ""sees-ma"". Now this provokes the question:  In the story, Ali Baba's brother became trapped in the cave and couldn't get out. He did try other grains though... If the phrase was originally something like ""password"" or ""password for opening"" (literally), why would he guess other grains? However, it turns out that tale wasn't originally in The 1001 Nights. It was first seen in a French translation by Antoine Galland. Galland claimed that he heard the folk tale in Aleppo, Syria. However, some scholars argue that Galland made up the story himself, since no documentation of the story in old Arabic records has ever been found. It does not appear in the oldest copy of ""The Thousand and One Nights,"" which is an Arabic manuscript from the 14th century. In ""One Thousand and One Nights,"" the storyteller Scheherazade tells ""Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves"" to her husband, the Persian king Shahryar. (source) TL;DR: Galland claimed it's a Syrian tale, but it's most likely he made it up. It's not in the oldest version, plus the making-it-up explains the other grains. If he made it up, it's most likely that ""סיסמה"" (seesma) became ""sesame""."
Who does the cat represent in Animal Farm?,"Yes. In the words of Jesse McDevitt-Irwin: suggests that she could represent the educated of Russia, more specifically, the educated who did not believe that communism was the correct path. She also skips out on work, which could mean the educated because they did not do physical nature. One more clue is the nature of a cat on a farm: the cat performs a service (rodent control) and receives benefits (milk, shelter). This further implies that the cat was privileged under the Czars, which further implies the wealthy, educated class."
Did Borges invent the idea of writing reviews/summaries of imaginary literary works?,"Sartor Resartus was written in 1836. There are examples of earlier imaginaries dating back to John Donne and Rabelais. Donne's The Courtier's Library (1650), is a catalogue of 34 apocryphal works modeled after Rabelais' Library of St Victor, Pantagruel, II, vii (~1532). Together, these two references move the origin of the OPs query back three centuries. See The Courtier's Library on the blog John Donne Society Digital Prose Project."
Did Sherlock Holmes have a character development arc across Arthur Conan Doyle's books?,"One possible case of character development is in ""The Adventure of the Three Garridebs"" when Holmes, for the first and only time in all the canon, is shown to care for his fellow man. This may be more revealing the character that's always been hidden beneath, rather than a change in character, but from an out-of-universe point of view at least, I think it counts as character development: ""You're not hurt, Watson? For God's sake, say that you are not hurt!"" It was worth a wound - it was worth many wounds - to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation. This is quite a change from the utterly cold, logical, even ruthless man we've seen in Holmes in all the other stories - the man who disdains any distraction from the pursuit of pure reason."
"Was Nabokov's Pale Fire intended to be read non-linearly, i.e. jumping to each line reference?","This is an interesting question. I don't have a definitive answer, but here is some pertinent information. In the foreword to the book, the fictional (and pathologically self-important) Kinbote suggests reading the notes first, then the poem (with the help of the notes), and then the notes again: Other notes, arranged in a running commentary, will certainly satisfy
  the most voracious reader. Although those notes, in conformity with
  custom, come after the poem, the reader is advised to consult them
  first and then study the poem with their help, rereading them of
  course as he goes through its text, and perhaps, after having done
  with the poem, consulting them a third time so as to complete the
  picture. I find it wise in such cases as this to eliminate the bother
  of back-and-forth leafings by either cutting out and clipping together
  the pages with the text of the thing, or, even more simply, purchasing
  two copies of the same work which can then be placed in adjacent
  positions on a comfortable table These instructions are not necessarily Nabokov's, however. Rather, they are used to illustrate Kinbote's ludicrous self-importance. That said, Nabokov agrees with Kinbote that re-readings are important. In Lectures on Literature, he writes: When we read a book for the first time... the very process of
  learning in terms of space and time what the book is about, this
  stands between us and artistic appreciation.... In reading a book, we must have time to acquaint ourselves with it. We have no physical organ (as we have the eye in regard to painting) that takes in the whole picture and then can enjoy its details. But at a second, or third, or fourth reading we do, in a sense, behave towards a book as we do towards a painting. So regardless of in what order you read the work originally, Nabokov does expect you to re-read and re-explore it. And it is certainly the case that in these subsequent readings, Nabokov intends you to jump around, following his leads and cross-references. He built that kind of branching structure into Pale Fire intentionally. (It is clear from recurrent passages elsewhere in his oeuvre that Nabokov has an aesthetic preoccupation with this kind of branching structure.) Lastly, Nabokov does make a comment specifically about Pale Fire which might shed some light on your question. In this interview can be found the following exchange: INTERVIEWER: Mention of Swift moves me to ask about the genre of Pale Fire; as a ""monstrous semblance of a novel,"" do you see it in terms of some tradition or form?   VN: The form of Pale Fire is specifically, if not generically, new.  This response doesn't tell us much, but it does reveal that Nabokov conceived of Pale Fire as being of a new form: at the very least it is a new species of novel (if not a new genus of literature). Maybe the differentia of this species, in Nabokov's mind, is its non-linearity or hypertextuality."
"In Foucault's Pendulum, by what method does the translation choose to keep or translate Italian?","First, it's not true to assume that all foreign bits in Foucault's Pendulum were left untranslated in the English version: However, Latin is more familiar to Italian, French, Spanish, 
  Portuguese, or Rumanian readers than to Britons or Americans. For 
  this reason, Weaver, with my approval, sometimes shortened some 
  long quotations and nonchalantly inserted some English paraphrases. 
  It was a process of domestication that attempted to preserve some 
  archaic aspects of the text.  Umberto Eco, Experiences in Translation
(all unsourced quotes that follow are from the same piece) Let's also state that if Umberto Eco is well acquainted with his translations, he should not be considered as the author or even as ""approving"" his translations. When speaking about a remarkable German translation, he states: and 
  my contribution consisted not in providing an ‘authorized’ interpretation but 
  in encouraging an alternative solution - as if I were a co-translator.  Umberto Eco is much against statements of intent and helps his translators by emphasizing textual evidence rather than by imposing his own interpretation of his work. Reading another tribute by Eco out-rules another option: it was not either to keep the translation ""true to word"": He [William Weaver] was a great translator because he also knew that to translate the meaning, one must dare to reject the literal translation in order to conserve the effect or the deeper sense of the text. For reasons of space, I am limited to relating one amusing memory, of a time in which we tore the text apart in order to render a simple play on words, a wordplay that was already difficult for Italian readers. Umberto Eco, Ciao, Bill The same also gives us a credible explanation for the Italian words present in the text: he sought to accurately render the fluidity, the rhythm, the lexical richness, and the sound of the text Umberto Eco, Ciao, Bill But an explanation is not enough: we want to know when, not why Weaver chose to keep Italian words... I'm currently re-reading the great interviews Weaver gave to the Paris review in hope of finding something, but this is the closest I got: I start at page one, and I may even start at page one this time because I’m thinking about this problem all the time. Briefly, my modus operandi is simply to begin and work as fast as possible, leaving gaps. If there is a problem I will make a big parenthesis, indicating that I have left a sentence out. Or I will translate it and write, He was happy / glad / delighted / overjoyed, and decide later. If there’s something I don’t really understand I will leave it. I will type it in Italian and put it in boldface, so that when I see it I’ll know that it’s a real problem, which I’ll have to discuss with Eco. After having done this very rapid (i.e., in a month or two) first draft, I print it out; then I arm myself with a box of Ebony soft pencils and good erasers, and I go over it painstakingly with a pencil. I fill in the blanks, make the choices and change things. I have a big legal pad beside me and at the top is written, Ask Um; then I write: pg. 35; pg. 10; and the things I want to discuss with him. William Weaver, The Art of Translation n°3, Paris Review This makes for a very poor explanation on the finished work, however - given the extremely high quality of his translations, it's unlikely that they were left incomplete, so I don't consider this a finished answer. Rather, a commentary much too long to be published as such!"
What is a Daniel?,"The ""Daniel"" mentioned by the townsman in The Scarlet Letter refers to the Hebrew prophet Daniel. In Chapter 2 of the Biblical Book of Daniel, Nebuchadnezzar,  king of Babylon, says he has had a dream and wants it to be explained without saying what the dream was about ('The thing is gone from me', he claims): And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.
Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.
The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. In a sense, the king presents the Chaldeans with a riddle and they are unable to solve it. The dream is eventually revealed to Daniel in a vision and he both describes and explains the dream to Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 2, 19-45). Daniel interprets one of Nebuchadnezzar's other dreams in Chapter 4. Note that the Daniel reference in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, Act IV, scene 1 (see Rand al'Thor's answer), is not from the Book of Daniel, but the book of Ezekiel, chapter 28: Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee:
With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures: (...) In those lines from Shakespeare's play, Portia is compared to Daniel as a judge, not as a solver of riddles."
What is a Byronic Hero?,"Byronic heroes were based off of Lord Byron's epic poem Child Harold's Pilgrimage.
According to Lord Macaulay in Rupert Christiansen's Romantic Affinities: Portraits From an Age, 1780- 1830, this is a description: A man proud, moody, cynical, with defiance on his brow, and misery in his heart, a scorner of his kind, implacable in revenge, yet capable of deep and strong affection. Lord Byron later wrote other works with heroes of a similar mold and his influence was seen during the Romantic movement and lasts through to modern works as well (ie the Phantom in Phantom of the Opera)"
"Explain the 28 Feb 2022 Dilbert cartoon use of the phrase ""sticking the landing""","'Stick the landing' is from gymnastics, when people pull off a tricky move and land neatly on both feet, properly balanced and with a flourish of the arms that communicates 'I did exactly what I intended to do'. It's like a whole-body 'QED'. From Wiktionary stick the landing (third-person singular simple present sticks the landing, present participle sticking the landing, simple past and past participle stuck the landing) (sports) To complete a gymnastic or other athletic routine involving leaps, vaults, somersaults, etc. by landing firmly, solidly, and flawlessly on one's feet. (aviation, astronautics) To execute a flawless landing (of an aircraft, rocket, or space capsule). (idiomatic, by extension) To complete a process in an impressive and conclusive manner. So in context, the character in green (Who I am gratefully advised by @PatDobson is called ‘Wally’) wishes to spend the rest of his life as a coffee-swilling blob of organic matter. EDIT: I'm actively choosing not to address what the author may or may not have meant by referencing a DNA test. The test functions as the set up for the joke, and readers may bring whatever sub-text to the idea of DNA testing being used in the workplace according to their own world view without it affecting the joke."
"Why are Orcs associated with the colors red, yellow, and black in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings?","This isn’t coincidental. In Margaret Sinex’s fantastic paper titled “Monsterized Saracens, Tolkien’s Haradrim, and Other Medieval ‘Fantasy Products’” (appearing in the 2010 Volume 7 edition of the Tolkien Studies journal), she notes how these colors were used by medieval Europeans to depict Jews. To quote from Debra Strickland’s book Saracens, Demons, and Jews: Making Monsters in Medieval Art: Both yellow and red are colors that feature consistently in pejorative images of Jews, and both colors had contemporary associations with criminals and other social undesirables including Jews themselves once they were forced to wear the yellow badge of infamy in certain regions. Here’s an example of this from the Lorenzkirche (Church of St. Lawrence) in Germany. In this stained glass picture, several Jews are shown worshiping the golden calf (i.e. being idolatrous). Notice how one of the ways the figures are identified as Jewish is through their yellow hats and clothing. (For a more detailed analysis of this picture, consult Sinex’s paper or Strickland’s book).  Photograph by George P. Landow. Tolkien was a medievalist, so this is yet another example of him incorporating medieval literature and art into his writing. This answer was taken from my blog post on race in The Lord of the Rings."
What is the significance of Alec Bings's name in The Phantom Tollbooth?,"It’s noted in The Annotated Phantom Tollbooth (which I highly recommend to any fan- it's a really lovely book) published by Knopf/Random House in 2011; on page 106, annotation 10 reads: The annotations were done by Leonard Marcus, and he interviewed Juster, Feiffer, and their wives for the content of the annotated edition, according to the acknowledgements page at the back of the book."
Why were these animals used to represent the different countries in Maus?,"First of all, let me just point out two things which it may be useful to bear in mind when considering how seriously to take this answer: whether I'm overanalysing or underanalysing here. Firstly, some of the choices of animals are significant. It's not completely random; the author spent some considerable time thinking about which animals to use to represent certain groups, even to the extent of having specific reasons for rejecting some suggestions. From this blog post: At the very beginning of the second volume (page 9) Art is thinking about what species he should choose to depict his wife’s nation, the French. Francoise votes for a ‘bunny rabbit’ but Spiegelman dismisses the idea claiming that it is a choice too sweet and gentle for the French. This scene reassures me in my view that in Maus the animals chosen to represent the different nationalities are selected for a reason, and they are not mere results of an arbitrary pick. On the other hand, some of the choices don't really matter at all. For national or ethnic groups which played only a minor role in the story, the choice of animals used to represent them was much more arbitrary, because it didn't really matter at that point. As the author said: As the book was coming to a close, I really couldn’t have cared less about my metaphor, but I was stuck with it. People would ask me, “Oh, how would you draw us Italians?” and I as always stumped. I just had to deal with each of these issues as they came up, and it led to the whole sequence in Maus II of talking to Françoise about how to represent her. In a way I started reaching for the absurd to make sure one didn’t take the ruling metaphor at, um, “face” value. With that out of the way, let's start considering the different groups and their animal representations one by one. I'll go through them in approximate order of their importance to the story, so the choices of animals will become more arbitrary and less significant as we go on. Spiegelman has actually spoken about this in an interview, and told us what inspired him to create this depiction. It seems that as well as the cat-and-mouse allegory (about which more later), there has been a long tradition of portraying Jews as rats or mice in anti-Semitic works. The most shockingly relevant anti-Semitic work I found was The Eternal Jew, a 1940 German “documentary” that portrayed Jews in a ghetto swarming in tight quarters, bearded caftaned creatures, and then a cut to Jews as mice—or rather rats—swarming in a sewer, with a title card that said “Jews are the rats” or the “vermin of mankind.” This made it clear to me that this dehumanization was at the very heart of the killing project. In fact, Zyklon B, the gas used in Auschwitz and elsewhere as the killing agent, was a pesticide manufactured to kill vermin—like fleas and roaches. As I began to do more detailed and more finely grained research for the longer Maus project, I found how regularly Jews were represented literally as rats. Caricatures by Fips (the pen name of Philippe Rupprecht) filled the pages of Der Stürmer; grubby, swarthy, Jewish apelike creatures in one drawing, ratlike creatures in the next. Posters of killing the vermin and making them flee were part of the overarching metaphor. It’s amazing how often the image still comes up in anti-Semitic cartoons in Arab countries today. In the same interview, Spiegelman spoke about how the perceived grace and nobility of cats ties in to the supposed Aryan supremacy which was part of the Nazi German ideology: There was one rendering of a cat in full Nazi drag that looked sort of like Marlon Brando in The Young Lions. It was the most noble and savage version of the Nazis, tying into the stereotypes that presented Nazis as somehow sexy. It reminded me of the whole Night Porter genre of pornography that involved SS uniforms and scared me away from drawing Maus with really large-scale cats. Also, of course, as you've already noted, ""Jews as mice, Germans as cats"" can be seen as a symbolic representation of the Holocaust as a ""cat and mouse"" affair with the Germans hunting down the Jews. Interestingly, Spiegelman originally had this idea for an entirely different case of racism in a different continent: Ah, mice… Actually, it all started with me trying to draw black folks. [...] I wanted to do something in that melodramatic pulp illustration mode, complete with venetian blind shadows, but with animal faces in which the denouement would have the protagonist getting crushed to death by a giant mousetrap that snaps shut on his body. I made some sketches but I was floundering. A filmmaker I had become close friends with, Ken Jacobs, was teaching an introduction to cinema class. On this particular day, Ken showed a bunch of old racist animated cartoons from the silent and early sound era. The blacks were cheerfully represented as subhuman, monkeylike creatures with giant minstrel lips—stereotypes stealing chickens, stealing watermelons, playing dice, all singin’ & dancin’, just the daily stock in trade of our racist cartoon heritage. …it all led me to my Eureka moment: the notion that I could do a strip about the black experience in America, using an animated cartoon style. I could draw Ku Klux Kats and an underground railroad and some story about racism in America. [...] After my self-excoriating doubts settled in, I realized that this cat-mouse metaphor of oppression could actually apply to my more immediate experience. This development took me by surprise—my own childhood was not a subject for me. But I did realize that if I shifted from Ku Klux Kats and anthropomorphized “darkies” to the terrain I was more viscerally affected by, the Nazis chasing Jews as they had in my childhood nightmares, I was on to something. It became my three-page contribution to Funny Aminals. Calling the French frogs is actually a long-running thing, at least in Britain. I've always assumed this is due to the French practice of eating frogs (many derogatory nationalist terms are based on cultural delicacies: the French are frogs, the Germans are krauts, the British are roast-beefs, and so on.) According to the Racial Slur Database (TIL this is a thing): The French are said to laugh like frogs. When they laugh, their adam's apples bulge out of their necks like frogs. Also perhaps from the French delicacy of frog-legs. Another possible derivation is the Fleur-de-Lys displayed on the French king's banner in the Middle Ages, which, to the English enemy, looked like squatting frogs. UK origins. This is a deep and sticky quagmire to get into. Many critics have condemned Spiegelman for his portrayal of Poles as pigs, accusing him of racism against the Polish people. Entire academic papers have been written on this issue. In an effort to keep it short, I'll quote just from this 82-page article entitled ""Poles as Pigs in MAUS"": Portraying Poles as pigs is offensive. In fact, it has been acknowledged as such by literary critics. In the biographical introduction to the excerpt from MAUS that appears in The Norton Anthology of American Literature, 7th edition (New York: Norton, 2007), Volume E, p. 3091, editors Jerome Klinkowitz and Patricia B. Wallace describe Spiegelman’s representation of Poles as pigs as “a calculated insult” leveled against Poles. A similar point was made by Harvey Pekar, a celebrated underground comic book write, who describes himself as a Jew with a background similar to Art Spiegelman’s: “When he [Spiegelman] shows them [Poles] doing something admirable and still portrays them as pigs, he’s sending a mixed message.”
​
Characteristically, Spiegelman has dismissed Poles’ concern about their depiction as pigs as “a squeal,” the sound pigs make. The pig imagery or “metaphor,” on the other hand, is rarely, if ever, explained – whether in MAUS itself, or in available reading materials. One handout provided to students states that the animals have a “symbolic quality,” without any further explanation of the role of the pigs.
​
“You pig,” is universally considered to be an insult. In many cultures, pigs are viewed as disgusting, filthy, and greedy animals. They are often considered to be vulgar and stupid. The implication, therefore, is that there is something unsavoury about the pig people. This is one obvious negative connotation that would not be lost on the students, especially since that image is reinforced by the negative stereotypes used to portray Poles, who even manage to remain fat while imprisoned in Auschwitz. For Jews and Muslims, pigs are “unclean” animals. Jewish culture in particular views pigs, and pork, as non­kosher, or unclean. [...] It is telling that Spiegelman chose this supremely un­kosher animal to depict the Poles, rather than the Germans. Unfortunately, the image of Poles as being “unclean” has a long and shameful tradition. In Poland, when a Jew wanted to insult a Pole, he called him a “Polish pig.” [...] Polish inmates of Nazi camps were often called “Polish swine” by German officials and kapos (prisoner functionaries). Poles are also referred to as “pigs” in Jewish memorial books.
​
MAUS employs the same imagery of the Poles as found in Nazi propaganda, where Poles were often referred to as “pigs.” Art Spiegelman was, of
course, aware of these problematic associations when he chose to portray Poles as pigs. Apparently Spiegelman has even admitted that bias against Poles played a role in his choice of the animal used to represent them. Quoting from the same article: In MetaMaus: A Look Inside a Modern Classic, Maus (New York:
Pantheon, 2011), belatedly, Spiegelman divulges his actual reasons for portraying Poles as pigs: it is to bash Poles. With reference to his father’s attitude towards Poles, he quips, “So my metaphor [mice to be killed outright, and pigs to be exploited and eaten] was somehow able to hold that particular vantage point while still somehow acknowledging my father’s dubious opinion of Poles as a group.” (P. 122.) Despite the fact that Poland had for centuries given sanctuary to Jews persecuted elsewhere, Spiegelman adds: “‘And considering the bad relations between Poles and Jews for the last hundred years in Poland, it seemed right to use a non­-Kosher animal.’” (P. 125.) This could again be interpreted as tying into the symbolism of the ""cat and mouse"" game of Germans and Jews. In the end, the American dogs come and chase away the cats to rescue the mice. Although there's not much love lost between dogs and mice in real life, the enmity between dogs and cats is real enough, and could represent the war between Americans and Germans. Again, an interview with Spiegelman seems to confirm this: Turning again to my simpleminded ur-text of American popular culture: cats chase mice, and dogs, by God, chase cats – it’s a direct food chain. [...] But dogs were easy; it’s almost the Family Feud answer to what animals come to mind and how do you perceive them. The dogs were heroic vanquisher of cats, so there was that. besides, as soon as you’re a cartoonist drawing a dog, you’ve got lots of different kinds of dogs to draw. You’ve got Collies and Dachshunds and Cocker Spaniels and Chihuahuas and their species or sub-species are much more clearly delineated than cats, even though cat fanciers will say otherwise. Here, the fact that there were so many possible dogs got me to actually verbalize to myself: “Oh, I get it. Americans are a mongrel race, a bunch of mutts.” Bill Mauldin’s panel cartoons of Willie and Joe – the “dogfaces” of World War II as GIs were called – came to mind as soon as I started trying to figure out what it might mean to draw a dog in an army uniform. Well, for one thing, they're gypsy moths, so even the name fits. Also, moths fit with an imagery of itinerancy - flitting from place to place, but never stopping for long - which makes them a reasonable choice to symbolise gypsies. Also, Spiegelman has a story about where the inspiration came from for this: I vividly remember drawing the sequence where my mother went to see a fortune-teller – I was in a small cabin, deep in the woods of Connecticut that summer. I prefer to work at night when I can, and these giant moths kept flinging themselves against the glass, trying to get in. Most of them looked like casting calls for Mothra. They were insane and enormous. I got really fascinated by what their faces looked like. And it was at precisely the moment I was trying to figure out how to draw the gypsy, so it was preordained that I’d use gypsy moths. By this point, we're getting to nationalities which are less important to the story, and their choices of animal are becoming more arbitrary. But here's what Spiegelman said; take it with a pinch of salt if you like: When Vladek looks for Anja after the war, he goes to a large displaced persons center at Belsen. The British are in charge of that camp. I guess I could have avoided the whole issue since they just appear in the mise-en-scène for a panel or two, but I decided to give the Brits a walk-on part – or, as it finally resolved itself, a swim-on part. I thought about fish and chips, an island culture, fish out of water. All those things just seemed to lead me toward drawing fish without bicycles but with jeeps. There are plenty of reindeer in Sweden. I'm not sure if there's any deeper meaning than that. The author doesn't have much to say about it either: Sweden was quite welcoming to refugees after the war. I thought of the Swedes as somehow far outside the loop of my Eastern European narrative and finding an animal so totally out of the scale with mice, cats, and mutts – those large galumphing and gentle reindeer – struck me as amusing. All bold emphasis is mine in the quotes above."
What were the parts of each of the six Seuss books that ceased publication in March 2021 that were problematic?,"The decision seems to have been made primarily because the books contained stereotyped, caricatured characters of color. This answer was sourced mainly from Rethinking Dr. Seuss for NEA's Read Across America Day and Here are the 'wrong' illustrations that got six Dr. Seuss books cancelled. Between the two you can see most of the objectionable images. The first article examined Dr. Seuss's top 50 books and is well worth the read. It found that 2% (or 45/2240) of the human characters were non-white and 100% of those depictions were racist. It also covers the context of Seuss's life before he became a children's author. Now, here's some mental insecticide."
Do we know what prompted Orwell to write 1984?,"George Orwell feared totalitarianism. He wanted to fight it and the book reads as a (dire) warning. There is at least one letter by his hand that goes into this in detail. ""I must say I believe, or fear, that taking the world as a whole these things are on the increase."" He saw nationalistic initiatives being on the rise due to the pressures and atrocities of WW2 and while he was confident Hitler would go, and soon too, he feared that even fighting fascism would lead to the waning and eventual end of truth and democracy. ""But if the sort of world that I am afraid of arrives, a world of two or three great superstates which are unable to conquer one another, two and two could become five if the fuhrer wished it.""

  This body dropt not down. [...] And a thousand thousand slimy things

Could you actually go around the world in 80 days?,"Circumnavigation was nothing new. Speedy circumnavigation was new, but not unheard of, and Around the World wasn't positing anything outlandish or even vaguely sci-fi. It's a story celebrating what the British Empire had already accomplished, not postulating what might be possible in the future. Verne himself claims to have been inspired by an early 1860s newspaper item which said that a man could in fact go around the world in 80 days and someone had done so already. Verne's claim is probably not precisely true, but whether it's an error of his memory or of the newspaper item we can't know—see verbose's answer for speculation on what article he might have read. People had been circumnavigating the globe for centuries—the first known successful attempt was in the early 1500s and the feat was repeated several times in the following three hundred years. Circumnavigations became both more common and faster in the 1800s. Thomas Cook ran a leisurely circumnavigation group tour in 1872, a few months before Around the World was published.
Around the World opens with a discussion of just how trivial circumnavigation had become for a man with sufficient resources, and Verne isn't exaggerating (see above). Recent global infrastructure improvements also meant the world was ripe for speedy circumnavigation: In 1870 George Train made the journey in 80 days (minus two months spent in France; his 80-day record is just counting the travel time). It was ridiculously expensive to go around the world quickly, but given sufficient money the big obstacle was unrest in the areas one traveled rather than the speed of one's mode of travel (again, reflected relatively accurately—albeit sensationally—in the novel). Sixteen years after Around the World was published, Nellie Bly and Elizabeth Bisland competed on behalf of the Cosmopolitan and the New York World to see who could do the circumnavigation faster. There was no question that they could do it. Both met with hardship on the way, but each beat the semi-fictional 80-day record: Bly did it in 72 days, Bisland in 76; the difference was largely a matter of which newspaper was willing to spend more money on the stunt. (For more information on both women, I recommend Jason Porath's excellent Rejected Princesses.) A few months later George Train did it again and hit 67 days, then beat his own record a third time with 60 days in 1892. The popularity of Around the World, then, was more about the reputation and skill of the author and his depiction of the dangers encountered on the journey, than about the feasibility of the feat itself. The deadline lent extra urgency to the dangers the characters encountered. It's also worth noting that Around the World celebrates the technological marvels and political influence of the world-spanning British Empire. It flatters the British pride, and that certainly didn't hurt its popularity."
Why doesn't James Joyce ever use quotation marks?,"James Joyce preferred dashes to quotation marks for aesthetic reasons. He even went so far as to call quotation marks ""perverted commas"". He remarks on his dislike of quotation marks at various places in his correspondences: I think the fewer the quotation marks the better.... The ‘ ’ are to be used only in the case of a quotation in full dress, I think, i.e., when it is used to prove or to contradict or to show &c. (Letters of James Joyce, Vol. I, p. 263) and Then Mr. Cape and his printers gave me trouble [with A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]. They set the book with perverted commas and I insisted on their removal by the sergeant-at-arms. (Letters of James Joyce, Vol. III, p. 99) These passages are recorded here."
"Does ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" glorify war or criticize it?","Throughout the poem, we see exaltation of the soldiers for their bravery. They are described as brave, bold, and having ""fought so well"". However, the second stanza reveals that the poem's writer considered the charge a farce: Not tho' the soldier knew
  Some one had blunder'd:
  Theirs not to make reply,
  Theirs not to reason why,
  Theirs but to do & die, The poem describes the act as charging ""Into the jaws of Death, Into the mouth of Hell "" and describes the reaction to the charge as all the world wondering. This shows a disdain for the commands leading to the charge.  "
"How to read é, ä, û?","Tolkien answers these questions in the appendices of the physical copies of many of the original books. (Some editions of the books don't include the pronunciation guides, but most do.) A more detailed pronunciation guide, however, appears in the back of the Silmarillion, which was kindly reproduced by this blogger. You can also find some more details on the Tolkien Gateway.  Your specific questions, answered: You're correct about the dieretic marks. They split words into two syllables around a vowel pair. However, more generally, you should read dipthongs - especially in Elvish - this way, even without this mark; the mark is largely for convenience. Eärendil, believe it or not, is occasionally spelled Ëarendil - they're the same. û is pronounced as in boom, as you've listed in your question; however, it extends the sound. Think, ""NAZ-goo-ool,"" instead of ""NAZ-gool,"" and you'd be close to the right sound. (It's not perfect, because it doesn't actually split into two syllables like that, but it's closer to that length.) Sméagol is actually pronounced somewhat incorrectly in the movies. The 'é' sound has more of an ""ay"" than an ""ee,"" and as it's a dipthong, it also splits into two syllables. Where the movies say ""SMEE-gul,"" it should really be something more like ""SMAY-ah-gol."" And, as with the û in Nazgûl, the vowel is slightly extended. However, it's not extended quite as much as û.  Useful for reading the above reasources: if you're familiar with IPA: e is [ɛ], é is [ɛː], and ê is [ɛːː]. Each ""ː"" adds a little bit of extension; a ""::"" feels almost, but not quite, like two syllables."
In which order should the Sherlock Holmes stories be read?,"Begin your Holmesian adventure with short stories from The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. Continue with the early novels before moving on to the later short stories. End with The Valley of Fear and then The Hound of the Baskervilles, to see Holmes (and Doyle) at his finest. The order is, for the most part, chronological. The classic Holmesian tale involves elements of deduction from seemingly nonexistent details, whether they be a piece of fabric or a burn mark. To understand the way Sherlock Holmes thinks, you need to read one of these to catch a glimpse of his methodology. Holmes is not just a man; he is a character for study, and his depth is what puts Doyle above so many other writers in detective fiction. He's inscrutable, irrepressible, and always unpredictable, and you cannot just pick up, say, The Hound of the Baskervilles and understand the complete persona of Sherlock Holmes. The short stories are, of course, the best place to start. In 20 or so pages, you can see an example of the sleuth's mind and personality, while getting to used to observing him work, through Watson. While there's no typical story, I'd recommend starting with one from The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. A Case of Identity would be my pick, as it begins with some marvelous deductions by Holmes and ends with a resolution nobody could have seen coming - yet at that point, you see the pieces fall into place as clear as day. You might be tempted to start with the story published first in that collection, A Scandal in Bohemia. Don't. It is an outlier in the Holmesian saga, an unusual and compelling tale that I think is best appreciated only after you get to know the detective. It shows parts of his personality that are only rarely apparent elsewhere - love, even - and involves a case unlike any other. It is atypical, and while it might interest you, I'd recommend starting with something more ordinary. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes are rather similar in style, I feel, and so the stories can be read in various orders. There is extremely little overall plot change within them, and while in a certain story Holmes may reference past cases, they are largely self-contained. Doyle's style is roughly constant, if memory serves. This collection can be picked up and put down at any point. I would, however, advise reading The Final Problem last out of all of them - for continuity's sake - as you acknowledged in the question. It is perhaps one of the most important short stories in the initial arc. I also happen to like reading The Adventure of the Naval Treaty directly before this, because I love it, but it's not mandatory. After a while, you may get bored. Each short story will challenge you, but the format can get tiresome after 24 of them. I encourage you to try one of the longer standalone works. I would prefer A Study in Scarlet or The Sign of the Four, which go into Holmes' methodology in more detail and present a story arc - which you don't see as much in any of the short stories. Both of these books were published before any of the short stories, but they can be challenging to slog through. I'd wait until you're comfortable with the style before going on to these. I suggest mixing them in after reading perhaps ten or twelve short stories - or earlier, if you want. But read them in one sitting. Do not start one and then go back to the short stories. Confusion may follow. I also happen to think that there are many cases where reading a book from start to finish is the best way to appreciate it, and this is one of those times. Note: Re-read The Final Problem, to refamiliarize yourself with it and see how the arc it begins evolves into the next series. Doyle, feeling extreme pressure by fans, brought Holmes back from the dead after killing him off - in a fashion many may know about, but which I'm not going to reveal. He eventually published The Return of Sherlock Holmes, another series of short stories. In my mind, these are worse than the original two collections (after all, there was an 11-year gap between this and the originals!). They feel forced, and the plots get ever more intricate, astonishing, sensational and, quite frankly, hard to believe. I find some unsatisfying; at any rate, I can tell the difference in style. Try to read these 13 together, as a group (start with The Adventure of the Empty House, Holmes' return). Don't mix them in with the other two collections; there's just something wrong. Maybe others disagree. At any rate, quality aside, I do feel like The Return of Sherlock Holmes was written with suspense in mind, not the pure intellectual investigation. My same criticism holds for His Last Bow and The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes. However, I don't remember them all as clearly as I remember the first three series. First, read The Valley of Fear. It's likely my least favorite of the four novels - again, I think suspense plays a bigger role than pure mystery - but it's still worth a read. I'd recommend reading it last, so you keep a rough chronological order for the novels, but I think it lacks a sense of closure. Finish off your Holmesian adventure with The Hound of the Baskervilles. Doyle wrote this to fight off the clamor of fans when Holmes was ""dead"", and so it was a throwback, in a sense, but it is quite self-contained. Doyle creates a unique cast of characters - none too hard to believe, in fact - and keeps suspense and intellectual mystery in a good balance. It does have a sense of closure, which The Valley of Fear does not, even though it is not part of the larger canon. It can be read apart from everything else, of course, but you really should know Holmes, in all his full glory, to appreciate his struggles in this book. So, here's my recommendations: This is somewhat chronological - which makes some sense; I think Doyle's best work was at the beginning."
Did Shakespeare consider Julius Caesar a tyrant or a martyr?,"It is left open by the playwright I am going to look at the three characters you have chosen, starting with Cassius.  Cassius is not an honorable man no matter whether you think Caesar should have died or not. Here is a quote of him trying to use his power to free a friend. That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
  You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
  For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
  Because I knew the man, were slighted off. His main fault with Caesar is not that he is a dictator, but that he is above him in power. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
  Like a Colossus, and we petty men
  Walk under his huge legs and peep about
  To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
  Men at some time are masters of their fates:
  The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
  But in ourselves, that we are underlings. Brutus is the opposite of Cassius, he is completely honorable. The reason he killed Caesar was he thought it would be best for Rome, and thus his duty. He is often considered the protagonist of this play, as he sees the most time and gains the most character development. I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
  But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
  What is it that you would impart to me?
If it be aught toward the general good,
  Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
  And I will look on both indifferently,
  For let the gods so speed me as I love
  The name of honour more than I fear death. His death even reflects the honorable Roman way of suicide, while also expressing regret over his part in Caesar's death. Farewell, good Strato.
  ""Runs on his sword""
Caesar, now be still:
  I kill'd not thee with half so good a will. Caesar does not appear very often in the play, it focuses mostly on Brutus. Shakespeare focuses less on whether he is a dictator or not and instead focuses on his arrogance, mainly by having him dress himself in third person. (Caesar did this..... Caesar said that). He also allows himself to be persuaded against his better judgement to go to the senate on March 15. 'Break up the senate till another time,
  When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
  'Lo, Caesar is afraid'? And that works really well. The opening scene is a good example for those who think he is a dictator, as it revolves around two senators griping. The people seemed to have loved Caesar, as Antony uses them to drive the conspirators away and to regain control of the city.  Brutus was trying to be a freedom fighter, and Cassius was greedy. Since Brutus was the protagonist of the story, he had to doubt Caesar's speech (if Caesar were just a dictator, he would have run him out with no problems, and thus would have no inner conflict), which means that the audience was given both Caesar the dictator, and Caesar the friend. Both examples of Caesar can be found in the scene I mentioned earlier with his wife and Decius Brutus. At first Caesar is adamant in going (note the third person) The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
Caesar should be a beast without a heart,
  If he should stay at home to-day for fear.
  No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well
  That Caesar is more dangerous than he:
  We are two lions litter'd in one day,
  And I the elder and more terrible:
  And Caesar shall go forth. He then is convinced to stay home (note the first person) Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
  And, for thy humour, I will stay at home. And then is convinced agin to leave by Decius's ego poking. 'Break up the senate till another time,
  When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
  'Lo, Caesar is afraid'? Here is an example of Antony speaking in Caesar's praise. It may be a little biased, but the facts are true enough that the crowd rallies around it. When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
  Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: Not to mention the strong feelings Antony felt at Caesar's death (the dog of war speech). Caesar was a good enough man for him to be loved by both Antony and Brutus."
"Why does Shakespeare's Julius Caesar switch to Latin for the ""Et tu, Brute"" line?","Whether the historical Caesar pronounced or not the said words is disputed. Of five Antique sources on Caesar's death: There is debate as to why Caesar would have switched to Greek for this admonition but as every Roman in the upper circles, Caesar was probably raised in a Greek-speaking environment before learning Latin, and this can be interpreted as a regression to the language of his childhood. The fact that no ancient sources report the quote in Latin has lead the French and Italian versions to retain another translation, Tu quoque mi fili, probably coined by Lhomond in the 18th century, which brings us to why Shakespeare used another translation of the quote to Latin, Et tu, Brute, in his masterpiece. Mixing Latin and vernacular language was a widespread practice in Medieval Europe. Latin was still the language of scholars and clerics, while vernacular language was taking the spot gradually, so mixing both languages would not have shocked an educated audience in the 14th century. But Shakespeare worked later, and his inclusion of a Latin hemistich was probably motivated by style consideration, mimicking a practice that came to life in 15th century Italy where poets would alternate verses in Italian and Latin. It was probably considered fashionable by Shakespeare to include some Latin at climactic moments of his plays, you can find a list in the article Latin on ShakespearesWords.com. Shakespeare himself used it (in Latin) in Henry VI and Richard Edes features it in Caesar Interfectus in 1582 (17 years before the play we're discussing), which hints toward the fact that the sentence was probably often quoted in the context of similar fates for those that reach power before being used in the play. The audience, I would say, would have been expecting the line and waiting for it rather than shocked by its appearance. Being ""true to life"" is by no means one of the objectives of Shakespeare's plays, or at least not being constantly true to life. Alternating between ghosts and lively maid scenes was the man's genius, and realism should definitely not be judged in this case using modern standards."
Translation: Why are parts of the original language kept?,"The purpose of keeping parts of the source langue no-translated, or using some variant or dialect of the target language for some elements (eg: dialog, a  specific character talk, ...), depends on the work, its creators (author, translator), and the languages involved. But, here is some general reasons and uses that I can think of: The original text, is based on a cultural reference that doesn't have an equivalent in the destination language the text represent a title. or an honorific (cf. Japanese honorifics) it's a location name. it is a maxim a motto, or a proverb. e.g: ""Carpe Diem"", ""Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno"", or:  “...L’amour fait les égalités, et ne les cherche pas."" -- The Red and the Black, Stendhal (Henri Beyle), translated by Charles Tergie it hold a mythological, spiritual, or religious meaning e.g: ""chants"" and ""prayer"", are rarely translated. the text is constituted of poem verses, it is a poetic prose, or it sound way more elegant in its source language. e.g:  ‘Vous qui pleurez un passé plein de charmes, Et qui traînez des jours
  infortunés, Tous vos malheurs se verront terminés, Quand à Dieu seul
  vous offrirez vos larmes, Vous qui pleurez!’ -- The-Three-Musketeers the original text is in a variant of the source language other than the standard one,  e.g: countryside language or a spoken unofficial language. the author or translator opted for this trope:  Bilingual Bonus: A hidden message in a foreign language. This ostensibly makes these
  messages available only to bilingual and international audiences. The
  extra can be anything from a plot-relevant point to additional
  dialogue to a random gag. -- tvtropes"
"In 1984, why does O'Brien expect Winston to know what Room 101 is?","Initially, Winston has no idea what room 101 is. However, because Winston realizes how people would rather die than go to room 101, O'Brien expects Winston to think the worst possible torture appartus was contained within the room. For each person, this worst form of torture would be different, and so for Winston, O'Brien expected Winston to believe room 101 was filled with rats.  Although Orwell paints Winston as not knowing what is in room 101, I'd say that subconsciously at least, Winston knew what he would meet in room 101 (even if he didn't say it out loud to O'Brien)."
What specific criticisms did Mark Twain make against Jane Austen's books?,"She [Jane Austen] makes me detest all her people, without reserve. Is that her intention? It is not believable. Then is it her purpose to make the reader detest her people up to the middle of the book and like them in the rest of the chapters? That could be. That would be high art. It would be worth while, too. Some day I will examine the other end of her books and see. Quote from: here He hates all her characters because of a specific reason: they don't feel believable.   Twain also criticized other classic authors, such as James Fenimore Cooper, saying he committed “114 offenses against literary art out of a possible 115” (from here).  Maybe Mark Twain was just a weirdo, or maybe he had some legitimate complaint with Jane Austen's characters and their believability.  On the same site we see this quote: “To start with, they say she draws her characters with sharp discrimination and a sure touch. I believe that this is true, as long as the characters she is drawing are odious.” I think he truly, actually, thought that Jane Austen's characters were one-sided and not believable enough to be good."
What is a Pooh?,"1) According to When We Were Very Young By A. A. Milne, Pooh was a swan that Christopher Robin named Pooh, so that if he didn't come Christopher could pretend he was just saying that he hadn't wanted the swan to come anyways (or something to that effect).  This was before the establishment of Winnie the Pooh proper, so it may be considered invalid. 2) As said in the comments, the first chapter of Winnie the Pooh says this: But his arms were so stiff ... they stayed up straight in the air for more than a week, and whenever a fly came and settled on his nose he had to blow it off. And I think — but I am not sure — that that is why he is always called Pooh. This probably refers to the sound blowing a fly off one's nose makes, namely a sort of poohing sound.  This is the author's explanation in universe."
Has a book ever been translated in its own fictional language?,"The closest I've seen is A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess, whose first-person narrator, Alex, narrates the entire novel in NadSat. Nadsat isn't a distinct fictional language, as you ask for, but it is a fictional argot invented by Burgess. Here's a representative quote from Goodreads, which is clearly readable but not fully comprehensible to an English speaker: That's what it's going to be then, brothers, as I come to the like end of this tale. You have been everywhere with your little droog Alex, suffering with him, and you have viddied some of the most grahzny bratchnies old Bog ever made, all on to your old droog Alex. And all it was was that I was young. But now as I end this story, brothers, I am not young, not no longer, oh no. Alex like groweth up, oh yes. But where I itty now, O my brothers, is all on my oddy knocky, where you cannot go. Tomorrow is all like sweet flowers and the turning young earth and the stars and the old Luna up there and your old droog Alex all on his oddy knocky seeking like a mate. And all that cal. A terrible grahzny vonny world, really, O my brothers. And so farewell from your little droog. And to all others in this story profound shooms of lipmusic brrrrrr. And they can kiss my sharries. But you, O my brothers, remember sometimes thy little Alex that was. Amen. And all that call. In-universe, Nadsat is Russian-inflected cockney slang spoken amongst teenagers in the novel's dystropian future England. Out-of-universe, Wikipedia says that Burgess ""knew that if he used modes of speech that were contemporarily in use, the novel would very quickly become dated. His use of Nadsat was essentially pragmatic; he needed his narrator to have a unique voice that would remain ageless while reinforcing Alex's indifference to his society's norms, and to suggest that youth subculture existed independently of the rest of society."""
"Why are all the schoolchildren referred to as guns in Clint Smith's ""The Gun""?","The use of ""gun"" as a noun to refer to all the children in the school serves three linked purposes. Initially it purposefully confuses the reader as to what's happening in the poem, while ensuring that the focus is on guns. The opening of the gun heard the first shot Is a deliberate obfuscation. How can a gun hear itself? It isn't until we get to the gun’s teacher told everyone to get on the ground That's there's any clarity as to what this poetic device is doing, and it may be a couple more lines before it's completely clear to the reader. By doing this, the reader's confusion mimics the confusion of a child in the initial stages of the shooting while ensuring the focus of both their thoughts is on guns. This latter effect is the second and central thrust of this device. Through the entire poem the reader cannot forget, even for a moment, that a gun is the centerpiece of this event, just as those trapped in a shooting cannot forget that either. Finally, it also helps to bring home the political subtext of the poem about the danger of guns and the need for gun control, demonstrated by the later references to ""thoughts and prayers"" and ""second amendment"". Through the repetition of the word ""gun' the reader is not allowed to forget that without the presence of the gun, this terrifying tragedy would not be happening. The poet has used this device because it is simple and highly effective. By using ""gun"" as the noun in place of ""child"" or a gendered alternative the poet can get this effect of repetition without burdening the poem with clumsy language to mention a gun in every line,  diluting its direct impact. It also makes it easy to keep the poem in the first person, heightening the reader's empathy with the child experiencing this event. This is an extreme example of a poetic technique called anaphora. Merriam-Webster defines it as: repetition of a word or expression at the beginning of successive phrases, clauses, sentences, or verses especially for rhetorical or poetic effect"
"What's the deal with Bilbo being some kind of ""burglar""?","I've always interpreted that as 'being stealthy', not as 'being good at stealing'. Hobbits are nimble creatures (they're even described as being able to seemingly disappear without a trace), especially compared to dwarves which are much louder. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. (Chapter 1, An Unexpected Party) Bilbo's value to the party is not being a good fighter; rather, he has a unique skill (which becomes even better after finding the Ring). A skill necessary for the dwarves' mission to succeed, because they can't take the object they're looking for,  the Arkenstone, in possession of the dragon Smaug by brute force. Anyway, they all seem to understand that he's not a thief but an honorable person; this is what one of the dwarves says in Chapter 1: “Yes, yes, but that was long ago,” said Gloin. “I was talking about you. And I assure you there is a mark on this door—the usual one in the trade, or used to be. Burglar wants a good job, plenty of Excitement and reasonable Reward, that’s how it is usually read. You can say Expert Treasure-hunter instead of Burglar if you like. Some of them do. It’s all the same to us. As for your side-question, The Hobbit was written at a time when Tolkien's ideas about Middle Earth weren't as fleshed out yet. Also, it was intended as a children's book, so perhaps he didn't include much details on purpose and left it to his readers' imagination. The journey to Rivendell was not without danger (see the trolls they meet in the second chapter) but it makes a lot of difference if you do it with thirteen battle-hardened adventurers and a (for a hobbit) experienced traveler versus four young, slightly naïve hobbits, even if they were halfway met by Strider/Aragorn. And Black Riders weren't a problem for Bilbo and the dwarves."
"Story where professor claims a step in a proof ""is obvious"" when it is far from obvious","This is a well-known piece of mathematical folklore that has been “told about most teachers of any great reputation” (Norman Beers, quoted below) and so we cannot take seriously any particular assignment, whether to Wiener as in the question, or to Hardy as suggested by Lazerowitz (quoted below). The earliest printed versions of the tale that I was able to find are from 1950, but both Norman Beers and R. B. Kershner make it clear that by this date the story was already a popular piece of oral folklore. Possibly earlier versions had different wording, making them hard for me to trace. The most obvious of the many reasons why we cannot agree that secrecy is obviously necessary is illuminated by a story told about most teachers of any great reputation, especially in mathematics and in mathematical physics. For, like the student who asked Professor Jones, “Is the answer to that (partial differential equation) really obvious?,” we sincerely do not understand the reasons for the assertion. And we, like the student, are not helped if the Professor requires to be excused from the classroom and given the balance of the lecture period in his private office before returning to the class with a flat, “Yes. It is obvious.” Norman R. Beers (1950). ‘The Atomic Industry and Human Ecology’. Nucleonics 6:5 (May 1950), p. 22–3. There is a story that G. H. Hardy passed over a step in the proof of a mathematical theorem he was lecturing on to his class with the comment, “This is obvious”. His students objected that it was not obvious to them, and asked for the explanation. Hardy, who apparently was taken aback by the objection, left the lecture room to look over the omitted step and after a few minutes’ deliberation returned and announced to the class, “Yes, it is obvious. We shall go on.” Morris Lazerowitz (1950). ‘Strong and Weak Verification II’. Mind 59:235 (July 1950), p. 345. A professor lecturing to a graduate class said, “This is obvious—or is it?” then went into his office and returned after 30 minutes and continued, “Yes, it is obvious.” Charles K. Robbins (1950). ‘Mathematical Miscellany’. In Mathematics Magazine 24:2 (November–December 1950), p. 115. Now the word “obvious” is a rather dangerous one. There is an incident, which has become something of a legend in mathematical circles, that illustrates this danger. A certain famous mathematician was lecturing to a group of students and had occasion to use a formula which he wrote down the remark, “This statement is obvious.” Then he paused and looked rather hesitantly at the formula. “Wait a moment,” he said. “Is it obvious? I think it’s obvious.” More hesitation, and then, “Pardon me, gentlemen, I shall return.” Then he left the room. Thirty-five minutes later he returned; in his hand was  was a sheaf of papers covered with calculations, on his face a look of quiet satisfaction. “I was right, gentlemen. It is obvious,” he said, and proceeded with his lecture. R. B. Kershner (1950). The Anatomy of Mathematics, p. 77. New York: Ronald Press."
Is a moral lesson a requirement for fairy tales?,"No. Some fairy tales don't have morals, and lots that do have morals that aren't that useful.  For instance, the Grimm brothers wrote many amoral stories, and many (not just the Grimm's) are believed to be jabs at the government or royalty at the time. (Possible)* Examples: Snow White is based on Margarete von Waldeck, a girl with a horrible relationship with her stepmother, from Germany in a town where children (""dwarves"") were exploited in the coal mines. Cinderella is based on Rhodopis, and the story of Cinderella goes back well before the fairy tale. Rhodopis was a slave, Charaxus fell in love with her, and bought her freedom. He received an angry poem from his sister. Dick Whittington and His Cat is based on Richard Whittington who became a successful textile trader, who had a cat. See this image. Hansel and Gretel could be based on the famine of 1315-1317, or it could be based on the story of Katharina Schraderin, a baker who in the 1600s, made a ginger bread cookie so nice that a jealous male baker accused her of being a witch. She was driven from town but angry neighbors brought her back to her home, and burned her to death in her own oven. The Pied Piper of Hamelin could actually be a true story in itself. The story is set in 1284. The town of Hamelin actually exists, and there are records of 1300 AD of a stained glass window in the church showing a piper leading children out the village. At the time, stained glass windows were a way of showing current events and remembering them. There is also a manuscript from 1440/50 AD that says that in 1284, in the town of Hamelin, 130 children were taken away by a piper and never heard of again. Although there are no rats mentioned, there could have been a rat infestation at the time, and the stories could have been merged. As for why the children were taking away, there are several theories. The rats could represent a plague that killed the children, the piper could have been a paedophile or murderer that took the children, or maybe just a child trafficker. These examples show that fairy tales weren't written to have a moral that children could learn, but storied of real life events. * - These are suspicions that haven't and cannot be proved"
"If Tolkien disliked allegory, why are there so many allegorical readings of The Lord of the Rings?","It was an allegory because, in spite of his dislike, Tolkien felt it was necessary and inevitable that it should be one. In several lesser-known quotes, the author freely admits that the tale is allegorical. Most clearly he states: ""Of course my story is not an allegory of Atomic power, but of Power."" The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien #186 He also claims it is a religious work which, given that it has no connection to any real-life religion, can only be true if it can be read as an allegory of religion. ""The Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work, unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision."" The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien #142 So how do we square this circle? The first is that another quote from Tolkien shows that he believed all myth was fundamentally allegorical in nature. Since one of his key purposes in constructing the legendarium around Lord of the Rings was to rebuild a lost English mythology it would be difficult for him not to write an allegory if this was his belief. ""I dislike Allegory - the conscious and intentional allegory - yet any
attempt to explain the purport of myth or fairytale must use
allegorical language."" The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien #131 He also believed that it was, to some extent, inevitable in the work of any author because it would surface through the subconscious. Or to put it another way, that allegory in literature was a failure only if it was created deliberately. ""The only perfectly consistent allegory is a real life; and the only
fully intelligible story is an allegory. And one finds, even in
imperfect human 'literature', that the better and more consistent an
allegory is the more easily it can be read 'just as a story'; and the
better and more closely woven a story is the more easily can those so
minded find allegory in it."" The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien #109 So what are we to make of this in relation to The Lord of the Rings? His admission that the book was an allegory of power, while denying that it is one of atomic power offers a clue. In stating his dislike of allegory, he is using the term to mean a literal reading: that he dislikes stories which offer only a single, specific political or moral interpretation. So, The Lord of the Rings can be read vaguely as an allegory of power, but not specifically of atomic power. Similarly, it can be read as an allegory of warfare, or of the struggle against evil, but not specifically of one of the World Wars. He wants his readers to relate to wide themes of human experience and not to narrow lessons on distinct events."
"How did Shakespeare get away with staging witchcraft in his plays such as Othello, Macbeth, or The Tempest?","The public saw the plays were fiction, perhaps even a warning against witchcraft, and the magic in them is divorced of religious overtones.  It is noteworthy that the two Shakespeare plays which deal most overtly with magic, Macbeth and The Tempest were both written during the reign of King James I. James was an enthusiastic believer in the dangers of witchcraft and wrote an entire book on it, Daemonologie.  In doing so, he was echoing the beliefs of the majority of his subjects. To them, witchcraft was a real danger. They would have needed no suspension of disbelief to view the magicians in the plays as a genuine menace. But at the same time, they knew the plays were fiction. Shakespeare gives no quarter in portraying the witches as villainous, nor does he provide any ""real magic"" for people to copy. In fact, it seems likely he added these elements to his plays specifically to please his new king. While belief in witchcraft was widespread, this era saw the first significant doubts about the validity of witches emerge. Reginald Scot wrote The Discoverie of Witchcraft which argued most ""witches"" were women with mental illness. James I wrote Daemonologie partly in response to this tract and had all copies of Scot's opposing work burned when he took the throne. Macbeth thus supports James' belief in the reality of witches. Furthermore, it actually borrows elements of Daemonologie in its depiction of witchcraft. The book discusses the Berwick Witch trials of 1590 which, like the play, took place in Scotland and, like the play, saw the witches accused of raising storms.  Second Witch: I'll give thee a wind.
  First Witch: Thou'rt kind.
  Third Witch: And I another.
  First Witch: I myself have all the other,
  And the very ports they blow,    In the trials, the storms were said to be sent against James himself, giving this a particularly personal angle to the King. In fact the line: Though his bark cannot be lost,
  Yet it shall be tempest-tost.    Is thought to refer directly to this incident.  There are further parallels. One of the witches says: But in a sieve I'll thither sail, And during the trials, one of the alleged witches was said to have attempted to cross the Firth of Forth in a sieve.  The witches in Macbeth generally behave in a manner similar to that described by King James in his book. He has them dancing at rituals, rifling graves for body parts, stirring cauldrons and performing magic with toads, all of which are mirrored in the play.  So in fact, far from causing trouble by including magic in his plays, Shakespeare was simply conforming to and supporting the prevailing trend and pleasing his new monarch. There was no threat to him in doing so and, to be sure, he was careful never to mention magic in a religious context nor to make his sorcerers into heroes. The nearest he comes to a sympathetic wizard, Prospero, repents and gives up magic at the end of The Tempest, thus saving the playwright from any possible accusation he was portraying witchcraft in a positive light."
What reference is Shakespeare making in Act 2 Scene 2 of Macbeth?,"Noting that Macbeth is speaking of his own hands, and his own fears,  How is ’t with me when every noise appals me? it is clear that this is an allusion to Matthew chapter 18, which speaks metaphorically of removing one's own bodyparts if they should bring you to sin. Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. Macbeth fears that his actions, which have led to terrible bloodshed (most notably in the murder of Duncan), have rendered him irredeemable. "
Why would one of Germany's leading publishers publish a novel by Jewish writer Stefan Zweig in 1939?,"Samuel Fischer, who founded the S. Fischer Verlag in 1886 was also Jewish. After his death in 1934, his son-in-law Gottfried Bermann Fischer took over management of the publishing house, but in 1936 he left Germany with Samuel Fischer's widow. They first went to Vienna, taking part of the catalogue with them, and there continued publishing under the name ""Bermann-Fischer Verlag"". After the Anschluss in March 1938 he fled Austria and eventually ended up in the Swedish capital, Stockholm, where he continued the publishing house. This is where Stefan Zweig's Ungeduld des Herzens was published in 1939. Thomas Mann's novel Lotte in Weimar was also published there in the same year; the German Wikipedia article about the novel shows the book's original cover, which says, ""Bermann Fischer Verlag. Stockholm"". Meanwhile, Peter Suhrkamp continued the original publishing house in Frankfurt am Main, but was forced to rename it to ""Suhrkamp Verlag, ehem. S. Fischer"" (""Suhrkamp publishing house, formerly S. Fischer"") [Saur, page 9]. Suhrkamp kept the business going, even though it cost him time in concentration camps. After World War II, Gottfried Bermann Fischer returned to Germany and wanted to resume his management of the publishing house. Suhrkamp refused, and after long negotiations, Fischer and Suhrkamp decided to let the authors decide: they wrote to the authors whose works they had published, explained the situation to them and asked whether in future they wanted to have their works published by Fischer or by Suhrkamp. Thomas Mann and Carl Zuckmayer were two of the most prominent authors who chose S. Fischer, whereas Hermann Hesse and Bertolt Brecht preferred Suhrkamp. [Saur, page 9-10] Stefan Zweig had died in 1942, so he was never confronted with this choice. Source (besides the German Wikipedia):"
How many sailors from Odysseus' crew survived the Odyssey?,"The entire crew died, excepting Odysseus, fairly early in the Odyssey at the hands of Zeus by request of Helios. Pretty early on, Odysseus warns the crew not to eat the sheep on Helios' island (XII 417-422, Robert Fagles): ‘My friends, in our ship we have meat and drink,
  so let’s not touch those cattle, just in case
  that causes trouble for us. For these cows
  and lovely sheep belong to Helios,
  a fearful god, who spies out all there is
  and listens in on everything as well.’ ...but they do. So Zeus blows Odysseus' ship to smithereens (XII 544-549, Fagles): The blow from Zeus’ lightning made our boat
  shiver from stem to stern and filled it up
  with sulphurous smoke. My crew fell overboard
  and were carried in the waves, like cormorants,
  around our blackened ship, because the god
  had robbed them of their chance to get back home.   Nobody had left Odysseus' crew up until this point, so it appears the entirety of the crew was killed (or deemed too insignificant to bother mentioning as alive). It's also only through divine intervention that Odysseus lived at all. It ends up being Alcinous, King of the Phaecians, who orders a ship to take Odysseus back to Ithaca.  As for how many crew members Odysseus had at the outset, the exact number is never conveyed by the poem. The Odyssey was largely a word-of-mouth story. It's speculated that Homer wasn't really the author of the Odyssey, and merely compiled the story. If ever a number of crew members was written down, Homer didn't transcribe it."
Was pretending to be an abridgement of a made-up work invented by William Goldman?,"Much of J.R.R. Tolkien's work is presented as an abridgment/translation of the ""original"", usually in Elvish. Much of The Silmarillion is presented as a gloss of epic poems, some of which Tolkien partly wrote, and Lord of the Rings is supposed to be a translation of the Red Book of Westmarch. Dune is similarly a re-telling of stories from books, many of which are excerpted as chapter headings. Fictional diaries are a very old device; just off the top of my head is Nikolai Gogol's 1835 Diary of a Madman. These are at least tacitly abridged, as they rarely contain a lot of the dull day-to-day stuff in real diaries. Similarly, the epistolary novel (collections of fictional letters, again at least tacitly edited) is an old device, dating back at least to the 17th century. (The original novel of Dangerous Liaisons was such an epistolary novel.) The device is undoubtedly much older; medieval examples wouldn't surprise me. But I do know that Goldman wasn't unique."
"What was a ""prince"" in Dostoevsky's times, i.e. mid-late 19th century?","The English word ""prince"" is translated from the Russian ""knyaz (князь)"", which could be used either to denote a member of the royal family or more commonly a member of the nobility. Men directly related to the Tsar were usually called Velikiy Knyaz or Grand Prince instead. ""Knyaz"" can also be translated as ""duke"", which would probably give a more accurate idea of Prince Myshkin's status. As the Tsardom of Russia gained dominion over much of former Kievan Rus', Velikii Kniaz (Great Kniaz) Ivan IV of Russia in 1547 was crowned as Tsar. From the mid-18th century onwards, the title Velikii Kniaz was revived to refer to (male-line) sons and grandsons of Russian Emperors. [...] Kniaz [...] continued as a hereditary title of Russian nobility patrilineally descended from Rurik (e.g., Belozersky, Belosselsky-Belozersky, Repnin, Gorchakov) or Gediminas (e.g., Galitzine, Troubetzkoy). Members of Rurikid or Gedyminid families were called princes when they ruled tiny quasi-sovereign medieval principalities. After their demesnes were absorbed by Muscovy, they settled at the Moscow court and were authorised to continue with their princely titles. From the 18th century onwards, the title was occasionally granted by the Tsar, for the first time by Peter the Great to his associate Alexander Menshikov, and then by Catherine the Great to her lover Grigory Potemkin. After 1801, with the incorporation of Georgia into the Russian Empire, various titles of numerous local nobles were controversially rendered in Russian as ""kniazes"". Similarly, many petty Tatar nobles asserted their right to style themselves ""kniazes"" because they descended from Genghis Khan I haven't found a good figure for how many knyazi there were in Russia around the time when The Idiot was set, but given the size of Russia, the variety of places a man could pick up this title, and the generally large families of the Russian aristocracy of the time, I would expect at least thousands. This is supported by a Russian Wikipedia page listing hundreds of Knyaz families. Our hero Prince Myshkin isn't a royal figure, or one of the highest nobles in the country. He's more like a son of a decaying aristocratic family which has lost most of its money. This is also quite apparent from the text of the novel, IMO - the word ""prince"" is thrown around quite casually, and he's never treated with special reverence due to his title."
"In Ozymandias, who is the ""ye"" in the line ""Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"" meant to be addressing?","""Look on my works ye mighty and despair."" First point: you are correct, the ye is equivalent to you. Second point:  the reason he uses ye instead of you is because it is supposedly an ancient inscription, and ye sounds like old-time language, rather than coming from Shelley's own time. Third point: the inscription  has an ironic double meaning. When the king was alive, he thought the words meant ""If you think you are mighty, just look at me, I am greater than you are. Despair, because you will never be as great as me."" But his empire collapsed and left nothing but a broken statue.  To modern people the inscription means, ""If you think you are mighty, look at me, I vanished from history, and so will you. Despair, because you, too, shall be forgotten."" By the way, the  poem was inspired by two actual statues,  one of them a broken head and torso in Egypt,  and an inscription on a different statue.   The original inscription, in translation, was:  ""King of Kings Ozymandias am I. If any want to know how great I am and where I lie, let him outdo me in my work."""
Can the Count of Monte Cristo's calculation of poison dosage be explained?,"I checked the original French text (emphasis mine): —Eh bien, reprit Monte-Cristo, supposez que ce poison soit de la brucine, par exemple, et que vous en preniez un milligramme le premier jour, deux milligrammes le second, eh bien, au bout de dix jours vous aurez un centigramme; au bout de vingt jours, en augmentant d'un autre milligramme, vous aurez trois centigrammes, c'est-à-dire une dose que vous supporterez sans inconvénient, et qui serait déjà fort dangereuse pour une autre personne qui n'aurait pas pris les mêmes précautions que vous [...] My translation: ""Well then,"" Monte-Cristo continued, ""suppose the poison would be brucine, for example, and that you take one milligram of it the first day, two milligrams the second - well then, at the end of ten days you would have one centigram; at the end of twenty days, adding one more milligram, you would have three centigrams: namely, a dose which you can take without inconvenience, but which would already be very dangerous for someone else who had not taken the same precautions as you [...] ""Three hundred centigrams"" would be ""trois cent centigrammes"" in French, not ""trois centigrammes"". Someone made a mistake translating. Three centigrammes makes sense, because of the phrase ""en augmentant d'un autre milligramme"": in the second week of this hypothetical experiment, the dose is increasing by one extra milligram each day, i.e. by two milligrams, which brings us to three centigrams at the end of twenty days."
Why did George Orwell name himself after the River Orwell?,"Blair originally submitted a list of four possible pseudonyms to his agent, Leonard Moore, telling Moore that he could make pick of the four1: There are several reasons Blair chose to use a pen name at all, one being that he thought that ""Blair"" was ""too Scottish""2. He wanted something English, and, from the research I've done, all of the above names are indeed English in origin (""Kenneth"" is an Anglicization, but its connotations are probably less Scottish than ""Blair""'s). The reasons for ""Orwell"" even being on the list are a bit more complicated. Blair spent quite some time in Southwold in his 20s and 30s, where his parents were living. It's a coastal town in Suffolk, with the nearest large towns (relative to tiny Southwold) being Lowestoft, Norwich, and Ipswich. Orwell grew familiar with the area, including the coastal regions to the north and south. The River Orwell is about 40 miles to the south, running from Ipswich to the coast, and it is possible that Orwell was familiar with it.3 The page George Orwell: An Exhibition from the Collection of Daniel J. Leab indicates that it may have been a stop during his journeys to London, which seems plausible. By using ""Orwell"", Blair was playing homage to the area that led to much of his early writing. There's also a village of the same name in Cambridgeshire, about 60 miles from Southwold. There are, however, some questions. If he wanted the name to be after a Suffolk river, why not, for instance, use the River Blyth, which flows right through Southwold (perhaps the name's Scottish roots led to the same distaste as with ""Blair"")? These questions probably will never be answered; there is no evidence that the River Orwell had any special significance to him over any other place in Suffolk.4 We do have to consider, though, that Blair did not want to choose something that could be easily traced back to him or his family. Around the time of the publication of Down and Out in Paris and London, his first longer work (a memoir), he wrote I would prefer the book to be published pseudonymously. I have no reputation that is lost by doing this and if the book has any kind of success I can always use the same pseudonym again. Given that today, we have to look hard to see if there's any deeper connection between Blair and his name, it seems that for a while, he succeeded in distancing Eric Blair from George Orwell. 1 The text of the 1932 letter can be found here. In it, Blair lists the names and writes, ""I would rather favour George Orwell"". (Thank you Gallifreyan!)

2 ""Too Scottish"" has been quoted all over the Internet, but it's extremely difficult to find an original source for it. The best indication I can get is from a 1936 letter from Blair to Norah Myles, in which he writes, ""The Blairs are by origin Lowland Scottish & dull"". That's the only thing I can find referring to his family's name's history and Scotland.

3 The Dictionary of Pseudonyms states that the River Orwell was the river ""on whose banks he had lived"", which seems improbable, given the 40 miles of separation. It is quite possible, though, that Blair spent time in Ipswich and on the river.

4 Anonymous Speech: Literature, Law and Politics notes that it is possible that Blair considered ""Orwell"" while walking along the banks of the river with his father."
How are graphic novels different from comic books?,"Graphic novel is a sub-category of comic books (which are, in turn, as subset of comics). For me (and hopefully for some other people out there), graphic novels represent a more coherent, complete, and mature subset of the comic book industry (and thus my comment on a relevant meta). This website calls comic books ""periodicals"", but some graphic novels were first released as periodicals as well. However, the term is often used erratically, and almost always subjectively - there exists an obligatory group of people who only apply the term to the older and classical examples (hat tip to SW prequel haters!). Below are some thoughts on existing examples of graphic novels, with some effort to determine what akes them graphic novels in the first place. Wikipedia page on graphic novel attributes the popularity of the term to A Contract With God, and latter Maus (which won a Pulitzer) and The Dark Knight Returns. The books that came later, and are called graphic novels are Sin City, Watchmen, V for Vendetta, and The Sandman. One recent graphic novel I can think of is Blue Is the Warmest Color. While I can't speak for the first two titles, one thing that is common for other graphic novels I listed is the coherent and complete storyline. Each of them is essentially a novel, except it being told in a graphic medium. Graphic novels are usually not based on any mainstream comics; surely, there may be a couple of Batman graphic novels, but the rest usually do fly under the radar of the comicbook-ignorant community. Apparently, a graphic novel may not be a graphic novel upon release (see Sandman), and may obtain that status over time, either by becoming famous, gathering a cult following, or vice versa. They don't necessarily have to be long (but usually longer than an ordinary comic issue) - The Killing Joke is only 50-odd  megabytes pages long, Blue Is the Warmest Color is roughly the same. On the other hand, The Sandman took 8 years for all 75 issues to be completed. They don't necessarily have to be serious (mature, grim, realistic, etc.) either - the Scott Pilgrim series are, in my book, a graphic novel, because it's essentially one story being told in 6 volumes. Graphic novels that I listed revolve around one story or central plot, sometimes telling it from different perspectives. This is unlike generic comic books, which are a continuous narration, with every 20 or so issues being bound by an overarching plot called ""story arc"". Graphic novels, as opposed to mainstream comics printed nowadays, are usually self-contained. There's no background reading required, and you don't have to read some other comic series to understand what's going on. Also, graphic novels tend to introduce recurring characters, and limit introducing new characters to a minimum. A genius implementation of that principle is The Sandman, where characters from the first volume suddenly become relevant, or have their stories explained, in later volumes. Gaiman did pretty well at intertwining the fates of his characters, in unpredictable ways. Graphic novels share some traits with ordinary novels - for instance, they often have a recurring symbol, used either as a plot device, a narration tool, or simply as a symbol. For instance, the Maiden, the Mother and the Crone in Sandman, or the characteristic red stain in Watchmen. They (though not all) also follow the dramatic structure, which is most easily traced in Watchmen. Note that certain Asian comics are considered graphic novels as well: Akira (won a Harvey award), Planetes, Ghost in the Shell. Though you certainly won't see many people calling them graphic novels per se, they certainly have attained the same cult status. One could say that it's just a glorified comic - and would be in a sense correct. For instance, Neil Gaiman said that [the person who said that Gaiman was writing graphic novels, not comic books] meant it as a compliment, I suppose. But all of a sudden I felt like someone who'd been informed that she wasn't actually a hooker; that in fact she was a lady of the evening. From The Sandman Companion, as cited in Wikipedia On the other hand, he uses the term ""graphic novel"" to describe his Mr. Punch, in his introduction to Smoke and Mirrors: [Queen of Knives, a short story], like my graphic novel Mr Punch, is close enough to the truth that I have had, on occasion, to explain to some of my relatives that it didn't really happen. Well, not like that, anyway. Alan Moore pins the term, with pretty much the same accusations: Q: What do you think of the term “graphic novel” that has come into use? Moore: It's a marketing term . . . that I never had any sympathy with. The term 'comic' does just as well for me . . . the thing that happened in the mid-’80s was that there were a couple of things out there that you could just about call a novel. You could just about call Maus a novel, you could probably just about call Watchmen a novel, in terms of density, structure, size, scale, seriousness of theme, stuff like that. The problem is that 'graphic novel' just came to mean 'expensive comic book' and so what you'd get is people like DC Comics or Marvel Comics—because 'graphic novels' were getting some attention, they'd stick six issues of whatever worthless piece of crap they happened to be publishing lately under a glossy cover and call it The She-Hulk Graphic Novel....

"In the Iliad, why does Homer list every captain involved in the Trojan war?","Apparently, because it was true.  The Iliad as we know it was composed over some centuries, transmitted orally, before ""Homer"" synthesized the version that was written down. Practically every word in that last sentence is subject to debate, called the Homeric Question. But this is the version that I think is most generally agreed on, and which I think best answers the question. The earliest versions may have been practically contemporary. A fair number of details have been later confirmed, most notably details of the walls of Troy as discovered by Heinrich Schliemann at Hisarlik in Turkey. The style is constructed for easy memorization, with a rigid meter (dactylic hexameter, which works as well for Greek as iambic pentameter does for English) and a lot of stock phrases (like Eos rhododactylos, ""rosy-fingered dawn"", and ""wine-dark sea""). So it's entirely possible that those names are in there because those people were, in fact, there. The poem was composed to honor them, and was being told to people who remembered them. You wouldn't want the Cretans to boo you because you forgot Idomeneus, after all. Still... that doesn't explain why people would want to listen to this rather stultifying section. Even if the Cretans cheered being mentioned, surely they didn't care about Diores, son of Amarynces, and Polyxenus, son of King Agasthenes, son of Augeas. Well, literarily, it does serve a number of purposes. For one thing, it makes it all feel like a historical recitation rather than a fantasy. The Greek notion of the distinction between fact and fiction doesn't match the way we think of it, and they seem to have believed in things that they knew were fictional, but that mix included a lot of reality.  It also serves political purposes. It helps to cement the notion of a Greek identity. It reminds them of a time they all worked together, even as Athens and Sparta were embarking on a series of wars. And it may have given authority to people claiming descent from those great Greek warriors: ""Look, my great-great-N-great grandpappy served with Agamemnon and Menelaus."" Finally... the Iliad as a whole is pretty tedious to modern ears even without the Catalog of Ships. It covers a fairly small piece of the war, and could better be known as the Wrath of Achilles. It doesn't tell any of the stories most people think of about the Trojan War: the abduction of Helen, the Trojan Horse, the Achilles Heel. I think the people who listened to it would have found the Catalog of Ships more engaging than we do."
Why is Pechorin a hero of our time?,"In his preface to the second edition, Lermontov criticises the readers who - like you - took the title at face value and interpreted it to mean Pechorin was really being modelled as a hero: The preface to a book serves the double purpose of prologue and epilogue. It affords the author an opportunity of explaining the object of the work, or of vindicating himself and replying to his critics. As a rule, however, the reader is concerned neither with the moral purpose of the book nor with the attacks of the Reviewers, and so the preface remains unread. Nevertheless, this is a pity, especially with us Russians! The public of this country is so youthful, not to say simple-minded, that it cannot understand the meaning of a fable unless the moral is set forth at the end. Unable to see a joke, insensible to irony, it has, in a word, been badly brought up. It has not yet learned that in a decent book, as in decent society, open invective can have no place; that our present-day civilisation has invented a keener weapon, none the less deadly for being almost invisible, which, under the cloak of flattery, strikes with sure and irresistible effect. The Russian public is like a simple-minded person from the country who, chancing to overhear a conversation between two diplomatists belonging to hostile courts, comes away with the conviction that each of them has been deceiving his Government in the interest of a most affectionate private friendship.  The unfortunate effects of an over-literal acceptation of words by certain readers and even reviewers have recently been manifested in regard to the present book. Many of its readers have been dreadfully, and in all seriousness, shocked to find such an immoral man as Pechorin set before them as an example. Others have observed, with much acumen, that the author has painted his own portrait and those of his acquaintances! . . . What a stale and wretched jest! But Russia, it appears, has been constituted in such a way that absurdities of this kind will never be eradicated. It is doubtful whether, in this country, the most ethereal of fairy-tales would escape the reproach of attempting offensive personalities.  Pechorin, gentlemen, is in fact a portrait, but not of one man only: he is a composite portrait, made up of all the vices which flourish, full-grown, amongst the present generation. You will tell me, as you have told me before, that no man can be so bad as this; and my reply will be: ""If you believe that such persons as the villains of tragedy and romance could exist in real life, why can you not believe in the reality of Pechorin? If you admire fictions much more terrible and monstrous, why is it that this character, even if regarded merely as a creature of the imagination, cannot obtain quarter at your hands? Is it not because there is more truth in it than may be altogether palatable to 
  you?"" You will say that the cause of morality gains nothing by this book. I beg your pardon. People have been surfeited with sweetmeats and their digestion has been ruined: bitter medicines, sharp truths, are therefore necessary. This must not, however, be taken to mean that the author has ever proudly dreamed of becoming a reformer of human vices. Heaven keep him from such impertinence! He has simply found it entertaining to depict a man, such as he considers to be typical of the present day and such as he has often met in real life -- too often, indeed, unfortunately both for the author himself and for you. Suffice it that the disease has been pointed out: how it is to be cured -- God alone knows!  -- translated by J. H. Wisdom and M. Murray (PDF available here, original Russian version here); emphasis mine It seems that, as I already guessed without knowing anything about the book, the title is a cynical reflection on the contemporary world. Lermontov is saying that a ""hero"" of our time is not really a hero but something of a jerk. But being unable to say so openly, he resorted to ironic ambiguity in order to make his point. It's also interesting to note that in the original Russian title Герой нашего времени, the word ""Герой"", while usually taken to mean ""hero"", can also mean ""character"". This was perhaps a deliberate choice of words on Lermontov's part, to further increase the ambiguity of the title."
Is there any evidence for a gay relationship in The Merchant of Venice?,"There is a modern tradition of Antonio and Bassanio, and the rest of The Merchant of Venice, being interpreted in queer terms. A common starting point for this is the first line of the play. ""In sooth, I know not why I am so sad"", says Antonio. We don't either. He's rich, he has close friends, he seems to have no desire to marry. He goes to great lengths for his friend Bassanio though, putting his wealth and even life at risk. At the end of the play Antonio is still making extravagant promises on Bassanio's behalf, now to his wife: ""My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord / Will never more break faith advisedly"". It's all a bit much. There's also a serve of cross-dressing, if you remember, with Portia and Nerissa dressing as men so Portia can be the lawyer for Antonio, and jokes about Bassanio sleeping with the (male) lawyer she pretends to be. There's plenty of other secret identities, concealments and revelations throughout the play, too: like Jessica converting to Christianity. An early reference for the queer tradition is WH Auden's essay Brothers and Others, from 1948, which notes Antonio's obsession with Bassanio, and the Renaissance association of sodomy with usury. ""It can, therefore, hardly be an accident that Shylock the usurer has as his antagonist a man whose emotional life, though his conduct may be chaste, is concentrated upon a member of his own sex."" The RSC website has a 1965 production with ""the unmistakeable suggestion of a homosexual dimension to the relationship between Bassanio and Antonio"". I wouldn't be surprised if a less institutional company got there even earlier. The Michael Radford film starring Al Pacino, also uses the text to make Antonio and Bassanio's relationship ambiguous. It could be showing them as gay or bisexual, or it could just be showing the difference in male friendships across different places and times. More direct discussion of queerness - or just biting the bullet and showing the characters as gay - seems to start in the late 1970s, going by Joseph Pequiney's The Two Antonios and Same-Sex Love in Twelfth Night and The Merchant of Venice (PDF). This 1999 journal article by Steve Patterson goes so far as to describe it as a ""modern cliche"". Lastly there's an excellent poem on the queerness of Merchant and the openness of Shakespeare in general to interpretation, The Sadness of Antonio, by Jason Schneiderman."
How did having a full pot of tea betray the doctor's lowly origins?,"Compare this with a situation where someone visits you, you offer them food, and they say: ""No, thanks, I have lots of food at home!"" This would be extremely rude in many cultures. It may imply any of the following: Any of these may be true, but one does not say that out loud. To me, who's not Dutch, Dr. Jolles's response seems to be a reflexive repudiation of poverty - something which a member of the gentry would never need to do. Dr. Jolles feels the need to say that he has a full pot at home because he didn't have a full pot of tea at home in his past. To quote George R. R. Martin: Any man who must say 'I am the King' is no true king."
Did later literary analysis agree with Mark Twain's criticism of J.F. Cooper?,"It appears that most later critics think that Twain's criticism was unfair, and possibly intended as humor. John McWilliams writes: Hilarious though Twain's essay is, it is valid only within its own
  narrow and sometimes misapplied criteria.1 Some other sources cited by Wikipedia appear to claim that the essay was not intended as a criticism at all, but as humor, because Twain's criticisms are not realistic. In this essay, Twain is ""Impos[ing] the standards of Realism on Romance,"" which is humorously incongruous.2 1 ""Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses (Introduction)"". Twain's Indians.

Did C. S. Lewis support the Ransom Theory in the Chronicles of Narnia?,"To cite an answer on Christinanity SE that sticks to C. S. Lewis' expressed views on the matter, avoiding theological debates: Lewis does not see any need to settle on a particular theory of the atonement, considering it to be something beyond human understanding. In a letter written to a ""Mr. Young"" (otherwise unidentified) dated 31 October 1963 -- so less than a month before he died -- Lewis is clearly replying to five specific questions that Young had asked him. One of them, #3, related to the Atonement: a The editor, Walter Hooper, suggests Romans 5:8 at this point. Source: C.S. Lewis, Collected Letters.

"Is the house plan in Anne Frank's diary an artistic rendition, or is it sketched by Anne?","While I can't speak with authority as to the contents of the original diary, I'd suggest that in answering the question as posed, 'Is the house plan in Anne Frank's diary an artistic rendition, or is it sketched by Anne?' and 'Did Anne's original diary have a (rough) sketch of the Secret Annex, or was it completely a rendition from the details from the diary?', there are several avenues to be explored. a) is the plan illustrated in the question in Anne's hand? b) can we find any trace of an 'rough sketch' in Anne's hand? c) would it be possible to construct the plan from details in Anne's text? d) would it be necessary to construct the plan from details in Anne's text. Looking at a) 'Is the plan in Anne's hand?'  My immediate response to that, as a design professional who spent many years at a drawing board before computer drafting took over, I would not regard that as the plan of a 15 year old girl in Anne's circumstances. The drawing utilises standard drafting conventions and use of lettering stencils. It seems unlikely these would be taught to girls of Anne's age and era, or that she would have access to the requisite tools. b) Can we find trace of a 'rough sketch' in Anne's hand. My efforts here are necessarily limited, but internet searches for images of the manuscript do not readily turn up such a sketch. In fact, widening the search I could not find any drawings of Anne's at all. I can find no reference either to the existence of Anne's own plan, which one feels would have been made much of and pored over by conspiracy theorists if no-one else. However, this is not conclusive. c) would it be possible to construct the plan from details in Anne's text? I am not in a position to comprehensively answer this question as I've not read the text recently enough or with attention to this detail.  What I did see from looking at the plan was a detail that seemed improbable for a plan constructed from references in text rather than a measured survey, and this led me to look much more closely at the way the landing area with the bookcase fits together in regard to what the plan shows. The left hand wall of the  landing offset by a few inches from the left hand wall of the corridor which leads to it from the frontage building. While it is far from impossible that Anne would notice this, it seems quite unlikely for her to have recorded it. This can obviously be tested by examining the text, but also relies on knowing whether this detail of the plan is correct in regard to the building.  From what I can see from photographs of the entrance to the annex as it exists now, the recording of the landing is incorrect, or has at least been simplified. The plan shows the swinging bookcase being closer to the wall on its hinge edge than wall with windows, while photos clearly show it closer to the opposite wall with the windows. However, the two different photographs of the bookcase on the linked site almost look as though the left hand wall has been realigned at some stage between the images being taken. If we look at the ceiling area where what appears to be the corner of an adjacent room intruding into the landing, the side of that projection which is perpendicular to the windows, appears shorter in the colour photo than in the black and white, the undecorated areas on the black and white being boxed in in the colour. This diversion into the shape of the landing doesn't effectively prove anything about how the hallway looked in Anne's period of residence, all it does indicate that we can't be fully sure without going into very great research detail, exactly how this area looked when Anne knew it. If walls have moved between photographs, how else might that corner with its awkward projection and slight recesses in the stonework have been boxed off at other times? d) would it be necessary to construct the plan from details in Anne's text. This is the question which I think can be answered most definitively. There would be no need to construct a plan from textual descriptions. The building still stands, Otto Frank survived. The text is not the only source. Taking these four avenues together, I see no evidence for a plan sketched by Anne herself, but no need to construct one from her descriptions either. Certainly the plan pictured in the question is highly unlikely to be drawn by Anne. The use of conventions such as arrows indicating direction of rise on the stairs, wash-hand basins depicted as curved when the actual artefacts are rectangular, the use of stencilled lettering, the labelling of the rooms in French, certainly militate against this being Anne's own work."
How does Shakespeare's iambic pentameter work with Original Pronunciation?,"I think the disconnect may derive from regarding Shakespeare's plays as being written literature.  The publication of the text versions of his play, whether in the the First Folios, the quartos, or any later form, were subsequent to the performance of the work.  Although Shakespeare is potentially more widely read than any other poet, this method of engaging in is work is always secondary. The poetry of Shakespeare's plays is meant to be spoken.  Thus, the metric problems you refer to would have been non-issues: It is also notable that the exact text which was performed while Shakespeare was at the Globe may never be known. Text was altered by intent or by accident, and there were both authorized and unauthorized publications during that period. Modern text of Shakespeare, whether for reading or performance, represent amalgamations of different versions.  Even today, the exact text you will see performed may very likely been altered by a dramaturge drawing from alternate versions. Nearly all modern adaptations have the intent of making the Bard's work more accessible to modern audiences and readers, which may include syllabic alteration."
What did Wodehouse say about writing in the first-person?,"Wodehouse wrote in a letter to William Townend dated 6 March 1932, (...) It's not all jam writing in the first person. The reader can know nothing except what Bertie tells him, and Bertie can know only a limited amount himself. This letter is quoted in P.G. Wodehouse in His Own Words, edited by Barry Day (Abrams, 2012). One of Wodehouse's early novels was Love Among the Chickens, first published in 1906 (almost a decade before his first Bertie Wooster story), and revised in 1921. According to the editor of Delphi Collected Works of P. G. Wodehouse, In 1921 Wodehouse revised the book, rewriting the first five chapters so they were narrated in the first person and making some changes in the ending. In spite of what he wrote to Townend in 1932, Laughing Gas, published in 1936, is told in the first person from the point of view of Reginald (""Reggie"") Swithin, third Earl of Havershot."
Looking for a poem about the (fictionalized) writing of The Canterbury Tales Prologue,"Like others, I have not been able to find the poem you are looking for, but I wonder if the source is actually the last few stanzas of Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde.  The stanza that begins with “Go, litel book” is followed by a stanza in which Chaucer comments on his use of English and worries that the language, because it is so “diverse,” might be misunderstood: And for ther is so greet diversitee
  In English and in wryting of our tonge,
  So preye I god that noon miswryte thee,
  Ne thee mismetre for defaute of tonge.
  And red wher-so thou be, or elles songe,

Understanding political subtexts in the Turing test paper,"I dispute your claim that the Turing test, or Turing's article, is about gender. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence; I see no hint in Turing's article that the test is about gender. If you think that it is, it is up to you to come up with evidence why that is a reasonable conclusion. Therefore, the only thing that is answerable in your question is: why does Turing use gender, to explain or make a point that is unrelated to gender? I see no evidence that this is anything but the straightforward didactic device it appears to be. Note that Turing uses the word sex, you use the word gender. I'll use the word sex, following Turing; the distinction is actually somewhat relevant, but not philosophically so. In this answer will not distinguish between thinking, consciousness, sentience, soul possession and other similar but not identical concepts. Turing uses the word “thinking” and links it to some variations on these other ideas but does not make a clear distinction between them. I will do likewise, although much could be said on the topic. Also, my perspective is that of a (former) computer scientist and occasional teacher of computer science. I am familiar with the concept of the Turing test and the historical context in which it was formulated but have not researched Turing's writings or the precise context in which he wrote this text. Let us start with the historical context. In Turing's time, the concept of a machine that might think in a way that's similar to a human is rather novel, daring and prima facie rejected. The concept is not wholly new — numerous human creation myths and golem and other similar ideas have existed for longer than we have recorded history. What was new in Turing's time was the idea that the creation of a thinking mind could be understood in technological terms and not just as magic: a thinking mind would be constructed by engineers, who would use techniques that are in principle reproducible (see §3) rather than a magical insufflation of life by dint of opaque biological processes or divine grant. It was a rather shocking idea, which is why about than half of the article consists of a refutation of counterarguments. So we have a philosophically daring idea which needs to be explained in a way that won't outright shock the audience and cause immediate rejection. An abrupt presentation of the idea would risk being emotionally rejected without serious intellectual consideration. This calls for a gradual presentation that first hooks the audience into a reasonable-sounding series of arguments, and then shows that if this idea is reasonable then so should be the more daring one. The daring idea is that a human and a (sufficiently advanced) thinking machine cannot be distinguished through the way they think, and the way they communicate via language in the abstract. (Turing neglects the language aspect, assuming that a thinking machine would be able to master human language. I will likewise consider mastery of language as part of the requirements of thinking.) The human and the machine may be distinguished by physical characteristics — they may have different size and shape, they may have different means of concrete communication (typing vs holding a pen, different timbers of voice, etc.). The point of the setup of the Turing test is to argue that these are only superficial differences that do not matter to the crucial question of whether the machine thinks. So we need to explain that there's a test for which a thinking machine and a human will be indistinguishable. But since this claim would immediately be rejected, we need to bring it up gradually. Then let's start where we have two different humans who need to be distinguished. Nothing shocking about that. Human A is trying to pass off as human B, human B is trying to refute this, and the goal of the interrogator C is to determine which is which. With two specific humans, C would have an easy job, by asking something that only B would know. So the test doesn't really work with specific humans. It would work a lot better with categories of humans. This way, A could justify ignorance of a fact, or variation from a stereotype, because not every member of the category would have to know the fact or follow the stereotype. We need to find a way to distinguish between two categories of humans who are not easily distinguished by their knowledge or mental ability. Yet these categories should be unambiguously distinct. Preferably those categories should have physical distinctions, to make the requirements for the setup of the test more evident. Things like nationality (which would lead to knowledge and language differences) and age (not well-defined and could also have noticeable intrinsic differences) wouldn't work. On the other hand, sex perfectly fits the requirement. Note that this does not require to accept that there is no intrinsic mental difference between men and women. While Turing's society did make some distinctions in this respect, his audience would not automatically have jumped to the conclusion that the test would obviously reveal which is which. And in any case what matters is not that the test could not reveal which is which under any circumstance, but that it is plausible that the interrogator would be unable to decide. Hence, first make the test be about sex. Then, once the audience has accepted the framework of the test as reasonable, switch the test to be about human vs machine. If the test is good enough to determine whether men and women can be distinguished as a category, then it's good enough to determine whether humans and machines can be distinguished as a category. Once the test has been established in section 1, Turing does not come back to the idea of testing for sex (gender). The paper is not about a test for gender."
Are there two Pooh?,"No. It's a whimsical joke. When you visit a friend's house without notice, it's lucky they were in. They might be out, and you may not get to see them, and have a snack. But when you visit your own house, of course you are there, and you can let yourself in for a snack. Note ""luckily Pooh was at home just as they got there""; he arrived when they arrived, because of course he did."
Why do the Pern novels use regular words as profanity?,"Minced oaths, from well-known ones like ""gosh"" and ""darn"" and ""heck"" and ""fricking"", to more obscure ones, are common in the real world, but even more so in fiction and especially fantasy. I've read children's stories, set in versions of the real world with some fantasy elements, where characters say ""ruddy"" or ""bliddy"" instead of the mild swear-word ""bloody"". In fully imaginary worlds, it's even more plausible to have completely invented curses. The usual reason for this, I think, is to keep the book family-friendly while still having a realistic amount of characters swearing. This particularly applies to the cases like ""ruddy"" and ""bliddy"" mentioned above, but can also apply to fantasy like The Dragonriders of Pern set in entirely imaginary worlds. Another reason is to increase immersion in the imaginary world. You wouldn't expect people in Pern to utter oaths like ""oh Christ!"", because Jesus Christ is a religious figure in our world. Creating some invented curses, especially those which have some theme related to that imaginary world (like dragon eggs in Pern), helps to remind the reader that this is an imaginary world and make them feel more immersed in it. Specifically, many real-world oaths, especially older ones, are ultimately based on something religious, ranging from ""goddamn"" to ""hell"" and many others. Swearing by the legendary Faranth could be seen as the Pern equivalent of swearing by Jesus Christ in real-life Europe or America. Cf., for example, the Wheel of Time series, another work of fantasy set in an entirely imaginary world, where we see a lot of characters using various curses like ""oh Light"" (the Light being a sort of mystic source of goodness from the Creator, often used metaphorically) or ""blood and ashes"" (an invented curse but similar enough to some real ones like ""bloody"" that it's clearly a curse). Some of them reflect facets of particular cultures: e.g. Shienarans use ""peace"" as a general blessing, even in odd contexts like ""peace favour your sword"", because they're Borderland people who've never known peace."
"Did T.S. Eliot really plagiarize in ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock""?","In The Poems of T. S. Eliot Volume I edited by Christopher Ricks (Faber & Faber, 2015), Ricks has several notes for the lines ""In the room the women come and go / Talking of Michelangelo."" First, he points out that the lines ""Dans la pièce les femmes vont et viennent / En parlant des maîtres de Sienne"" are not from Laforgue but are the French translation by Pierre Leyris (1947) of T. S. Eliot's lines from ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"". The claim that Eliot plagiarised Laforgue seems to be based on a comment in B. C. Southam's A Student's Guide to the Selected Poems of T. S. Eliot (Faber & Faber, 1968, 1994, page 50): In imitating Laforgue almost word for word, Eliot introduces an element of parody, re-rendering the French in a tripping rhyming couplet (…). Second, the words ""women come and go"" echo lines from Christina Rosetti's ""The Convent Threshold"": Love-music warbling in their throat,
Young men and women come and go. Third, he points out that ""go / Talking of ..."" has an echo in Ash-Wednesday's, ""Going (...) / Talking of trivial things"". Ash-Wednesday is a much later poem, first published in 1930. The claim that the words ""When the evening is spread out against the sky"" are plagiarised from Bergon's Time and Free Will is plain and simply wrong. Scholars know that Eliot had read the 1910 translation (Time and Free Will is available on Archive.org) and Bergson uses the word combination ""spread[ing] out"" repeatedly in that work. However, it is not the evening that is spread out anywhere, nor is anything described as ""spread out against the sky"". Below are a few examples from Bergson's essay: In some of its manifestations consciousness even appears to spread outwards, as if intensity were being developed into extensity, (…). But yet we spoke at first of one and the same sensation which spread further and further, of one prick which increased in intensity. (…) if on the other hand our conception of number ends in spreading out in space everything which can be directly counted (…) (…) while states of consciousness are not essentially external to one another, and become so only by being spread out in time, regarded as a homogeneous medium. By separating these moments from each other, by spreading out time in space, we have caused this feeling to lose its life and its colour. the absurdity of the fundamental hypothesis by which it spreads out time in space (…) B. C. Southam comment on Bergson's influence both in the general introduction to his Student's Guide ... and in the introduction to the chapter on ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"" but does not use the word ""plagiarism"" in this context (nor in the context of the supposed imitation of Laforgue). The word ""retreats"" in line 5 had also been used by the Victorian-era poet James Thomson in The City of Dreadful Night: Although lamps burn along the silent streets;
(...)
The dark holds countless lanes and close retreats; (Eliot had read some of Thomson's work but it would go a bit far to describe borrowing a single word as plagiarism.) The phrase ""overwhelming question"" (line 10) had also been used in James Fenimore Cooper's The Pioneers (Chapter XXIII) (1823): The whole company were a good deal astounded with this overwhelming question, (…) Ricks has notes on many other lines of ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"" that point to similar phrases and usages in other works (in addition to echoes in Eliot's later poems). Whether these echoes and similarities constitute plagiarism is very hard to judge, since this depends on where you draw the line between inspiration and plagiarism. When discussing modernist literature such as the works of T. S. Eliot or James Joyce, it is important to take into account that these authors introduced a more allusive style. Eliot's The Waste Land is a famous (or infamous) example of this. Julia Kristeva would later coin the term intertextuality for practices or techniques such as allusion, quotation, translation, pastiche, parody and even plagiarism. In his essay Tradition and the Individual Talent (1919), Eliot had already written how literary works are always interconnected in a way that is very similar to Kristeva's concept of intertextuality: No poet, no artist of any art, has his complete meaning alone. His significance, his appreciation is the appreciation of his relation to the dead poets and artists. You cannot value him alone; you must set him, for contrast and comparison, among the dead. (…) The necessity that he shall conform, that he shall cohere, is not onesided; what happens when a new work of art is created is something that happens simultaneously to all the works of art which preceded it. Eliot also discussed the allusive nature of Joyce's novel Ulysses in his review of the novel (""Ulysses, order and myth""). Ulysses reuses episodes and other aspects from the Odyssey, whereas some of the echoes in ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"" refer to authors that have now been forgotten (except by scholars), making it harder for modern readers to regard these echoes as true allusions that they can reasonably be expected to recognise. This may be the explanation for some of the plagiarism accusations that have been levelled at T. S. Eliot."
What is the earliest reference in fiction to a government-approved thieves guild?,"The question is difficult to answer due to its terms of reference. Usually it’s not possible to tell exactly where a given story lies on the continuum from “full endorsement” to “begrudging acceptance”. Governments are made up of many people, some of whom may be complicit with the thieves and some not. Did Tammany Hall “fully endorse” the gangs of New York? Did the Kingdom of Naples “fully endorse” the mafia of Sicily? Pratchett can have Vetinari endorse the Thieves’ Guild of Ankh-Morpork because he’s writing a satire and exaggeration is a satirical technique, but in other contexts we wouldn’t expect to see anything so explicit. So what I’m going to do is change the terms of reference and look instead at the history of the phrase “Thieves’ Guild” and how it became popularized in fantasy fiction so that Pratchett found it a suitable target of satire. The “thieves’ guilds” of Ankh-Morpork are first mentioned in The Colour of Magic (1983), so we have to look for sources before that date. I think the idea of an official or quasi-official “Thieves’ Guild” in fantastic settings was popularized by the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. A “Thieves’ Guild” was mentioned in the 1978 Players’ Handbook and the concept was expanded in later manuals. The Thieves Guild is an accepted part of communal society, and so long as they contain their activities to cutting purses, picking pockets, burglarizing homes, waylaying late-night revelers, all is well. Gary Gygax (1978). Players’ Handbook, p. 30. Random House. Thieves occasionally form guilds, especially in major cities and places with a strong sense of law and order. In many cases, they are forced to cooperate merely to survive. Influential thieves see guilds as a way to increase their own profits and grant them the image of respectability. They become dons and crimelords, directing operations without ever having to dirty their hands. At the same time, the membership of a thieves' guild is by definition composed of liars, cheats, swindlers, and dangerously violent men and women, Thus, such guilds are hotbeds of deceit, treachery, and back-stabbing (literally). Only the most cunning and powerful rise to the top. Gary Gygax (1989). Dungeon Master Guide, 2nd edition,† p. 19. Random House. † The 2nd edition is too late to have influenced Pratchett, but there may have been similar wording in the first edition (1979). Let me know if you have a copy and can confirm or deny! Gygax took inspiration from various works of fantasy literature, for example the magic system comes in large part from the story ‘Mazirian the Magician’ (1950) by Jack Vance. Another of his influences was the ‘Lankhmar’ series of fantasy stories by Fritz Leiber (the influence is explicit, for example the 1980 Deities and Demigods supplement includes the fictional pantheon from Leiber’s series). The Thieves’ Guild is mentioned briefly in Leiber’s story ‘The Two Best Thieves in Lankhmar’ (1968): […] the intersection of Silver Street with the Street of the Gods, a crossing-point where there habitually foregathered the junior executives and star operatives of the Thieves Guild; also meeting there were the few free-lance thieves bold and resourceful enough to defy the Guild and the few thieves of aristocratic birth, sometimes most brilliant amateurs, whom the Guild tolerated and even toadied to, on account of their noble ancestry, which dignified a very old but most disreputable profession. Fritz Leiber (1968). ‘The Two Best Thieves in Lankhmar’. In Swords Against Wizardry, p. 79. New York: Ace. The guild becomes an important plot element in the story ‘Ill Met in Lankhmar’ (1970). Almost the first law of the Thieves’ Guild was never kill the hen that laid brown eggs with a ruby in the yolk, or white eggs with a diamond in the white. Fritz Leiber (1970). ‘Ill Met in Lankhmar’. In Swords and Deviltry, p. 170. New York: Ace. In The Colour of Magic, Pratchett acknowledged his debt to Leiber, by parodying the latter’s heroes (Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser) as “Bravd and the Weasel”, and he also gave a nod to Dungeons & Dragons by having Bravd “fumble the initiative” when he first appears. (In Dungeons & Dragons, “initiative” is the privilege of moving first in a round of combat, and to “fumble” is to roll a low number with humorous or disastrous consequences.) The biographer Marc Burrows says that Pratchett was familiar with the game prior to The Colour of Magic: Pratchett was no stranger to Dungeons and Dragons and played locally with friends, often acting as dungeon master. The game excited him, and he considered it to be an entirely new artform: here was a way to make fiction interactive and turn narrative into competition. Among the familiar gorgons, ogres and magic spells he would create his own characters and settings […] One of his inventions was called the Luggage Marc Burrows (2020). The Magic of Terry Pratchett, p. 89. White Owl. So if Pratchett got “Thieves’ Guild” from Gygax and Leiber, and Gygax got it from Leiber too, where  did Leiber get it from? Well, there seem to be two sources in English. First, from Luke Owen Pike’s history of the remarkable Jonathan Wild: In the republic of the thieves’ guild Jonathan Wild became as it were a dictator; but like many of the great men of the middle ages, he owed his greatness to double-dealing. From small beginnings he became, in London at least, the receiver-in-chief of all stolen goods. He acquired and maintained this position by the persistent application of two simple principles; he did his best to aid the law in convicting all those mis-doers who would not recognise his authority, and he did his best to repair the losses of all who had been plundered and who took him into their confidence. By degrees he set up an office for the recovery of missing property, at which the government must, for a time, have connived. Here the robbed sought an audience of the only man who could promise them restitution; here the robbers congregated like workmen at a workshop, to receive the pay for the work they had done. Luke Owen Pike (1873). A History of Crime in England, p. 256. London: Smith, Elder. “Thieves’ guild” seems to have been Pike’s coinage and not used by Wild and his contemporaries, but the term was copied from Pike into subsequent works on criminology, for example: Jonathan Wild is an interesting example of a criminal of great practical ability, a man whose genius for organisation would have made him equal to any position in which he might have been placed. “In the republic of the thieves’ guild”—I quote Mr. Pike’s excellent summary of his career—“Jonathan Wild became as it were a dictator” Havelock Ellis (1890). The Criminal, p. 136. London: Walter Scott. The second source for the term, and the more likely route for Leiber to have picked it up, comes from descriptions of organized crime in China: Almost every large village, certainly every town, has its Thieves’ Guild, the members of which are generally known, and are always on good terms with the police. North China Herald (24 August 1883), p. 223. […] the approach of the annual feast of the Thieves’ Guild, which takes place about this time. The place of meeting is not public but it is always well-known some time before. And did the Inspector of Police wish to arrest he could do so. He will probably not make any arrests until his annual fee has been paid him by the Guild. North China Herald (15 January 1897), p. 59. This made its way into China-set literature in the early 20th century: “Rich?” Tang smiled bitterly. “Nine times these past two years have I been taxed for this business; five bags of silver have I given to the militarists. I work as hard as does any coolie. I pay a large squeeze to the Thieves’ Guild, and another to that of the beggars, that their members may let me alone.” Elizabeth Foreman Lewis (1932). Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze, p. 182. Philadelphia: John C. Winston. For the river ships were full of professional thieves. When they became so great a pest that business was lessened because of them, the owners of the vessels paid the thieves’ guild a certain sum of money to stay off the ships for a while. Pearl S. Buck (1936). Fighting Angel, p. 125. New York: Reynal & Hitchcock. An early occurrence in science fiction is in a 1961 story by Cordwainer Smith, who had served in China in the war. Bozart was not trained against deception by a technician; it never occurred to the Thieves’ Guild back on Viola Siderea that it would be necessary for their own people to resist deceivers. Cordwainer Smith (1961). ‘Mother Hitton’s Littul Kittons’. In Galaxy, June 1961, p. 107. Another early adopter was Andre Norton: If a man could raise the price to buy into the Thieves’ Guild and so open a door out of this rat hole, Stowar was the negotiator. Andre Norton (1964). Night of Masks, p. 12. New York: Harcourt, Brace & World."
Why is the order of The Chronicles of Narnia changed from original publication?,"The question of reading order for The Chronicles of Narnia is a complicated one, with much debate even among avid fans of the series. But you've asked only why publishers changed the order, which is much easier to answer objectively than which order is ""best""/preferable. The answer lies in a letter which Lewis wrote, dated April 1957, to a young American fan named Laurence Kreig. The boy preferred internal chronological order (starting with The Magician's Nephew) while his mother preferred publication order (starting with The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe). Lewis said: I think I agree with your order for reading the books more than with your mother's. The series was not planned beforehand as she thinks. When I wrote The Lion I did not know I was going to write any more. Then I wrote P. Caspian as a sequel and still didn't think there would be any more, and when I had done The Voyage I felt quite sure it would be the last, but I found I was wrong. So perhaps it does not matter very much in which order anyone read them. I’m not even sure that all the others were written in the same order in which they were published. I never keep notes of that sort of thing and never remember dates. In C.S. Lewis's Collected Letters, Volume 3, pp. 847-8, the following footnote is added to this letter: In the summer of 1963 Lewis had Walter Hooper write down the order in which he preferred the stories to be read: The Magician’s Nephew; The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; The Horse and His Boy; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the ‘Dawn Treader’; The Silver Chair; and The Last Battle. Regarding the order in which the stories were written, see CG, ‘The Writing of the Narnias’, pp. 401–5. The US publication rights were originally owned by Macmillan, who preferred the original publication order starting with The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. In 1994, Harper Collins took over the US publication rights, and they changed the order to internal chronological order starting with The Magician's Nephew. Why? In the 2005 Harper Collins editions, the publishers added the following note: Although The Magician's Nephew was written several years after C. S. Lewis first began The Chronicles of Narnia, he wanted it to be read as the first book in the series. HarperCollins is happy to present these books in the order in which Professor Lewis preferred. TL;DR: Lewis himself expressed a preference for internal chronological order, at least a couple of times, and the publishers of later editions decided to follow this.

Why Did Doyle Choose 221B Baker Street?,"All the unreputable Internet sources indicate that the numbering on Baker Street in Doyle's lifetime was only up to 100. Apparently Doyle initially called the street ""Upper Baker Street"".  One theory is that Doyle chose 221B - a non-existing address - to avoid some poor fella living there from receiving piles of mail an unwanted clients - which is the theory I subscribe to, as this is what a decent man would do. Apart from that, there is no information I could find that would explain why Sir Arthur Conan Doyle chose 221B of all possible (higher-than-100) addresses. Doyle himself lived at 1 Bush Villas in Elm Grove, Southsea, Portsmouth, at the approximate time of writing his first stories. Wikipedia lists no accounts of Doyle living or working near Baker Street. References (most copy each other verbatim anyway):"
How did the Inklings originate?,"The well-known Inklings was a literary discussion group, and that is exactly what they did. There was a preceding group where they got the name from, which was founded for the purpose of reading aloud unfinished compositions. When this initiative folded with the departure of its founder Edward Tangye Lean in 1933, Tolkien and Lewis, both members of the original group, transferred the name to their own group at Magdalen. Formed around Lewis and Tolkien and being invitation only, it was a gathering of like-minded spirits valuing narrative in fiction and encouraging the writing of fantasy. Apparently it was discussion as well as the reading aloud of their unfinished works, receiving both praise and candid criticism. According to Tolkien, Lewis took particular pleasure in listening to others read their works aloud, having a phenomenal capacity to remember these texts. Tolkien summed up the spirit of Inklings meetings when he called it “a feast of reason and flow of soul” (Letters, 102). On the connection between the two 'Inklings' societies, Tolkien later said ""although our habit was to read aloud compositions of various kinds (and lengths!), this association and its habit would in fact have come into being at that time, whether the original short-lived club had ever existed or not."" The name “Inklings” itself is a bit of whimsy, a pun on those who dabble in ink—writers--and those who may only have an inkling of what they intend to write about when they begin a project. The golden years of the Inklings seem to have been from the late 1930s to the mid-1940s, when the group heard J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings read aloud, as well as C.S. Lewis’s Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra, and Charles Williams’ All Hallows Eve. References:"
Were English poets of the sixteenth century aware of the Great Vowel Shift?,"TL;DR: As late as the beginning of the 17th century, the editor Thomas Speght claimed that it was possible for a skillful reader to scan Chaucer. But he modernized Chaucer’s spelling, making it hard for anyone after him to do the same! It seems that in the mid-16th century, some people still knew, or thought they knew, how to scan Chaucer. Gavin Douglas, in the preface to his translation of Virgil’s Aeneid, published 1533, praised Chaucer as “horleige and reguleir” (that is, as regular as a clock), and the antiquarian John Stow, in the preface to his 1561 edition of Chaucer’s works, wrote without further comment that the poet possessed “soche perfection in metre”. But by the end of the 16th century the skill must have fallen into desuetude, for Thomas Speght, the editor of The Workes of Our Ancient and learned English Poet, Geoffrey Chaucer, felt the need to justify the claim that Chaucer could be scanned. In his preface to the second edition (1602) he wrote thus: And for his verses, although in divers places they may seeme to us to stand of unequall measures: yet a skilfull Reader, that can scan them in their nature, shall find it otherwise. And if a verse here and there fal out a sillable shorter or longer than another, I rather aret it to the negligence and rape of Adam Scrivener,† that I may speake as Chaucer doth, than to any unconning or oversight in the Author: For how fearfull he was to have his works miswritten, or his verse mismeasured, may appeare in the end of his fift booke of Troylus and Creseide, where he writeth thus: And for there is so great diversitie
In English and in writing of our tongue,
So pray I God that none miswrite thee,
Ne thee mismetre for defaut of tongue, &c. Moreover, whereas in the explanation of the old words, sundry of their significations by me given, may to some seeme conjectural, yet such as understand the Dialects of our tongue, especially in the North, and have knowledge in some other languages, will judge otherwise […] Thomas Speght (1602). Preface to The Workes of Our Ancient and learned English Poet, Geoffrey Chaucer. London: Adam Islip. † Chaucer’s scrivener (copyist), to whom he wrote a short complaint in verse. This passage implies that Speght knew that the pronunciation of words had changed, and that Chaucer’s verse had scanned in the original. And he indicates that at that period there existed regional dialects which preserved old pronunciations and vocabulary, so that a skilful reader familiar with these dialects could make out Chaucer’s scansion. (Sadly Speght gives us no other clues as to how much he knew about the change in pronunciation—he was more concerned with explaining Chaucer’s “old and obscure words”.) However, lacking knowledge of Middle English, Speght’s readers must have had difficulty in making out these implications. And sure enough, less than a century later, John Dryden read Speght’s claim that Chaucer could be scanned by a skilful reader and did not believe it: ’Tis true, I cannot go so far as he who publish’d the last Edition of him; for he would make us believe the Fault is in our Ears, and that there were really Ten Syllables in a Verse where we find but Nine: But this Opinion is not worth confuting; ’tis so gross and obvious an Errour, that common Sense (which is a Rule in everything but Matters of Faith and Revelation) must convince the Reader, that Equality of Numbers, in every Verse which we call Heroick, was either not known, or not always practis’d, in Chaucer’s Age. It were an easie Matter to produce some thousands of his Verses, which are lame for want of half a Foot, and sometimes a whole one, and which no Pronunciation can make otherwise. We can only say, that he liv’d in the Infancy of our Poetry, and that nothing is brought to Perfection at the first. We must be Children before we grow Men. There was an Ennius, and in process of Time a Lucilius, and a Lucretius, before Virgil and Horace; even after Chaucer there was a Spencer, a Harrington, a Fairfax, before Waller and Denham were in being: And our Numbers were in their Nonage till these last appear’d. John Dryden (1700). Preface to Fables ancient and modern: translated into verse, from Homer, Ovid, Boccace, & Chaucer: with original poems. London: Jacob Tonson. The reason that Dryden did not believe Speght, I think, is that the latter had modernized the spelling, thus erasing many clues to the Middle English pronunciation of the words! It is ironic because this is the very thing that Chaucer had prayed should not happen in the passage that Speght quoted from Troilus and Creseyde. We can see the problem clearly a couple of pages later in Dryden’s Preface, where he quotes a passage from Chaucer’s General Prologue to The Canterbury Tales (in Speght’s spelling) and complains that “you have likewise more than one Example of his unequal Numbers”. For example, in Speght’s spelling, the line: Or feine things, or find words new appears to have only eight syllables. But if we look at the 1542 edition of The Canterbury Tales, the spelling is: Or feyne thynges, or fynde wordes newe and with this spelling, there is little difficulty in finding ten syllables that scan. The fact that Speght modernized Chaucer’s spelling casts some doubt on the possibility that he personally was able to scan Chaucer, for if he had known of the importance of the terminal e he would surely not have been so diligent in removing it. This suggests to me that Speght and his contemporaries in the late 16th century were still aware that Chaucer ought to scan, but no longer knew how to do it. Here’s a passage from George Gascoigne giving a similar impression: Also our father Chaucer hath used the same libertie in féete and measures that the Latinists do use: and who so ever do peruse and well consider his workes, he shall finde that although his lines are not alwayes of one selfe same number of Syllables, yet beyng redde by one that hath understanding, the longest verse and that which hath most Syllables in it, will fall (to the eare) correspondent unto that whiche hath fewest sillables in it: and like wise that whiche hath in it fewest syllables, shal be founde yet to consist of woordes that haue suche naturall sounde, as may séeme equall in length to a verse which hath many moe sillables of lighter accentes. George Gascoigne (1575). ‘Certayne notes of instruction in English verse’. In Edward Arber, ed. (1869). English Reprints: George Gascoigne, p. 34. London: 5 Queen Square, Bloomsbury. In the same year as Dryden, Samuel Wesley published a similar account: Of Chaucer’s Verse we scarce the Measures know,
So rough the Lines, and so unequal flow;
Whether by Injury of Time defac’d,
Or careless at the first, and writ in haste;
Or coursly, like old Ennius, he design’d
What After-days have polish’d and refin’d. Samuel Wesley (1700). An Epistle to a Friend Concerning Poetry, p. 12. London: Charles Harper. The comparison of Chaucer to Ennius, the “father of Roman poetry”, was a commonplace, for example Aston Cokayne called Chaucer “our true Ennius, whose old book / Hath taught our Nation so to Poetize” (‘A Remedy for Love’, 1658). Wesley, unlike Dryden, does realize that the difficulties may be due to “injury of time” (that is, to change of language) rather than incompetence of the poet. A couple of decades after Dryden and Wesley, John Urry repeated Speght’s claim but affirmed Dryden’s skepticism. Chaucer’s pronunciation must have been truly lost at this point. It is thought by some that his Verses every where consist of an equal number of feet; and that if read with a right accent, are no where deficient; but those nice discerning Persons would find it difficult, with all their straining and working, to spin out some of his Verses into a meafure of ten Syllables. He was not altogether regardless of his Numbers; but his thoughts were more intent upon solid sense than gingle, and he tells us plainly that we must not expect regularity in all his Verses.† John Urry (1721). Preface to The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer. London: Bernard Lintot. † The House of Fame, book III: “Yet make it somwhat agreable / Though some verse fayle in a syllable.” (With thanks to Peter Shor, who found the passage from Dryden.)"

"How much of ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" is based on real events?","Ernest Hemingway traveled to Madrid in March of 1937 to observe the Spanish Civil war firsthand.  He reported on the war for the North American Newspaper Alliance.  In March 1937, he traveled to Madrid to observe conditions firsthand.  His observations and experiences provide the inspiration for the novel.  The Spanish Civil War lasted from July 1936 - March 1939.  To give a brief summary, the war was fought between the Loyalists who were defending the current Government against the Nationalists or ""fascists"" (as Hemingway referred to them) which were supported by Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler and were led by General Francisco Franco. Hemingway sympathized with the loyalists as is evident in this novel.  One of the main examples of this is the protagonist, Robert Jordan who fights on the side of the loyalists against Franco's ""fascist"" forces.  Another example is Robert Jordan's love interest, Maria who was raped and orphaned by the fascist regime. The following are events that actually happened and are referenced in the novel:  The events at Ronda  This is a somewhat controversial topic. Whether or not what Hemingway describes in the novel actually took place is debatable.  I am only including it in this list due to the fact that there was an actual uprising in 1936 that took place in the south, but historians still are unable to pinpoint exactly where or exactly what occurred during this uprising.  Some sources speculate that some 7,000 priests, monks and nuns were slaughtered while their churches burned while others speculate that Hemingway's depiction of events is accurate.  Hemingway describes this in detail in Chapter 10 of the novel.  He describes 500 people who are allegedly fascist sympathizers being thrown off of a cliff side from a house.  Hemingway himself even has conflicting quotes regarding this event.  He tells his friend A.E. Hotchner: When Pilar remembers back to what happened in their village when the
  fascists came, that's Ronda, and the details of the town are exact. However, in a 1954 letter to his friend Bernard Berenson, Hemingway admitted to completely fabricating the scene.   The most significant part of the novel is the bridge that Robert Jordan is planning to blow up.  The bridge and the planning of its demise is the central plot to the novel.  There has never been any definitive proof that the bridge in the novel was real.  Hemingway never spoke of the bridge being an actual bridge.  Literary scholars maintain that the bridge is simply used as a metaphor."
What circumstances is Bachchan referring to in this poem?,"Please note: Since there is no source available which states on which year exactly this poem was written, it becomes difficult to predict what exact situation poet might be referring to. But considering the lifespan of poet and the meaning of the poem itself, I have written my own assumptions. If you find the year at which the poem is written, I will happily edit the answer accordingly. The translation is not correct. First, let me clarify the meaning of a few words and improve the translation of this poem which will automatically clarify its central meaning: Therefore, a proper translation of the poem is: मानव पर जगती का शासन, - There is a constant pressure of (so called) development on humans जगती पर संसृति का बंधन, - Development is restricted by unity (being one) संसृति को भी और किसी के प्रतिबंधों में रहना होगा! - Anyone else will oppose (restrict) convergence (unity) साथी, सब कुछ सहना होगा! - (And therefore) You will have to tolerate this all, my friend. So, the central meaning of the poem is: True development is not in proving how powerful a nation or race is, but in unity, oneness and convergence. But convergence and unity are manipulated (restricted) by the same humans to get power (personal development). This ultimately leads the same humans to suffer. Coming to question..
What circumstances the poet is referring to? Well, I found no source which shows the exact year in which this poem was written. But Harivanshrai (born in 1907) was living in that era where India was ruled over by the British, and the entire World went to war twice (the First and Second World Wars). So we can assume, that the poem might be referring to those wars and worthless conflicts happening. On a personal note, We can also assume that this piece would have been written for his son Amitabh Bachchan when he was dumped by the same people who had made him a star."
How did people know the meaning to Shakespeare's new words?,"Actually, most of the new words appears to have based on existing words to some extent: either taking a noun and turning into a verb or vice versa (one example of this would be ""to dawn""), or shortening a word or adding a new beginning ending (""irregulous""), or joining two words together (""eyeball""): all these would be rather easily understood. More difficult, but not impossible for at least parts of his audience, would be borrowing words from other languages, especially Latin. These would have covered the majority of his new words. There were a few exceptions, but some of those are onomatopoeia, such as ""gnarling"". Ther remains a very few beyond that, and for those, such as ""potch"" (Coriolanus: ""I'll potch at him some way""), we have to remember that some sounds actually have a sort of meaning. Take ""slimy"", ""slither"" and ""sliding"": it would seem that ""sli"" suggest a certain meaning, so a hypothetical word formed with that combination (""slinny"") would suggest something similar. Context would also help. If you really want to see how one can ""understand"" a totally new word, I would suggest reading some nonsense verse, such as Jabberwocky. I found this to be a useful overview of words first appearing in Shakespeare; from the same site is a more in-depth coverage of how he coined words (at the end of which are a few entirely new words). For the meaning of sounds, this Wikipedia article gives some introduction (I have also read about it in books on linguistics, but those were in Swedish)."

"227 days in Life of Pi, coincidence or symbolical?","I found this interview with Yann Martel, from which two of his answers in particular jumped out at me: I chose the name Pi because it's an irrational number (one with no discernable pattern). Yet scientists use this irrational number to come to a ""rational"" understanding of the universe. To me, religion is a bit like that, ""irrational"" yet with it we come together we come to a sound understanding of the universe. I wanted an Indian animal. At first I had an adolescent Indian elephant. But that was too comical. Then a rhino, but rhinos are herbivores and didn't see how I could keep a herbivore alive for 227 days in the Pacific. So finally I settled on what now seems the natural choice, a tiger. The first quote tells us that the author had the concept of rationality and irrationality, and the connections as well as the contrast between them, in his mind while writing the book. This sounds similar to the rational approximation 22/7 for the irrational number pi, and makes it more likely that this was indeed an intentional reference. The second quote suggests that the length of time was somehow significant. Why, instead of changing the animal to one more likely to survive for 227 days, did Martel not instead change the time period to one a rhino was more likely to survive? Which brings me to (IMO) the most compelling argument: why specify the number of days at all? It seems quite strange and unrealistic that Pi or anyone else would even be able to keep track of the days during that surreal voyage; ""several months"" would surely be a more reasonable way of describing the period. But no, it's stated as exactly two hundred and twenty-seven days. Why bother to give a precise number at all, unless it's somehow significant? And given that it's significant, exactly what its significance is then becomes obvious, tying in with the title and the name of Pi."
How much experience did Tolkien have in writing?,"He wrote some (fiction) stories before LOTR, yes. The Father Christmas Letters were written for his children, he wrote them pretending to be Santa. Roverrandom, a children's book about a dog and a wizard. Farmer Giles of Ham, a comical fable about a farmer. He also wrote more stories after LOTR, in addition to a couple (non-fiction) research papers before that. So he wasn't entirely new to writing in general."
"Meaning of 'Yawl write, hear?'","You've got it right. As you've recognized, this is dialect. Yawl - this is a less common way of spelling the dialectical y'all, which is used as the second person plural. Hear - this is a shortened form of the expression you hear, which is used in the same dialect as a rhetorical way of asking for confirmation or assent. In more standard (but still informal) American English, the same sentence could be phrased: ""You guys make sure to write to me, ok?"""
"What does ""N. takes M."" mean in ""Emma""?","This is fairly obscure, but (like any good riddle) obvious when you have the right information to see the answer. Have a look at The Form of Solemnization of Matrimony from the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer: essentially, the stuff that a priest would say during an Anglican wedding ceremony. I publish the Banns of Marriage between M. of - and N. of -. [...] I N. take thee N. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth. I N. take thee N. to my wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love, cherish, and to obey, till death us do part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto I give thee my troth. In this pretty official document, ""M."" and ""N."" are used as placeholders to represent the names that the priest should read out at the beginning of the ceremony. Later on, when the couple are taking their vows, it's only ""N."" that's used, but other versions of the Book of Common Prayer (such as this one from c. 1800-1820 - thanks @GarethRees) consistently use ""N."" for the bride and ""M."" for the groom. Note the appearance of the phrase ""for better, for worse"", so that in the versions which consistently differentiate between ""N."" and ""M."", we literally have the line ""I N. take thee M. [...] for better for worse"", almost exactly the same as in your quoted passage. This confirms that we've solved the riddle correctly and found what's being referred to. So yes, it is ""an abbreviation of the names of a couple getting married"", as you guessed. But not a specific couple: rather, ""N."" and ""M."" are essentially the ""John and Jane Doe"" of Church of England documentation. Thanks to this site for pointing me to the correct answer. It also contains further information about the usage or non-usage of ""M."" in different editions: In the earlier versions of the prayerbook, this ""N."" occurred wherever either the man's name or the woman's name was to be spoken as part of the wedding ceremony. In most later editions of the prayerbook, in order to prevent any possible confusion as to where the man's name was to be spoken, and where the woman's name, two different letters have been used -- ""M."" was introduced to mark places where the man's name should be said, while ""N."" was left to mark places where the woman's name should be said. The differentiation was probably done in this way merely because the man's name is usually said before the woman's name in the ceremony, and ""M."" comes before ""N."" in the alphabet; as far as I'm aware, there is no deeper significance to the particular choice of letters for the man's and woman's names, and the letter ""M."" doesn't seem to abbreviate anything (in the way that ""N."" can be said to abbreviate nomen). (One ingenious suggestion, that ""M."" and ""N."" were intended to stand for Latin maritus ""husband"" and nupta ""bride"", must remain rather doubtful.)"
Why is Gatsby great?,"It seems to have been the editor who proposed the title, and the author didn't like it much. The original suggestion seems to have come from Fitzgerald's editor and friend, Maxwell Perkins: I always thought that ""The Great Gatsby"" was a suggestive and effective title, -- with only the vaguest knowledge of the book, of course. But anyway, the last thing we want to do is divert you to any degree, from your actual writing, and if you let matters rest just as they are now, we shall be perfectly satisfied. The book is the thing, and all the rest is inconsiderable beside it. -- Maxwell Perkins to F. Scott Fitzgerald, 16 Apr 1924 (source) When the author first sent the book to Perkins, he titled it The Great Gatsby but was unsure of this title: Under separate cover I'm sending you my third novel: The Great Gatsby. [...] I have an alternative title: Gold-hatted Gatsby. After you've read the book let me know what you think about the title. -- F. Scott Fitzgerald to Maxwell Perkins, 27 Oct 1924 (source) Before his editor even had the chance to reply to this letter, he sent another, amended, version and changed the title to Trimalchio in West Egg: Trimalchio in West Egg. The only other titles that seem to fit it are Trimalchio and On the Road to West Egg. I had two others, Gold-hatted Gatsby and The High-bouncing Lover, but they seemed too light. -- F. Scott Fitzgerald to Maxwell Perkins, 7 Nov 1924 (source) Perkins responded as follows: Now deal with this question: various gentlemen here don't like the title,—in fact none like it but me. To me, the strange incongruity of the words in it sound the note of the book. But the objectors are more practical men than I. Consider as quickly as you can the question of a change. -- Maxwell Perkins to F. Scott Fitzgerald, 18 Nov 1924 (source) After persuasion from both his wife and his editor, Fitzgerald agreed to the title The Great Gatsby. But months later, even when the book was about to be published, he was still trying to make last-minute changes to the title: On 7 March [1925], Fitzgerald cabled Perkins to ask if it was too late to change the novel’s title because he wanted to revert to “Gold-Hatted Gatsby” or “Trimalchio.” Perkins replied on 9 March: “Title change would cause bad delay and confusion.” And on the nineteenth Fitzgerald cabled again: CRAZY ABOUT TITLE UNDER THE RED WHITE AND BLUE STOP WHART WOULD DELAY BE. By then it was too late. -- source The book was published on 10 April 1925 under the title The Great Gatsby. As in this similar question about an unrelated work, there may be an element of irony or even sarcasm in the title. Perhaps Gatsby really is as bad as you say, and the title refers to him as ""Great"" as an ironic way of pointing up how un-Great he actually is. But there are other interpretations. For instance, this article considers the question of what makes Gatsby ""great"" and makes the case that he actually is great, as a character and arguably as a person too. Readers might admire him or find his story relatable: Perhaps Gatsby is no more than a simple man who lives, loves, and dies. But perhaps he is much more than that – a hero for all dreamers, one who stands for the survival of his dreams even in the face of unconquerable adversity, and one who dies tragically, an honorable yet empty man, with an army of faithful readers mourning his defeat in death but unceasingly admiring his disposition in life. Perhaps, just maybe, it is what he is fighting for that everyone can relate to. When it comes down to it, Gatsby is fighting to chase a love that is slipping too quickly into his past for him to catch. We, as the readers, know that Gatsby’s desire for Daisy’s love is a hopeless case, yet we want so badly for him to be happy; it is this paradox that brings us all together in support of Gatsby. It is what makes us hate Daisy when she cries over the shirts. It is what makes us love him when he puts his pride aside to hide in the bushes to make sure she is alright. It is what makes us sick when Gatsby’s body is floating dead in his pool. It is what makes us feel as though we are there at his funeral, mourning the loss of a close friend. Gatsby's success story is also one that could well be called ""great"", and which Americans in particular might admire and identify with: [Fitzgerald] created Jay Gatsby to embody the American dream. That unique American ability to go from rags to riches. A dream that is the epitome of all dreams, and that all people have dreamt at one time or another: The poor boy or the broke soldier having the very very rich girl, and rising to the class of the rich and famous. [...] in a mere 3 years, he went from nothing to owning one of the largest houses in New York speaking to the most powerful people around, and throwing parties that every important person in the Us attended. This is the American Dream. And more than that: as well as being financially successful, Gatsby has a personal life which is arguably dominated by self-sacrifice. What you describe as ""quite delusional in his love affairs"" could also be described as a man who will do anything for love, even to the extent of sacrificing his own life. Even though F. Scott Fitzgerald could have stopped there, he did not feel that James Gatz had truly become great. He points out that Gatsby, unlike everyone else, achieved this greatness for love. When one person selflessly gives themselves, sacrifices themselves, sacrifices everything they have, and even gives their life for someone else; they are greater than anyone. Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy, to win her love, is the dream he lives for, and hope sustains him. Daisy is Gatsby's version of the American Dream, the love of his life, the perfect housewife, the ultimate status, ""the king's daughter, the golden girl"" (however all of these qualities are just Gatsby's idealization of her after dreaming about her for five years) and he is willing to sacrificing everything to obtain her. James Gatz lived his entire life to love Daisy. When he shows her the stuff in his house, he's showing her the house he has created for her. He doesn't really care for any of this - it's all done specifically for her. Even the parties stopped when she didn't like them. [...] 
  In the end, he says that he will tell the police that he was driving, he waits outside her house like a gallant knight, and finally takes a bullet for her so that she may live on. Jay Gatsby has lived and created all that he has in the name of love and the name of Daisy, not James Gatz or Jay Gatsby.
  The last comment from Gatsby is about Daisy coming to him, and Nick responds by stating that Gatsby is better then all of them. So Gatsby dies for love and for the people. Moreover he is great in all desires and all his dids. [sic] (emphasis mine)"

"Was Paradise Lost the first major work of literature to give ""sympathy for the devil""?","As asked, the question is difficult to answer. Several premises are open to question: Keeping these issues in mind, let's see how one could think one's way to an answer. To begin with, as @eirikdaude pointed out in a comment to the question, that Satan is the hero of Paradise Lost cannot be taken for granted. William Blake was the first to assert that Milton was ""of the devil's party"", but since then, there have always been detractors. A blurb to Stanley Fish's 1967 book, Surprised by Sin, says: In 1967 the world of Milton studies was divided into two armed camps: one proclaiming (in the tradition of Blake and Shelley) that Milton was of the devil’s party with or without knowing it, the other proclaiming (in the tradition of Addison and C.S. Lewis) that the poet’s sympathies are obviously with God and the angels loyal to him. Fish's book sought to bridge the gap between the two camps by an ingenious argument. Of course Satan is presented sympathetically and attractively in Paradise Lost: Milton's point is that our being drawn to the devil shows how and why we are fallen. We fall because the devil is attractive, and we are fallen to find him so. Milton deliberately traps us into sympathy with the devil, so that we realize and understand our fallen nature. We are, in short, surprised into and by sin. [Obiter dicta: Personally I think Fish rather than Milton has devised this wonderful way for the latter to have his cake and eat it too. But then, what one reads for has changed between 1967 and now. Those few who read Milton at all these days don't do so to figure out what his intentions were, or even to psychologize him and say that his Christian superego is unable to mask the desires of his Satan-worshipping id. That said, on its own terms, Fish's monograph is a brilliant piece of work.] So it's not so much that Milton has sympathy for the devil. It's that he knowingly makes the devil appear sympathetic in order to drive home the real point of his poem. And his portrayal of a sympathetic Satan has plenty of antecedents in English literature. One such is Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus. Both Faustus himself and Mephistopheles are sympathetic characters. As a fervent opponent of censorship who believed that truth would not emerge unless we test it against falsehood, Milton probably felt some kinship with Faustus's thirst for all knowledge. As for Mephistopheles, this smooth-talking charmer also has elements of the tragic hero. When Faustus asks how it is that a devil can escape the confines of Hell, Mephistopheles replies: Why this is hell, nor am I out of it.
Think’st thou that I who saw the face of God,
And tasted the eternal joys of Heaven,
Am not tormented with ten thousand hells,
In being depriv’d of everlasting bliss? Even earlier than Marlowe, the Old English poem ""Christ and Satan"" (if it please you to consider it sufficiently ""major"") presents Satan in a similar vein. Satan's lament at his fate is very moving: Nu ic eom asceaden     fram þære sciran driht,
alæded fram leohte     in þone laðan ham.
Ne mæg ic þæt gehicgan     hu ic in ðæm becwom,
in þis neowle genip,     niðsynnum fah,
aworpen of worulde.     Wat ic nu þa
þæt bið alles leas     ecan dreamas
se ðe heofencyninge     heran ne þenceð,
meotode cweman.     Ic þæt morðer sceal,
wean and witu     and wrace dreogan,
goda bedæled,     iudædum fah,
þæs ðe ic geþohte adrifan     drihten of selde,
weoroda waldend;     sceal nu wreclastas
settan sorhgcearig,     siðas wide.     (lines 176–188) Michael D. C. Drout reads these lines aloud between the 2:40 and 3:30 marks of this podcast. Aaron K. Hostetter translates them as follows: Now I am separated from that gleaming host, withdrawn
from the light into this hateful home. Nor can I conceive
how I have come into this place, into this abjected cloud,
stained with malicious sins, cast out of the world.
I know now this fact: that he will deny us the joys of eternity,
he that is the Heaven-King, and all who do not think to obey
or please the Measurer. I must endure this killing,
this woe and this torment and wrack, deprived of good things,
marked by my former-deeds, because I thought to drive the Lord
from his throne, the Sovereign of Armies. I must now set myself
upon the ways of exile, sorrowing, upon these wide paths. Charles Kennedy has a different prose translation: I  am  rejected from  the  heavenly  host,  cast  out  from  light  into  this  loathsome  home.  I may  not  well  bethink  me  how  I  fell  thus  low,  into  this  deep  abyss, stained  with  my  sins,  and  cast  out  from  the  world.  Now  I  know  that  he will  forfeit  all  eternal  joy  who  thinketh  not  to  serve  the  King  of  heaven and  please  the  Lord.  Needs  must  I  undergo  correction,  vengeance  and punishment  and  pain,  stripped  of  every  good,  stained  by  my  former deeds,  because  I  thought  to  drive  God  from  His  throne,  the  Lord  of hosts.  Now,  sorrowful  and  full  of  care,  I  needs  must  go  an  exile-journey, a  wandering  wide.     (page 5) Jeffrey Burton Russell says that the poem achieves additional power by coloring Satan as a Teutonic hero, defeated yet proud in facing his wyrd, his implacable fate.     (p. 144) So the idea that Satan could be charming, or sympathetic, or heroic, has a long history prior to Milton. And Milton perhaps expected us to succumb to his charms. Nevertheless, it does not follow that Milton wanted us to maintain our sympathies for Satan. Given the overall arc of his personal life, political engagements, and written works, it seems safe to say that he would be shocked and alarmed by that interpretation. One might instead read Paradise Lost as very much a Reformation poem: a work written in the thick of the Reformation, as a way of engaging with the question of the relationship between humankind and God. The work seeks to ""justify the ways of God to men"": to explain directly, and without any intervening church, how sin, grace, and redemption operate in our human world."
"Censorship of African-American characters in ""Tintin in America""","The first efforts to market Tintin to an American readership happened in the early 1960s, in the ill-fated ""Golden Press debacle"", when, among other things, the American publisher Golden Press demanded the removal of scenes of the consumption of alcohol (what would happen to Captain Haddock?), wanted to rename ""Snowy"" to ""Buddy"", and also required the removal of black characters from The Crab with the Golden Claws: The US censors didn’t approve of mixing races in children’s books, so
the artist created new frames, replacing black deckhand Jumbo with
another character, possibly of Puerto-Rican origin. Elsewhere, a black
character shown whipping Captain Haddock was replaced by someone of
North African appearance. The effort flopped, however, and the release of Tintin albums in the USA stagnated until the publishing house Atlantic-Little, Brown took over the rights in the 1970s. As the Wikipedia article notes, problems again arose with the depiction of black characters, this time in Tintin in America.
From Thompson's 1991 book Tintin: Hergé and his creation, cited in the Wikipedia article: The Americans put themselves firmly in the wrong when they refused to
print any frames that pictured black people at all. Outrageously, as
late as the 1960s, Hergé was forced to go over parts of his work and
remove black characters. The doorman at the half-built bank in this
same scene was originally black, as were the mother and baby whom
Tintin inadvertently disturbs on page 47. Micheal Farr's work Tintin The Complete Companion (freely available from the Internet Archive) notes that just three frames were changed: Hergé returned for a third time to the American adventure for a 1973
edition, when apart from tightening up the formatting of the script by
cutting out whenever possible hyphenated breaks, he made significant
concessions to his  American publishers by removing in three cases
blacks from the narrative. They objected to the placing of blacks
alongside whites in a story destined for young readers. [The album had first been released in black and white in 1932 and been transferred to color, and generally tightened up, in 1946, hence the remark that Hergé returned to it ""for the third time""]. The three frames in question are on the first page: when Al Capone address his henchmen, the black man on the far right is changed to a swarthy Italian/Puerto Rican type character in the new version. On page 29 the commissionaire on duty at the ""Petroleum and Cactus Bank"" was changed from a black to a white man, and on page 47 a mother and her crying baby were changed from black to white.  Although done for bad reasons - presumably as in the 1960s this was done to remove evidence of racial desegregation, although neither Farr nor Thompson explicitly state this, or who required it - it was not wholly a bad thing. The images of black people Hergé drew are rather stereotypical and offensive. Thompson gives the publication date of the English version of Tintin in America as 1978, post-dating the redrawing, so it seems there was no previous English language version which contained the African-American characters. Some European translations were made earlier, but I have not been able to locate one, to see the African-American characters in a color version of the album."
Why does the Lady of Shalott stay instead of stray?,"The word stay here means stop or pause. From Merriam-Webster: intransitive verb 1:  to stop going forward :  pause 2:  to stop doing something :  cease Or from the Macmillan dictionary:  4 [transitive] formal to stop something such as a court case from continuing
The defence has filed a petition to stay proceedings. The sense is:  If the lady stops her weaving in order to look down to Camelot, a curse will take effect.  The lines you've quoted are from the 1842 version of the poem, which uses stay intransitively and obscures the sense a bit. The corresponding lines in the 1833 version use the verb transitively, and make the sense clearer: No time hath she to sport and play:
  A charmed web she weaves alway.
  A curse is on her, if she stay
  Her weaving, either night or day,
      To look down to Camelot. (Emphasis added) That of course is exactly what happens. The lady sees Lancelot in the mirror, stops weaving, and rushes to the window to catch a further glimpse of him as he rides down to Camelot. This sets the curse in motion. "
Are there recorded instances of asexuality in the body of ancient Greek writings?,"There are a few gods and goddesses in ancient Greek mythology (assuming you count that as part of literature) who lead virgin lifestyles. Athena, Artemis, and Hestia come to mind as examples. Now of course, being a virgin doesn't necessarily imply being asexual - Artemis, for example, seems to recognise the idea of sexuality, and some stories even have it that she was in love with her hunting companion Orion. But I'm going to focus specifically on Athena.

First of all, even the manner of her creation hints at an unusual distance from sexuality. She wasn't born in the usual way, but sprang fully formed and armoured from the forehead of her father Zeus. Some versions of this myth say that Zeus slept with Metis before swallowing her in fear of her prophesied offspring, and that Metis then gave birth to Athena within Zeus, but this is not universally agreed upon. Justin Martyr's Apology says (emphasis mine): They said that Athena was the daughter of Zeus not from intercourse, but when the god had in mind the making of a world through a word his first thought was Athena. Obviously, by itself this doesn't tell us anything about Athena's own sexuality, but symbolically it connects her with the idea of asexuality from the very beginning of her life. A study of Athena by Karl Kerenyi links her virginal nature to her relationship with her father.

At least one version of the origin story of Erichthonius, born from the earth after Hephaestus's attempted rape of Athena, certainly makes her sound asexual. I don't have an original or 'noteworthy' source for this, but I found it here (emphasis mine): There is one story in which the god [Hephaestus] was told by Ares that Athena wanted to make love to him, so when she asked him to make her some new weapons, he said that the only payment he would need was her love. Athena didn't catch the innuendo. As far as she was concerned, love didn't equal sex. For her, love was what most people feel for their brothers and their sisters 
Finally, Athena is the goddess of wisdom and strategy. Her whole nature revolves around being calm, rational, and unemotional. Again, of course, this doesn't necessarily correlate with asexuality in the real world, but since we're talking about an idealised or even caricatured figure, from millennia ago to boot, it makes sense that the people writing about her might connect the two concepts. Either romantic love or sexual desire would be, in some sense, a departure from the pure reason which characterises Athena. She is always an advocate of rationality, and neither love nor sexuality are entirely rational impulses. While Artemis, for example, could have sexual desires without contradicting her status as the goddess of the hunt (or even the goddess of virginity - she was abstinent, not necessarily asexual), the whole concept seems to go against Athena's essential nature."
Why does Pinocchio's nose grow?,"Pinocchio is born dishonest. This is both true in a symbolic way, as well as a literal way. Quite literally the first thing Pinocchio does after being born is get Geppetto thrown in jail: ""Poor Marionette [Pinocchio],"" called out a man. ""I am not surprised he doesn't want to go home. Geppetto, no doubt, will beat him unmercifully, he is so mean and cruel!"" ""Geppetto looks like a good man,"" added another, ""but with boys he's a real tyrant. If we leave that poor Marionette in his hands he may tear him to pieces!"" They said so much that, finally, the Carabineer ended matters by setting Pinocchio at liberty and dragging Geppetto to prison. Pinocchio's self-portrayal to the world is already dishonest, and his inability to claim ownership over the bad he does is shown to be the central problem. And the story has barely even started. Pinocchio is born dishonest, a liar in a literal sense. Thankfully, Collodi does a great job of pointing this out to us at every turn: CHAPTER 4 The story of Pinocchio and the Talking Cricket, in which one sees that bad children do not like to be corrected by those who know more than they do. It's pretty obvious from the chapter headings - not just this one, but others included - that Pinocchio's portrayed as a child who was born ""bad."" The nose plays into this. Heck, minutes, maybe hours into his existence, he's already committed his first murder: Perhaps he did not think he would strike it. But, sad to relate, my dear children, he did hit the Cricket, straight on its head. With a last weak ""cri-cri-cri"" the poor Cricket fell from the wall, dead! Lying is ultimately used as an analogy for all of Pinocchio's bad behavior. Many of the subsequent sections of the book involve Pinocchio doing something bad, and then lying about it. Collodi helpfully lays the first instance out for us as a chapter heading: CHAPTER 17 Pinocchio eats sugar, but refuses to take medicine. When the undertakers come for him, he drinks the medicine and feels better. Afterwards he tells a lie and, in punishment, his nose grows longer and longer. Ultimately, the meaning of his nose growing is to set a precedent. When we later encounter the Curse of the Growing Nose, we know that it's because something about the way Pinocchio was made... makes him lie. He was born bad, and that's the point."
"When and why did ""No man is an island"" start being regarded as a poem?","The versification of this passage from Donne predates the widespread use of the Internet, as you’ll see from the earliest examples below. Moreover, it looks as though multiple editors have independently decided to format the passage as verse. The evidence for this is that different editors have chosen different ways to break up the passage into lines. We would not expect this to happen if they were copying from some shared source. Here are two  different eight-line versifications: No man is an island, entire of itself;
every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.
If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were,
as well as if a manor of thy friend’s or of thine own were:
any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind,
and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
it tolls for thee. Myrna Grant, ed. (1997) Poems for a Good and Happy Life, p. 104. Garden City: CrossAmerica. No man is an island, entire of itself;
Every man is a piece of the Continent, a part of the main;
If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less,
As well as if a promontory were,
As well as if a manor of thy friend’s or of thine own were;

And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;

and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;

It is hard to trace the origin of these versifications because available search tools tend not to have any way of searching for line breaks, so that the rare versified versions of Donne’s text are buried among the common prose versions. However, if an editor happens to introduce a corruption at the same time as the versification, then the search tools become much more helpful. Here’s an example of such a corrupted text in the form of a fourteen-line versification: No man is an island,
Entire of itself.
Each is a piece of the continent,
A part of the main.
If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less.
As well as if a promontory were.
As well as if a manner of thine own
Or of thine friend’s were.
Any man’s death diminishes me,
Because I am involved in mankind.
Therefore, send not to know
For whom the bell tolls,
It tolls for thee. Deborah Gaye, ed. (2010). Of Love and Hope, p. 152. London: Avalanche. Corruptions in bold. Some of these changes might be defensible, but “manner” for “manor” and “thine friend” for “thy friend” are just embarrassing mistakes. But this version is rare and so more easily traceable. For example, here it appears in a novel: The Sussex shore had been a haunt for smugglers. Towered over by the humps of the Seven Sisters and the knob of Beachy Head, pirates of old had hauled their contraband in through gaps in the cliff. The tales of these buccaneers provided J. M. Barrie with the inspiration for Captain Hook […] Lore like that cluttered Wyatt’s mind as he closed on the lonely cottage ahead. […] His epiphany was to recall John Donne, whose poem took on deeper meaning here at the rim: No man is an island,
Entire of itself.
Every man is a piece of the continent,
A part of the main.
If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less.
As well as if a promontory were.
As well as if a manner of thine own
Or of thine friend’s were.
Any man’s death diminishes me,
Because I am involved in mankind.
Therefore, send not to know
For whom the bell tolls,
It tolls for thee. Michael Slade (2008), Crucified, pp. 230–231. Sutton: Severn House. In the context of a novel, the errors are excusable, since we are told that the protagonist is recalling this “poem” from memory. In particular, the substitution of “manner of thine own” for Donne’s “manor … of thine own” is just the kind of trick that memory can play, because the protagonist’s recollections of stories of smugglers and pirates could have brought to mind a speech from Charles Kingsley’s Westward Ho!: If it is ordained that thou shouldst advance the ends of the brotherhood by being shark-bitten, or flea-bitten, or bitten by sharpers, to the detriment of thy carnal wealth, or, shortly, to suffer any shame or torment whatsoever, even to strappado and scarpines, thou art bound to obey thy destiny, and not, after that vain Roman conceit, to choose the manner of thine own death, which is indeed only another sort of self-murder. Charles Kingsley (1855). Westward Ho!, volume 2, p. 268. Cambridge: Macmillan. On the Internet, this corruption can be traced using the Wayback Machine to this capture in July 2005, and on Google Books to A Purpose for Life: Service (2005) by Alexander Zax. Whether one of these is the original of the corrupted text, or whether both are copying from some yet older shared source, is impossible for me to say."
What is the symbolism of the final rise of the Kraken?,"This interpretation is largely based on discussions I had with one of my professors and classmates about The Kraken and Tennyson’s use of symbolism in general. We believe that The Kraken, like other poems of Tennyson's, should be looked at with an idea of the political and social climes of the Victorian age. Tennyson’s work is often permeated with social and political commentary. We see many patriotic poems (Ode on the death of the duke of Wellington, The Charge of the Light Brigade, and others), especially surrounding his period as Poet Laureate. It may seem easy to criticize him as upholding the political ideas, rigid class system and moral codes of the Victorian era, and in a sense, this is true. Several views that we today might consider backward, for instance, are evident in Locksley Hall, in the narrator’s attitude towards women and non-Europeans - though these do not necessarily correspond with Tennyson’s own opinions. I’d specifically like to look at Tennyson’s views in revolution. F. J. Sypher’s Politics in the Poetry of Tennyson describes him as one who “praised revolution abroad, but not at home; who desired change, but not too fast”. Take a look at several lines from stanza CXIII of In Memoriam A.H.H. (highlighted by Christopher Ricks in Tennyson): Should licensed boldness gather force,
  Becoming, when the time has birth,
  A lever to uplift the earth
  And roll it in another course, With thousand shocks that come and go,
  With agonies, with energies,
  With overthrowings, and with cries
  And undulations to and fro. While a description of some of the passions and views of his friend (the inspiration for the poem), Arthur Henry Hallam, this also seems to support the idea that Tennyson agreed with revolution “when the time has birth” - in other words, when the time is right. However, this is not necessarily going to be easy, and it will come “with thousand shocks”, and terrible pain for the people involved. We see a more negative protrayal of bloody revolution in Idylls of the King, where revolt and civil war against King Arthur and his rule leads to his death, and the deaths of many in Camelot and the Round Table. Arthur, the spirit of Britain, was crushed by such abrupt change, just as the Victorian upper classes could be crushed by a revolt from below. Tennyson and the Fabric of Englishness looks at even darker views on revolution and social change coming from the working classes. You Ask Me, Why, Tho' Ill at Ease is forward and direct in criticizing worked organizations and worker rights: Should banded unions persecute
  Opinion, and induce a time
  When single thought is civil crime,
  And individual freedom mute; We can consider Tennyson less than enamored with such an idea, and indeed, other works of his dealt with real revolutions in other countries that he felt could threaten Britain. My fellow students, professor and I chose to interpret The Kraken in the political context, within the larger collection of Tennyson’s works. The Kraken itself may represent the working masses and their dreams of freedom, growing steadily larger under the elite upper-classes. Their revolutionary ideas of social change are in an “ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep”, as they always are during periods of political stability. However, their discontent, stuck in the depths of their minds and hearts, has grown bigger and bigger, until it is a monstrosity. Eventually, Tennyson feels, this will all burst. The Kraken - the masses - will rise as ”the latter fire” of revolution begins, throwing the country and perhaps the world into turmoil. The death of the creature is also symbolic. It could be an indication of Tennyson hoping that any resulting chaos will be short-lived or will fizzle out, or that another “cycle” of peace (to quote Sypher) will begin. Anyway, this is simply one interpretation of the poem, a consideration of Tennyson’s views on social and political change as a whole. I hope I’ve convinced anyone reading this that Tennyson did have varying thoughts on revolution and its implications, and that this may well be the underlying meaning of The Kraken. While it can be argued that the poem is an explanation of religion or of our deepest feelings, or that it should simply be taken literally, I think that the idea of sudden political change is also an equally valid stance."
"What justifies the anti-Tess interpretation of ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles""?","It was mainly due to the Victorian interpretations of several events and actions in the novel and subsequent comments from contemporary critics. Firstly, Tess committed murder when she killed Alec. Although the reader of course sympathises with Tess after all Alec did to her, it was still murder, and therefore immoral, in the eyes of Victorian law and hence Tess was heavily criticised for this act... and given the death penalty. Contemporary critic R. H. Hutton described Tess' actions thus: 'though pure in instinct, she was not faithful to her pure instinct' Furthermore as an aside, Hardy hints his views on Tess' crime and punishment (and thus Victorian society's views) in this line at the very end of the book: ""Justice"" was done Ch. 59 The presence of the quotation marks suggests Hardy's contempt of contemporary views on a situation like Tess'. They are unforgiving and condemn her without consideration of the crimes that the 'victim' (Alec) committed. The stress here is that he is criticising the same people who then criticised the subtitle of Tess of the d'Urbervilles. Secondly, Tess became an adulteress when she married Angel and then married Alec when Angel travels to Brazil, however she really thought he would never return, which makes it excusable in our eyes. But this adultery would have been shocking and inexcusable to the Victorians and would certainly have been classed as immoral. Thirdly, it was interpreted that, after Alec assaulted her, Tess lost what was called her 'physical purity' and hence Hardy came under fire for his subtitle of 'A Pure Woman (...)' since this contradicted the contemporary commonly accepted ideas of purity. (this article explains it well if you want to go into it.) I will paraphrase the basic idea: The Victorian idea was that 'purity' was lost in such a situation regardless whether consent was given. Virtue was synonimized with this 'purity' and hence Tess would not have been considered pure by many contemporary readers. In addition, there has been ambiguity over the scene in which Tess is violated by Alec (although it is usually decided that it was non-consensual - discussed in this question) there were obviously those who believed it to be a seduction and hence a fault and immorality on Tess' part. This was fueled by the commonly accepted belief at the time that (quoted from the thesis below): Olwen Hufton claims that the common Victorian belief was that pregnancy (...) “was held to demonstrate [the woman’s] active consent” So, many thought that Tess was additionally morally impure due to this event, due to the fact she did conceive Sorrow. Furthermore, there are also aspects of misogyny, as while Angel committed a consensual immoral act and Tess forgave him for it, when she confessed that she was violated as a young girl, an involuntary act in her case, he 'cannot' forgive her (reference)
: “Forgive me as you are forgiven! I forgive you, Angel.” “You–yes, you do.” “But you do not forgive me?” “O Tess, forgiveness does not apply to the case! You were one person; now you are another. My God–how can forgiveness meet such a grotesque–prestidigitation as that!” Ch. 35 Even though Angel admits that she was ""more sinned against than sinning"" he cannot forgive her as society's expectations were very different for women. They were expected to be strictly moral  but men's actions to the contrary were brushed under the carpet. In our time we cannot comprehend this injustice, but as early 20th century critic Norman Page noted: 'what is fairly obvious to the modern reader, however, would not have been obvious to all Victorian readers' Tess of the d'Urbervilles was Hardy's attempt at criticising this double standard among other negative aspects of Victorian society, a criticism which again caused controversy among his contemporaries. In regards to anti-Tess critics, Mowbray Morris published a heavily critical review soon after Tess was published, in the Quarterly Review, but I have been unable to find a copy to find exact explanations.

What is the Neverending Story's moral about power?,"It is first important to recognize what kind of story this is. It is about a young boy whose mother has died. His journey in the novel reflects his emotional growth, developing sense of identity and purpose, and acceptance of his mother's passing. The Childlike Empress does not rule Fantastica in the sense of giving orders - it's remarked upon several times that does not take sides between ""good"" and ""evil"" Fantasticans, and does not exercise temporal power. Thus the monstrous Ygramul the Many says: Die Kindliche Kaiserin läßt uns alle gelten als das, was wir sind. Darum beugt sich auch Ygramul ihrem Zeichen. The Childlike Empress accepts us all for what we are. That is why Ygramul bows to her sign. In the centre of the novel, she climbs to the house of the Old Man of Wandering Mountain, who is her antithesis. The writing on the ladder tears at her clothing; she thinks that letters had never been kind to her (es war nichts Neues für sie, daß Buchstaben ihr nicht wohlgesinnt waren). She is a kind of creative wellspring for Fantastica, her health linked to that of the whole realm of story, but she herself defies being pinned down in writing. Her home, the Ivory Tower, cannot be penetrated without disaster. For Bastian, the Childlike Empress is the first of several mother-figures he encounters in the story, and critically she disappears at the halfway point. Before that, her suffering and expression of love mirror that of Bastian's own mother, and drive him to the point where he can enter Fantastica in triumph. But then she is gone. The AURYN, the double-snake amulet of the Childlike Empress, gives Bastian the power to make his wishes real. It is engraved on the back with ""Do What You Wish"" (Tu Was Du Willst), glossed by Grograman as that Bastian should follow his true will (daß du deinen Wahren Willen tun sollst) rather than his mere whims; his own deepest secret (dein eigenes tiefstes Geheimnis). Bastian's uses of AURYN initially represent a childlish self-aggrandizement - to be strong, attractive, renowned, beloved. He also uses AURYN to become an author of the fates of others, with less than perfect results (creating the dragon, the Lake of Tears, and so on) which is part of his attempt to exercise direct control over the world around him. In so doing, he's following a naive belief that he has the wisdom and the right to override the will of others, essentially to declare problems solved by his fiat. This too relates to the loss of his mother. His creations have an undercurrent of grief - tears for the apparent death of Grograman; a literal lake of tears around the Silver City, made by the incessant weeping of the Acharai; the loneliness of the Night Forest and the desert; the solitary wandering through the Temple of a Thousand Doors. He likewise pines to be loved, but he cannot create the real thing by his wishes. The best he can do is create renown, and fumble towards a genuine friendship with Atreyu without the aid of the amulet. Each of his wishes is an exercise of power that fails to address his grief at the source. Each one takes away part of his own story. Bastian's seduction by the witch-queen Xayide is the endpoint of this line of development. Her power is in pure emptiness (Alles, was leer ist, kann mein Wille lenken) and she is an empty mother-substitute. It is she who encourages Bastian to dethrone the Childlike Empress. She is tall and beautiful in his eyes, but separates him from his true friends. Bastian must reject her self-destructive nihilism in order to proceed. Argax, the keeper of the City, shows Bastian the remnants of his predecessors who failed. They have lost all memory and meaning, and hence they do not age (Darum werden sie auch nicht älter). For Bastian to grow as a person, he must reorient himself to finding his true will once again. He must reject his previous self-indulgent use of AURYN and start again from the beginning. In the final chapters, Bastian passes through: In these last stages, Bastian does everything except seize power; he instead becomes subject to others and finally accepts his mother's death and its consequences. We see some hints there that he may regain some of the false glory he sought in Fantastica, but now earned. But that is another story, to be told another time. The nature of power in the story has little to do with political power or governance. It is a matter of using ones innate power in the right way, in particular destined towards something other than oneself. Insofar as the Childlike Empress has power, it comes from not exercising it over others, but expressing pure innocence. For Bastian, he must forego attempts to cover his grief by clumsy solutions but instead achieve deeper self-knowledge."
"Is there strong evidence that ""room 5"" in V for Vendetta was a conscious reference to Room 101?","I've just finished reading V for Vendetta in its collected trade paperback edition. At the end, there is a short essay by Alan Moore, titled ""Behind the Painted Smile"", which explains the creative process behind the book - how it was conceived and how it was executed. Initially, Alan Moore wanted to write a similarly themed comic about a guy called ""The Doll"", who would be fighting a totalitarian state in 1980s. This early idea was rejected by DC.  However, later Alan Moore came together with David Lloyd (the artist of V for Vendetta) and gave him the draft of ""The Doll"". They decided to make this comic, with the protagonist being called ""Vendetta"" at first. This title, however, was called ""too Italian"". It were Dez Skinn and Graham Marsh that came up with the title ""V for Vendetta"", and Alan Moore and David Lloyd liked it so much it gave them new incentive to work.  So my understanding is that the name ""V"" came first, and the contents of the work were later adapted to suit that name. This is why multiple explanations of V's name exist, such as  Therefore I don't think that this was an intentional conscious reference to Orwell."
Did Frodo want Bilbo to die?,"He's referring to Bilbo's retirement to Rivendell. Bilbo's plan was to relax, listen to the songs, translate some books, and work on his memoirs. As Gandalf put it in the next line: ‘He felt better at once'. I don't think Frodo had Bilbo's longer-term prospects in mind. He didn't know that a journey across the Sea was in the cards. All the rest Bilbo was expected to get was at the Last Homely House. Frodo (and Hobbits in general) don't seem to think much about the Afterlife, and the uncertainty of what happens when you go The Elves Know Not Whither. ""Rest"" doesn't seem to figure into it: maybe for Elves, in Mandos, but not for Men.  It is a bit of an oddity for Tolkien to have used a phrase there with such clearly Catholic overtones. He generally tried to avoid evoking our religion(s) into Middle-earth. Tolkien's ear sometimes failed to notice when his turns of phrase had other meanings. (Every time he mentions ""Tirion upon Túna"" I still mentally add ""... upon Rye""). So I think here he's referring simply to the straightforward event: Bilbo went to Imladris, to rest, peacefully."
"Does Gandalf ever say this in the book ""The Hobbit"", or is it made up for the movie?","No, this passage is not in the book; quite the opposite, it says that while Bilbo might have got ""something a bit queer in his make-up from the Took side"" of his family, that something never had a chance to come out ""until Bilbo Baggins was grown up"". He certainly never ran off in search of Elves in the woods as a child - he is described as ""a second edition of his solid and comfortable father"", who, as a Baggins, ""never had any adventures or did anything unexpected"". The book version of Bilbo is mentioned as being fond of maps, though - ""He loved maps, and in his hall there hung a large one of the Country Round with all his favourite walks marked on it in red ink."""
In what Chinese fairy tale does a painter disappear into his own painting?,"Seems to be referring to Wu Daozi (680 – c. 760,  a Chinese painter of the Tang dynasty), as depicted in the following text: Wu's death was a myth. One story says that after painting a mural
about a natural scene in the palace one day, Wu drew a door on the
mural in the side of a hill. Then he clapped his hands and the door
opened. After entering, Wu invited the emperor to follow. But the door
suddenly shut, he disappeared inside his own painting and was never
seen again."
How can I check that used or old books are in good condition before I purchase them?,"I know the expression is ""You can't judge a book by its cover,"" but in this case, you might be able to start there.  :) If you have time to look at each individual book for a minute or two, I would personally start by checking the cover for evident ""trauma"" marks.  I mean like big dents or crushed corners (typical if the book is dropped).  These are frequently what will wear on the binding of the book, which is typically what matters to avid users. The second thing I would check is to open the book at random.  Is there a place where the book tends to fall open very easily?  If so, check the pages next to there.  Are they starting tear or disconnect along the seam?  This could be a sign either that someone left the book on its face with a weight on it, or simply left it open for a long time - both of which will weaken the binding, making pages more prone to fall out. A third thing I would check is page wear.  This is a somewhat unusual issue, but on the occasion, especially with very old books, you'll run across a copy that was very used - to the point that the pages are starting to wear away on the corners.  While this can be nice for antique collectors, for a reader, it's not ideal, since the pages are more fragile and will tear easily. There are other things too, and I'm looking forward to seeing what other community members come up with, but that's what I tend to check for.  Hope it helps!"
"Why does this copy of the Iliad mention ""the will of God""?","That's a poor translation, although an understandable one; it should be ""Zeus"". First I checked a number of other English translations of the Iliad; it was easy to find the relevant passage in each one, since it's the very first paragraph of the whole thing. Here are a few I found, with the corresponding phrase highlighted by me in each case: Goddess, sing me the anger, of Achilles, Peleus’ son, that fatal anger that brought countless sorrows on the Greeks, and sent many valiant souls of warriors down to Hades, leaving their bodies as spoil for dogs and carrion birds: for thus was the will of Zeus brought to fulfilment. Sing of it from the moment when Agamemnon, Atreus’ son, that king of men, parted in wrath from noble Achilles. Translated by A. S. Kline, 2009 The wrath sing, goddess, of Peleus' son, Achilles, that destructive wrath which brought countless woes upon the Achaeans, and sent forth to Hades many valiant souls of heroes, and made them themselves spoil for dogs and every bird; thus the plan of Zeus came to fulfillment, from the time when first they parted in strife Atreus' son, king of men, and brilliant Achilles. Translated by A. T. Murray, 1924 Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with one another. Translated by Samuel Butler, 1898 Bearing in mind that Jove is one of the Roman names for the adapted Greek god Zeus, all of these translations suggest that the monotheistic-sounding ""will of God"" is an anachronism and it should really refer to Zeus. Let's now take a look at the ""original"" (for some value of original) Ancient Greek text, sourced from here: μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος
οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί᾽ Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε᾽ ἔθηκε,
πολλὰς δ᾽ ἰφθίμους ψυχὰς Ἄϊδι προΐαψεν
ἡρώων, αὐτοὺς δὲ ἑλώρια τεῦχε κύνεσσιν
οἰωνοῖσί τε πᾶσι, Διὸς δ᾽ ἐτελείετο βουλή,
ἐξ οὗ δὴ τὰ πρῶτα διαστήτην ἐρίσαντε
Ἀτρεΐδης τε ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν καὶ δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς. The key word here is Διὸς, which is (with a capital delta) the genitive singular of Ζεύς (Zeus). Interestingly the same word with a lower-case delta, δῖος, can mean heavenly, divine, noble, and it's actually used that way in the very same passage, two lines later, to refer to Achilles. This looks like a piece of Ancient Greek wordplay that's not preserved in any of the above translations. The word is also presumably cognate with the Latin deus and the English deity, both meaning simply ""god"" (not necessarily monotheistic). Hence my comment that the translation error is an understandable one."
"What's the joke with ""Best of Queen"" in Good Omens?","The theory proposed by Terry Pratchett is that ""Best of Queen"" is the only decent music that can be found on the road in gas station markets, so those CDs tend to accumulate in the car, without the driver noticing them much. Neil Gaiman proposes that the CDs do really turn into ""Best of Queen"" albums, just like that. He occasionally gets fan mail about it: here and here For stuff like that, the Annotated Pratchett File, where I got this piece from, is a good resource. I can't access their cited source right now, so I'm still looking for a primary source."
Where did the term Kwisatz Haderach in Dune originate?,"Kefitzat Haderech is a Jewish phrase that means ""contracting the path"".  Herbert defines Kwisatz Haderach as ""the Shortening of the Way"" (Dune: Appendix IV), clearly meaning to reference the Hebrew here.  As seen in this answer on SFF, a large quantity of names in Dune are inspired by words from Semitic languages such as Hebrew or Arabic. "
"Why does the Iliad start ""in the middle""?","Whether the Iliad starts in the middle depends on what the subject of the poem is. If the subject is the whole Trojan War, then certainly the poem starts in the middle, and finishes well before the end. But is that really the subject? The opening line of the poem is: μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος That is, “sing, goddess, the rage of Peleus’ son Achilles”. If the subject of the poem is the rage of Achilles (and μῆνιν, rage, is the very first word) then the Iliad begins at the beginning, with the cause of Achilles’ rage (the quarrel with Agamemnon over the captive Trojan women Chryseis and Briseis), continues with its consequences (Achilles sulks; the battle goes poorly for the Achaeans; Patroclus impersonates Achilles and is killed by Hector), and ends with its resolution (Agamemnon returns Briseis to Achilles; Achilles kills Hector; Priam begs the return of his son’s body)."
What translation/version of the Bible would Chaucer have read?,"Chaucer (almost certainly) used the Vulgate, the 4th-century Latin translation by Jerome, the text that was the usual scripture of the Catholic Church in the medieval period. I added the caveat “almost certainly” because stories from the Bible were popular subjects for retellings, so that in any particular case where Chaucer refers to a biblical passage, there are other sources from which he might have got the story. For example, the Summoner’s Tale alludes to Matthew 23:7–8: ‘No maister, sire,’ quod he, ‘but servitour,
Thogh I have had in scole swich honour.
God lyketh nat that “Raby” men us calle,
Neither in market ne in your large halle.’ Chaucer might have got this directly from the Vulgate text of Matthew, but he could also have got it second-hand, for example, from the Roman de la Rose: Et ament que l’en les salue
Quant il trespassent par la rue,
Et veulent estre apelé mestre,
Ce qu’il ne devroient pas estre Jean de Meung (c. 1280). Le Roman de la Rose, volume 2, lines 12570–12573. Paris: Firmin Didot (1864). Grace W. Landrum considered all such allusions in order to determine whether Chaucer’s wording is closest to the Vulgate or to other sources, and concluded that After the subtraction of second-hand borrowings there remain unquestionably to Chaucer’s credit about 275 cases of direct dependence upon the Vulgate. Grace W. Landrum (1924). ‘Chaucer’s Use of the Vulgate’. In Proceedings of the Modern Language Association 39:1, p. 99. For example, in the passage from the Summoner’s Tale there are a couple of wording choices that support Chaucer’s source being the Vulgate and not the Roman de la Rose: No single case is conclusive (since there could be another source not considered) but the weight of the evidence is strongly in favour of Chaucer having access to, or maybe even owning, a copy of the Vulgate. Other versions of the Bible are extremely unlikely as sources for Chaucer: there is no indication that he knew Greek or Hebrew, and knowledge of these languages was poor among Western Europeans until after the emigration of Byzantine scholars following the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Some people have suggested that Chaucer might have read the earliest (1382) version of Wycliffe’s English translation of the Bible. Walter Skeat, for example, suggested that we compare the Parson’s Tale with the Wycliffite translation of Genesis 3:1–7. There are substantial similarities between the two English versions of the temptation story, but there are also a few places that suggest Chaucer was working directly from the Vulgate (or some other source deriving from the Vulgate) and not from Wycliffe: Landrum was skeptical of the idea that Chaucer had relied on Wycliffe: Furthermore, comparison of Chaucer and the Wycliffite versions in practically all other cases brings out great unlikeness of phrasing and diction. Landum, p. 87."
How can you come out dry from the Sea of Knowledge?,"TL;DR: water symbolises knowledge, and all the other correspondences flow1 from there. If the sea is called the Sea of Knowledge, then what is its symbolic significance? Assuming that what's in the sea is literally representing knowledge, then (in the allegorical reading) we can equate water with knowledge or information. Then what does it mean to swim in this sea, and what does it mean to get wet? If you're swimming, you're surrounded by the water; I would equate this with being exposed to knowledge on all sides, like reading an informative text or attending a lecture. But getting wet means you actually absorb water and it stays on you; that surely equates with absorbing knowledge, i.e. learning. ""You can swim all day in the Sea of Knowledge and still come out completely dry. Most people do."" So how can this sentence be interpreted? It should be something along the lines of: ""You can be exposed to knowledge all day and still end up learning nothing. Most people do."" But let's take this allegory further! What happens when Milo, Tock, and the Humbug actually swim through the Sea of Knowledge? They swam and swam and swam for what seemed like hours, and only Tock's firm encouragement kept Milo struggling through the icy water. At last they reached the shore, thoroughly exhausted and, except for the bug, completely soaked. ""That wasn't bad at all,"" the Humbug said, straightening his tie and brushing himself off. ""I must visit there again."" Milo and Tock swim for hours, and end up soaking wet and tired; the Humbug is dry, comfortable, and quite relaxed about the whole situation; he would be happy to do it all again. Thinking about this with the allegorical interpretation, it's like attending a long lecture or reading a weighty textbook: some people study for hours and end up tired but with a lot of new knowledge, while those who don't learn anything are comfortably relaxed and could happily do the whole thing again (still without learning anything). In fact, the whole passage about the island of Conclusions can be interpreted under the same representation of knowledge as water. Jumping to conclusions is easy, and you can do it without possessing any of the pertinent information; but to get away from a false conclusion you reached, you need to learn something and gain some new knowledge. Norton Juster is masterfully and very subtly depicting this fact of life by the imagery of the island and the sea: you can jump to Conclusions like magic, but it takes a lot of hard work swimming through Knowledge to get back to where you started. Thank you very much for asking this question. Even after a very recent re-read of The Phantom Tollbooth, I'd failed to grasp the significance of this passage about the Sea of Knowledge until now. (I'm ashamed to admit that on my very first read, as a child, despite finding the Canby episode very memorable, I even failed to understand the point of his name.) There's always more to notice with this book! 1 Pun very much intended. Obviously."
Significance of the Phoenician Sailor having pearls for eyes in The Waste Land,"It's an allusion to Shakespeare's The Tempest, Act I, scene ii.  Ariel sings to Ferdinand, in order to deceive him into thinking his father has been drowned in a shipwreck. ARIEL sings Full fathom five thy father lies;
  Of his bones are coral made;
  Those are pearls that were his eyes:
  Nothing of him that doth fade
  But doth suffer a sea-change
  Into something rich and strange.
  Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell Burthen Ding-dong Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell."
Why all those tangents in Victor Hugo's Les Misérables?,"Norman Denny has this to say in the introduction to his translation of Les Misérables: Hugo [...] had little or no regard for the discipline of
  novel-writing. He was wholly unrestrained and unsparing of his reader.
  He had to say everything and more than everything; he was incapable of
  leaving anything out. [...] One reason for [so many digressions] is that it was written over a period of nearly
  twenty years. A first unfinished novel entitled Misères was written
  during the three years from 1845 to 1848; it was then put aside for
  twelve years, to be completed in 1860-62 as Les Misérables. About Waterloo: Hugo, as he tells us, had tramped over the battlefield, presumably
  when he was living in Brussels in 1853; he had studied maps and
  army-lists and such professional records as were available to him, and
  out of this he concocted his own elaborate and poeticized layman's
  version of an event [...]. This is the largest of the digressions, and
  it is reasonable to assume that the bulk of it was written long before
  Hugo returned to his novel. About Parenthèse: Hugo's publisher, Lacroix, feeling that this would be trying the
  reader's patience altogether too high, urged him to take it out; but
  Hugo refused, as it seems for purely personal reasons: his cousin
  Marie, to whom he was attached, had taken the veil in 1848. Denny then proceeds to drop some of these digressions to appendices in his translation, making his Les Misérables a far more pleasant prospect."
"The meaning of ""The rest is silence"" in ""Hamlet""","There appear to be multiple ways of reading this sentence, depending on how you interpret the context of ""rest"" and ""silence"". Hamlet has been experiencing a great deal of upset and distress during the course of the play. Enough to drive him to madness. So one possible reading of this sentence is that the ""silence"" of death will finally allow him to ""rest"". ""Going to your rest"" is, of course, a common euphemism for death. It is also the end of the play, as well as the end of Hamlet. ""The rest is silence"" can be read literally in the context of the performance: there is little left to watch, after which the characters will be silent. And in the context of the play itself, Hamlet himself will be silenced by death. However, it can also be read as a continuation of the speech and little to do with death itself. Before expiring, Hamlet is talking about the possible outcome of Fortinbras's election. ""The rest is silence"" could be interpreted as a statement saying Hamlet would vote for him, but the outcome is otherwise uncertain. ""The rest"" of the possible outcome is ""silent"": one can imagine a personification of fate or prophecy refusing to speak more on the matter. If you like puns, and Shakespeare seems to have done, there's one here. Shortly before his dying speech, Hamlet personifies Death and refers to the act of dying as an ""arrest"". So here he is saying ""th'[e/a]rest [i.e. dying] is silence"". Finally, a major theme of the play is mortality and the question of what comes after. We see this in Hamlet's statements about the ghost of his father, about Yorick, about men going to die in battle. We see it, most famously in ""to be or not to be"" and in an ""undiscover'd country"". ""The rest is silence"" could be a statement of uncertainty: Hamlet is about to find out the answer to this question but he cannot tell anyone what it is. In fact, the answer may be ""silence"", i.e. oblivion. This is your theological connotation. So the literary value in this short line appears to be one of substantial ambiguity. Which is fitting, given the questions of uncertainty and faith at the heart of the play."
"Short story about an atomic energy agency van, with a funny surprise ending","This is ""Critical Mass"" (Wikipedia, ISFDB) by Arthur C. Clarke, first published in 1949. From Wikipedia: This comic story describes the relationship between a village and a nuclear research facility located near it. On the day that the story takes place, a truck carrying a mysterious cargo has an accident, and the driver flees. The terrified villagers are about to begin an evacuation, when the narrator discovers that the cargo were merely hives of bees."
Where does this Federico Garcia Lorca quote come from? Is it a fake?,"This is a quote from an interview he gave in 1931. Traigo preparados cuatro libros. De teatro. De poesía. Y de impresiones neoyorkinas, el que puede titularse : la ciudad, interpretación personal, abstracción impersonal, sin lugar ni tiempo dentro de aquella ciudad mundo. Un símbolo patético : Sufrimiento. Pero del revés, sin dramatismo. Es una puesta en contacto de mi mundo poético con el mundo poético de Nueva York. En medio de ambos están los pueblos tristes de África y sus alrededores, perdidos en Norteamérica. Los judíos. Los sirios. Y los negros. ¡Sobre todo los negros! Con su tristeza se han hecho el eje espiritual de aquella América. El negro que está tan cerca de la naturaleza y de la otra naturaleza. ¡Ese negro que se saca música hasta de los bolsillos! Fuera del arte negro no queda en los Estados Unidos más que mecánica y automatismo. English translation: I have prepared four books. About theater. About poetry. And about my impressions of New York, which I could call The City, a personal interpretation, an impersonal abstraction, without a specific place or time within that city-world. A pathetic symbol: Suffering. But reversed, without dramatics. It's a coming into contact of my own poetic universe with the poetic universe of New York. The centerpieces of both are the sad peoples of Africa and their surroundings, lost in North America. The Jews. The Syrians. And the Blacks. Especially the Blacks! With their sadness they have become the spiritual axis of that America. The black who is so close to nature and to the other nature. That black who draws music even out of his pockets! Aside from Black art, there is nothing left in the United States but mechanics and automatism. (note: the Spanish word literally translates to 'blacks', but that's not intended to be offensive/derogatory in any way) This interview was given to Gaceta Literaria, published in Madrid on 15-01-1931, under the title “Estampa de García Lorca”, after Lorca had spent about one year in New York. Passages from this interview were later included in the collection A Poet in New York. Sources:"
No mayonnaise in Ireland?,"The phrase comes from a story by humorist Will Stanton that appeared in the May 1971 issue of Reader's Digest. The narrator claims that he is subject to ""a kind of slip-of-the-ear,"" leading to his mishearing things. This is the first example he gives: I was standing next to a woman at one party recently, not paying much attention to what she was saying, when suddenly she came out with the statement that there was no mayonnaise in Ireland. The narrator delivers what he considers an appropriately witty response. The woman then approaches the man's wife, concerned. ""I'm afraid he's had one too many."" she said; ""I was quoting a line of poetry—you know, that bit about 'No man is an island.' Well, your husband gave me a blank look and said there is no ketchup in Australia."" Being practically the Platonic ideal of mondegreens, ""no mayonnaise in Ireland"" was referenced on many blogs. In early 2012, Stanton's daughter Linda Stanton French commented on a couple of such blog posts, providing source information. This in turn led to the story's being available online. Here is a timeline followed by a link to the story. On February 6, Stanton French commented on a 2011 blog post by Kelly: ""There's no mayonnaise in Ireland"" is a phrase my father, Will Stanton, made up for a story he wrote that was published in the May 1971 Reader's Digest. A few days later, on February 20, she belatedly replied to a 2006 post from a blogger named Jim: The story quoted in the first two paragraphs of your link is from my father, Will Stanton’s, short story, “There’s No Mayonnaise in Ireland”, that appeared in the Reader’s Digest in May 1971. Several commenters on Jim's post greeted Stanton French with huzzahs, shared their memories of the story, and bemoaned their inability to find it anywhere. Two days later, on February 22, Stanton French set up a Facebook page for Will Stanton. The entire text of ""There's No Mayonnaise in Ireland"" is linked off that page."
"Meaning of ""The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed"" in ""Ozymandias""","The passions survive the hand that mocked [the passions] and the heart that fed [the passions]. That means that the passions (by being impressed on the lifeless statue) outlived both the sculptor's hand and the pharaoh's heart. I don't know if this definition of survive is confusing you, or if it's just the convoluted syntax in general. From Oxford Learner's Dictionary: survive: 1.2 [transitive] survive somebody/something: to live or exist longer than somebody/something
‘She survived her husband by ten years.’
‘He is survived by his wife and two sons.’ A couple more comments: Mock here means either to mimic or to mimic derisively. Which of these meanings did Shelley intend? Or did he deliberately leave it ambiguous? I can't say for sure; he used it with both of these meanings in other poems. There's an implied them after fed, and dropping it is one of the things that makes the grammar confusing. I'm not sure whether dropping this them is strictly grammatical, but poetic license excuses a lot."

Sci-Fi Short Story - Life Saving Weight Loss,"Typing a few keywords (robot collect animals weight range chase human short story) into google came up with the following story: The Ruum by Arthur Porges published 1953 Synopsis: A shape-shifting, indestructible robot—a ""Type H-9 Ruum""—is accidentally left behind on earth during the age of the dinosaurs by visiting aliens, and not recovered because their ship is destroyed in a battle. The Ruum's work is collecting different species of animals within a 30-mile radius, weighing 160 pounds (give or take 15 pounds) and preserving them in a state of suspended animation for later retrieval. Many millions of years later Jim Irwin, a uranium prospector in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, encounters the Ruum's specimens, animals which include modern and prehistoric mammals and a small Stegosaurus. After he has noticed that the animals are all of a uniform size, and alive, the still-functioning Ruum appears. Shooting it with a rifle does not damage it, and when the approaching blob-shaped Ruum reveals gripping hooks and a probe dripping green liquid, Irwin runs as it pursues him at a steady five miles per hour. It is noted that Irwin weighs 149 pounds. Fit and military-trained, Irwin attempts to evade and destroy the Ruum. First he hides above his trail and drops a boulder on it, but this also fails to damage it. Then he climbs a sheer cliff, but the Ruum extrudes a climbing claw to the ledge where he is hidden. He tries to dislodge it with a stick, and finds the Ruum can generate an electric shock. He shoots it and dislodges it, but the Ruum is unharmed by the fall and responds by growing multiple claws. Having not had any time for food or sleep, Irwin eventually circles back to his camp by a lake and sets a trap with dynamite. Taking advantage of the Ruum's distraction by a grizzly bear, which it kills, he detonates the dynamite using a pistol bullet. Dazed by the explosion, he sees the Ruum still unharmed and still approaching. Exhausted and defenseless, he awaits it adding him to its collection. However, it lifts him up, then puts him back down and leaves. Soon afterward, his colleague Walt Leonard arrives by seaplane and rescues him. Safely in the plane, they make plans to bring a helicopter and collect some of the Ruum's specimens in its absence to sell to scientists. Leonard comments on Irwin's haggard appearance, guessing him to have lost 10 pounds during the chase: the reader understands that this caused his weight to become less than the Ruum's weight criterion. While there are a few differences it generally matches the storyline given, and was the first hit on google. I found an illustration from an illustrated version, with 1 other illustration available:  Also thanks to user14111 for commenting a link to an ISFDB page with a list of publications this story appeared in."
To what extent did Agatha Christie base Captain Hastings on Dr. Watson?,"This isn't a particularly satisfying answer, but I thought it might be helpful to offer confirmation that Agatha Christie indeed thought of Hastings as Poirot's Watson: I quite enjoyed Captain Hastings. He was a stereotyped creation, but he and Poirot represented my idea of a detective team. I was still writing in the Sherlock Holmes tradition, eccentric detective, stooge assistant, with a Lestrade-type Scotland Yard detective, Inspector Japp – and now I added a ‘human foxhound’, Inspector Giraud, of the French police. Giraud despises Poirot as being old and passé. Agatha Christie: An Autobiography, Agatha Christie"
"What is the difference between a Novelette, Novella and Novel?","(Thanks to @Standback for making edits) It's to do with how much content there is. A novelette is longer than a short story, but shorter than a novella. The word count is usually between 7,500 words to 17,500 words. A novella is longer than a novelette and is sometimes called a long short story or a short novel A novel is longer than a novella and is meant to be read over several days The reason they sound so familiar is that they all come from the Italian word ""novella,"" feminine of ""novello,"" which means ""new."" There are no hard-and-fast rules about where the boundaries lie between the forms. This can differ by genre and by simple established convention in readership (for example, readers now expect novels to be much longer than the ~40,000-odd words they used to be). However, we can take an example from the Hugo and Nebula awards, which have separate award categories for different lengths. They define the categories as follows: Short Stories: up to 7,500 words
  Novellettes: 7,500 - 17,000
  Novellas: 17,000 - 40,000
  Novels: 40,000 + words "
Did Lady Macbeth communicate signs of her instability prior to the blood scene?,"Oh, yeah, she's clearly unstable from the moment we meet her. Even better, she chooses to be unstable. In her very first appearance, she calls on supernatural forces to remove all traces of compassion: Come, you spirits
  That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
  And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
  Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
  Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
  That no compunctious visitings of nature
  Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
  The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
  And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
  Wherever in your sightless substances
  You wait on nature's mischief!   She knows that she has compassion, and wants it gone. That presages both her viciousness and her breakdown over the consequences. This isn't the speech of somebody entirely in her right mind, right from the start. There's another particularly horrifying sequence: I have given suck, and know
  How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
  I would, while it was smiling in my face,
  Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
  And dash'd the brains out   There's a huge amount to be made of this. There are no other references to the Macs having children, and in particular no sign that Mac was planning to leave the throne to his family. She must have lost a child: a common enough occurrence at the time, but don't be misled into thinking that they were unaffected. In performance, there's a huge well of grief to be had there. I want to point out one other line, kind of unassuming, but highly effective in performance: Things without all remedy
  Should be without regard: what's done is done. In context it's very easy to see that as simply callous, telling Mac to man up. But there's an undertone that says, ""OK, maybe we screwed up, but it's finished and we can't fix that so there's no point in feeling guilty"".  That is the strongest presage of the mad scene: she does feel the guilt, just as she knew she would. It's reflected in her final line: To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:
  come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's
  done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed! She's re-living the moment (thus, the knocking at the gate, introducing the Porter scene). And she repeats her line, this time desperate to forget. She cannot, and soon she will be dead."
Was Holden Caulfield molested as a child?,"There are strong hints that Mr Antolini expresses sexual interest in Holden in this scene. Consider his verbal reaction when Holden wakes up from his touch: ""What the hellya doing?"" I said. ""Nothing! I'm simply sitting here, admiring--"" The whole scene happens in a dark room, with Antolini drinking heavily, and conveys an aura that some molestation could have happened, and perhaps was already beginning: It was dark and all and I couldn't see him so hot, but I knew he was watching me, all right. He was still boozing, too. Then Antolini refuses to acknowledge Holden's reasonable discomfort at being woken up in a dark room by a drunk adult man touching him non-consensually. Instead, Antolini casts the blame for the awkward result on Holden, repeatedly calling him ""a very, very strange boy"". This is an abusive deceitful tactic, as Holden is well-aware (""Strange, my ass""). However, I would caution strongly against concluding that ""Holden was sexually molested as a child"" and especially against seeing that as some sort of fundamental explanation for all the events, themes, and ideas presented in the novel. Catcher in the Rye is not a mystery genre work and there's no single answer to be uncovered by unearthing subtle clues and thus resolving all the fundamental questions the novel raises. ""Holden is clinically depressed"" is likewise not an adequate answer. Holden tells us quite elaborately, throughout the novel, about things that depress him, and very often why they do. Trying to understand Holden is key to gaining value from the novel. Dismissing practically the entire narrative as ""Holden was depressed"", ""Holden was sexually molested"", or ""Holden was crazy"" only serves to shut down any fruitful discussion before it even begun. Moreover, if the only problem is that Holden was depressed / molested / crazy, then this novel is mostly relevant for people who suffered from these conditions. Instead, a very large portion of readers find meaning and relevance in the novel, including those who never suffered any of these conditions. Rather than dismissing or otherwise limiting the novel's relevance, it is far more challenging and rewarding to try to understand why a fairly normal person could think, feel, act, and react as Holden did. Holden's reaction to Antolini's behavior in that scene is very reasonable when you recall that Holden knew, trusted, and even admired Antolini for quite some time before that evening. A major theme in the novel is how sexual desire affects various characters and their humanity, including Holden himself. For instance, consider his explanation of his relation to Sally Hayes as a function of his attraction to her. The encounter with the prostitute has some of that too, though there are other interesting themes there. To avoid straying too much, and get back to your question, there's no particular reason to suspect that Holden was molested as a child. Holden was an upper-middle-class (possibly even upper-class) child growing up in an upscale part of New York. It is unlikely that he was exposed to molestation by strangers, and there's absolutely no hint that any family member molested him either. By many accounts, Holden was a handsome boy, and that can certainly attract unwanted attention, as Holden himself mentions in the bit you quoted (""they're always being perverty when I'm around""). Arguably, that scene is an example of someone ""being perverty"" around Holden. However, he is able to protect himself quite well. He identifies, and promptly exits the compromising situation. It's worth pointing out that he is able to do so despite difficult present conditions: he is effectively without shelter and asleep when Antolini tries to molest him. In fact, that's a common circumstance to many of the events in the novel: Holden exits the normal, sheltered life of a boy of his age and class, and enters a series of unusual and sometimes vulnerable alternative circumstances. This is how Antolini is able to touch him, and how Maurice is able to assault him earlier in the novel. In fact, the Maurice incident also carries undertones of sexual assault: Then what he did, he snapped his finger very hard on my pajamas. I won't tell you where he snapped it, but it hurt like hell. Holden never exhibits any special reaction to the sexual undertone of this part of the assault. To conclude, Holden enters a vulnerable state when he leaves his proper upper-middle-class at the boarding school, and in that vulnerable state he encounters some unsavory happenings, including assaults of a violent nature, sexual nature, or both. However, there's no evidence that these sexual assaults echo some significant earlier trauma. In any case, it is inadvisable to dismiss the huge wealth of ideas and themes present in the novel as simply a mechanical consequence of any particular psychopathology, such as past sexual trauma."
What do these espionage tradecraft phrases from Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy mean?,"All three phrases show up on page 40 of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy in a single sentence. ""He was waiting for a connect, working a letterbox maybe, or trailing his coat and looking for a pass from a mug like me."" The entire paragraph is: Once more it was Smiley's turn to receive the heat of Tarr's charm: ""So what's it all about, Mr. Smiley? See what I mean? It's little things I'm noticing,"" he confided, still to Smiley. ""Just take the way he sat. Believe me, sir, if we'd been in that place ourselves we couldn't have sat better than Boris. He had the pick of the exits and the stairway; he had a fine view of the main entrance and the action; he was right handed and he was covered by a left-hand wall. Boris was a professional, Mr. Smiley; there was no doubt of it whatsoever. He was waiting for a connect, working a letterbox maybe, or trailing his coat and looking for a pass from a mug like me. Well, now listen: it's one thing to burn a small-time trade delegate. It's quite a different ball game to swing your legs at a Centre trained hood, right Mr. Guilliam?"" waiting for a connect - Merely waiting to meet somebody. A connect is a person's handler or contact. The source is the novel itself. The term ""connect"" shows up in several places in the story. An example from the same book: ""You want to know who his connect is out there - this magic guy in North Germany with a crock of gold that's going to make us millionaires overnight?"" working a letterbox - Watching a drop off point for an informant. A place where somebody places a ""letter"" for another to pick up. The term, ""letterbox"" is used at multiple locations in the story (and other stories) as a term for where informants drop off materials for their handlers. For example, ""Ever seen that bamboo scaffolding they use? Fantastic. Twenty stories high and the coolies swarm all over it with slabs of precast concrete. A bit of discard piping,"" he said, ""handy at shoulder height. It seemed most likely if Irina was in a hurry, that the piping was the letterbox she would use.""   The movie, Bridge of Spies, shows a letterbox in the scene where the Russian spy hides a fake nickel under the park bench. The park bench is the ""letterbox"", a place to put ""mail"" for pick up later. trailing one's coat - An officer of one side acting as if he is a likely defector - drinking, complaining about his job, in the hope of attracting a recruitment offer from an enemy intelligence officer, with the object of recruiting the enemy as a double agent instead. The source for ""trailing one's coat"" comes from the Wikipedia article on Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. looking for a pass - Hoping he can get a recruiter on the other side to defect and become a double agent. Think of how a man might make a pass at a woman in a bar hoping to flirt with her. He makes a pass, and if she reciprocates, the conversation continues to the next step. Edit to add: John LeCarre claims he invented the spycraft jargon that shows up in his stories. This is mentioned in the Wikipedia entry on Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy."
Story about child slavery and mutilated body parts?,"Would it be Canned by Alex Shearer?  First hit on google when typing 'boy tin can factory child slavery finger book'. Summary from Kirkus Reviews (emphasis mine): This macabre mystery may make readers give up canned foods. Fergal Banfield, an eccentric English lad with the peculiar hobby of collecting unlabelled cans from supermarket bargain bins, discovers a gold ear stud in his latest acquisition. The mystery deepens when he next discovers a severed human finger in another can. Fergal meets Charlotte, a fellow can-collector, who finds a human ear in one of her cans, and it goes with the gold stud. Fergal’s investigation leads him to a pet-food factory owned by Mr. and Mrs. Dimble-Smith. Fergal makes the grisly discovery that the factory is staffed by enslaved young children from Africa and Asia, who become ingredients of the pet food when they grow old enough to resist captivity. Pressed into service and fearing for his life, Fergal gets a message to Charlotte on a can label about his situation and location, but no one believes her story. So it’s Charlotte to the rescue! The grotesque elements of the story are more suggestive than descriptive, and Shearer’s delightfully droll, dark humor makes for many light moments. Readers with a taste for the bizarre and gross will find this tale most tasty. Thanks to @Mithrandir for adding some related extracts: The Protagonist is a young male who collects unmarked cans. Fergal felt he needed somewhere to hide, a wall to retreat behind - some shelter. He didn't want a hobby to bring him into contact with other people, he wanted one to shield him from then. And that was when he became interested in cans.
  Not rare cans, though, nor ancient cans from expeditions to the North or South Pole; not foreign cans from exotic places, or cans in unusual colors. Just simple, ordinary, everyday cans.
  Without labels.
Chapter 1 I believe they are cans of soup or dog food (not sure!). ""For you, Fergal,"" he whispered. ""I'll open this one for you.""
  And he returned to the kitchen.
  Mr. Bamfield fetched a plate and the can opener. With solemn ceremony he clasped the butterfly opener around the rim of the can...
  ...The smell of it alone was enough. Never mind the sight of it - that pinky-gray mush look it had. It was hard to know exactly what it was supposed to be. It smelled like some kind of economy-brand pet food.
Chapter 15 He has a habit of buying old cans and his parents are worried about him Soon, to his mother's increasing unease, Fergal had filled the  entire top shelf of his bookcase with cans.
Chapter 2 One day he finds another person who loves collecting unmarked cans as well (a young female). ""How do you know,"" he said, ""that it's more important to you?""
  ""Because I need it,"" the girl said. ""For my collection!""
Chapter 7 Eventually, he finds a decapitated finger in one of the unmarked cans. It was a finger. A finger. A human finger. With a slightly grubby fingernail, and a mark around it - a faint indentation around the base.
  There it was, lying on his desk.
  One canned finger.
  One finger, canned.
Chapter 5 I believe he finds a tin can with a wedding ring, a human ear and a note that pleads for help. ""It's an ear,"" he said. ""Off someone's head.""
Chapter 8  Fergal took the small gold earring from his pocket and placed it down on Charlotte's dressing table.
  ""It's a sleeper.""
  ""That's right.""
  ""Interesting.""
  ""What did you find first?""
  ""This."" Charlotte reached into her desk drawer, took something out, and placed it next to the gold stud.
  ""It's a ring.""
Chapter 8  There were four of them: one vowel and three consonants. They spelled out the word h e l p.
Chapter 10 He realizes that all the cans come from the same factory and he decides to venture out and explore it himself The code, Charlotte thought. He must have found the code. He must have found the code on a labelled can. he must have discovered where the strange cans were coming from. And there the manufacturer's name would be, on the label of the can he had found - a name and probably an address too. That must have been why he was so excited. He had matched the code.
Chapter 13 Eventually he finds the factory and finds that the owner of the factory is missing a finger. ""Interested in cans, are you?"" he said. He held his hand up so that I could see he had a finger missing.
Chapter 15 The owner enslaves the male protagonist and he finds that the owner has illegally bought dozens of child slaves who are forced to work in his factory 24/7 in poor conditions. Well, I bit and kicked and scratched as hard as I could, but I was overpowered and taken inside. I heard the door clang shut behind me and the sound of a double lock. And I've not seen daylight since. All I've done is work.
  There are two shifts here - all day and all night...
  ...When we get to sleep, we're cramped together into two small rooms - one for girls, one for boys. Sometimes you have to wake somebody up to tell them that it's time for them to go to work so that they will get out and you can have their bed. The food we get is disgusting.
 Chapter 15 The parents of the protagonist and the police searches for him for weeks but have no clue at where he is (the factory is in another town). She was at the bus depot. She felt her feet take her to the information point; she heard her voice say, ""Excuse me, where can I get a bus to Havverstock?""
Chapter 16 The protagonist (somehow) sends off a letter to the female tin collector in one of the tins hoping she finds it (which she does!). But the biggest shock of all came when she found label one and began to read what was written.
  It was a letter, addressed personally, to her.
Chapter 15 In the final chapters of the book, the female tries to tell authorities that he has been kidnapped and enslaved in the factory but as she is young no one believes her. ""Look, love,"" he said, ""I'm sure you mean well. I've got kids myself, see, and I know what you're all like. They get fantasies, don't they? I used to get them too when I was your age. Dreams about being a hero, about saving people from drowning and getting medals and being modest about it and all the rest. Am I right?""
Chapter 17 She also ventures alone to the factory to try and save the protagonist and she does. She jumped down from the step. The door closed behind her and the bus went on its way.
  She was alone in the still of the night.
Chapter 16 All the slaves are released and the protagonist is back with his family. The children had been taken away and looked after. Those who had homes were reunited with their parents. Those who were orphans were found decent families to live with. The factory was closed down.
Chapter 17 I believe the slave owner is mutilated by one of his factory machines because in the last chapter I remember it saying that no one ever heard again of the owner and in another tin can someone finds live human fingernails and toenails. But the Dumble-Smiths had gone. How they had gone, where they had gone, nobody seemed to know.
Chapter 17  He fished it out and inspected it. It was a nail.
  A great big toenail.

"Who first said this quote about how we only sleep safely because ""rough men stand ready"" to fight on our behalf?","Actually? Neither. In conclusion, QI believes that this saying was introduced by
  Richard Grenier who was attempting to provide a pithy representation
  of an idea he ascribed to George Orwell. Later writers and speakers
  turned his phrase into a quotation and directly attached it to Orwell.
  Over time variants were constructed with modified phrasing. Quote Investigator has a long article about this quote, cited in the Wikiquote page mentioned in a comment. They have many variations of the quote, from various different people including Kipling, Le Carré, Churchill, and Orwell. Since you asked about those last two in particular: In more recent years the saying has sometimes been connected to the
  statesmen Winston Churchill. Here is an example from 2006:
  19 While it may be apocryphal, Winston Churchill is often quoted as
    having said (supposedly paraphrasing Orwell) “We sleep soundly in our
    beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on
    those who would do us harm.” There are many quotes of Orwell's that are thematically similar, but don't quite match the words of your quote. For example: In 1942 Orwell published an essay about Kipling in which he referred
  to a phrase in the poem “Tommy”: 4 A humanitarian is always a hypocrite, and Kipling’s understanding of
    this is perhaps the central secret of his power to create telling
    phrases. It would be difficult to hit off the one-eyed pacifism of the
    English in fewer words than in the phrase, ‘making mock of uniforms
    that guard you while you sleep’.  In the same essay Orwell made a
  statement about Kipling that thematically overlapped the later
  misattributed phrase: 5 6 He sees clearly that men can only be highly civilized while other men,
    inevitably less civilized, are there to guard and feed them.   Orwell referred to “less civilized” men above whereas Grenier later
  referred to “rough men”. See the article for more examples of this idea in Orwell's writing."
"What are the ""old euphemisms"" in The Great Gatsby?","The new-money people of West Egg, on the other hand, are more ostentatious about their hedonism. In essence, yes, you have caught the gist of the phrase. Daisy is aware, as is Nick, of the fact that the more conservative cultural mores are in play in West Egg, but the people there are closer to openly breaking free of them, of shrugging them off.  There's a very slight, but very real, admiration in that phrase ""raw vigor""; on at least one level, probably visceral, Daisy appreciates the vitality and energy of the people, but she's also aware that their freedom is limited, that they haven't quite escaped society's conservative strictures yet. Classic Fitzgerald phrasing - almost a throwaway, but it tells you about a central internal conflict within the character using what, barely ten words? "
How much weight is given to authors' intentions in literary analysis?,"My father was a professor of literature and I am reasonably confident that if he were asked this question he would say that the purpose of criticism is not to figure out what the author meant, but to fully understand and appreciate the nature of the experience that the work creates.  He spent much of his career arguing for the superiority of the 1850 version of Wordsworth's prelude over the 1805. The 1805 version is considerably more liberal in its sentiments and it was preferred by many of the scholars of the day for that reason -- they considered it to be a better work because it expressed more liberal sentiments compared to the more conservative sentiments of the 1850 version.  But my father's argument was not that the 1850 version was better because its politics were more conservative, but that it was better because it was better poetry; that its images were more striking and its emotions both more mature and more deeply felt. (I'm paraphrasing his argument wildly, but that seems to me, through the filter of memory, to be the gist of it.) I also remember an anecdote about Beethoven which I assume I must have heard from him. A woman came up to Beethoven after a concert and asked him what the piece he had just played meant. Beethoven answered by sitting down at the piano and playing it again.  A piece of art, in other words, means itself, the totality of its experience, and nothing else. The purpose of criticism is both to judge the quality of the experience as an experience and to make the fullness of the experience more accessible to the reader.  Of course, this is not the majority view among literary critics.  But to me, the notion of a piece of literature as a covert polemic seems odious. I believe that a writer turns to fiction not to conceal an argument which they are very capable of making plainly, but to record an experience. Sometimes, in other words, what you want to say is not that the world should be such and such, but simply that the world is such and such, not how human life should be lived, but simply what the nature of human experience actually is. Experience, by its nature, cannot be conveyed in summary. It can only be taken whole. The meaning of a poem is the poem. The meaning of a novel is the novel. "
"Which is the 'correct' version of ""The Lady of Shalott"" and why are there two?","The 1842 version is the more well-known version of this poem, and it most certainly is a revision of the first version. The University of Iowa (starting at ""The Two Versions"") conducted a thorough analysis of why Tennyson might have thought it necessary to make the changes he did. I'll give a rough summary, but many of the details are listed on that page. Many of the reasons for the changes largely come down to Tennyson potentially wanting to change how the poetic observer sees Shalott. The 1833 version focuses much more on the natural environment, whereas the 1842 version seems to focus much more on Shalott itself. One of the examples that page uses is that: The yellowleavèd waterlily,
  The greensheathèd daffodilly,
  Tremble in the water chilly,
  Round about Shalott. was replaced with: And up and down the people go,
  gazing where the lilies blow. Later in the poem, Tennyson seems to want to insert more ambiguity about what, exactly, the story is surrounding her. The story becomes less straightforward, and what happens to her loses some definition in favor of narrative. The ultimate effect of this is to change the meaning and tonal feel of the ending of the piece. There are a good deal more examples of this (which I won't repeat here - see the link above), and it does seem to be the primary reason for the edit. "
How do I straighten out a paperback book's cover that is bent?,"If the cover has creased, the layers of the paper will have separated and the fibres pulled out of alignment. The crease is then bulkier than the rest of the cover and stretched on the side it bends away from. 
As you cannot push the fibres back into their former alignment, this is a technique I have used to get the cover to lie flat. Note, don't do this with a valuable book whose ££ you wish to retain, as it is ultimately a destructive method. 
I started with this book (click images to enlarge):  Turning to the inside of the cover, I used a fine scalpel blade to 'shave' away the upstanding line of the crease.  I then used tape strips across the shaved crease to restore tension to the inside face of the cover. I would have preferred to paste paper strips, but had no paste available.   The corner will remain damaged, but looks better when sitting out and is less likely to sustain more damage when being returned to the shelf."
How much did forensic science at the time of Sherlock Holmes' publication influence it?,"Doyle makes Holmes notoriously good at analyzing footprints to determine the gender, age, and in some cases, the motivation for the exact path taken by the possible culprit. Footprints have been used in a similar way in real forensive investigations as far back as the nineteenth century. The second method I can think of that Holmes makes extensive use of is handwriting analysis. This plays a prominent role throughout the entire series, as Holmes is able to tell the age, gender, and dominant hand of the person writing the document. In many cases, he can determine the type of ink used, the native language of the writer, and how similar two pieces of handwritten work are. Victorian society placed a high emphasis on handwriting, which is why several law enforcement agencies use handwriting analysis before the time Doyle wrote Sherlock Holmes. Holmes definitely makes extensive use this technique, although Doyle does overexaggerate it quite a bit. According to this blog, Sherlock also decodes ciphers: Sherlock Holmes solves a variety of ciphers...In The Valley of Fear Holmes has a man planted inside Professor Moriarty’s organization. When he receives an encoded message Holmes must first realize that the cipher uses a book. After deducing which book, he is able to retrieve the message...Holmes’s most successful use of cryptology occurs in The Dancing Men. His analysis of the stick figure men left as messages is done by frequency analysis, starting with “e” as the most common letter. Conan Doyle is again following Poe who earlier used the same idea in The Gold Bug (1843)."
What was the ethnicity of Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights?,"TL;DR: Heathcliff’s ethnicity is ambiguous. To the other characters, his appearance strikes them as foreign, but they cannot say with any certainty where he appears to be from. Mr Earnshaw’s unsatisfactory account of Heathcliff’s origins, together with his preference for the boy, lead us to suspect that Heathcliff may be his illegitimate mixed-race son. Lockwood says that Heathcliff is “a dark skinned gypsy, in aspect” (chapter I). Several other characters also call him a “gipsy”: Mrs Earnshaw (IV), Hindley (IV), Mrs Linton (VI), Joseph (IX), and Edgar (X). Nelly describes him as a “black-haired child” (IV) with “dark face and hair” (X) or “black hair, and eyes” (XX) and likens his eyes to a “couple of black fiends” (VII). She advises him, “A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad, if you were a regular black” (the implication being that he is not one) and says playfully, “You’re fit for a prince in disguise. Who knows but your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian queen” (VII). When he returns after making his fortune, “the cheeks were sallow, and half covered with black whiskers” (X). When he is ill, she is disturbed by “Those deep black eyes! That smile, and ghastly paleness!” (XXXIV). After he dies, she “combed his black long hair from his forehead” (XXXIV). Mr Linton says he is “a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway” (VI). (A lascar is a sailor from south or south-east Asia. The implication, I think, of “castaway”, is that his complexion is dark as if sun-tanned.) Isabella says that when Heathcliff prayed, “God was curiously confounded with his own black father” (XVII). I don’t think we can take any of the racial epithets literally: none of the characters have certain knowledge of Heathcliff’s background, so all that they can be saying is that he seems foreign in appearance. Mr Earnshaw’s story about how he found Heathcliff is given as follows by Nelly: The master tried to explain the matter; but he was really half dead with fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst her scolding, was a tale of his seeing it starving, and houseless, and as good as dumb, in the streets of Liverpool, where he picked it up and inquired for its owner. Not a soul knew to whom it belonged, he said; and his money and time being both limited, he thought it better to take it home with him at once, than run into vain expenses there: because he was determined he would not leave it as he found it. (Chapter IV) But is this a credible explanation? A couple of aspects of the episode are suspicious. First, why did he choose to walk all the way to Liverpool and back—“sixty miles each way, that is a long spell!” (IV)—when he could have ridden? We know that Mr Earnshaw owned horses, since Cathy can ride—“she was hardly six years old, but she could ride any horse in the stable” (IV). Perhaps he walked in order to be incognito—if he had ridden, he would have had to stable his horse at his destination, where he might be recognized. Second, what was his business in Liverpool? It must have been of short duration, since he was back in only three days, and it is hard to imagine that walking a hundred and twenty miles (half of it carrying the child) in that time left much spare for errands. But whatever his business was, it was urgent enough to leave the harvest in the hands of others. So I think a plausible idea is that Mr Earnshaw was summoned to Liverpool specifically to collect Heathcliff, but he was unwilling to admit this to his family, preferring to tell the foundling story instead. Why was he unwilling? William Empson considered the following possibility: It seems clear what Emily would have added to the plot if she had not wanted to avoid shocking the public. Old Earnshaw sets off to Liverpool on foot because a letter has told him that his younger brother’s son, by a lady of mixed race in the Port of Liverpool, has been left destitute. He avoids scandal by not saying that this is his nephew, and leaves telling the secret until too late. This is all that is needed to explain the assumptions of the story. William Empson (1966). Letter to Paunch. In Argufying: Essays on Literature and Culture, pp. 493–494. But I think a better theory is that Heathcliff is Mr Earnshaw’s own mixed-race son. We can imagine that on previous trips to Liverpool he has maintained a mistress, but she has died leaving their son to his care. This would explain more convincingly why he was unwilling to tell the truth to his wife and family. It would also explain why Mr Earnshow “took to Heathcliff strangely, believing all he said […], and petting him up far above Cathy, who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite” (IV), and why “they had christened him “Heathcliff”: it was the name of a son who died in childhood” (IV). Earnshaw […] gives a vague and illogical report of finding the homeless and starving child in the Liverpool gutters. Earnshaw’s rationalization of the adoption seems weak […] Even in an eighteenth-century provincial slum, the waif must have had some protector. Mrs. Earnshaw considers her husband to be mad, and the narrator, tart Nelly Dean, expresses doubts through her manner of recounting the tale. […] The brief picture of Mrs. Earnshaw presented here would certainly supply an added motive for concealment of a child who could possibly be Earnshaw’s illegitimate offspring. She “was ready to fling it out of doors”; she grumbles and berates the exhausted traveler. How would such a woman have reacted to any honest admission of sinful adultery? Earnshaw could only bring a by-blow into the family by devious means, as long as his wife was still alive. Eric Solomon (1959). ‘The Incest Theme in Wuthering Heights’. In Thomas A. Vogler ed. (1968). Twentieth Century Interpretations of Wuthering Heights, p. 111. New Jersey: Prentice-Hall."
"What did Scout mean when she said ""It takes a woman to do that kind of work""?","Its clear to see in To Killing A Mockingbird that Atticus cares for his children. Aunt Alexandra comes to visit the children because she feels they need some ""feminine influence"" after all they have no mother. Aunt Alexandra is shocked by Jem's description of Cousin Joshua and asks Atticus to speak to his children about their ""gentle breeding"" and she expects him to remind the children that they are not ""run of the mill people"". In this chapter Atticus talks to the children and tells Scout to be more ladylike and Jem to become more of a gentlemen. The children (being their age) do not properly grasp the context Atticus talks about and Scout begins to cry. When Atticus says ""Get more like Cousin Joshua every day, don't I? Do you think I'll end up costing the family five hundred dollars?"" He was trying to reassure his children by suggesting that maybe he might cost the family money like Cousin Joshua. Scout however recognizes Atticus' efforts to comfort her and she understands what he was trying to do, she respects Atticus trying to comfort them but she realizes that he lacks a mothers ability to nurture their children as it does not come naturally to him. Scout is referring to the absence of their motherly role in their family more than being sexist or prejudiced."
How wide was the exploration of Japan's culture in American literature before 1905?,"Probably not very wide, although there are more works than you might think. Some of these works, especially older works, were non-fictional. I will list a few works about Japan that were published in the USA and/or written in the USA or by American authors. Maybe more (non-fictional?) works can be found in A Collector's Guide to Books on Japan in English, Joseph Rogala, 2001.  Japan as It Was and Is (1855)
This was written by Richard Hildreth, who was, according to Wikipedia an American journalist, author and historian. However, it is non-fictional.  Japan in American Fiction, 1880-1905
It looks like there are at least two books in the series ""Japan in American Fiction, 1880-1905"": The first novel (you can read it here), was written by Edward Greey (1835-1888). Although he was born in England, he moved in 1868 to New York City. He wrote several Japan themed books, including Young Americans in Japan; or, The Adventures of the Jewett Family and their Friend Oto Nambo.  (source, here you can find a longer list of novels) The second one, A Muramasa blade, a story of feudalism in old Japan (you can read this here), was written by Louis Wertheimber. I can't find much information about this author. The book was published in 1887 by Boston: Ticknor and Company The American Diary of a Japanese Girl (1901)
According to Wikipedia, this was the first English language novel published in the United States by a Japanese writer, although I do not know whether this counts as American literature. "
What is Devdas syndrome?,"As far as I can tell, this seems not to be quite a formal, well-defined term. Rather, it's the use of an iconic cultural touchstone as shorthand for issues and tropes that come up often - and, just as the original creation can be interpreted in different ways, can be admired or criticized, people's use of the phrase ""Devdas syndrome"" seems to depend on their own interpretation of the story. Devdas is a tragedy -- rich Devdas and middle-class Parvati are in love, but the match is prevented by family, class, and culture. Devdas goes into a self-destructive spiral of melancholy and alcohol. ""The Devdas Phenomenon"", by Corey K. Creekmur, summarizes: Three key events carry the story to its hopeless conclusion: Finally, as he had promised (“If it’s the last thing I do, I’ll come to you”), Devdas drags himself to the entrance of Parvati’s home – to which she has been restricted — where he dies just before she is alerted to the presence of a stranger’s body just beyond the massive gates that shut her inside as she runs to him. (While these details may spoil the story for a first-time viewer, it’s clear that most Indian viewers come to any telling of the tale with the plot well-known and its now-familiar highlights eagerly anticipated with each retelling.) What I gather from the various discussions I've read is that Devdas is a story that romanticizes, perhaps not uncritically, its protagonist wallowing in sorrow and tragedy. So, Devdas Syndrome is roughly this: The romantic portrayal, of wallowing in sorrow, usually over an ended romance. This is how I'm seeing the phrase used and the story discussed, primarily casually, across the internet. For example, this essay describes Devdas Syndrome as the desire to romanticize failure: As a nation, we have always loved losers. And you cannot get a bigger loser than Devdas. He symbolizes everything that is  wrong with us. (...) Devdas refuses to rise above his sick and sodden self-image. In fact, he wallows in it and his
    death is a supreme act of completely meaningless sacrifice. An escape,
    as it were, from the sheer trauma of coping with life.  By enshrining the story of this eternal loser and packaging it so
    lovingly and misleadingly as the story of the eternal lover, Bhansali
    ends up romanticizing Devdas. Or ""The Devdas Syndrome: Turning Heartbreak into Hatred"", which uses the phrase to describe people who cannot get over a failed romance, who are bitter and entitled and blame all their problems on the girl who told them no.  And of course, not every interpretation sees romanticizing tragedy as something to be avoid it. Some find it powerful and moving: He wanted love and intensely loved, and yet could not express both. His unfulfilled love did not stop him from loving uncondition- ally... thus making his love immortal even though it destroyed him later in his life. Ultimately, Devdas is a story that projects emotion as its hero.  This understanding of Devdas Syndrome seems borne out by this description of the author of the original 1917 novella feeling it has misled people At one time Sarat told his pals that if he only he had visualised the negative impact his book was going to have on the youth he would not have permitted his book to be filmed at all!  (I do not know whether this anecdote is true, false, or a fictional portrayal, but in any event it's indicative of public opinion of the creation.)"
"Is the cliffhanger at the end of ""First among sequels"" resolved?","There's a larger context to the unresolved cliffhanger, and yes, it is an unresolved cliffhanger.
At the end of First Among Sequels, Thursday is fleeing an exploding airship (at the denouement, in an edition of The Eyre Affair [just go with it]), when her usual escape method (bookjumping) has been textually seived out of commission.
The context being that there is a serial killer (a killer of serialised characters), who has made attempts at Tempe Brennan and Harry Potter, succeeded at taking out Sherlock Holmes, and the airship blowing up is the third attempt at Thursday's life (Norman Johnson, the pagerunner Minotaur, and the written Felix8 having tried earlier).
Obviously, whoever the killer is, they have pull, as only a Jurisfiction Agent or a member of the Council of Genres, has the power to order the aforementioned textual seive, as well as hide Felix8's transfictional travel. But the Minotaur does not trust Jurisfiction owing to his 5 year imprisonment (see The Well of Lost Plots for further info).
Additionally, during the Minotaur's original escape, had 'Who killed Godot?' as a cliffhanger (Godot being the Jurisfiction Agent killed before the UltraWord™ conspiracy started to unravel, and who's head is in a sack for most of the Thursday3).
A long-running conspiracy, or dangling plot-threads?
Finally, it was the Taxi driver that had the steering column rammed through him, not Thursday herself."
"If Phileas Fogg had a clock that showed the exact date and time, why didn't he realize that he had arrived a day early?","This is a well-known plot hole. See Wikipedia's article on the book. However, Fogg's mistake would not have been likely to occur in the real world because a de facto date line did exist. The UK, India, and the US had the same calendar with different local times. When he arrived in San Francisco, he would have noticed that the local date was one day earlier than shown in his travel diary. Consequently, it is unlikely he would fail to notice that the departure dates of the transcontinental train in San Francisco and of the China steamer in New York were one day earlier than his travel diary. He would also somehow have to avoid looking at any newspapers. Additionally, in Who Betrays Elizabeth Bennet?, John Sutherland points out that Fogg and company would have to be ""deaf, dumb and blind"" not to notice how busy the streets were on an apparent ""Sunday"", with the Sunday Observance Act 1780 still in effect. The last line especially indicates Verne was going for dramatic effect (with success, since most readers probably did not realize what was going to happen until it did)."
"What is meant by the title ""The Color of Money""?","D. A. Hosek's quote from the novel is interesting and relevant, but fails to note that it riffing on an old phrase. The Colour of Money The colour of money is a phrase that is often used in the betting world, but what exactly does the colour of money mean?
...
in the betting world the colour of money has a more precise meaning. In this case, to see the colour of someone’s money means to see proof that the person has money to bet with. For example, if there were two men in a bar and one invited the other to bet £50 on a game of pool, the person being invited to bet might respond: “Show me the colour of your money first,” which basically means, “Let me see that you have £50 on you to bet with.” If the bettor can demonstrate that he has the cash on him to bet with, the wager might be accepted, but if the bettor can’t show the colour of his money, it would probably be rejected. So,  it is a phrase that a pool hustler might use in regard to making a bet. But also has a clever double meaning with pool tables and dollar bills both being green. The phrase itself dates back to  at least 1905, if not older."
"What does Wednesday mean by ""the flowers in your hair are optional""?","It is a reference to the song ‘San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear [Some] Flowers in Your Hair)’.

If you're going to San Francisco
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If you're going to San Francisco
You're gonna meet some gentle people there Whether there is a deeper significance to the reference in the book, I can’t say."
"Why does Robert Frost contradict himself in ""The Road Not Taken""","Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
   I took the one less traveled by,
   And that has made all the difference. Quotes have a way of taking on a life of their own. These lines, the last three lines of Frost's The Road Not Taken, have been endlessly quoted by many people: as epigraphs in their books, on their personal web pages, and so on. And why not? They express an idea that is almost heroic: of doing the unconventional thing, being a maverick rather a conformist, of the virtue of individualism that has always resonated in America, of the satisfaction (or regret!) that your choice ended up making a difference. To use language is to give expression to ideas; language begins to turn into poetry when the ideas are striking, or the form is striking, or both. Here we have a master poet who has cloaked this idea in creative language, and there are all sorts of subtle things that make the words memorable and charming. (The rhyme, the repetition of the “I”, …) So those who wish to “borrow” the language of a poet to express this idea about themselves are certainly not doing anything “wrong”. In the context of the poem, though, it appears that the author may have intended (see questions on authorial-intent) something else (or something more), which becomes apparent if we read the poem closely, in its entirety and in order. So let's do that: Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
  And sorry I could not travel both
  And be one traveler, long I stood   In the very first line the author sets the context quickly: here he is, faced with two roads in a wood. Of course, being a single person he can't travel both (what a delightfully absurd idea!), so he's having to make up his mind. This he does: And looked down one as far as I could
  To where it bent in the undergrowth;   Then took the other, as just as fair,
  And having perhaps the better claim,
  Because it was grassy and wanted wear;   He's considered one road and then decided to take the other one, which (“as just as fair”) is very similar. Why? Simply because it appears “perhaps” better, after looking at its grass and feeling that it needs walking on. Immediately after making this decision on such flimsy grounds though, he is aware that: Though as for that the passing there
  Had worn them really about the same,   And both that morning equally lay
  In leaves no step had trodden black.  So, then again (“Though as for that”), the difference is not such a big one, possibly even non-existent. Both roads are good; perhaps the one he didn't take is good too. (You could call this contradiction, but it's just that on closer examination the difference has vanished. And whenever we list pros-and-cons of any choice, taking one side of the matter and then the other, we are, in a sense, contradicting ourselves.) So there is already a fear of having picked the wrong one, which is assuaged with: Oh, I kept the first for another day!
  Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
  I doubted if I should ever come back.   “The next time I'm here, I'll take the other one” is what he tells himself, knowing fully well that there may not be a next time. What's more likely to happen is something else (I've added the quotation marks for clarity): I shall be telling this with a sigh
  Somewhere ages and ages hence:
  “Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
  I took the one less traveled by,
  And that has made all the difference.”   Remember the original reason he picked the second road, because it was “perhaps” better, as it was “grassy and wanted wear”? The reason which, on closer examination, turned out to be flimsy as the difference was negligible? No matter; he's going to stick to that story. Years later, at parties and to grandchildren, he's going to make the difference seem larger than it was. Exaggerate it, put on an act (“telling this with a sigh”), claim that his decision has always been to take the less-travelled road, and that this has made a difference. So those who take the last three lines and think that they represent Frost's intention can be said to have “misunderstod” the poem. (See similar comments by David Orr, in video and in text — he's written an entire book called The Road Not Taken: Finding America in the Poem Everyone Loves and Almost Everyone Gets Wrong and the excerpt linked is good reading.) It is also telling that many people misremember the poem's title as The Road Less Traveled: Frost may have intended the title The Road Not Taken to be about the road he did not take, but many people who are strongly affected by the last lines seem to have interpreted the poem as being about the road not taken by (many) others: the less-travelled road he did take. However, (as I said at the beginning of this answer), they are perfectly valid in their understanding of those three lines specifically, which are indeed intended to convey the idea they have. (That's why he's going to say it “ages and ages hence”: because it is really an awesome thing to say!) The poet is fooling around and mocking the utterance of that idea, sure, as is clear from reading the entire poem and as convincingly demonstrated by the historical research in Rand al-Thor's answer, but the poet is also on to something more here. The metaphorical application of the poem to a scope beyond forest-navigation is obvious, as the experience is universal: we have all been faced with questions like “which subjects should I study?” “Should I stay at my current job or take the new one?”. And we have responded with reasoning like “I will study [X] because it will fulfill my soul” or “I will stay at my current job because career prospects are better”. But people change, the world changes, and this reasoning may turn out to be rubbish. We are left rationalizing the choices we did make, or overstating their significance. This is life. We are faced with choices; we hesitate and waver; we consider one option and then the other; we pick somewhat randomly for reasons that seem good at the time; we know these reasons don't always hold water; we may tell ourselves we can still try the other one and only sometimes admit to ourselves that the decision may be irrevocable; we later muse/wonder about having taken the other choice (The Road Not Taken); we make peace by telling grand stories about how our choice was the right one (or sorrow by telling how our choice was the bad one). So the last lines may be an act, but the propensity to put on such an act is very real. Possibly without intending it, Frost has created a masterpiece that succinctly captures all of this in 20 memorable lines (with rhyme and metre), with the images of a “yellow wood” to boot. Having understood all this about human nature though, one arrives at a maturity that goes back to the point Frost was trying to make to his friend Edward Thomas (again, see Rand al-Thor's answer): no matter which choice we make, we'll go through the same sequence of emotions anyway. It's just two roads in a wood; the choice doesn't matter. Quit agonizing so much, pick one and keep moving. A couple of comments based on other Frost poems: This is not the only Frost quote that is loved by people even though the context of the poem is against it. Many people attribute “Good fences make good neighbors” to Frost or his poem Mending Wall, even though in the poem the narrator is speaking against someone who utters that proverb mindlessly. (Here too, the distinction between someone who says something and means it, and the poet thinking about the act of saying it.) In a sense, Frost's Fire And Ice is also a similar consideration-reconsideration, which you could call “contradicting himself”: picking one option and then saying the other will do too."
"Accented è in Blake's ""The little ones leapèd, and shoutèd, and laugh'd / And all the hills echoèd.""","The 'èd' verb ending in 19th-century and earlier poems indicates that you are supposed to pronounce the ending -ed as a separate syllable. This is not the spelling Blake used when he originally wrote this poem. He did not put the accent on leaped and shouted.  So why do editors add the accent today? Today, in English, there are two ways of forming past tenses of regular verbs. If the verb ends with a /t/ or /d/, we add an extra syllable, as in printed. Otherwise, we either add the consonant /t/ or /d/, as in laughed, grinned or echoed. When Blake wrote, the convention in poetry was to pronounce all past tenses spelled with 'ed' with an extra syllable, even though these endings weren't pronounced in normal speech. If the poet didn't want an extra syllable, they would replace the 'e' with an apostrophe, as in cover'd, leap'd, and laugh'd. Today, since people don't understand this convention, editors insert an accented 'è' in past tenses when the poet wanted you to pronounce an extra syllable, like
leapèd, shoutèd, and echoèd in Blake's poem. How did this convention develop? In late Middle English, most verbs formed past tenses by adding an extra syllable. When Shakespeare wrote, in Early Modern English, the extra syllable was in the process of disappearing, and most regular verbs had two pronunciations in widespread use. Shakespeare and his contemporaries generally distinguished between these two pronunciations using spelling (although they didn't use accents and often didn't use apostrophes). Over the next two centuries, poets took advantage of the freedom to use these two different pronunciations so as to make their poems rhyme and scan, even though people had long stopped pronouncing the extra syllable in ordinary language (except for words like printed, where we still pronounce it today). How should these be pronounced? If you look at the poems of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, they rhymed ""-ed"" past tense endings with words ending in /ɛd/, like bed and dead. Two hundred years later, Blake and Keats were still using those rhymes. Was this how this ending was pronounced in everyday English? If you look at Walker's Critical Pronouncing Dictionary from 1824, past tenses like blessed, learned, repeatedly, unrepented, are pronounced with /ɛd/, even though words ending with ""-ed"" that aren't past tenses, like naked, ragged, wicked, are pronounced with /ɪd/. So Blake and Keats pronounced the ""-èd"" ending  the same way that (at least some) people pronounced past tenses of regular verbs ending with -ted or -ded. So when you read poetry with -èd endings, how should you pronounce them? That's up to you; I can see arguments both for pronouncing it as /ɛd/, and for pronouncing it the same way you pronounce the past tenses of regular verbs like created."
"Why did the alexandrine become the ""natural"" metre for French verse drama, whereas English renaissance drama adopted the iambic pentameter?","There are two parts to this question: why does English use iambic meter while French doesn't, and why does English have 10 syllables in each line of iambic pentameter, while French has 12 syllables per line in an alexandrine. To answer the second question first, it may be pure chance that French settled on 12 syllables per line, while English settled on 10. There are lots of English poems in iambic meter with 8, 10, or 14 syllables per line, and they all work fine. And the dominant meter in French was the decasyllable before it was displaced by the alexandrine in the 17th century. The reason that French doesn't use iambic meters is because it's very difficult to write iambic poetry in French. Before I can explain any further, I need to say something about stress patterns in English and French and some of the rules that govern alexandrines. In English, every word (except function words like and, in, the has some accented syllable, and poetry has to accommodate these. You can emphasize words by using stress, but these emphases fall on top of the phonemic stress patterns already present within the words. In French, there is no stress pattern associated with the words; the stress accents are associated with phrases, and always fall on the last syllable of every phrase. (Except for mute e's, which are never accented. Most of these mute e's are pronounced in songs and poems, but only a relatively small fraction are pronounced in usual speech.) So if a word is pronounced alone, its last syllable always has an accent, but if it's in the middle of a phrase, it probably won't. The alexandrine has 12 or 13 syllables in every line, depending on whether they end with a mute e (which today are generally not pronounced at the end of a line of poetry, so effectively each line has 12 syllables today). The lines are divided into two halves (hemistiches) of 6 syllables each. There is always an accent on the 6th and 12th syllables of each line, and there usually is one other accented syllable in each hemistich. To give an example, from Baudelaire's Chant d'automne (Autumn Song), the first two lines are: Bientôt nous plongerons // dans les froides ténèbres;
Adieu, vive clarté // de nos étés trop courts! Shortly we will plummet // into the cold darkness;
Farewell, vivid brilliance // of our summers too short! Here I've tried to give a fairly literal translation (keeping six syllables per hemistich) and I've bolded the accented syllables in French. Note that no syllables are accented in the French word vive (vivid). This is because if you have an adjective-noun combination in that order in French, you don't need to accent any syllables in the adjective (you can see from this that French will have fewer accented syllables than English, making writing iambic meters much harder). For an entirely English illustration, here is Roy Campbell's translation of the first four lines into iambic pentameter, followed by my translation of the first foru lines into an English version of the French alexandrine. Soon into frozen shades, like leaves, we'll tumble.
Adieu, short summer's blaze, that shone to mock.
I hear already the funereal rumble
Of logs, as on the paving-stones they shock. We will soon be engulfed // by the cold and the dark.
Dear summer, fare thee well! // Your visit was too short.
I can already hear // the funereal shocks
Of firewood as it falls // on the stones of the court. Note that the second line would be iambic hexameter if you put stress on the words fare and was. But you wouldn't if it was a French alexandrine. When reading alexandrine poetry, there is a strong tendency to parse it so exactly two syllables are stressed in each hemastich (although this isn't always possible). Similarly, when reading iambic poetry, there is a strong tendency to put some stress on every other syllable, even those (like the and on in the example above) that wouldn't be stressed ordinarily. And again, this isn't always possible. So to get a line of iambic verse in French, it needs to consist entirely of two-syllable phrases. This is quite a bit shorter than French phrases usually are. Lines of iambic hexameter are rare in French poetry. The penultimate line of part I of the above poem, Chant d'automne is one. I believe Baudelaire quite deliberately wrote it as iambic hexameter,  and I suspect it took some effort his part: Pour qui? — C'était hier l'été; voici l'automne! For whom? — It was yesterday summer; look: here's autumn! Edit: I've had a few more thoughts about why alexandrines came to be dominant in French poetry.  French poetic meters are generally composed from parts with an even number of syllables, almost always 4, 6, and 8. Decasyllables are generally broken into 4+6 syllables, while alexandrines are broken into 6+6. Thus, in some sense, alexandrines are more symmetric, and this may be more pleasing. (Although maybe I'm wrong about this, since decasyllables were more dominant for several centuries, although alexandrines were also used during this period.) And why doesn't iambic hexameter occur very often in English? My conjecture (which could be completely misguided) is that iambic hexameter has long enough lines that you need to divide them into halves. If you divide all the lines into three feet + three feet, it's too regular, and sounds boring. Whereas if you divide some into three + three feet, and some into two + four and four + two, it's too irregular."
What is the origin of this contradictory poem?,"The book The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren by Iona and Peter Opie, published in 1959, catalogues many different schoolyard poems from throughout the first half of the twentieth century, including the following version of the one you're interested in: Ladles and jellyspoons
  I stand upon this speech to make a platform
  the train I arrived in has not yet come
  so I took a bus and walked
  I come before you to stand behind you
  and tell you something I know nothing about! One fine day in the middle of the night
  two dead men got up to a fight
  back to back they faced each other
  drew their swords and shot each other
  a paralysed donkey passing by
  kicked a blind man in the eye
  knocked him through a nine inch wall
  into a dry ditch and drowned them all. I haven't actually read the Opies' book myself, but according to this page: Opie noted that this had been collected in 12 different schools around the UK, but that it had also been collected, with almost no variation, fifty years before. It was probably older than that, too. This rhyme most likely evolved from other nonsense rhymes based on similar themes: opposites put together, blind people watching, deaf people hearing, and so on. A manuscript in the Bodleian library dating back to 1480 contains the following lines: I saw three headless [men] playing at a ball,
  A handless man served them all.
  While three mouthless men laughed,
  Three legless [men] from them ran. I've also found several sources pointing to a 1305 manuscript The Land of Cockaigne for an even older version of this kind of nonsense poem, but I haven't managed to track down a copy of the original manuscript to check the details. The primary source here appears to be The Mummers' Play by R. J. E. Tiddy, published in 1923, the relevant citation being on p. 116.

With such a long history, it seems the best conclusion we can draw is that the idea of this poem has been around so long that it's pretty much a folk tradition. It's been handed down from generation to generation, probably mostly orally, and has of course changed and mutated quite a lot over the last seven hundred years. But trying to pin down an 'original author', for any particular version of the poem, is a fruitless venture in this centuries-long game of Chinese Whispers. Even today, there are many slightly different versions of the poem, and no single 'canonical' wording - just look at the number of variations listed here and here, for example.

As for your bonus question about the genre of this poem, I would say it's a classical nonsense rhyme. It should be noted, however, that there are two distinct kinds of nonsense poem: ones like this where the words make sense individually but become nonsensical when put together in the right way, and ones like Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky which are full of nonsense words. Some would say that only the latter counts as a true nonsense rhyme: Although the Two Dead Boys poem (“One Fine Day in the Middle of the Night”) is often referred to as a nonsense rhyme, the description is not strictly accurate. It is clearly understandable in any of its many forms and versions and the impossibilities in the story are no more than sensible words and phrases that have been transposed. An example of a true nonsense rhyme can be seen for instance in the first four lines of Lewis Carroll’s “Jabberwocky” from Through the Looking Glass [...] One can get a feeling for the severe, gathering darkness of the poem from Carroll’s introductory lines but, until Humpty Dumpty explains it in its entirety, the poem, and particularly these first four lines, makes no sense at all. But in everyday parlance, ""nonsense verse"" can certainly be used to cover both types of poem. The former type specifically have also been called ballads of impossibilities: The folklorist and writer Ed Cray, writing to others on an Internet ballad chat line, noted that the rhyme [the same one you're asking about] was a “Ballad of Impossibilities” and that, “A number of these songs/ballads of impossibilities were printed as broadsides in the 18th and 19th centuries.[”]"
Children’s poem about a boy stuck between the tracks on the underground,"This is Michael Rosen's poem ""Nightmare"", found in his book Mustard, custard, grumble belly and gravy, which is available to borrow on the Internet Archive: I'm down
I'm underground I'm down the Underground Waiting Waiting for a train There's the platform
There's the lines
There's the tunnel
There's the lines. I'll wait down there
Down between the lines
Waiting for the train
Down between the lines.
I'll climb down there
Down between the lines
and wait for the train
down there. [...] I'm between the lines
and the train's coming.
Can't you see? [...] I'm still down
Can't anyone see me
down between the lines? [...]  Interestingly, I found an article about Mike Rosen's visit to a school where he mentioned this very scenario as a recurring boyhood nightmare (probably, based on ""I used to have"") of his: 'Nightmares… do you have nightmares? I used to have one about the underground in London. I'm in the underground, down between the lines. And the platform's getting higher and coming to squeeze me. And I can see a train coming, nearer and nearer. And I'm shouting, ""I'm here. Down between the lines. Can't somebody see me?""… ' This was quite a tricky one to find, since Google doesn't index this poem at all. I found the above school-visit quote by searching for variants of your phrases, such as ""between the rails"" or ""between the lines"" as well as ""between the tracks"". The query poem rosen ""between the lines"" train is coming got me to that page, but no sign of any poem on the same theme. I was about to post my answer just mentioning that school-visit story, and speculating that maybe you misremembered it as a poem. But if that really was a nightmare of his, it's plausible that he'd turn it into a poem! So I gave up on Google and searched the Internet Archive for the phrase ""down between the lines"", which got me to the right source finally."
What are the Riddle Rules?,"We don't really know, as they're not mentioned. We don't know all of the rules, because they're never really mentioned - this is the only time AFAIK, and they don't really say much: ""Both wrong,"" cried Bilbo very much relieved; and he jumped at once to his feet, put his back to the wall, and held out his little sword. He knew, of course, that the riddle-game was sacred and of immense antiquity, and even wicked creatures were afraid to cheat when they played it. But he felt he could not trust this slimy thing to keep any promise at a pinch. Any excuse would do for him to slide out of it. And after all that last question had not been a genuine riddle according to the ancient laws.
The Hobbit, chapter 5 However, we can take a guess as to what the one that he broke here is: Each riddle must have a clearly correct answer. Bilbo's question wasn't a riddle, as it could have lots of answers, and cannot be proved. (This is actually sort of like what we do on Puzzling - riddles that don't have an answer that can be proved to fit all of the lines are closed.)"
When did men dressed as women stop being the norm in English theatre?,"It started in the 1600s, and was a gradual process not a sudden one. By the Edwardian era, it was no surprise to the audience to see an actress on stage. Up until the 1600s, women had very few rights, and there was no chance of a woman appearing on stage. Theater was popular during the early 1600s and in other places in Europe woman first appeared on stage during operas. This, however, angered the church, and the public wasn't too pleased either. Women first appeared on stage in England during Charles I's reign (1625-1649), but the actors themselves were not English, they were French. Charles's Queen, Henrietta Maria, was a Frenchwoman and it was her influence that brought a French company, complete with actresses, to perform in London at the Blackfriars Theatre. The public were horrified, and the rising Puritans even more so. An audience member called Thomas Brande wrote the following to the Bishop of London about the play: Glad I am to saye that they [the actresses] were hissed, hooted, and pippin-pelted from the stage, so as I do not think they will soone be ready to trie the same againe. The first introduction of actresses had been a failure. And as Oliver Cromwell abolished the crown and banned theater, there was no chance of actresses becoming normal. However, during Charles II's banishment, he had seen French plays were it was already normal for actresses to be seen on stage. During the restoration of the crown, he wanted women to be allowed to appear on stage, but he had to do it in a way such that the puritans and public wouldn't be angry. He granted a charter to the Drury Lane company. It stated all females be played by woman, not men. The document still exists today (trying to find image or transcript can't find). The reaction was mixed, but not entirely outraged. However, as the first women started appearing, the public began both accepting it and expecting it, and theater companies realised it brought in more audience members, so allowed character roles to be played by woman. The first legal actress was Margaret Hughes, who became the first woman to perform on an English stage at the Vere Street theatre, on 8 December 1660. She played Desdemona in Shakespeare's Othello. Soon after came the famous Nell Gwyn, an actress and the King's mistress. Moving into the 1700s, and Victorian era, actresses were abundant and some famous enough to marry into nobility.

What did Suzanne Collins base the Hunger Games on?,"She was inspired by a combination of the classic myth of Theseus (in which Athens similarly sends a selection of young men and women to Crete as a 'tribute', the difference being that none of them survive), reality TV shows (many of which involve people being humiliated, albeit not murdered, for the entertainment of the masses), and her second-hand experience of war (both from watching television coverage and hearing about it from her veteran father). The author has addressed this at length in an interview: Thanks to a cruel futuristic government, 24 children are chosen by lottery to compete in the annual Hunger Games—a fight to the death that’s televised live. How did you come up with that idea? It’s very much based on the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur, which I read when I was eight years old. I was a huge fan of Greek and Roman mythology. As punishment for displeasing Crete, Athens periodically had to send seven youths and seven maidens to Crete, where they were thrown into the labyrinth and devoured by the Minotaur, which is a monster that’s half man and half bull. Even when I was a little kid, the story took my breath away, because it was so cruel, and Crete was so ruthless. You’re not kidding. The message is, mess with us and we’ll do something worse than kill you—we’ll kill your children. And the parents sat by apparently powerless to stop it. The cycle doesn’t end until Theseus volunteers to go, and he kills the Minotaur. In her own way, Katniss [the heroine of The Hunger Games] is a futuristic Theseus. But I didn’t want to do a labyrinth story. So I decided to write basically an updated version of the Roman gladiator games. What inspired you to write it? One night, I was lying in bed, and I was channel surfing between reality TV programs and actual war coverage. On one channel, there’s a group of young people competing for I don’t even know; and on the next, there’s a group of young people fighting in an actual war. I was really tired, and the lines between these stories started to blur in a very unsettling way. That’s the moment when Katniss’s story came to me. Why did those programs speak to you so deeply? When I was a kid, my dad fought in Vietnam. He was gone for a year. Even though my mom tried to protect us—I’m the youngest of four—sometimes the TV would be on, and I would see footage from the war zone. I was little, but I would hear them say “Vietnam,” and I knew my dad was there, and it was very frightening. I’m sure that a lot of people today experience that same thing. But there is so much programming, and I worry that we’re all getting a little desensitized to the images on our televisions. If you’re watching a sitcom, that’s fine. But if there’s a real-life tragedy unfolding, you should not be thinking of yourself as an audience member. Because those are real people on the screen, and they’re not going away when the commercials start to roll."
"What is the ""Neon god"" in ""The Sound of Silence"" by Simon and Garfunkel?","The ""neon god"" is obviously the sign pictured earlier in the song.  But why is it a god? The sign is a god because people made it a god (""the neon god they made""). In praying and bowing to the sign, they made it into a god.  What the sign represents, though, is harder to answer. Many interpretations I've found have said it represented advertising and TV. According to Garfunkel (this quote is from Wikipedia, but it's directly quoted from a book on Paul Simon's life): Garfunkel once summed up the song's meaning as ""the inability of people to communicate with each other, not particularly internationally but especially emotionally, so what you see around you are people unable to love each other."" It seems the song is about people's inability to communicate with all of the television watching and stuff; people who don't have any kind of original thought.  I haven't found any direct quotes on the meaning other than Garfunkel's above, so you're just going to have to take what you can get. However, this site cites Simon as saying this in an interview with NPR: It's not a sophisticated thought, but a thought that I gathered from some college reading material or something. It wasn't something that I was experiencing at some deep, profound level - nobody's listening to me, nobody's listening to anyone - it was a post-adolescent angst, but it had some level of truth to it and it resonated with millions of people. Largely because it had a simple and singable melody."" It sounds like he just wrote the lyrics, then realized that they fit nicely with this theme."
"What order should I read the ""Ender's game"" series in?","In my personal opinion, the best order would be the publishing order.

This list also doesn't include the many other books in the same universe, it's just the main ones."
Why did Douglas Adams call Paul Neil Milne Johnstone the worst poet?,"It seems likely that Adams was just taking an opportunity to get one more adolescent dig in at an old friend and rival, who thus got to be immortalized as the ""worst poet in the universe.""  Sources claim that Adams was a regular contributor to Johnstone's high school English zine, and that the two of them jointly received a prize in English while attending the Brentwood School in Essex.  The poem attributed to him in the book as an example of his wretchedness was actually written by him (I'm guessing as another high school joke).  An old schoolmate of both of them remembers Johnstone as ""unbearably pompous for a 19-year old"" but Adams as only slightly less so. His name was disguised in the print editions of The Hitchhiker's Guide as ""Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings,"" after he complained, apparently not because of being called the ""worst poet"" but because his complete actual home address was included in the original broadcast (which seems like a reasonable concern). So in other words, Adams was both trolling Johnstone and doxing him, doubtlessly for his own personal amusement.  Would any one among us do less for an old high-school friend? The dead swans lay in the stagnant pool.
  They lay. They rotted. They turned
  Around occassionally.

Was C. S. Lewis condemning nuclear weapons in The Magician's Nephew?,"The Magician's Nephew is set a generation before The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, specifically 1900 (see Wikipedia). The latter book is set during World War II. Thus, in the time frame of The Magician's Nephew, nuclear weapons had not yet been discovered.  Thus, at the time the book is set, the nuclear weapon is still a hypothetical future invention, and the text is consistent with Aslan referring to nuclear weapons.  As for the ""great nations of your world will be ruled by tyrants,"" both Hitler and Stalin would seem to qualify. Neither had risen to power yet, but both would within 35 years, which fits very well with the time frame ""before you are an old man and an old woman."" On a related note, C.S. Lewis wrote the essay On Living in an Atomic Age, where he doesn't really address the question as to whether atomic bombs are evil. He does say that civilization would end eventually, with or without the invention of the atomic bomb, and all the atomic bomb could do is bring that end earlier. Thus, according to Lewis, all the pools in the Wood between the Worlds are eventually destined to dry up. "
What does 'Gilead' mean in The Raven?,"Commentators like William Giraldi, The Annotated Poe,  point out that this refers to Jeremiah 8:22: Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered? Wikipedia says that the Balm of Gilead, speaking figuratively, is a ""universal cure,"" and Les Harding writes: To ask the question found in Jeremiah 8:22, ""Is there no balm in Gilead?"" is to ask ""Is there no relief or consolation for the evils which befall us?"" (source) David L. Jeffrey cites ""The Raven"" as an example of an ironic use of the phrase, while retaining the biblical association: In Poe's ""The Raven"" a desperate speaker cries out for hope, but does so to a ""thing of evil"" (source) Kevin Reynaud interprets it similarly, and connects the phrase to the broader context of the poem: The mention of Gilead refers to the Bible in which the balm of Gilead was a healing ointment, implying that the narrator's only cure to depression is to be reunited with Lenore in Heaven.

Why does Marley in A Christmas Carol claim that Scrooge will be visited across three nights?,"The visitations do happen over the course of three days as seen by that Scrooge goes to bed at past two in the morning, the first two visitations have Scrooge awakening shortly after midnight, and waiting to hear the clock strike one before the ghost appears. As per Marley's statement, the third ghost, the the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come appears right after midnight. Scrooge does note the first time passage and is astonished. At the second, he is so bemused from his experience that he does not know what to expect. And, of course, the third ghost appears in the wake of the second. To his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have got into the works. Twelve! .... “Why, it isn’t possible,” said Scrooge, “that I can have slept through a whole day and far into another night. It isn’t possible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!” .... “The hour itself,” said Scrooge, triumphantly, “and nothing else!” He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep, dull, hollow, melancholy One. Light flashed up in the room upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn. .... The Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground. He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep. Awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of One.... Gentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don’t mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much. Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the Bell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling.... The bell struck twelve. Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like a mist along the ground, towards him. Given that the second ghost, ostensibly showing him the present, brings him to Christmas Day, it seems that the ghosts are not moored to time, and therefore can rewind the day as necessary to bring him all three visits, and have it still be Christmas Day upon his waking for the final time. As far as I know, Dickens never commented on the timing of the visits, but I have seen commentaries linking it to the three days before Jesus rose from the dead (along with more tying it to being Christian allegory), or to Scrooge being a man who lived only in the present, having rejected his past and gathering money not for any future purpose, but to have it now (and yet, doing nothing with it, living in virtual privation), and therefore he was already detached from time."
What is the bananafish? What does it represent?,"The bananafish represents Seymour, and all the other returning soldiers. ""Well, they swim into a hole where there's a lot of bananas. They're very ordinary-looking fish when they swim in. But once they get in, they behave like pigs. Why, I've known some bananafish to swim into a banana hole and eat as many as seventy-eight bananas."" He edged the float and its passenger a foot closer to the horizon. ""Naturally, after that they're so fat they can't get out of the hole again. Can't fit through the door.""
  ...
  Sybil said, ""What happens to them?""
  ""What happens to who?""
  ""The bananafish.""
  ""Oh, you mean after they eat so many bananas they can't get out of the banana hole?""
  ""Yes,"" said Sybil.
  ""Well, I hate to tell you, Sybil. They die.""
  ""Why?"" asked Sybil.
  ""Well, they get banana fever. It's a terrible disease.""   This represents Seymour pretty accurately. He and other soldiers came into war as ordinary men, like the bananafishes were ordinary when they went into the hole. In the hole (war), they became full of horror and/or pleasure at fighting, like the bananafishes eating the bananas and becoming full of.. well.. bananas. They became trapped inside the hole (war) and diseased. In the case of the soldiers, in more ways than one.  They became full of literal diseases, because the trenches are a nasty place, but they also became mentally ill."
Are any Sherlock Holmes antagonists besides Moriarty based on real people?,"I'd like to go into Moriarty in more detail, because Worth was not the only inspiration for Moriarty. Doyle did not simply draw on Worth for inspiration. Masters of Crime states that Doyle himself only acknowledged being inspired by one criminal: Jonathan Wild, a 17th and 18th century master of the criminal underworld. In The Valley of Fear, he is even referenced by Holmes: Everything comes in circles—even Professor Moriarty. Jonathan Wild was the hidden force of the London criminals, to whom he sold his brains and his organization on a fifteen per cent commission. The evidence pointing to Worth as another inspiration is largely circumstantial but quite apparent. He was once referred to as ""the Napoleon of crime"" by a Scotland yard detective (see Masters of Crime), a phrase Doyle my have appropriated for Moriarty. Like Moriarty - and like Wild - he was famous for creating a large criminal network in London to which he could seldom be traced. Adler, who appears in A Scandal in Bohemia may have been inspired by several real-life singers and courtesans. The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes lists quite a few, including Lola Montez (mistress of Ludwig I of Bavaria, which hearkens to  the story), Lillie Langtry (whose career is similar to Adler's), Pauline Lucca, Laura Bell, and others. The Doctor and the Detective also mentions one Ludmilla Hubel, whose love affair with Archduke Johann Salvator parallels Adler's relationship with the King of Bohemia. Viktor Adler, an Austrian politician, may be the source of the name ""Adler"". Doyle's famous blackmailer, who appeared in The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton, bears a striking similarity to the 19th century Charles Augustus Howell in both name and occupation (blackmailer and art dealer). London After Midnight states the Doyle himself admitted as such, although I'm still trying to confirm this. It's also worth noting that Masters of Crime, which drew parallels between Moriarty and Wild and Worth, same book states that John Clay, the hidden antagonist of The Red-Headed League, can be similarly traced. He shares characteristics of Worth and a criminal rival of Worth's named Max Shinburn - even though Doyle did not, at the time of the story's publication, know about either of the two. The author describes Clay as a ""dummy run"" for Moriarty, although Doyle could not have had Worth in mind at the time. It seems possible that Doyle based Clay on Wild, though. The obvious similarity is the ability to hide behind accomplices, distance oneself from the crime, and avoid capture, which Clay has, according to Holmes, used quite often in the past. Both, too, seem to have spun vast webs - perhaps not quite at the level of Moriarty - covering a wide range of illegal activities, from petty theft to murder."
"Is this hypothesis about the significance of the name ""Denna"" in the Kingkiller Chronicle supported by the text?","Denner resin comes from the sap of denner trees, and addicts ('sweet-eaters') will go to great lengths to eat it. It usually turns their teeth white, as it does for a girl whom Kvothe sees dance naked on the snow as part of a deal she made to get some. It is addictive and triggers euphoria for a time, but it has nasty side effects like numbness, delirium, and disorientation.  There are reasons to doubt that a) Denna symbolises/personifies denner resin, and b) that Denna is a physical manifestation of denner resin. Certainly, Kvothe's narration is imperfect, such as the time he downplayed the incident when he was arrested in book two, but there's a limit to how far Rothfuss could take an extended metaphor before the reader stops taking Kvothe's story seriously. Kvothe is too damn clever to take a drug like denner resin. Look at what Abenthy, an arcanist, said about him. ""hardly ever makes mistakes. I'll bet he knows every song you've ever sung to him. He knows more about what's in my wagon than I do. [...] It's not just memorisation though. He understands. Half the things I've been meaning to show him he's already figured out for himself. Have you ever known a boy his age who talks the way he does?"" In book two, Elxa Dal is similarly impressed at Kvothe's ability given his age, expressing surprise that he is ""already a re'lar"" at 17 (although Kvothe is actually 16). This is because Kvothe's knowledge massively surpasses both his age and his time. Within a span I could identify any chemical in his cart. In two months I could distill liquor until it was too strong to drink, bandage a wound, set a bone, and diagnose hundreds of sicknesses from symptoms. I knew the process for making  four different aphrodisiacs, three concoctions for contraception, nine for impotence, and two philtres referred to simply as 'maiden's helper'. We are told that Abenthy's main interest is chemistry, so Kvothe knows a lot about ailments and remedies, and poisons... As he [Trapis] spoke he absentmindedly crossed his legs and began to rub one of his bare feet. Inefficient circulation, a long-unused part of me thought. Increased risk of infection and considerable discomfort. Feet and legs should be raised, massaged, and swabbed in a warm infusion of willow bark, camphor, and arrrowfoot. This was during Kvothe's time in Tarbean, where he spent three years on the streets. Considering he still remembers the things he's learnt, it's likely that he understands the full side-effects of the poisonous denner resin, so it's not plausible that he would become addicted. Kvothe also had an advantageous upbringing. Abenthy describes him as 'living in such an enlightened atmosphere', which is not the sort of place where you find drug addicts. Look at the unfavourable way in which Kvothe describes the so-called 'sweet-eaters' (as opposed to the pleasant way he describes Denna, see below): I learned to run from anyone with an unnaturally white smile. [...] Tarbean is full of dangerous people, but none as dangerous as a sweet-eater filled with a desperate craving for more resin. They will kill you for a pair of pennies. In addition, Kvothe only just manages to scrape a living in Tarbean. He could not have been such a good pickpocket if he had been eating expensive drugs, and considering how impressed he is with a low-value coin, he needed all the money he could get.  I gaped. A silver penny was worth ten copper pennies, or fifty iron ones. More than that, it was worth a full belly every night for a month. [...] Through dangerous trial and error I discovered the proper way to slit a purse and pick a pocket. I was especially good at the latter. Locks and latches of all kinds soon gave up their secrets to me.  It's not only that obtaining denner resin would have made him poor in the first place, but the side-effects of eating it would hinder his ability to escape the brutal guards inside Tarbean. As it is, Kvothe survives against the odds because of his unnatural wit and sensitivity, which he would not have if he had been insensible as a result of taking drugs: Someone was watching me. On the street you either develop a sensitivity to certain things, or your life is miserable and short. Arguably, Kvothe's intelligence is offset by the sheer stress he suffers throughout the trilogy. His family was murdered, he's in debt with a gaelet, and a really rich guy hates him. But think of it this way: would Kvothe be more likely to be daunted / putt off denner resin if he knew all about it, or if he had no idea what it could do? Kvothe is too good at the lute to be a drug addict. I could play for hours upon hours [...] I began to play something other than songs. When the sun warms the grass and the breeze cools you, it feels a certain way. I would play until I got the feeling right. I would play until it sounded like Warm Grass and Cool Breeze. Kvothe also wins his silver talents at the Eolian for his grand performance of 'The Lay of Sir Savian Trailard'. Denna changes her name habitually: Dianne, Denna, Dinnah, Dyanae, Dinael, Dinay, Dianah, Donna, Dyane and Alora.   Just because Kvothe first knows her as 'Denna', it doesn't mean that that it important enough to be taken as a literal play-on-words for denner resin. She herself dismisses the name 'Denna': 'Denna', she said softly. 'I'd almost forgotten her. She was a silly girl.' Denna affects her surroundings too much to be a figment of Kvothe's tweaked storytelling. Roent's wife, Reta, sat in front of that wagon. Her mien wavered from severe, when she watched the men loading the wagons, to smiling when she spoke to the girl [Denna] standing nearby.  [...] Bast held up his hands defensively. 'It's just something I noticed, Reshi. All the women in your story are beautiful. I can't gainsay you as a whole, as I've never seen any of them. But this one [Denna] I did see. Her nose was a little crooked.' [...] 'Here we all are.' Sovoy smiled at me as he walked over and put his arm casually around Denna's waist. [...] Together, they turned and walked arm in arm back to their table.  [...] Three more days and five more fruitless trips to Imre. Neither Deoch nor Threpe had heard any news of her. Deoch told me that it was her nature to disappear like this, and that looking for her would serve about as much purpose as calling for a cat. I knew it to be good advice, and I ignored it.  [...] We were almost out when the man behind the bar called out. [...] 'That your cousin [Denna] then?' he asked. 'Has the constable said she could go? [...] Denna: 'an older gentleman introduced himself to me. [...] If things continue smoothly, I think he'll be my patron before the year is out.' [...] I was about to explain things to her when Denna gestured to a man standing behind her. [...] 'Kvothe, this is Lenthoren.' [...] Simmon: 'I talked with Sovoy. He's still not over her [Denna]. He really loved her, you know.' If Denna isn't a real person, then the people apart from Kvothe whom she affects are either made up, which would be extreme and contrived, or many scenarios are conjured up merely to accommodate her, which would undermine the point of Kvothe's narration. However, this particular factor only discounts the idea that Denna is fake, not the idea that Denna is as bad as denner resin. Denna is characterised to fully to be fake/ a negative force like denner resin, worthy of being ignored. 'I had pneumonia when I was just a tiny baby [...] That's why my lungs aren't good. It's horrible not being able to breathe sometimes.' If Denna was a made-up character to hint at Kvothe having a drug addiction, or she was a negative force like denner resin, it's not plausible that she would have been given a backstory that invokes the reader's sympathy. Consider her following descriptions. They sound sincere, as if Kvothe really is romantically interested in Denna, and she likes him back at least a little bit. It would be misleading if Rothfuss had intended Denna to be as detrimental a force as denner resin. She smiled at me then. It was warm and sweet and shy, like a flower unfurling. [...] This time as I sang it I looked out into the audience, hoping at the end I would hear a voice answering my own. [...] Then a voice drifted onto the stage, gentle as a brushing feather, singing [...] She sang as Aloine; I as Savien. Part of me wanted to search the audience for her, to find the face of the woman I was singing with. [...] Distracted, I touched a wrong note and there was a burr in the music. [...] Then I heard a voice, a voice like burning silver, like a kiss against my ears. Looking up, my heart lifted and I knew it was my Aloine. Looking up, I saw her and all I could think was, beautiful. Beautiful. [...] Denna: 'You remind me of a Willow', she said easily. 'Strong, deep-rooted, and hidden. You move easily when the storm comes, but never farther than you wish.' [...] I sat there in the dark, holding her sleeping body in my arms. She was soft and warm, indispensably precious. I had never held a woman before.' [...] But tonight she was wearing a dark green dress that left her shoulders bare. She was stunning. She knew it. She smiled. They even speculate about her patron, who is confirmed by the Cthaeh in book two to be beating her. Firstly, the fact that the all-knowing Cthaeh acknowledges Denna's existence discounts one of the theories that Denna is made up. Secondly, if she is made up/ just a symbol of denner resin, then her patron would have to be made up too. It's unlikely that Rothfuss would have created a whole character to accommodate a false character/ a purely symbolic character. Now that I looked more closely, I noticed that she had a bruise on one temple in addition to the bandage on her arm. [See above for the mention of her patron] Denna is treated like a real human. She eats sociably and even saves Kvothe's life, despite that these things undermine the idea that she is a negative drug/ a false character, making it implausible that Rothfuss should have put in the following scenes: Denna and I had the opportunity to eat some lunch of our own. Just some flatbread, sausage, and the rest of my carrots. [...] My hands gripped at the top of the arch, but couldn't find any purchase. Denna caught me. Denna is also observant in such a way that a negative / fake character would have no need to be, pointing things out to the protagonist (sometimes before he notices them) in a way is either affectionate or helpful: 'Did you know that when you're angry your eyes [...] I thought I was imagining it before [...] but your eyes really do change colour.' Kvothe says that she is the only one to have noticed this, apart from Abenthy who is sharp-witted by virtue of being an arcanist.  [Straight after Kvothe nearly dies by losing his grip on a cliff] 'Oh!', she gasped, her hands going to her mouth, 'Your beautiful hands!' Of course, the same could be said even if Denna was a negative influence on Kvothe, but I think she shows too much forthright compassion to be seen as such. It is unlikely that she is a symbol of addiction for the same reason (because a drug addiction wouldn't save his life like Denna). Denna is too smart (in a positive way) to be a symbol for denner resin / a negative force. Denna has a high level of intuitive intelligence, allowing her to suggest a plan when they're in danger: lure the draccus off a cliff. 'Do you think that would hurt it?' I asked dubiously. 'Well', Denna said, 'when you flick an ant off the table it doesn't get hurt even though for an ant that has to be like dropping off a cliff. But if one of us jumped off a roof, we'd get hurt because we're heavier. It makes sense that bigger things fall even harder.' She gave a pointed look at the draccus. 'You don't get much bigger than that.'  She was right, of course. She was talking about the square-cube ratio, though she didn't know what to call it. Denna eats denner resin by mistake, and that would either make no sense or be very contrived if the theory the she symbolises denner resin were true. However, this has nothing to do with the theory that Denna is a negative force. Kvothe is concerned about the resin she has eaten, implying that he would have no intention of consuming it himself. She had pried a large disk of sticky material out of the bottom of one of the pans and taken a bite out of it. [...] 'What's ophalum?' she asked softly. 'A drug. Those are denner trees. You just had a whole mouthful of denner resin.' [...] Denna:  'I suddenly feel really good.' [...] 'It's the resin', I said. [...] 'I want to get you back to Trebon', I said. 'Just in case you ate more resin than is good for you. I wouldn't trust any doctor living there, but they probably have some medicines I could use. Just in case.' [...] I was no longer worried about her overdosing. After gathering a small mountain of firewood, her mania was fading, leaving in her in a content, almost dreamy legarthy. Still, I knew the after-effects of the drug would leave her exhausted and weak. I wanted her safely in bead in Trebon for her recovery. Kvothe is careful when approaching her, and when speaking of her. She seems far more sophisticated / complex than a drug. Everyone knows that drugs feel good at the time, but has bad side-effects, end of story. Denna is far more baffling. As with all truly wild things, care is necessary in approaching them. [...] With slow care rather than stealth we must approach the subject of a certain woman [...] I fear approaching her too quickly even in a story. Should I move recklessly, I startle the very idea of her into sudden flight. Kvothe gets angry when Chronicler records his attempts to summarise Denna, despite not indicating otherwise. Drugs is not a topic you would skirt around in such a squeamish, touchy fashion. Drugs are drugs. A victim of drugs would not want to drag it out. The sooner they are covered by the narrator, the better (from the narrator's perspective).  'Her lips were always red, morning and night. As if minutes before you saw her, she had been eating sweet berries, or drinking heart's blood. [...] What good can come of this? How can I make any sense of her for you when I have never understood the least part of her myself?' / Chronicler had written most of this out before he realised that Kvothe had probably not intended him to. [...] Kvothe's eyes caught and held him. They were the same dark eyes that cronicler had seen before. Eyes like an angry God's. [...] Kvothe tore the half-written sheet with slow care, the sound bleeding he colour from Chronicler's face. Kvothe treads carefully with Denna, as if she is delicate (unlike a euphemism for drugs), and as if her nature is unpredictable, unlike drugs, whose effects are continuous and predictable: I knew the truth: I would never see her again. But here she was, and I was entirely unprepared. What next> A kiss on the hand was traditional, but what sort of kiss was appropriate? In Atur you merely nod over the hand. Cealdish ladies like the moneylender's daughter I had chatted with earlier expected you to brush the knuckles lightly and make a kissing sound. In Modeg [...]... I pressed my lips gently to the back of her hand for the space of time it takes to draw a quick breath. Her skin was warm and smelled vaguely of heather. [...] We talked through the long hours of night. [...] It was like we were doing one of those elaborate Modegan court dances, where the partners stand inches apart, but - if they are skilled - never touch. [...] I should have been bolder and kissed her at the end. I should have been more cautious. I had talked to much. I had said too little. This point also does not discount the idea that Denna is a negative force. Kvothe has too much restraint and willpower to take drugs. In book two, Threpe voices his surprise that the Maer rewarded Kvothe by paying for his tuition, because many of Kvothe's favours to the Maer were unsung. In reality, Kvothe had saved the Maer's life, won him a wife, and cleared his lands of bandits, so he arguably deserved much more. However, he manages not to admit the more dubious of these deeds as they are not socially appropriate. Such moral restraint is uncharacteristic of a drug addict. Also in book two, Kvothe gets annoyed with Denna's song which she composes herself and plays on a harp because it throws the Chandrian (who killed his family) in a positive light. Rather than excusing his aggressive reaction with the real reason he hates the Chandrian, he manages to restrain himself because he knows that most people view the belief in the Chandrian as childish, and that telling Denna of the Chandrian's existence could get her killed. This similarly shows restraint. In addition, the fact that Kvothe is a musician tells us that songs are a vivid event for him. Since he respects music so much, it is unlikely that he would have praised Denna's harp-playing music to the extent he does if she wasn't real / primarily symbolised a drug addiction. He also respects women as women are kind to him, so it is unreasonable to think that he would have personified a drug addiction in his story using a beautiful woman, or that Denna is a negative force like denner resin. Equally, Kvothe shows that he has great willpower when he painfully sets his own nose moments after he realises it it broken, at the age of 12. My vision was blurry and my nose felt larger than the rest of my head. I prodded it delicately. Broken. Remembering what Ben had taught me, I put one hand on each side and twisted it sharply back into place. I clenched my teeth against a cry of pain, and my eyes filled with tears.  In conclusion, I think that all the Denna/denner-resin theories are unlikely. Congratulations on reaching the end of this answer!"
"Medical school that brainwashes students, run by drug company that does unethical experiments","See Wikipedia (which has a very brief description) and Goodreads, from which I quote the description and some of the reviews as follows, with emphasis added by me. (All typos are [sic] - I copy-pasted this rather than transcribing by hand.) Quinn Cleary has always wanted to be a doctor. Yet the only way she can afford it is to win acceptance to The Ingraham, an exclusive, privately funded medical school and reasearch center reputed to be the nation's finest. The few selected students chosen by The Ingraham receive a completely free medical education: tuition, room. board, and lab fees all paid by the school. Once accepted to the school of her dreams, Quinn dives into her studies and into a steady realationship with a classmate. At last, her life seems perfect. Or is it? Quinn begins to notice subtle changes in her classmates: the way they act, the way they think -- all seem to be falling eerily into line with the messanic verison of the school's director. She confides her concerns to her boyfriend, who laughs them off -- until he finds a suspicious electronic monitoring device in his room. Then he disappears. ...Alone on the deserted campus during midyear break, Quinn finally encounters the dark truth about The Ingraham -- the true purpose of the institute's seemingly humane medical research, the motives that have determined the school's policy, and the secret mission of the hospital's intimidating security force, a small private army that is drawing an ever tighter net around her with each passing minute. The applicants are given a tour and they have to spend the night in the dorms; the following day they are given a long exam as the final step in the admission process. Flash forward a few months and Quinn is broken hearted, but not down and out. Quinn is a fun character- a strong woman in contrast to his typical 'damsel in distress'. She is on the wait-list at The Ingraham, with a back up to join the Navy to pay for med school. Her new buddy Tim (friend of a friend) who did get in to The Ingraham, concocts a plan to get Quinn in, and it works! School is hard, but Quinn crams and gets by... We begin to suspect more and more that something is off about the school, however. The nightly 'bull sessions' among the students largely concern medical ethics, especially who should be given care given medical rationing. Quinn seems to be on the outs with the rest of the student's opinions, which are strangely uniform on the issue. We also learn that all the dorms are bugged, as are all the phones, etc. What exactly is going on at The Ingraham? As the plot unfolds, things go from bad to worse. The sinister events taking place at The Ingraham weren't exactly shrouded in mystery as there were numerous clues given early on in the story - Ward C was dedicated to burn victims who were injected with a solution that was still in the works, the students were starting to have the same mindset despite their initial differences, the Chief of Security was constantly in Quinn's room, et cetera. Although the mystery (using the term loosely here) wasn't unpredictable nor suspenseful, it was engaging because the author crafted such believable characters and conveyed the sense of imminent danger throughout the story. Certain interesting bits were mentioned yet never followed up on such as ""the Sheedy thing"", the identity of the cadaver Quinn had for class and Matt's feelings for Quinn. Highly recommended, but not as casual reading in between procedures next time you're hospital-bound, or even in the Doctor's waiting room. Seriously. After a few failed attempts, the search terms that finally did the trick for me to find this were novel about medical school hypnosis  waiting list torture. One of the results was this solved Goodreads question, where the OP described: The story is about a medical school that selects the highest honors students to attend. Upon coming to the school, one or two students learn that the cadavers they are working on actually come from a secret ward of the school where they are being tortured and killed and then are provided to the medical students to study."
When did the Rupert Bear stories start repeating themselves?,"The first time the Rupert Annuals repeated a story was in 1953. But before the year I remember (2006), there were only seven years in which old stories were repeated (1953, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988), and the only time any story from later than 1940 was repeated was for the 50th anniversary special (1986), which made a point of containing one story from each decade. Since the earliest annual I owned was 1949, this explains why I never noticed repetition until recently. The year I remember (2006) was when repetition of old stories really became a trend. In fact, since 2010, there has been only one new story each year, the rest being recycled older stories. Apparently Rupert annuals have gone so far downhill that they're mostly surviving on reruns. I'm glad I got out when I did, so that Rupert can remain a treasured childhood memory without being spoiled. The above conclusions were drawn from examining raw data in the form of all titles of all Rupert stories since the start of modern Rupert in 1936. (I didn't check the earlier Tourtel stories, since the form was so different then that repetition would be impossible: at most, a post-Bestall story might be based on the same idea as a Tourtel story, and inspiration is different from wholesale copy-pasting.) My data was taken from this site (which has a page for each year, listing that year's story titles and sometimes extra info such as facsimile editions) and this site (which has a page for each decade, listing the story titles from every year in that decade). I've cross-referenced the two against each other to check for consistency; in the data below, brackets in story titles denote small differences between the two sources (usually minor things such as uncertain hyphenation) while entire stories in brackets were listed in one source but not the other (there are only two of these). Since my second source only covers the '30s to '90s, all data from 2000 onwards is taken from the first source alone. It's perhaps not necessary for me to include all my raw data in this answer. I do so, not only to make my research reproducible, but also because this may now be the only place on the internet with all Rupert story titles gathered on a single page. All my searching hasn't yielded another such page - if there was one, it would have made my data collection far easier and quicker. 1936 The New Adventures of Rupert Rupert and the Wonderful Kite

To what effect does Goldman claim The Princess Bride is an abridgement?,"The abridgment is part of the overall frame story. The frame story is very different in the book than in the film.  The book's frame story is very cynical. It's about the disillusionment of children growing up, and the business of fairy tales. The ""abridgment"" is one element of that: his realization that the story that was read to him was not, in fact, the actual story. The actual story was long and boring. His ""father"" concocted a fairy tale out of a supposedly true story. The fictional ""Goldman"" (who is biographically different from the real Goldman, who has two daughters rather than one son) is a rather bitter person, and that's parallel to his realization that the book is so different from what he remembers. He's also cynical about love: in the frame story, he attempts to cheat on his wife (and is shot down). The ""true love"" of Buttercup and Westley contrasts with the reality of ""Goldman's"" love life. It's rather remarkable that the movie excised this element and took the inner fairy tale at face value, completely rewriting the frame story. Such a change would seem to have a low chance of working, and yet it's arguably a considerable improvement on the book. The book's cynicism verges on misogyny (or ""stomps right into""), and that does not bear the test of time well. The film doesn't exactly pass the Bechdel test, either, but it makes an uplifting story out of one that's fundamentally a downer. That's pretty amazing."
Does the description of Eustace's parents fit some known stereotype?,"I believe Lewis meant readers to assume the Scrubb family were adherents of scientism. There's only a small amount of evidence for this in Dawn Treader itself, but it makes sense in light of his expressed views on scientism in his other work. This interpretation also lends itself to a straightforward reading of Dawn Treader as the journey of an atheist to belief, a journey that Lewis himself made during his life. The article ""C. S. Lewis: Science and Scientism"" by Henry F. Schaefer III quotes Webster's dictionary's definition of scientism as ""a thesis that the methods of the natural sciences should be used in all areas of investigation including philosophy, the humanities, and the social sciences: a belief that only such methods can fruitfully be used in the pursuit of knowledge"". Schaefer explains further in the following quote: It is well to note that at least two other terms carry meanings related to the one Lewis intended by the word scientism. The first is “logical positivism,” a system of thought that became popular in the 1920s. The second is “reductionism,” a more recently accepted word that is becoming rather common, particularly among philosophers of science. Taken to the limit, reductionism claims that human behavior is simply a matter of neurons firing in the brain, and the latter can be further reduced to atomic physics. In such a purely reductionist worldview, human responsibility does not exist. Although popular in three different eras, the three terms scientism, logical positivism, and reductionism are sufficiently closely related that distinctions may be subtle. They represent a belief system toward which C. S. Lewis was not receptive. As a more specific example of scientism, consider my relationship with my wife, to whom I have been happily married for more than 30 years. Scientism tells us that if one could make enough accurate scientific measurements on myself and on my wife, the resulting analysis would fully explain my strong attraction to her in preference to all others. He later cites Carl Sagan, Richard Dawkins, and Daniel Dennett as intellectuals who represent these modern-day versions of scientism. Lewis was a follower of scientism himself in his younger days, before he had a religious awakening and converted to Christianity. Schaefer includes a quote from Surprised By Joy in Lewis's own words: ""You will understand that my (atheism) was inevitably based on what I believed to be the findings of the sciences; and those findings, not being a scientist, I had to take on trust—in fact, on authority."" I gather scientism was fairly popular in English academic circles from the late 19th Century up until about the 1950's, but all my direct knowledge of it comes from reading critiques of its ideas by its opponents, of which it seems to have had many. The picture these works paint of it is not flattering. Followers of scientism in these works are invariably atheists; are usually obsessed with eugenics, genetic fitness, and IQ tests; wish to impose government-sponsored programs to sterilize or kill the ""unfit"" to preserve the quality of the gene pool; and believe it is their right or duty to subjugate or exterminate ""inferior"" races. They often support the worst excesses of British imperialism, and after the Second World War, fictional scientism adherents started to take on traits of the Nazis or the Stalinist Soviets. G.K. Chesterton criticizes ideas that sound rather like scientism in What's Wrong with the World. You can see the profile of scientism in the World State of Brave New World; the Ingsoc party of 1984; Weston, Devine, and the N.I.C.E. from Lewis's own Space Trilogy; and even a tiny bit in Sauron and Saruman of The Lord of the Rings. Objections to scientism in these works are often made on religious grounds. Orwell objects from many of the same ethical beliefs as the others, but his views on religion were complicated. (1, 2) Of course, Lewis couldn't write in a children's book that the Scrubbs were atheists who believe in eugenics, imperialism, Marxism, and a Nietzchean rejection of traditional morality. So he settles for a few practices that seem in line with the more harmless things scientism believers might do in their daily lives, but will mark them as odd to most children of the time: they're vegetarians, non-smokers, and non-drinkers. Even today, vegetarianism, along with atheism and strong faith in science, is associated with left wing politics. Dawn Treader was published in 1952; according to the American Cancer Society, ""[t]here were a few small-scale studies conducted from the late 1920s to late 1940s that suggested a possible link between smoking and lung cancer"", but strong evidence didn't start to emerge until the 1950's, and the harmfulness of smoking didn't start to become common knowledge until the 1964 Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health. So being a non-smoker would have probably seemed very outré to readers in 1952; you'd have to be paying very close attention to the bleeding edge of research to know there was any evidence at all that smoking was harmful. And in my experience, being a non-drinker can mark you as odd in certain social circles even today. The following information about their underclothes, their bedclothes, and their windows being open is probably just meant to further mark the Scrubbs as odd; if I were writing today and trying to achieve the same effect, I might mention that they do all their cooking and make all their own soap with virgin coconut oil, or that they insist every room have a crystal at its northernmost point. This passage is followed in the book by a short description of Eustace himself: Eustace Clarence liked animals, especially beetles, if they were dead and pinned on a card. He liked books if they were books of information and had pictures of grain elevators or of fat foreign children doing exercises in model schools. Voyage of the Dawn Treader, Chapter One: ""The Picture in The Bedroom"" He's none too concerned about hurting or killing other living creatures; he likes dead beetles, after all, and he likes them pinned to cards, like an entomologist cataloguing specimens. He doesn't read anything that involves abstraction, whimsy, metaphor, or imagination of any kind; he only likes books of information. He enjoys looking at grain elevators (for some reason) and fat foreign children doing exercises (probably because he's a bully and a weakling, and enjoys watching other people suffer---a bit further on we're told that ""deep down inside him he liked bossing and bullying"" but that ""he was a puny little person who couldn’t have stood up even to Lucy, let alone Edmund, in a fight""). Predictably, Eustace neither believes in nor approves of Narnia: Last year, when he had been staying with the Pevensies, he had managed to hear them all talking of Narnia and he loved teasing them about it. He thought of course that they were making it all up; and as he was far too stupid to make anything up himself, he did not approve of that. Ibid. These passages paint a picture of someone who fancies himself some sort of scientist, carrying around dead beetles on cards as if they were scientific specimens and thumbing through books full of pictures of grain elevators. Eustace doesn't know at this point that Narnia is real, so he thinks it's an imaginative game the Pevensies have made up, and his reaction is cruelty and condescension; not only does he reject imagination and play and belief himself, he also mocks others for accepting them. We're never told straight on that Eustace is an atheist, but this sounds quite a bit like how Christians would perceive someone like Richard Dawkins, who spends a great deal of his time publicly proselytizing atheism and ""debunking"" religion. There are little signs in other parts of the book as well that Eustace's family are adherents of scientism. In Chapter 2 we're told Eustace puts down the titular ship the Dawn Treader and keeps on ""boasting about liners and motorboats and aeroplanes and submarines""; an obsession with Western society's technological superiority is definitely a trait of the scientism-believing villains in other books, including Weston and Devine in Out of the Silent Planet, who believe the Malacandrian societies are inferior partially because of their limited use of technology. Later in the same chapter, Eustace writes in his diary that he told Caspian he's a Republican. As an American, I'm assuming he means a British Republican, i.e. someone who supports dissolving the monarchy and forming a republic like the one that existed under Oliver Cromwell, which to me sounds rather like something a Marxist would support, given Marxism's antipathy towards hereditary rulers. In Chapter Five, Eustace writes about an argument he had with Caspian over whether it was feasible to row back to land on short water rations: Caspian says the men couldn’t row on half a pint of water a day. I’m pretty sure this is wrong. I tried to explain that perspiration really cools people down, so the men would need less water if they were working. Ibid., Chapter Five: ""The Storm and What Came of It"" I'm pretty sure Eustace is wrong, and that you need to have adequate water during strenuous exercise (such as rowing a large ship); these guidelines for prolonged exercise suggest drinking when you're thirsty and enough to quench your thirst, which the men on the ship wouldn't be able to do. Schaefer quotes Lewis himself from an essay collected in The Discarded Image: ""In our age [...] the ease with which a scientific theory assumes the dignity and rigidity of fact varies inversely with the individual’s scientific education"". This is exactly what Eustace is doing. He's a child, with no scientific education that we've seen so far, asserting something he thinks is a fact of science when people's lives are at stake, and he's completely self-assured about doing so, never once considering that he might have remembered wrongly or that there might be other complicating factors. His doing this also fits with Faye-Ann Crowell's assertion, which Schaefer also quotes, that ""it was not science which Lewis was attacking [in the Space Trilogy] but certain ideas held by people usually not scientists."" Lewis has already shown us some of the odious scientifically flavored ideas that Eustace holds, but now he's also showing us that Eustace is not a scientist or even particularly conversant with science despite the airs he puts on. The Narnia books treat religion through metaphor and symbolism, so as I said, they never come out and tell us that Eustace is an atheist. But there are enough hints that I think it's a reasonable reading. And if we adopt this reading, then Eustace's character arc in the story is the journey of an atheist to faith, like the one Lewis himself had as a young man. Eustace starts the story as a non-believer who mocks and bullies others for their belief in Narnia and Aslan. He holds dogmatically to his version of ""the real world"" even when the evidence of his senses plainly tells him that he's not in that world anymore, that he's in a place where there's no British Consulate he can complain to and no one knows what a Republican is. He treats the people around him with contempt, insulting their intelligence, calling them names, and failing to understand good intentions. He notes in his diary that when he complains about getting too little food or too little water, Lucy is usually quick to share with him, but he doesn't understand why, because charity and kindness are apparently foreign concepts to him: in Chapter Five he writes ""Very short rations for dinner and I got less than anyone. Caspian is very clever at helping and thinks I don’t see! Lucy for some reason tried to make up to me by offering me some of hers but that interfering prig Edmund wouldn’t let her."" Later in the same chapter, he writes that ""Lucy gives me a little of her water ration. She says girls don’t get as thirsty as boys. I had often thought this but it ought to be more generally known at sea."" It sounds to me like Lucy tricked him with some made up scientific-sounding flimflam---again demonstrating how little knowledge of science Eustace actually has---to explain her act of kindness in a way that would make sense to him. Partway through the book, Eustace turns into a dragon, and is surprised when everyone treats him with kindness and sympathy. He starts to understand morality and ethics, and concepts like charity, kindness, generosity, and altruism, as well as developing a sense of camaraderie with the others that was missing before. It's Aslan who finally turns Eustace from a dragon back into a human. We know from the other books that Aslan represents Jesus Christ in Narnia, or rather is Jesus Christ as He chooses to appear in Narnia, so Aslan transforming Eustace back into a human represents the moment that Eustace chose to embrace faith, and through that act was able to end his moment of crisis. The narrator tells us near the end of Chapter Seven that ""[i]t would be nice, and fairly true, to say that 'from that time forth Eustace was a different boy.'"" After coming to faith, Eustace changed drastically, and became a much more pleasant person, renouncing his previous attitudes and embracing a morality and ethics along with his faith in Aslan / Jesus. The book ends with Reepicheep, a zealous believer, take a leap of faith to get into Aslan's Country, the Narnian representation of Heaven. Eustace, alongside Edmund and Lucy, come to the edge of Aslan's Country and meet Aslan, who tells Edmund and Lucy that they must find the door to Aslan's Country from their own world. The children return to their own world, where we're told that everyone soon started saying how Eustace had improved, and how “You’d never know him for the same boy”: everyone except Aunt Alberta, who said he had become very commonplace and tiresome and it must have been the influence of those Pevensie children. Ibid., Chapter Sixteen: The Very End of the World After Eustace returns, he's given up the belief system of his parents. He's no longer an atheist; he no longer believes in scientism; he's acquired a sense of morality. Everyone calls it an improvement, except for his mother, Aunt Alberta, who had taught him her own beliefs and isn't happy that he's abandoned them."
What is the significance of Sauron never having a physical presence in the Lord of the Rings?,"Tolkien never explained the choice to leave Sauron off-stage, or at least he did not do so in the published letters. But I can see three ways in which the decision makes sense. First, The Lord of the Rings is written largely from the down-to-earth point of view of the hobbit characters, a narrative strategy that Tolkien recognized was necessary to reach a large audience. Discussing the possible publication of the Silmarillion, he wrote: But I am afraid that all the matter of the First and Second Ages is very ‘high-mythical’ or Elvish and heroic, and there is no ‘hobbitry’ at all: an ingredient that seems to have made the present mixture [that is, The Lord of the Rings] more generally palatable. J. R. R. Tolkien (1955). Letter to Lord Halsbury. Number 174 in Humphrey Carpenter, ed. (1981). The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien. London: George Allen & Unwin. It would have been difficult for Tolkien to reconcile the rural-comical tone of ‘hobbitry’ with the representation of a mythic figure like Sauron. For an example of how this could have gone wrong, consider the one scene of Sauron’s dialogue that made it into the novel. For although the question says that he does not “have any acting dialogue”, this is not quite true. Pippin speaks with him using the Palantir of Orthanc, and reports the conversation thus: ‘“So you have come back? Why have you neglected to report for so long?” ‘I did not answer. He said: “Who are you?” I still did not answer, but it hurt me horribly; and he pressed me, so I said: “A hobbit.” ‘Then suddenly he seemed to see me, and he laughed at me. It was cruel. It was like being stabbed with knives. I struggled. But he said: “Wait a moment! We shall meet again soon. Tell Saruman that this dainty is not for him. I will send for it at once. Do you understand? Say just that!” J. R. R. Tolkien (1954). The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers III.11. London: George Allen & Unwin. In this passage, Sauron is at risk of coming across as a pantomime villain rather than a mythic figure of evil, and it was surely a wise decision to include no more of his dialogue than this. Second, the distance of Sauron from the events of the narrative conforms to the pattern of military leadership in The Lord of the Rings. The captains whom Tolkien approves (Aragorn, Theoden) have a heroic style of leadership, fighting in the first rank of battle and inspiring their armies with their personal bravery; while the captains whom Tolkien disapproves (Sauron, Saruman, Denethor) have a modern style of leadership, directing strategy from a safe distance in their fortresses. Denethor draws our attention to this in a conversation with Pippin: ‘Not—the Dark Lord?’ cried Pippin, forgetting his place in his terror. Denethor laughed bitterly. ‘Nay, not yet, Master Peregrin! He will not come save only to triumph over me when all is won. He uses others as his weapons. So do all great lords, if they are wise, Master Halfling. Or why should I sit here in my tower and think, and watch, and wait, spending even my sons? For I can still wield a brand.’ J. R. R. Tolkien (1955). The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King V.4. London: George Allen & Unwin. This is one of several passages in which Tolkien uses the word ‘wise’ ironically to describe conduct so prudent as to become self-defeating. Saruman says that “it would be wise” (II.2) for Gandalf to join him in an alliance with Sauron; Gandalf describes Sauron as a “wise fool” (III.5) for thinking that his enemies are “seeking to cast him down and take his place”; and Saruman’s enchanted voice “seemed wise and reasonable” (III.10). The image of Denethor sitting in his tower and “spending even his sons” ought to remind us of the situation on the Western Front of World War I. Tolkien had fought at Thiepval Ridge on the Somme in September 1916, while General Haig directed the battle from the Château de Beaurepaire near Montreuil-sur-Mer, a hundred kilometres away. Third, the physical absence of Sauron corresponds to the way that evil is conceptualized in The Lord of the Rings. In Tolkien’s world, goodness corresponds to light, and evil flourishes in darkness. Evil beings are hidden from the world in underground lairs: barrow-wights in the barrow-downs; the Balrog in Moria, Shelob in Torech Ungol. Sauron’s army advances under the darkness of “a great cloud [that] streamed slowly westward from the Black Land, devouring light” (V.4), and the turning point of the siege of Gondor is when a wind blows the cloud away “and the darkness was removed” (V.5). Tolkien described the power of the Nazgûl as presiding in the fear of their victims, which is magnified in darkness: Their peril is almost entirely due to the unreasoning fear which they inspire (like ghosts). They have no great physical power against the fearless; but what they have, and the fear that they inspire, is enormously increased in darkness. J. R. R. Tolkien (1958). Letter to Forrest J. Ackerman. Number 210 in Carpenter (1981). It is well known that the most frightening monsters in movies are those that are not shown in detail: nothing that the special-effects department can contrive is as fearsome as the viewer’s own imagination. Thus, Sauron’s threat would be diminished if he were brought into the light of the narrative."
How 'human' are the animals in The Wind in the Willows meant to look?,"I can't comment on the illustrations, but on examining the text, it seems clear that the author intended the animals to be very human indeed. When Toad shows the other animals round is canary-coloured cart early in the book, several things are mentioned that would be quite ridiculous if Toad and his companions were to be imagined as animal-like (emphasis mine): Meantime Toad packed the lockers still tighter with necessaries, and
hung nosebags, nets of onions, bundles of hay, and baskets from the
bottom of the cart. Little sleeping bunks--ablittle table that folded up against the
wall--a cooking-stove, lockers, bookshelves, a bird-cage with a bird
in it; and pots, pans, jugs and kettles of every size and variety. These objects would vastly outsize a toad or mole if they were to be imagined as animal-like or animal-sized. Not to mention to be of little use to them. So Grahame wants the reader to imagine beings that are basically human in aspect, but with the physical features of animals. In my copy there is a drawing which shows the illustrator took this description quite literally.  Later, during Toad's encounter with the Washerwoman, she doesn't at first even notice that he's a toad. The woman moved nearer to him and peered under his bonnet keenly and
closely. 'Why, so you are!' she cried. 'Well, I never! A horrid,
nasty, crawly Toad! And in my nice clean barge, too! Now that is a
thing that I will NOT have.' Even disguised by a bonnet, we can't possibly imagine that someone would fail to notice if the person they were talking to were a toad, unless it was a very, very human-like toad. The whole of Toad's escapade with the car also lends weight to the perception that he is extremely human in aspect. He can drive an ordinary car. He can be arrested and sentenced and sent to jail without any of the humans he encounters batting an eyelid. Of course, the book is a fantasy and Grahame emphasizes and de-emphasizes the animalistic qualities of his characters as it suits the narrative. But it seems there can be little doubt that when it suited him for them to appear human, the animals are supposed to be extremely close to an actual human. UPDATE: I noticed that the OP's quote isn't the first time that Toad is mentioned as having hair in the book. When he wakes up after his night the wood following his escape: He shook himself and combed the dry leaves out of his hair with his
fingers; and, his toilet complete, marched forth into the comfortable
morning sun, cold but confident, hungry but hopeful, all nervous
terrors of yesterday dispelled by rest and sleep and frank and
heartening sunshine. And right at the end of my copy, I found an illustration which does appear to show the Toad with hair: "
Did Captain Pirx make a joke in base 13?,"It occurs in Pirx pilóta kalandjai (orig title. Opowieści o pilocie Pirxie; in Stanisław Lem teljes science-fiction univerzuma vol. 2, (2006) Szukits könyvkiadó, translator Murányi Beatrix), in the short story “Feltételes reflex”.  The young student Pirx and the older scientist (astrophysicist) Langner are waiting in a hotel room on the moon, before traveling to the base at the back side of the moon. Langner asks Pirx his age, without looking up from the complicated computations he was doing.  Pirx replies “111”, which makes Langner look up, then adds “in binary”, which makes the scientist smile. Langner kiterített az asztalon egypár új diagramot, és nagyítóval vizsgálgatta, olyan elmélyülten, ahogy Pirx még kedvenc színésznője képeit sem nézte soha.  Közben megkérdezte Pirxtől, hány éves. – Száztizenegy – felelte Pirx, és amikor társa felpillantott, hozzátette: – Kettes számrendszerben. Langner most mosolyodott el először. Kezdett emberhez hasonlítani. Erős, fehér foga volt. English translation (by Louis Iribarne) of that passage from Lem's novella ""The Conditioned Reflex"" as printed in the Avon Books edition of Tales of Pirx the Pilot: Spreading out some new spectrograms on the table and studying them more intently than Pirx had had ever scrutinized his favorite pinup, Langner suddenly asked: ""How old are you?"" ""A hundred and eleven,"" Pirx said, and added, when the other looked up, ""in binary."" Langner broke out in a smile—his first—a smile that lent him an almost human look. He had strong, immaculately white teeth. The numbers don't seem to make any sense.  (Pirx is actually 22 years old at that time.)  This appears to show that the young Pirx still says the first stupid thing that comes into his mind without thinking it through, which is in character for him.  If there's a deeper meaning or joke behind the choice of these particular numbers, I can't see it."
How did the Strugatsky Brothers' experience with Soviet literary publishing censorship reflect on their books?,"This subject is covered in most detail in the book ""Limping Fate"". Unfortunately, there is no English translation yet. This book is written in a form of two interleaved novels (not unlike Master and Margarita). The first novel, sometimes published separately under the same name, describes a few days in life of a Soviet writer. The second, also published separately as ""Ugly Swans"", was mentioned in the comments to your question; in this book it is a secret and unfinished Magnum Opus of the writer. The writer bears some resemblance to the collective image of the Brothers: he writes SF (though most of his published works are military prose), he served at the Far East as a military translator, and so on. Among the events of his life, both contemporary and past, the motive of censorship indeed appears from time to time. In the past: In '52, the Armed Forces received an order to destroy all ideologically antagonistic literature. Our regiment had a trophy library of some Manjurian noble... Naturally, no-one had the time to separate chaff from wheat... In spite of the strict orders, the literate officers picked some books from the flames... In present: Some of the questions HR asked my daugter were pretty weird. What did I tell her about my pre-war Leningrad friends? Did she see any of them personally? ... ""Father, did you do anything wrong?"" - A terrible thought hit me: what if they printed me again in another country without the Writers Union approval? ... Valentin told me that The Quarterly Observer wanted nothing to do with him after the last troubles. In The Provincial News no one had an opinion on his book. They were waiting for the boss to return. When he does, the opinion will magically appear... I asked him, will he fight for the name. To hell with the name, he replied, let it be The Old Sage instead of The Old Fool, but he'll keep the rape scene: let them cut it out, they get paid for it... However, for the most part the book mentions censorship only in passing, and anyway it was written in the 80's when the censorship got relaxed."
"Overpopulated world, where volunteers are being taken to be converted to food","Piers Anthony's Macroscope (1969) contains a description of an alien species  who allow themselves to be made into food for financial gain (or to offset loss): Those who could not afford to pay their debts were butchered; those who could not achieve sufficient success in life gained a few years of rich living by selling their bodies in advance for meat. It was a fashionable and comfortable mode of suicide, and at present some fifty percent of the individuals sublimated their lemming-instinct in this fashion."
What fictional series has the longest release to completion?,"Arsène Lupin adventure novels were published between 1905 and 2012, all written by author Maurice Leblanc.

Why is Dante's Magnum Opus Called a 'Divine Comedy'?,"The question can be broken down into two subquestions: one about the term ""comedy"" and one about the adjective ""divine"". Dante never referred to his own work as the ""Divine Comedy"", so where does the title come from? The term comedy: the term comedia can be found in a letter that Dante wrote in Latin to Cangrande della Scala. We also find the term in Canto XVI of Inferno: di questa comedìa, lettor, ti giuro, In other contexts, Dante does not refer to his work as a ""comedy""; instead he uses the term ""poema sacro"", for example in the first verse of Canto XXV of Paradiso: Se mai continga che ’l poema sacro
al quale ha posto mano e cielo e terra In addition, what Dante and his contemporaries understood by ""comedy"" diverges from what we mean by that term. Even though they were aware of Aristotle's subdivision of drama in tragedy, comedy and satyr play, this does not seem to have been very useful to them. Based on etymology, they thought of comedy as a story with a bad beginning and a happy end. This clearly applies to Dante's main work, which begins with a descent into hell and ends in paradise. A ""comedy"" was not required to make an audience laugh. The term ""comedy"" can also be seen as contrasting with ""tragedy"" in a different way. In medieval poetics, tragedy was considered a ""higher"" genre than comedy. Dante himself had referred to Virgil's Aeneid as an ""alta tragedia"" (literally, ""high tragedy"") and referring to his own work as ""comedy"" is thus an act of modesty. Virgil's Aeneid had told a story that would later enable the founding of Rome, whereas Dante's ""comedy"" tells the story of an erring Christian trying to find the right path, which is much less heroic than what Aeneas went through. The term divine does not come from Dante at all. The first person to use that term was Boccaccio in his Vita di Dante (""Life of Dante"") or Trattatello in laude di Dante (""Short Treatise in Praise of Dante""). References:"
Is Professor Moriarty really Sherlock Holmes' arch-enemy in the way some people think?,"TL;DR: a close reading of ""The Final Problem"" says YES, but a broader analysis would tend to reject this evidence and possibly to say NO instead.

Holmes certainly considered Moriarty to be the most formidable criminal he ever encountered. From the very first time we see him speak of Moriarty, it is always in tones of awe: ""Aye, there's the genius and the wonder of the thing!"" he cried. ""The man pervades London, and no one has heard of him. That's what puts him on a pinnacle in the records of crime. [...] He is the Napoleon of crime, Watson. He is the organizer of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city. He is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract thinker. He has a brain of the first order. [...]  In three days—that is to say, on Monday next—matters will be ripe, and the Professor, with all the principal members of his gang, will be in the hands of the police. Then will come the greatest criminal trial of the century, the clearing up of over forty mysteries, and the rope for all of them; but if we move at all prematurely, you understand, they may slip out of our hands even at the last moment."" -- ""The Final Problem"" (emphasis mine) And after his return from their apparent mutual destruction, he continues to speak of Moriarty with the same respect: ""Well, well, such is fame! But, then, if I remember right, you had not heard the name of Professor James Moriarty, who had one of the great brains of the century. Just give me down my index of biographies from the shelf."" [...] ""My collection of M's is a fine one,"" said he. ""Moriarty himself is enough to make any letter illustrious, and here is Morgan the poisoner, and Merridew of abominable memory, and Matthews, who knocked out my left canine in the waiting room at Charing Cross, and, finally, here is our friend of tonight."" -- ""The Adventure of the Empty House"" (emphasis mine) He also describes Moriarty's right-hand man, Colonel Sebastian Moran, as ""The second most dangerous man in London."" Presumably Moriarty, then, is whom Holmes considers to be the most dangerous man in London - a high accolade, given how many criminals Holmes has met. 
But none of this really answers the question of the nature of Holmes's personal relationship with Moriarty. Did he consider him to be his ""arch-enemy"", or simply another, albeit particularly accomplished and dangerous, criminal to catch? To answer this, we need to look more closely at his words in ""The Final Problem"": ""I tell you, Watson, in all seriousness, that if I could beat that man, if I could free society of him, I should feel that my own career had reached its summit, and I should be prepared to turn to some more placid line in life. Between ourselves, the recent cases in which I have been of assistance to the royal family of Scandinavia, and to the French republic, have left me in such a position that I could continue to live in the quiet fashion which is most congenial to me, and to concentrate my attention upon my chemical researches. But I could not rest, Watson, I could not sit quiet in my chair, if I thought that such a man as Professor Moriarty were walking the streets of London unchallenged. [...] Again and again he strove to break away, but I as often headed him off. I tell you, my friend, that if a detailed account of that silent contest could be written, it would take its place as the most brilliant bit of thrust-and-parry work in the history of detection. Never have I risen to such a height, and never have I been so hard pressed by an opponent. He cut deep, and yet I just undercut him."" -- ""The Final Problem"" (emphasis mine) And the (reported) conversation between himself and Moriarty when they first met face-to-face: ""'It has been a duel between you and me, Mr. Holmes. You hope to place me in the dock. I tell you that I will never stand in the dock. You hope to beat me. I tell you that you will never beat me. If you are clever enough to bring destruction upon me, rest assured that I shall do as much to you.' ""'You have paid me several compliments, Mr. Moriarty,' said I. 'Let me pay you one in return when I say that if I were assured of the former eventuality I would, in the interests of the public, cheerfully accept the latter.' ""'I can promise you the one, but not the other,' he snarled, and so turned his rounded back upon me, and went peering and blinking out of the room. -- ""The Final Problem"" (emphasis mine) All of this suggests something more than mere professional respect for Moriarty's intelligence and skill. Holmes explicitly says that his 'duel' with Moriarty was the greatest height of his career as a detective, and that in order to defeat this single enemy he would gladly accept his own destruction. The above quotes definitely imply a special relationship between the two, which, yes, could definitely be described as their being ""arch-enemies"" to each other. 
However, all of the above is deduced only from close reading. Let's now take a step back and consider the context of ""The Final Problem"" within the wider Holmes library. Both in and out of universe, this story was written as a sort of ""swan song"", a final eulogy of Sherlock Holmes. Both Watson and Conan Doyle thought it was the very end of Holmes when they wrote it, and both had good reason to make it sound as though defeating Moriarty was the greatest achievement of Holmes's career - because it makes a good story, and because it enables the great detective to end on the highest possible note. So the testimony of ""The Final Problem"" is not necessarily reliable evidence. Even if Holmes didn't consider Moriarty his arch-enemy, his biographers (both in and out of universe) would want to make it sound that way.

So what evidence is there in the other Sherlock Holmes stories? In The Valley of Fear he plays a prominent background role, and he is again mentioned there as a genius and criminal mastermind, the man behind most organised crime in London, but his personal relationship with Holmes isn't elaborated on as much as in ""The Final Problem"". The evidence here is inconclusive. It's worth noting that The Valley of Fear definitely contradicts at least one part of ""The Final Problem"". In the latter, Watson is unaware of Moriarty's nature as a criminal mastermind until his meeting with his friend mere days before Moriarty's downfall, when Holmes's nets were already almost closed - whereas The Valley of Fear is set long before Holmes is close to catching Moriarty, but Watson is well aware of his suspicions about the man. This again suggests, at least from an in-universe perspective, that Watson is an unreliable narrator in ""The Final Problem"". (Out of universe, it's more likely that Conan Doyle simply forgot the exact details of ""The Final Problem"" when writing The Valley of Fear, and neither should be considered more reliable or 'canonical' than the other.) It's also interesting how few of the stories Moriarty actually appears in. Counting mentions of him as well as actual appearances, he can be found in only seven of the Holmes stories. If he really was Holmes's arch-enemy, then surely a conscientious biographer of Holmes would devote more time to him among sixty stories? This is an (admittedly weak) piece of evidence that perhaps Moriarty should not be considered Holmes's arch-enemy."
Does the Epic of Gilgamesh have a continuous cultural history?,"When the Medes and the Babylonians conquered Nineveh in 612 B.C. they also destroyed the ""Library of Ashurbanipal"". Clay tablets from that library mainly ""survived"" as fragments. These South-West Palace, which contained the library, wasn't rediscovered until around 1850. This is where the most complete surviving versions of the Gilgamesh Epic were later found. This does not mean that the epic did not circulate between 612 B.C. and the 1850s. The most recent fragment in cuneiform dates from around 130 B.C. (and the most recent cuneiform text from Ancient Babylonia was dated around 75 AD). However, according to Walther Sallaberger, the Gilgamesh Epic ceased to be part of a scribe's general education during the first millennium B.C. (See Sallaberger: Das Gilgamesch-Epos. Mythos, Werk und Tradition C. H. Beck, 2008.) The most reliable historian of Babylonia from Antiquity was the Chaldean priest Berossus or Berosus, who wrote his Babyloniaca around 290 B.C. This work has survived only in fragmentary quotations by other authors. One of these was Aelian (or Claudius Aelianus), a Roman author who wrote in Greek and mentioned a Babylonian king named Gilgamos. However, his Gilgamos story has nothing to do with what we know from the epic. The flood story in Berossus's  Babyloniaca is very similar to the one from the Gilgamesh epic but with a different protagonist: Xisothros (the Sumerian Ziusudra) instead of Utnapishtim. The name Gilgamesh, disconnected from the epic, seems to have survived in the Dead Sea Scrolls from Qumran, where glgmyš/s meant ""menacing giant"". The name Humbabah seems to have survived as Hôbabiš, which also meant ""giant"". These two names lived on in Manichean literature until the early Middle Ages. Even though the Babylonian flood story probably predates the Biblical version, people in the late nineteenth-century had great difficulty to accept that this might actually be the case. The flood story known in the West for roughly two millennia was definitely not seen as a Babylonian story for two reasons: (1) the Biblical flood is caused by God and the Bible was seen as the word of God, so any alternative narrative must necessarily be wrong, and (2) the West knew almost nothing about Babylonia from sources other than the Bible (and those other sources were less authoritative for the reason already mentioned). Using the flood story in the Bible as an argument for the survival of knowledge about the Epic of Gilgamesh has a serious flaw: the flood story is just part of Tablet XI of the epic and does not involve Gilgamesh himself. Knowledge about other parts of the epic evidently did not survive, e.g. how Enkidu came into being, how he became Gilgamesh's servant (in the Sumerian stories) or friend (in the Standard Babylonian version), how both men went to the Cedar Forest, how they fought the Bull of Heaven, how Enkidu died and, rather importantly, how Gilgamesh's quest for immortality. A Gilgamesh epic without the flood story would still be an epic. A flood story without Gilgamesh is just a myth shared by several cultures. Assyriologists today consider the Epic of Gilgamesh as a story that was rediscovered rather than one that has a continuous cultural history."
Which flood story was first: Genesis or The Epic of Gilgamesh?,"The ""standard"" version of the Epic of Gilgamesh, the one edited by Sîn-lēqi-unninni, is dated to somewhere between 1300 BCE and 1000 BCE. Although the epic is far earlier, this is the version that includes Utanapishtim's story of the flood.  The dating of Genesis, however, as many matters that may have some religious significance is not entirely concluded. Depending on who you ask, you will receive answers ranging from 1400 BCE to the 5th century BCE, with the earlier limit of the range stemming from traditional views rather than scientific methods (e.g.  the disputed concept of Mosaic authorship). If you accept the more conservative estimations of about 700 BCE, then the flood myth in Gilgamesh is clearly earlier.  If on the other hand, you wish to allow for the wildly exaggerated traditional datings, then I think you should also permit for a small switch of focus from Gilgamesh to the Akkadian Epic of Atra-Hasis. Atra-Hasis also includes a flood myth, and it's widely accepted1 that the flood myth in Tablet XI of the aforementioned ""standard"" version of Gilgamesh derives from it.  Furthermore, the flood myth in Gilgamesh is not directly comparable to the biblical narrative. In Gilgamesh, the tale of the flood is secondary to the eponymous hero's quest and is severely restricted by its first person narrative; Utanapishtim can only tell us what he personally experienced. One of the more important things we never learn, for example, is the reason for the flood, as, presumably, Utanapishtim was not aware of it. Atra-Hasis, on the other hand, provides us with the history of the world before the creation of man, and a fuller story of the deluge, including an explanation of its cause. It is, therefore, a lot more comparable to Genesis than Gilgamesh, and this I believe is why we should focus on it instead. Following this path will lead us to an even clearer answer to your question as the earliest known record of Atra-Hasis can be dated to around 1646–1626 BCE (during the reign of Ammi-Saduqa), by its colophon. Thus, Atra-Hasis is earlier even if we accept Moses wrote Genesis. Lastly, I would be remiss not to mention that the other Mesopotamian flood story, the Sumerian tale of Ziusudra, is also older than Genesis. The story is told in a single tablet, that has been dated to around 1600 BCE.  1  ""In the intervening years, it is true, it had become clear that what Smith had discovered, the eleventh tablet of the Gilgamesh Epic, was derivative"" - Moran, William L. “Atrahasis: The Babylonian Story of the Flood.” Biblica, vol. 52, no. 1, 1971, pp. 51–61. www.jstor.org/stable/42609705."
Short Story About a Woman Saving up to Buy a Gift?,"A husband and wife both buy each other thoughtful gifts, but in the process are forced to sell things (his watch, her hair) which the gifts (a watch chain, some hair combs) were meant for. The story opens with her considering her small savings, including a bit about bullying/""bulldozing"": One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas. She is given tortoise shell hair combs as a gift, at the end: For there lay The Combs--the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jewelled rims--just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone. Method of finding: recognition from having read the thing before, most recently due to this question."
What rough beast slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?,"The poem is alluding to the Book of Revelation. The ""rough beast"" is the Anti-Christ. The scene is set for the final showdown and the Second Coming. Thus, with its unremitting pessimistic tone notwithstanding, the poem at least gives humankind the possibility of redemption. That having been said, the persona is not necessarily espousing a traditional Christian world view. Written is 1919, the poem is a reaction to the Great War. It conveys the persona's horror at the slaughter that the war unleashed and its socio-political aftermath in language heavy with religious significance. The poem's opening stanza portrays a society spinning out of kilter. ""The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold"" are metaphors for the rise of radical politics. But we should be in no doubt that this is as much a spiritual crisis as it is a worldly one: ""the falconer"" and ""the centre"" are also God. ""Turning and turning in the widening gyre"" also alludes to the view of a cyclical nature of history expressed elsewhere by the poet. It continues by emphasising the scope of the crisis...""and everywhere The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned"". these are allusions to the Book of Revelation (see comment below) and the Christian sacraments(?) respectively and once again emphasise a spiritual dimension to the crisis befalling humankind. ""The worst"" the persona says ""are full of passionate intensity"" emphasising their lustful, animalistic (and sinful?) natures, while ""the best lack all [moral(?)] conviction"". The best, at least, lack the conviction to act. One is ""full"" while the other ""lack[s]"". One thinks but does not act, while the other acts but does not think. Society is beset by chaos, as represented by imagery of ""The blood-dimmed tide"" and, especially, animals imagery laden with negative connotations: ""rough beast"", ""indignant dessert birds"", and the errant falcon. The worst give in to their primitive urges and themselves become agents of chaos. The second stanza begins with the persona's plaintive cry: ""Surely some revelation is at hand"". And seemingly it is. The persona is assailed by a fantastical vision ""somewhere in sands of the desert"", an allusion to the Temptation of Christ, of ""A shape with lion body and the head of a man""... is this then the ""rough beast""? maybe - but it seems more likely to be a personification of the physical and spiritual crisis at hand, the ""Spiritus Mundi"", rather than the ""rough beast"" as the persona uses the phrase ""The darkness drops again"" to draw a distinction between the two. The hybrid creature may personify humankind's duel natures: reason/instinct, head/heart, order/chaos, reactionary/radical. ""That twenty centuries of stony sleep"" alludes to the almost two thousand years since the birth of Christ. The ""rough beast"", its centuries long wait now ended, makes its way to the appointed place for the final confrontation. The persona equates the slaughter of the Great War and it socio-political ramifications with the biblical end times, although this should not be taken literally. (work in progress but constructive criticism is welcome)"
How did contemporary readers respond to coincidence in 19th century novels?,"This is a vast subject; entire books have been written on the subject of coincidence in fiction. So I’ll attempt a very brief survey. Charles Dickens was the most popular novelist in English in the mid-19th century, and his novels are full of coincidences. In his introduction to the 2002 Penguin edition of Oliver Twist (1837–9), Philip Horne listed a few of the more conspicuous ones: The pocket picked by Charley and the Dodger when Oliver first goes out from Fagin’s house happens to be that of Mr. Brownlow, the oldest friend of Oliver’s father, and once in love with Oliver’s aunt (now dead), who happens to have on his wall a portrait of Oliver’s mother, which so resembles Oliver Mr. Brownlow is awestruck. When Sikes takes Oliver after his recapture to commit his second crime, at Chertsey, hours away from London, it turns out to be the house where Oliver’s other aunt, Rose Maylie, lives. Oliver’s father’s will, destroyed by the father’s wife, happens to have stipulated that Oliver inherits only if “in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour, meanness, cowardice or wrong”—such a stain is just what falling into Fagin’s hands puts Oliver at risk of; Oliver’s legitimate but wicked brother Edward Leeford (‘Monks’) happens to be the only one to know of this will, and to see and recognize Oliver, whom he has never seen (this time by his uncanny resemblance to their common father), on the one occasion he is away from Fagin’s (and rescued by Mr. Brownlow). Somehow Monks connects with, and somehow finds, Fagin, whom he employs to recapture and criminalize him. Other novels that make use of coincidence were and remain immensely popular, for example Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë (1847; in which Eyre, wandering the moors, is rescued and taken in by the Rivers family, who turn out to be her cousins, whom she has never previously met) or Les Misérables by Victor Hugo (1862; in which Valjean, fleeing the police in the back alleys of Paris, meets the man whose life he saved many years previously in a distant town in another part of France). There was a little contemporary criticism of Dickens’ coincidences. In 1842, Edgar Allan Poe wrote a long review of Barnaby Rudge, in which, among more pressing concerns, he touches briefly on coincidences thus: There are many coincidences wrought into the narrative those, for example, which relate to the nineteenth of March; the dream of Barnaby, respecting his father, at the very period when his father is actually in the house; and the dream of Haredale previous to his final meeting with Chester. These things are meant to insinuate a fatality which, very properly, is not expressed in plain terms—but it is questionable whether the story derives more, in ideality, from their introduction, than it might have gained of verisimilitude from their omission. For Poe this is clearly a question of balance: coincidences detract from the quality of verisimilitude, but add to the quality of fatality, and he values both qualities. (Aside: Poe’s review refutes the idea, raised in comments, that “readers back then were much less nitpicky”. The review is a monument of nitpicks! But Poe’s nitpicks are directed at the effects Poe values, which are dramatic unity, which he thinks is spoiled by the inclusion of the Gordon Riots, and suspense, which he thinks is spoiled by the sloppy way the mystery plot is handled. Poe recognizes that coincidences are unrealistic, but realism is far from his most important concern.) One way to think about this kind of question is to turn it around: Reading 21st century literature, it is striking how often the plot turns on outrageous elements of fantasy. For example, in the ‘Harry Potter’ novels the characters cast spells, drink potions, and fly about on broomsticks. Did contemporary readers just accept this? Were they put off? Was the magic necessary to reassure them that it wasn’t real in some way? Obviously contemporary readers understand that magic is a literary convention in the fantasy genre. We know that it’s not realistic, but since we don’t require fantasy novels to be realistic, that’s not a problem. Instead, we appreciate the dramatic or comic situations that that author can create using magic. Coincidence does something similar in the 19th century novel: it’s an economical and effective means for the author to create dramatic or comic situations, and it “carries with it an element of surprise or astonishment that derives from the lack of apparent causal connection” (Thomas Vargish, The Providential Aesthetic in Victorian Fiction). If Oedipus kills a stranger, that’s homicide, but if by coincidence the stranger is his father, then that’s tragedy. Vargish argues that early 19th century English culture was steeped in the Christian idea of ‘divine providence’, that is, a belief that the world is ordered by “a Supreme Being who foresees and controls human events for some divine purpose”. In this view of the world, coincidences are the traces of the divine plan, that rewards the virtuous and punishes the wicked. I doubt it was true of all authors—surely like any trope it drifted from its origins—but Dickens seems to have thought about coincidence plots in this way. In an 1859 letter to Wilkie Collins he wrote, apparently in response to the latter’s suggestion about a change to A Tale of Two Cities to build up an event in a more convincing manner: I do not positively say that the point you put might not have been done in your manner; but I have a very strong conviction that it would have been overdone in that manner—too elaborately trapped, baited, and prepared—in the main anticipated, and its interested wasted. […] I think that the business of art is to lay all that ground carefully, not with the care that conceals itself—to shew, by a backward light, what everything has been working to—but only to suggest, until the fulfillment comes. These are the ways of Providence, of which ways all art is but a little imitation. It never went away, it just changed its appearance. Watch any television crime series and you’ll see that it’s commonplace for the murderer to be revealed as someone who coincidentally appeared earlier in the episode; or for the detective to see or hear something unrelated to the mystery that coincidentally suggests the solution; or for an innocent suspect to appear guilty because of a coincidental similarity with the criminal or the crime. Coincidence remains an economic way of creating drama. But certainly literary novels no longer include the same kinds of egregious coincidence as Dickens, Brontë, and Hugo. That’s a consequence of the success of literary realism in the mid-to-late 19th century. Originating in France with the works of Stendhal and Balzac, realism was a reaction against the prevailing mood of romanticism. The progress of science, and especially the publication of On the Origin of Species in 1859, made it hard to hold on to the idea of a providential universe, and the rise of the social novel required a realistic treatment. By the publication of Middlemarch (1871–2), George Eliot found it necessary to apologise for making use of a coincidence (by which the rogue Raffles happens upon a letter which he can use to blackmail Bulstrode): As the stone which has been kicked by generations of clowns* may come by curious little links of effect under the eyes of a scholar, through whose labors it may at last fix the date of invasions and unlock religions, so a bit of ink and paper which has long been an innocent wrapping or stop-gap may at last be laid open under the one pair of eyes which have knowledge enough to turn it into the opening of a catastrophe. To Uriel watching the progress of planetary history from the sun, the one result would be just as much of a coincidence as the other. * OED: “clown, n. 1.a. A countryman, rustic, or peasant.” One has to go somewhat later to find full-throated denunications of the use of coincidence. George Gissing, an important realist novelist and critic, was scathing on the subject: I have left it to this place to speak of the sin, most gross, most palpable, which Dickens everywhere commits in his abuse of “coincidence”. Bleak House is the supreme example of his recklessness. It seems never to have occurred to him, thus far in his career, that novels and fairy tales should obey different laws in the matter of incident. When Oliver Twist casually makes acquaintance with an old gentleman in the streets of London, this old gentleman of course turns out to be his relative, who desired of all things to discover the boy. When Steerforth returns to England from his travels with Emily, his ship is of course wrecked on the sands at Yarmouth, and his dead body washed up at the feet of David Copperfield, who happened to have made a little journey to see his Yarmouth friends on that very day. In Bleak House scarcely a page but presents some coincidence as glaring as these. Therein lies the worthlessness of the plot, which is held together only by the use of coincidence in its most flagrant forms. Grant that anything may happen just where or when the interest of the story demands it, and a neat drama may pretty easily be constructed. The very boldness of the thing prevents readers from considering it; indeed most readers take the author’s own view, and imagine every artificiality to be permitted in the world of fiction.  (Charles Dickens: A Critical Study, 1898.) For Gissing, realism is the most important thing, or maybe the only thing."
Why is the tense wrong in the beginning of The Stranger?,"I'm not sure if whole books have been written on the topic, but at least whole book chapters have been. I haven't read this book, but I'll share my first impression. One thing to note is that the English translation you quote is reasonably faithful. It slightly misses the effect of the original, however, in that it doesn't use a future tense. A more accurate translation of the beginning of the second paragraph would be (my translation): The old people's home is in Marengo, eighty kilometers from Algiers. I will take the bus at two o'clock and I will arrive in the afternoon. This way I will be able to hold the wake, and I will come back tomorrow night. Another thing that isn't apparent in the English translation is which past tense is used in most of the book. The normal tense in a novel is the passé simple. This is a literary tense, rarely used in everyday life in the 20th century, suitable for expressing that something happened at some past time. The Stranger is (apart from the first two paragraphs) written in the passé composé, which in literary usage is only used to indicate that something has been accomplished, but in everyday language is used for any past action. The use of passé composé gives a feeling of immediacy — the events that are narrated are still very relevant, whereas passé simple would tend to indicate a tale from the past. The use of passé composé also gives a feeling of informality, which is expressed in other ways: Meursault is a working class person, who uses simple language (also visible, for example, in the tendency to use of short sentences). In many ways, the book is written like a personal diary. In this respect, the succession of tenses makes sense. The first few sentences are written in the present tense. They describe what Meursault thinks when he writes the first entry in this diary, soon after receiving the news that his mother has died. The part starting with “I took the two-o'clock bus” is the next entry in the diary, written after the bus trip. Where this simple interpretation fails is that as far as I can tell, the opening is the only place where Meursault uses the present tense. It is unlikely that he would never need to express actions in progress. This singles out Meursault's mother's death as an exceptional event. Furthermore, that event is not only where the book starts, it's where the idea of the book starts. This singular use of the present makes it look like the news of Meursault's mother's death caused Meursault to start holding this diary. He was considerably shaken, and this kicked off the chain of events in the rest of the book. The whole book is built on several ambiguities, including the extent to which Meursault is emotionally shaken by his mother's death and other events. The text, superficially, makes him look extremely detached, cold, emotionless. He writes simple descriptive sentences, showing no emotion, just like he shows no emotion in many other ways (not crying at his mother's funeral, shrugging when asked about marriage, ...). Yet there is subtext that shows him more affected under his cold attitude. I think the use of the present tense in the opening shows that he is emotionally shaken at his mother's death but does not realize it consciously."
"What did O'Brien mean when he said ""They got me a long time ago"" in the book 1984?","That's definitely the implication, yes. It's a sentence that should be taken fairly literally, if obscurely. Story-wise, this serves a functional purpose. It shows someone who used to perform actions counter to what the government wanted, and was, in essence, reformed into participation.  O'Brien is extremely knowledgeable about the past - likely far more than he lets on to Winston. On top of that, it seems that people of the Inner Party are all generally more well-read than those of the Outer Party (go figure). How else would they know about the contents of books? 'It is called wine,' said O'Brien with a faint smile. 'You will have read
  about it in books, no doubt. Not much of it gets to the Outer Party, I am
  afraid.' He's also knowledgeable about the sort of philosophy that - guess what - comprises mostly terms you'd find in books, and the sorts of things you'd really only learn from books: O'Brien smiled faintly. 'You are no metaphysician, Winston,' he said.
  'Until this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence. I
  will put it more precisely. Does the past exist concretely, in space? Is
  there somewhere or other a place, a world of solid objects, where the past
  is still happening?' This smacks of someone well-read. And these two examples were easy to find - if you search for ""O'Brien,"" the book is littered with references to how knowledgeable he seems to be about the past.  But that aside, this is also an important jab at Winston's only real hope at escape:  He thought oftener of O'Brien, with a flickering hope. O'Brien might know that he had been arrested. While it's possible to hypothesize about how O'Brien ended up in government work following being had, perhaps suggesting that practices have changed over time, or aren't as absolute as they seem, the fact remains: he was probably caught, and was probably stopped.

Science fiction short story with the ability to jump from world to world,"This strongly reminds me of The Long Earth series by Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter. I distinctly remember a passage about the main character, Joshua Valiente, which matches the quoted passage comparing him with Daniel Boone. In this series, there's a device called a Stepper which lets humans step between parallel Earths. Checking Wikipedia, it seems the series originated in a short story, The High Meggas (The device is a belt in this story.) Looking at the Long Earth Wikia's plot description for that story, it seems there is a female character who turned out to be the villain:  Shea asks for the gun, so that she can finish him off - an act of murder. Larry realises that she is a killer. The asteroid: The crater was made by a fragment of an asteroid that hit Linsay's
  Earth - as well as the surrounding worlds - ten or fifteen thousand
  years previously. Larry calls this asteroid ""the Fist"". ...   With
  every move, the effects of the Fist become more pronounced. Finally,
  Linsay and Shea move into the Gap - a world where the Earth has been
  destroyed completely. We have super-intelligent baboons, and:  Anna Shea appears suddenly, holding a gun - she also survived the Gap.
 Big Yin, the superbaboon pack leader, assaults her from behind and
 Shea is killed."
"Understanding the use of the word ""Negress"" in the Kilmartin and Cox translation of Solaris","Native speaker here. The most important part that was lost in translation was the rhythm of the prose. Lem's texts at all times have a quality similar to that of a blank verse. Sadly, I think it would require much better writer than Lem to save the meaning and give a similar quality to English translation. Also a number of passage's literal details got lost. Reading this I see an image of Venus of Willendorf (except the arms and clothes), which was well known at the time.  The parts omitted/wrong I would translate/correct as:  a duck-like walk (""kaczkowatym chodem""), a black woman (""murzynka""), arms equal to normal man's thighs  (""ramiona dorównywały udom normalnego człowieka""), passed by without even a glance in my direction (""nie spojrzawszy nawet w moją stronę""), swinging her elephant-like withers (""kołysząc słoniowatymi kłębami""), steatopygous sculptures from paleolith (""steatopygicznych rzeźb z epoki kamienia łupanego""). I've tried to be as accurate here as I could, zero improvisation on my part.  The word ""murzynka"" alone was at the time, and still is, simply the most common Polish word for ""a black woman"", maybe not elegant like modern ""afro-amerykanin"" (""Afro-american""), but also not derogatory. (Don't mistake with adjective ""murzyński"" which presently is derogatory). But ""Negress"" isn't a totally inappropriate translation, as the passage as a whole clearly aims to scare you. Simple as that, I don't see anything deeper. Lem gathered as many small unexpected disturbing details as he could that would scare in the context, but without putting Gibarian out of character (the author of said ghost) or sacrificing reality. I think a race was just one of these small details for Lem: slightly disturbing (for a Polish contemporary reader, who was unlikely to see a black person in entire life!) but not alluding to anything significant."
"What was a ""ward in chancery""?","This was a real concept in those days - indeed it still is, but such children are nowadays more often referred to as ""wards of court"". Most of the search engine results I found for ""ward in chancery"" are genealogy forum threads where people were asking about their own ancestors: for example this and this. I did find one page about ""wards in chancery"" which was specific to G&S: Wards of the Court of Chancery, i.e., persons under that court’s protection. This perhaps explains why Major-General Stanley could be the father of so many lovely girls all between the ages of 18 and 22. How he managed to have this charming collection farmed out to him has never been explained. To understand this fully requires an understanding of one of the most tricky and esoteric parts of the English legal system: equity law, specifically as it applies to trusts. A trust is the situation arising when one person or legal entity (the trustee) is holding assets on behalf of another (the beneficiary). The trustee has all legal and administrative rights to the assets, but is obligated to act in a way that is to the advantage of the beneficiary. This system is commonly used by the rich as a (legal) way to dodge tax, and trust law in England specifically has a long history. There can be multiple trustees or multiple beneficiaries involved in a given trust, and the laws governing trusts are particularly complex, more so than common law. One particularly common way for trusts to arise is when the beneficiary is a minor. Since minors are not able to govern their own financial affairs, it is necessary for someone to take up the role of trustee. Normally a child's parents would have this role, but there are special cases when inheritance law is involved. If a person dies and bequeaths some of their assets to a minor, then a trust is automatically set up with that minor as the beneficiary. Again the trustee(s) would usually be the minor's parent(s) ... except if the people who died were themselves the parents. In this case, the now orphaned child may find themselves the beneficiary of a trust, perhaps for a sizeable amount of money, but with no trustees. This is where the Court of Chancery comes in. The laws governing trusts are part of equity law, which is a separate entity from common law and, up until the late 19th century, was in England administered by a specialised equity court, also known as a chancery court - namely, the English Court of Chancery. This was dissolved in the 1870s, but the Chancery Division remains a separate branch of the English legal system and of the High Court of Justice to this very day. From Wikipedia: The Court of Chancery was a court of equity in England and Wales that followed a set of loose rules to avoid the slow pace of change and possible harshness (or ""inequity"") of the common law. The Chancery had jurisdiction over all matters of equity, including trusts, land law, the administration of the estates of lunatics and the guardianship of infants. So, in a situation where a minor without parents stood to inherit a considerable sum, it was the Court of Chancery which assumed responsibility for that minor and their assets until they came of age. Under the terms of trust law, the court, or its chosen representative, had the right to make decisions about the child's upbringing and how to use their assets, on the understanding that everything it did was for the child's own good. Thus, that child was not only a ""ward of court"", but specifically a ""ward in chancery""."
Was Susan ever able to return to Narnia?,"Susan probably made it back to Narnia, because her experience with faith reflects that of Lewis himself. In 1960, C. S. Lewis wrote back to a reader and said that Susan is not in Aslan's country. Not because I have no hope of Susan ever getting to Aslans's country, but because I have a feeling that the story of her journey would be longer and more like a grown-up novel than I wanted to write. But I may be mistaken. Why not try it yourself? Source, provided by BESW in chat ""Oh Susan!"" said Jill. ""She's interested in nothing nowadays except nylons and lipstick and invitations. She always was a jolly sight too keen on being grown-up."" This implies that she's starting on her 'silly phase', to paraphrase Artemis, which she will eventually grow out of and redeem herself. Now, if you claim that Susan died in the train accident, The Last Battle doesn't say that. It makes no mention of Susan near the crash: ""There's not much to tell,"" said Peter. ""Edmund and I were standing on the platform... ... ""...probably on the same train though Lucy didn't know about it -"" This is actually quite like Lewis's own experiences. In Inside The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe by James Staurt Bell, Carrie Pyykkonen, and Linda Washington, it's mentioned several times that he struggled with religion and then became religious (partly due to an all-night talk with j-r-r-tolkien and another friend). Don't forget this quote: When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.
-Wikiquote So, he looks like he's saying that he did the same thing that Susan did: Became 'grown-up', but then when he actually 'grew up', he was more 'childish'. As @BESW stated in chat, this is sort of an intentional fallacy - this only is the case because CSL decided that this is the case, without there being proof from the work. I've tried to find examples from the books about being 'grown-up' being a bad thing. I've only found a few things so far: He didn't call his Father and Mother 'Father' and 'Mother', but Harold and Alberta. They were very up-to-date and advanced people.
The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, chapter 1 ... ""Oh Susan!"" said Jill. ""She's interested in nothing nowadays except nylons and lipstick and invitations. She always was a jolly sight too keen on being grown-up.""
-The Last Battle, chapter 13 So, it's entirely possible that she makes it, he just didn't feel like writing a 'grownup story'."
"Why is the poem ""Yggdrasil"" placed where it is in House of Leaves, and which narrator included it?","Yggdrasil is an Ash Tree that splits into every known reality, and the house is on Ash Tree Lane, so it does actually have a pretty constant and repeated reference throughout the book."
What occult references caused The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes to be banned in the Soviet Union?,"Searching for Doyle's works banned in USSR in 1929 yields nothing about The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, save for this question and one comment on LiveJournal. However, searching the Russian Wikipedia article for censorship in USSR, I found an entry about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Maracot Deep. The novel was published in USSR in 7 chapters (while it was published in two parts in The Saturday Evening Post and The Strand Magazine before being collected in one book in 1929) from 1927 to 1929. The last chapter, published in 1929, was severely reworked. In particular, every single reference to ""The Lord of the Dark Face"", and anything mystical, was purged, with the following note by editors: Конан Дойль, увлекающийся в последние годы оккультизмом, настолько перегрузил конец ""Маракотовой бездны"" эпизодами и подробностями из ""потустороннего мира"" (до чертовщины и черной магии включительно!), что редакция ""Следопыта"" вынуждена была прибегнуть к сокращению отдельных кусков и разговоров этой части романа, совершенно неуместных на страницах журнала и нелепых с точки зрения нашего читателя, которому рассуждения о ""вечной борьбе добра и зла"" и мистические измышления о способах изгнания дьявола - просто скучны и смешны. Досадно за талантливого писателя, который не только докатился до мракобесия, но и проповедует его наивными приемами, лишенными даже тени оригинальности и новизны  Taken from an interview with Soviet writer and translator Aleksandr Sherbakov  Translation: Conan Doyle, who is taken an interest in occult lately, used so many ""otherworldly"" episodes and details in the ending of ""The Maracot Deep"" (including satanism and black magic!), that the editors of the ""Pathfinder"" had to resort to cutting some of the passages and dialogues in the last part of this novel, passages that are absolutely out of place on the pages of this journal, and make no sense for our readers, who will find discussions about ""the eternal fight between good and evil"" and mystical discussions about exorcism boring and laughable. It is said to see that such gifted writer has not only come to occultism, but also uses its naive tricks, which lack even the trace of originality and novelty.  Translation mine  According to Sherbakov, the bound issue of the Strand from 1929 was even missing from the library, where he went to read the last part of the novel in its original language. He attributes the censorship and changes done to the following passage, a speech by the the Lord of the Dark Face: You wonder how I can injure them. I have powers, and they are not small ones. I can sway the minds of men. I am the master of the mob. Where evil has been planned there have I ever been. I was with the Huns when they laid half Europe in ruins. I was with the Saracens when under the name of religion they put to the sword all who gainsayed them. I was out on Bartholomew's night. I lay behind the slave trade. It was my whisper which burned ten thousand old crones whom the fools called witches. I was the tall dark man who led the mob in Paris when the streets swam in blood. Rare times those, but they have been even better of late in Russia. That is whence I have come.  Emphasis mine, taken from this edition  Obviously, censors could not allow such speeches, so they had it reworked, and inserted some passages of their own. The Maracot Deep remained censored until 1990. As to how this is connected to Sherlock Holmes, I was able to find no evidence. Maybe Sherlock Holmes was rage-censored because of this novel. Maybe it happened to be in the same issue of Strand. One work about Sherlock Holmes that was banned in USSR was the film The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson (ironically, the film is of Soviet production), because it referenced the war in Afghanistan. To lift the ban, Holmes' line about Watson being to Afghanistan had to be re-recorded to Watson being to ""some Eastern country""."
Short story about a man condemned to death because he cannot remember the details about a country,"This matches in almost every detail ‘The Lost Sanjak’ by Saki, published in Reginald in Russia and Other Sketches (1910). “a man (a journalist?) visiting a prison inmate” The prison Chaplain entered the condemned’s cell for the last time, to give such consolation as he might. “He was incarcerated for a crime he did not commit” “In ten minutes’ time I shall be hanged by the neck until I am dead in expiation of the murder of myself, which murder never took place, and of which, in any case, I am necessarily innocent.” “it was a case of mistaken identity or insufficient alibi” “To make matters worse, infinitely worse, an aunt of the really murdered man, an appalling female of an obviously low order of intelligence, identified me as her nephew.” “The conviction hinged on the fact that he could not prove that he was really himself” “I had looked forward apprehensively to the proving of my identity and the establishment of my motives as a disagreeable necessity; I speedily found out that the most disagreeable part of the business was that it couldn’t be done.” “because he could not remember the location of a country he had been to” “The prosecution had made a careful note of the circumstance that the man whom I claimed to be—and actually was—had posed locally as some sort of second-hand authority on Balkan affairs, and, in the midst of a string of questions on indifferent topics, the examining counsel asked me with a diabolical suddenness if I could tell the Court the whereabouts of Novibazar. I felt the question to be a crucial one; something told me that the answer was St. Petersburg or Baker Street. I hesitated, looked helplessly round at the sea of tensely expectant faces, pulled myself together, and chose Baker Street.” “The story ended with the journalist leaving the prison making a note to himself to remember things so as to not be in such a situation himself.” When the Chaplain returned to his quarters some fifteen minutes later, the black flag was floating over the prison tower. Breakfast was waiting for him in the dining-room, but he first passed into his library, and, taking up the Times Atlas, consulted a map of the Balkan Peninsula. “A thing like that,” he observed, closing the volume with a snap, “might happen to any one.”"
Why does Miss Havisham drive fast cars?,"There's nothing in Great Expectations that would suggest that Ms. Havisham would be interested in speed at all: as far as I remember, we only ever see her inside Satis House, wearing her wedding-dress, living in darkness. The closest we get to seeing Ms. Havisham at speed is when Pip is instructed to walk her around her dining table in Chapter 11 of Great Expectations, but even that isn't very fast: She looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said, leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, ""Come, come, come! Walk me, walk me!"" I made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss Havisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and she leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have been an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr. Pumblechook's chaise-cart. She was not physically strong, and after a little time said, ""Slower!"" Still, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she twitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me to believe that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast. After a while she said, ""Call Estella!"" so I went out on the landing and roared that name as I had done on the previous occasion. When her light appeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round and round the room. I suspect that you're right that it's meant to be funny because it's unexpected: Ms. Havisham the ex-shut-in who's now become a daredevil and grown a need for speed, and is now a Cool Old Lady. This also fits in with her character in Thursday Next, where she's generally a superspy, pulling off impossible feats to save the day. In this regard, she's a bit like Granny Puckett from Hoodwinked, who turns out to be a little bit more active than you'd expect from Red Riding Hood's Grandmother (who we only see in bed in the fairy tale!). Just 'cos you bring him up, it is perfectly in character for Mr. Toad to be obsessed with motor-cars (and to be vary of police attention)."

"Who is the speaker in Leonard Cohen's song, ""Avalanche""?","I'll try tackle this one, though I should preface that Cohen's lyrics are often impressionistic, combining different motifs without one specific meaning. For example, ""Hallelujah"" - perhaps his most famous song - combines different Biblical stories (David, Samson) freely, not being easily mapped to one single character. This song combines different motifs, too. Your interpretation of ""you strike my side by accident"" could well be correct. This song appears to be partly in the voice of the soul entering the world (the ""Avalanche""), partly in the voice of the Deity, and partly in the voice of a scorned lover. Here is a good thread discussing these and other aspects of the song, such as Gnosticism. Here is some more from Quora. This is an academic paper discussing, inter alia, Cohen's original poem that this song was based on. (I've tried to summarise these sources in this answer, but they are worth reading for further depth.)"
How did T.S. Eliot's literary criticism affect his poetry?,"T.S Eliot’s creative output may not necessarily have been influenced by his critical beliefs. Whereas his poetry was seemingly influenced by a number of poets in the English tradition with a kind of musical whimsicality and pathos-laden emotion, such as Tennyson, his criticism arguably focused on poets who were of a different character, epic-religious poets such as Milton for example. Criticism and artistic creativity do not always overlap. As is quoted in Adorno’s Aesthetic Theory, “Aesthetics is to artists what ornithology is to birds.” Similarly, some critics have named “the authorial fallacy” the (inaccurate) notion that authors have authoritative knowledge over their own work; by contrast, artistic work can be such a highly subconscious process that artists may be blind to or unaware of apparent mechanisms or patterns behind what they themselves do, and which critics may be better positioned to establish. My guess is that actually Eliot’s criticism and his poetry occupied relatively separate compartments of his mind, something like the difference between being an athlete vs. a coach. In fact, it’s slightly hard to imagine how New Criticism could inspire any particular literary style, since it’s a relatively dry theory advocating how texts should be discussed and analysed, and not favouring any particular style over any other."
"Meaning of ""bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnerronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthur-nuk!""","It's a nonce word and is used only in Finnegans Wake. I have no clue why Joyce made it so long (perhaps he wanted to catch readers' attention and persuade them to read Finnegans Wake). It's defined by Your Dictionary as: A sound which represents the symbolic thunderclap associated with the fall of Adam and Eve. About it's origin, YourDictionary says: A coinage from Finnegans Wake author James Joyce said to represent the thunderclap associated with the fall of Adam and Eve. The word is a hybrid of words in many languages that relate to thunder. From Interesting Literature: Joyce uses the word Bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnerronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk, which is meant to denote the symbolic thunderclap which accompanied the Fall of Adam and Eve (a meaning that is imbued with greater significance in light of Joyce’s lifelong fear of thunder). It is a 101-letter word
that depicts the word for thunder in various languages. There's a video on Adam Harvey's YouTube channel where he pronounces it himself and explains how to pronounce it.
He breaks it down into its constituent parts and explains what each word means and where it came from.

Why does the prophecy imply Macbeth has to murder the king?,"You are quite right that the witches did not prophecy that Macbeth would murder Duncan, and so the option was available to him to “play it safe”: that is, to wait and see how the prophecy transpired, and so, perhaps, ascend the throne of Scotland “holily”. When you spot a case like this, in which a character behaves in a way that you would never do, that’s a chance to learn something about the difference between the character and you. The question to ask should be, “what do his actions tell us about Macbeth?” What do we know about Macbeth? He is Thane of Glamis, that is, a member of the nobility of Scotland, who has had to fight in hand-to-hand combat to defend his country from the rebel lord Macdonwald and his Norse allies, the “kerns and gallowglasses from the Western Isles”. How did Macbeth acquit himself in battle? A soldier who witnessed the event reported it to Malcolm thus: For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),
Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish’d steel,
Which smok’d with bloody execution,
Like Valour’s minion, carv’d out his passage,
Till he fac’d the slave [that is, Macdonwald];
Which ne’er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
Till he unseam’d him from the nave to the chops,
And fix’d his head upon our battlements. This does not seem to be a description of a man who would be content to play it safe and wait and see! The soldier says that Macbeth “disdained Fortune”: that is, he risked his life on his skill with the sword. It is clear from this description that Macbeth is accustomed to, and proficient in, bloody violence, and so when he is faced with the question of how to interpret the witches’ prophecy, the dagger is the tool that seems most comfortable and convenient to his hand."
Why is it called Watership Down?,"As Aurorar0001 says, Watership Down is a real place name in Hampshire, England. The following comments are meant to shed some light on the origin of this place name. The second part, Down, is a noun and here has a meaning similar to 'hill'. To quote the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a down is ""an undulating usually treeless upland with sparse soil — usually used in plural: sheep grazing on the grassy downs"" (link; ""down, noun (2)""). The first part, Watership, derives from Old English wæterscipe, a neuter noun with the meaning 'a body of water, a piece of water, water' (Bosworth Toller's Anglo-Saxon Dictionary, link). Another source gives the meaning of the Old English word as 'conduit, water-channel' (Gover et al. 1970, p. 346). The word part -ship here has nothing to do with a boat, but is a derivational suffix like in friendship, hardship, township etc. Names similar to Watership occur also in Warwickshire, and if you were to look for them, you would likely find them in other areas of England as well. For Warwickshire, you find Watershut Meadow and (in a historical spelling) Watershippe feilde (Gover et al. 1970, p. 346). The name Watership Down therefore had an original meaning 'uplands in the watery area', 'uplands by the water-channel' or something along these lines. Reference: J. E. B. Gover, A. Mawer and F. M. Stenton, in collaboration with F. T. S. Houghton, The Place-Names of Warwickshire, English Place-Name Society 13 (1970 reprint)."
Symbolism of Albus Dumbledore's name in Harry Potter,"The last name is actually not that fancy. As this old interview with Rowling states: How did you decide what to name your characters and places? I collect unusual names. I have notebooks full of them. Some of the names I made up, like Quidditch, Malfoy. Other names mean something -- Dumbledore, which means ""bumblebee"" in Old English...seemed to suit the headmaster, because one of his passions is music and I imagined him walking around humming to himself. And so far I have got names from saints, place-names, war memorials, gravestones. I just collect them -- I am so interested in names. (Barnes and Nobles Interview with J.K. Rowling (1999); Emphasis mine)"
"Why does the murderer call Macduff's son ""egg""?","A. R. Braunmuller (Macbeth, New Cambridge Shakespeare, 1997) provides the following gloss: Contemptuous epithet for a young person (OED Egg sb 2b, citing only this line and another from 1835); (...) G. K. Hunter's edition of the play (New Penguin Shakespeare, 1967) doesn't provide a gloss here. Braunmuller also links the murderer's word choice with the proverb ""An evil bird lays an evil egg"" (cited in Robert W. Dent's Shakespeare's Proverbial Language: An Index, 1981, B376). The murderer also calls Macduff's son ""fry of treachery"". Fry means fish-spawn (G. K. Hunter) or ""progeny, (...), brood"" (Wiktionary) and is another ""contemptuous epithet"". It is also worth noting that the word choice ""egg"" fits the bird imagery in Macbeth. Macbeth uses a lot of animal imagery, but birds are mentioned with particular frequency."
"What does ""halter"" mean here?","@BeastlyGerbil's answer is correct, but for completeness I checked for other uses of the word ""halter"" in the Entire Gutenberg Twain Files (warning: slow to load!) The court informed him that a sheriff had been appointed to do the hanging, and— Capt. Ned's patience was at an end. His wrath was boundless. The subject of a sheriff was judiciously dropped. When the crowd arrived at the canyon, Capt. Ned climbed a tree and arranged the halter, then came down and noosed his man. He opened his Bible, and laid aside his hat. Selecting a chapter at random, he read it through, in a deep bass voice and with sincere solemnity. Then he said: ""Lad, you are about to go aloft and give an account of yourself; and the lighter a man's manifest is, as far as sin's concerned, the better for him. Make a clean breast, man, and carry a log with you that'll bear inspection. You killed the nigger?"" -- Roughing It, Chapter 50 ""By advantage taken of one in fault, in dire peril, and at thy mercy, thou hast seized goods worth above thirteenpence ha'penny, paying but a trifle for the same; and this, in the eye of the law, is constructive barratry, misprision of treason, malfeasance in office, ad hominem expurgatis in statu quo—and the penalty is death by the halter, without ransom, commutation, or benefit of clergy."" -- The Prince and the Pauper, Chapter 24 The jailer finished by lifting himself a-tip-toe with an imaginary halter, at the same time making a gurgling noise in his throat suggestive of suffocation. [...] Another was a man who had been accused of stealing a horse; he said the proof had failed, and he had imagined that he was safe from the halter; but no—he was hardly free before he was arraigned for killing a deer in the King's park; this was proved against him, and now he was on his way to the gallows.  -- The Prince and the Pauper, Chapter 27 ""Yes, we have,"" said another citizen, ""we've got this""—and he produced a halter. Many shouted: ""That's the ticket."" But others said: ""No—Count Angelo is innocent; we mustn't hang him."" -- Those Extraordinary Twins, Chapter 10 By the garish light of the electric lamps I saw the little group of privileged witnesses, the wife crying on her uncle's breast, the condemned man standing on the scaffold with the halter around his neck, his arms strapped to his body, the black cap on his head, the sheriff at his side with his hand on the drop, the clergyman in front of him with bare head and his book in his hand. -- From the 'London Times' of 1904 So Twain definitely uses the word ""halter"" to mean a noose for hanging, in his writings in general. Finally, let's look at the wider context of the quote you're asking about: We were like to be drowned with the rain, deafened with the howling wind and the booming thunder, and blinded by the lightning. It was indeed a wild night. The drenching we were getting was misery enough, but a deeper misery still was the reflection that the halter might end us before we were a day older. A death of this shameful sort had not occurred to us as being among the possibilities of war. It took the romance all out of the campaign, and turned our dreams of glory into a repulsive nightmare. As for doubting that so barbarous an order had been given, not one of us did that. First he's complaining about the weather, but then he changes topic to worry about the halter. It's not just a typo for ""weather"": the halter is a deeper misery than the weather. Note also the reference to a barbarous ""order"" being given - the order for hanging, and nothing to do with the weather."
Did Piggy participate in the killing of Simon?,"Did Piggy and Ralph participate? The current answers range from ""Yes"" (but maybe no) to ""Probably"" (maybe, maybe not) to ""Ralph did but not Piggy"". I'd like to explain why the correct answer is an unequivocal yes - that they were both involved, both were complicit in the murder, and they both sought to lie about it. First, let's quickly set the scene. Simon has gone off on his own into the forest, has a delusional episode with a pig's head on a stick (the ""Lord of the Flies""), has a fit and passes out. When he comes to, he climbs the mountain and discovers that the ""beast"" is merely the decomposing body of a parachutist. Meanwhile, Jack and Ralph have fallen out, and Jack has staged a mutiny, forming his own gang of hunters. The hunters kill a pig, raid Ralph's camp and steal fire, and hold a party. Ralph finally gives in, and he and Piggy join the party. Ralph challenges Jack, but a thunderstorm hits, and Jack's response is to summon his hunters to ""Do our dance!"" Between the flashes of lightning the air was dark and terrible; and the boys followed him, clamorously. Roger became the pig, grunting and charging at Jack, who side-stepped. The hunters took their spears, the cooks took spits, and the rest clubs of fire-wood. A circling movement developed and a chant. While Roger mimed the terror of the pig, the littluns ran and jumped on the outside of the circle. Piggy and Ralph, under the threat of the sky, found themselves eager to take a place in this demented but partly secure society. They were glad to touch the brown backs of the fence that hemmed in the terror and made it governable. “Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!” Roger rejoins the circle, the thunder and lightning are constant, the chanting goes up a notch, and now ""out of the terror rose another desire, thick, urgent, blind"": “Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!” It's in this terrifying and deranged setting that Simon crawls like a beast out of the bushes and into the circle. Beastly Gerbil's answer provides the grisly details of Simon's brutal death. The next chapter gives us the answer. Piggy and Ralph are alone on the beach the next morning, and Ralph is clearly troubled about what had happened. Finally he says it: ""That was murder."" Piggy immediately (and ""shrilly"") tells him to stop talking like that. ""It was dark. There was that––bloody dance.There was the lightning and thunder and rain. We was scared!"" But Ralph says he wasn't scared, he was ... ""I don't know what I was"". Nicely ambiguous: does he mean he doesn't know what emotion he had felt, or he doesn't know what thing he had become - an animal, a beast, a madman? At this point the reader might also recall an earlier chapter where Ralph and the hunters had first performed their kill-the-pig dance, with Robert as the pretend pig within the circle: They got his arms and legs. Ralph, carried away by a sudden thick excitement, grabbed Eric's spear and jabbed at Robert with it. ""Kill him! Kill him!"" [...] Ralph too was fighting to get near, to get a handful of that brown, vulnerable flesh. The desire to squeeze and hurt was over-mastering. Ralph has got form; he knows what he did - what he was - and is in turmoil. ""Oh Piggy!"" he says, his voice ""low and stricken""; ""cradling the conch, he rocked himself to and fro."" ""Don't you understand, Piggy? The things we did–––"" Another answer cites Ralph's description that Piggy was ""outside the circle"", but Piggy's ""shrill"" reaction has all the hallmarks of a guilty boy desperately searching for a defence or an excuse: ""... he had no business crawling like that out of the dark. He was batty. He asked for it."" He gesticulated widely again. ""It was an accident."" But the clincher is Piggy's final conspiratorial don't-tell-anyone appeal, and Ralph's willing complicity in the lie: ""And look, Ralph,"" Piggy glanced round quickly, then leaned close––""don't let on we was in that dance. Not to Samneric."" ""But we were! All of us!"" Piggy shook his head. ""Not us till last. They never noticed in the dark. Anyway you said I was only on the outside–––"" ""So was I,"" muttered Ralph, ""I was on the outside too."" Piggy nodded eagerly. ""That's right. We was on the outside. We never done nothing, we never seen nothing."" The scene ends with the Samneric twins returning with firewood, everyone acting guilty and assuring each other that they hadn't been involved. The air was heavy with unspoken knowledge. Sam twisted and the obscene word shot out of him. ""––dance?"" Memory of the dance that none of them had attended shook all four boys convulsively. ""We left early."""
Who first referred to Odysseus as Ulysses?,"Ulysses is the Latin form of the Greek Odysseus, stemming from the Sicilian or alternate Latin form Ulixes.  The first instance of these forms in literature that I can find is in the Odusia by Livius Andronicus.  This is an early translation of the Odyssey (third century BC).  The only parts of it that survive are 46 lines from 17 books of the Odyssey, but this is one of those lines: Inferus an superus tibi fert deus funera, Ulixes? 
  (Od. 10, 64) I found the surviving text of the Odusia here.   Marcus Pacuvius was an early Latin dramatist who probably used Ulysses.  Though I'm not sure, he wrote many of his plays on Greek topics, and the translations of his works I found use the name Ulysses.   So to answer your question: Livius Andronicus was the first writer I can find who used a form of the Latin name of Odysseus, and Virgil was not the first."
"What does ""if the court knows herself"" mean?","“If the court knows herself” is a catch-phrase referencing a joke that was popular in mid-19th-century America. The earliest version of the joke that I have been able to find is from 1853: When a Kentucky judge, some years since, was asked by an attorney, upon some strange ruling, “Is that law, your honour?” he replied, “If the court understand herself, and she think she do, it are.” C. Gough (1853). The Cruet Stand, volume II, p. 283. Beddington: J. S. Hiron. Here “the court” is synecdoche for the judge himself, so that his claim is a logical tautology: of course if he understands the law correctly, then his ruling is correct. (The judge calls the court “she” because courts are commonly personified as female, after Justitia, the Roman goddess of justice.) The people of Kentucky were stereotypically portrayed as backward in learning but self-reliant, so the idea behind the joke seems to be that the Kentucky judge has little knowledge of the law, but he has the smarts to not let this affect the way he runs his court. The judge’s claim from the joke became a popular catch-phrase or meme. Here are some examples: Mr. ALDRICH. I rise to a point of order. I understand the Chair to say that the question now is upon the motion of the gentleman from New Jersey. That motion has been voted on and decided here three times to-night, [laughter,] “if the court understand herself, and she think she do.” [Renewed laughter.] John C. Rives, ed. (1863). Proceedings of the Third Session of the Thirty-Seventh Congress, p. 579. Washington: Congressional Globe. But as we say, “a miss is as good as a mile,” only that the next time I go to sea I shall take some grub and some water and a compass, and “if the court know herself, as she think she do,” I shall hardly venture in a craft not much bigger than a washing tub. Thomas Kilby Smith (April 26, 1865). Letter to Elizabeth Smith. In Walter George Smith, ed. (1898). Life and Letters of Thomas Kilby Smith, p. 397. New York: G. P. Putnam’s Sons. The neighbor, adopting these conclusions, tried to dissuade Jackson from burying his money in any hole in those remote woods; but Jackson replied, in the words of the Western judge: “If this court understand herself, and she think she do, coal is certainly coming out of that mountain,”—and set to work, encouraged only by his father, then a very old man, and his brother, a self-taught, practical geologist, who joined hands with him in the undertaking. J. T. Trowbridge (1869) ‘A Carpet-Bagger in Pennsylvania’. In The Atlantic Monthly, April 1869, p. 453–454. “Well, ’spose you paid me ten dollars for takin’ you over there and back, you don’t think I’d be fool enough to know anything about it, do you? Not if the court know herself, and she think she do, as Esquire Dickens always says when he declines a small marriage fee—because it’s too small!” C. R. Edwards (1870). A Story of Niagara, p. 160. Buffalo: Breed, Lent & Co. I turns to Mr. Holmes, and says I, “Looky here, my fat friend, I’m a-running this shanty, and if the court knows herself, you’ll take whiskey straight or you’ll go dry.” Mark Twain (1907). Chapters From my Autobiography, XXV. In The North American Review, number DCXXV (December 1907), p. 483. So in the passage from In the Midst of Alarms, Yates just means that he thinks he is not going to jail, but he makes it into a joke by using the catch-phrase."
"Who is Mrs LeFay in ""The Magician's Nephew""?","As noted in the question, The Magician's Nephew contains little information about Mrs Lefay. The name is probably inspired by Morgan Le Fay, the half-sister of King Arthur, but this should not be taken as necessarily implying kinship between them - ""Le Fay"" simply means ""the fairy"". Uncle Andrew's talk to Digory gives most of the details we know: Have you ever heard of old Mrs. Lefay?"" ""Wasn't she a great-aunt or something?"" said Digory. ""Not exactly,"" said Uncle Andrew. ""She was my godmother. That's
her, there, on the wall."" Digory looked and saw a faded photograph: it showed the face of an old
woman in a bonnet... It was not at all a nice face, Digory thought She was locked up in prison, and was released shortly before she died. Uncle Andrew gives the further information that she was part fairy: my godmother was a very remarkable woman. The truth is, she was one of
the last mortals in this country who had fairy blood in her... ""I bet she was a bad fairy,"" thought Digory Digory clearly gets the impression that she was evil, but possibly she had a change of heart before she died, as she ordered Uncle Andrew to burn the box of magic dust. Some more details are revealed from one of Lewis' notebooks which includes a long fragment of a hand-written first draft of The Magician's Nephew. When C.S. Lewis died, he left strict instructions to his brother Warnie that all his papers were to be burnt. The story goes that Walter Hooper arrived at The Kilns (Lewis' home) just in time to snatch some of the documents out of the bonfire, including the notebook which became known as The LeFay Fragment. According to a blog posting by Tenethia South: In it, Digory has a special power to speak with trees and animals, but
loses it when he is convinced by Polly to saw off one of a tree’s
limbs in order to build a raft. Mrs. Lefay, his godmother, comes for a
visit and seems to be sympathetic to his problem. Although we would
all probably love to find out if this early Digory ever regained his
ability to speak to trees, the fragment ends abruptly when Mrs. Lefay
begins to give Digory directions to her home. A commenter on the blog who read the Fragment reveals that: His [Digory's] aunt said, “but if you observe me carefully, I’m sure
you’ll see why I think she’s rude, unmannered, and slovenly.” Mrs. Lefay turns out to be the “Fattest and shortest” woman Digory had
ever seen (perhaps dwarven?). Her black dress is covered in yellowish
dust that she claims is snuff perhaps a precursor to the dust in The
Magician’s Nephew?). She gives a pretty good Mary Poppins impression
until Aunt Gertrude leaves, when she then reveals that she knows about
Digory’s loss, and hints that there might be redemption. In her words
“You [Digory] look exactly what Adam must have looked like, five
minutes after he’d been turned out of the Garden of Eden” The Fragment is reproduced in full in Walter Hooper's Past Watchful Dragons: The Narnian Chronicles of C.S. Lewis (1979), available on free loan from the Internet Archive. I give below an image of two pages of the handwritten notebook, which were shown at the Bodleian Library as part of the ""Magical Beasts"" exhibition in 2013. If Lewis' handwriting defeats you, they can be read more easily on pages 50-51 of Hooper's book. "
Why is the superstate Winston lives in named Oceania in 1984?,"The best description we have of the three superpowers and their geography comes from Chapter III (War is Peace) of Emmanuel Goldstein's magnum opus: Oceania comprises the Americas, the Atlantic islands including the British Isles, Australasia, and the southern portion of Africa. Eastasia, smaller than the others and with a less definite western frontier, comprises China and the countries to the south of it, the Japanese islands and a large but fluctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet. -- Part 2, Chapter 9 We see, then, that Oceania is an entirely apt description for this superpower which consists mostly of ocean, just as Eurasia is an apt name for the one which covers most of the continents of Europe and Asia, and Eastasia for the one which is geographically smallest and tucked into eastern Asia.  (image courtesy of Wikipedia) Oceania's oceans are also its major military advantage in the eternal war between the three nations, and the asset which makes it essentially unconquerable: None of the three super-states could be definitively conquered even by the other two in combination. They are too evenly matched, and their natural defences are too formidable. Eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces, Oceania by the width of the Atlantic and the Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness of its inhabitants. -- ibid"
"Origin of “Good books are the warehouses of ideas”, attributed to H. G. Wells on commemorative £2 coin?","TL;DR: It’s a typographical error: for “ideas” read “ideals”! “Ideals!” said my uncle; “certainly Ideals. Of course one must have ideals, else life would be bare materialism. Bare fact alone, naked necessity, is impossible barren rock for a soul to root upon. Life, indeed, is an unfurnished house, an empty glass in a thirsty land good and necessary for foundation, but insufficient for any satisfaction unless we have ideals. Or, again, ideals are the flesh upon the skeleton of reality, and it cannot live without them. “It always appears to me,” said my uncle, ""that the comparison of ideals to furniture is particularly appropriate. They are the draperies of the mind, and they hide the nakedness of truth. Your fireplace is ugly, your mere necessary shelves and seats but planks and crudity, all your surroundings so much office furniture, until the skilful hand and the draperies come in. Then a few cunning loopings and foldings, and behold softness and delicacy, crudity gone, and life well worth the living. So that you cannot value ideals too highly. “Yet at the same time—” My uncle became meditative. “I would not have a man the slave of his ideals. Hangings make the room comfortable, but, after all, hangings are hangings. Perhaps, now and then of course, I would not suggest continual inconstancy a slight change, a little rearrangement, even a partial replacement, might brighten up the dear old dwelling-place. An ideal may be clung to too fondly. When the moth gets into it, or the dust did not Carlyle warn us against this, lest they ‘accumulate and at last produce suffocation’? I am exactly at one with him there. “And that, as any Cabinet Minister explains every time he opens a public library, is why we have literature. Good books are the warehouses of ideals. Does it strike you your furniture is sombre, a bit Calvinistic and severe try a statuette by Pope, or a classical piece out of Heine. Too much white and gold for every-day purposes then the Reverend Laurence Sterne will oblige. Urban tone may be corrected by Hardy, and Lowell will give you urbanity. And, however well you match and balance them, remember there is a time for ideals, and a time when they are better out of the way. H. G. Wells (1895). ‘The Use of Ideals’. In Select Conversations with an Uncle (Now Extinct) and Two Other Reminiscences, pp. 18–19. London: John Lane. This reference was spotted by Eleanor Fitzsimons on Twitter. I’ve quoted so much of the context to demonstrate that the context is satirical—when the narrator’s uncle says that “good books are the warehouses of ideals” he means that you can leave the ideals in the books and not have to think about them, until the time comes when it might be expedient or convenient to get them out. This is a terrible quotation to use when you are intending to commemorate a writer: it says that the writer’s ideals can safely be ignored and forgotten, in the warehouse of his books, until the day when you might take them out and use them for background decoration, like a wall-hanging. But perhaps the choice is in keeping with the four-legged tripods. Who turned “ideals” into “ideas”? The earliest instance I was able to find is from 1999: Good books are the warehouses of ideas. — H. G. Wells (1866–1946) Ben Jacobs and Helena Hjalmarsson (1999). The Quotable Book Lover, p. 4. New York: Lyons Press."
Ray Bradbury says Fahrenheit 451 isn't about censorship. Is he right?,"You can make an argument for anything, really. It just depends on whether it's a good argument. I'd argue that  the common interpretation of Fahrenheit 451 as being about government censorship isn't a very good interpretation. What fits much better is the one that the author himself intended: Fahrenheit's not about censorship, it's about the moronic influence of popular culture through local TV news, the proliferation of giant screens and the bombardment of factoids. The government is merely carrying out what the people wants: ""Classics cut to fit fifteen-minute radio shows, then cut again to fill a two-minute book column, winding up at last as a ten- or twelve-line dictionary resume. I exaggerate, of course. The dictionaries were for reference. But many were those whose sole knowledge of Hamlet (you know the title certainly, Montag; it is probably only a faint rumour of a title to you, Mrs. Montag) whose sole knowledge, as I say, of Hamlet was a one-page digest in a book that claimed: 'now at least you can read all the classics; keep up with your neighbours.' Do you see? Out of the nursery into the college and back to the nursery; there's your intellectual pattern for the past five centuries or more."" This is the purpose of the firemen: to continue what humans on their own began. Without the firemen, one could argue, the situation would be mostly the same - a few eccentrics, but the majority focused only on violence and quick entertainment. And that's exactly the statement which Bradbury wanted to make: today, we are going down that path. School has moved away from learning and towards making school ""interesting"" and incorporating ""technology"". This point about school is also made in Fahrenheit 451: School is shortened, discipline relaxed, philosophies, histories, languages dropped, English and spelling gradually neglected, finally almost completely ignored. Censorship, I would argue, is more about the banning of discussion of specific topics. This isn't censorship. This is a complete end to real learning and thought. It's about staring, blank-eyed, at a screen - Montag's wife is almost not there by the end of the book, with the installation of the screens so she can ""watch the story"", though the stories are really meaningless. It's what the people wanted. They wanted the books to go away. The government and the firemen were just a tool of the people. So, the books went up in flames."
Is Alice in Wonderland about drugs?,"The closest I've found to a definitive statement is this one: Carroll’s diaries, which are on display at the exhibit, make no mention of drugs. We know that he occasionally enjoyed a glass of sherry and may have taken opiate-infused drug Laudanum (which was readily available to everyone in the 1860s). Other than that, there’s nothing connecting Alice and drugs. The Alice in Wonderland fansite says much the same in their FAQ: No evidence has ever been found that linked Carroll to recreational drug use. Even in his extensive diaries, Carroll has never made any reference to the use of drugs. There is however one part in the book that may describe the use of drugs: the hookah smoking Caterpillar who advises Alice to eat from the mushroom. With the story Carroll made fun of all aspects of society, and it may be possible that he was reflecting the age with this part: In the Victorian era there were no drug laws like we know them now. Opium, cocaine, and laudanum (a painkiller that contained opium) were used for medicinal purposes, and could be obtained from a pharmacist (mind that LSD was not yet invented at the time!). So in Carroll’s days it was not uncommon to experience the effect of being ‘high’, whether or not accidentally. They then note that the Caterpillar wasn't even in the original tale told by Alice, but added later when he was assembling the book for publishing. Just to cover all of the bases, some of the historical record of his diary and correspondence is no longer available to reference: .... Dodgson’s diaries, which were published in abridged form in 1954 and in full, with Wakeling’s annotations, beginning in 1993. But even they are an imperfect source. Four of the 13 volumes are missing — as are the pages covering late June 1863, when his break with the Liddells occurred. A Dodgson descendant apparently cut them out after the writer died. That said, what has survived does not support the idea that the books were written under the influence of drugs nor that they were about drugs."
In what way is The Lord of the Rings metafiction?,"Metafiction is self-conscious about language, literary form, storytelling, and directly or indirectly draw attention to their status as artefacts (From Wikipedia's description of metafiction.) I'd say Lord of the Rings fulfills this. Tolkien was  a philologist. His thing was constructing languages. To begin with, each species or group of people generally has their own distinctive language, which fits in with that species' characteristics, and also follows normal language patterns (i.e., the languages are realistic). A list of languages mentioned LotR (not complete): And so on and so forth. Further, names also fit in with culture and language - think Ghan-buri-ghan vs. Elrond vs. Nazgul vs. Khazad-dum. The form of Lord of the Rings is that of an epic. It's meant to emulate stories like Beowulf, or the Norse sagas, or the Finnish Kalevala, or the Oedipus cycle. Further, it is presented as such: in the foreword, Tolkien describes translating and transcribing the story he is about to tell from the Red Book of Westmarch. A not insignificant portion of the Lord of the Rings is tales from the past, or reminiscing of the way things were. Think of the story told in the council of Elrond of how the ring came to be, and how it was passed to Frodo, or the story of Luthien and Beren told in the hollow of Weathertop, or the song sung by Gimli in Moria, or the song sung by Legolas just inside of Lothlorien, or the stories told by the Ents of the Entwives, or the reference of the barrow-wights to the past kings that lay there, or... The list clearly goes on. Further, there's some meta references - in the foreword, Tolkien mentions how he got the story, through the Red Book of Westmarch, which was copied and past down, and in LotR it's described how the Red Book was written, first by Bilbo, then Frodo, and finally Sam. There's also the appendices. First, see above about the Red Book of Westmarch and the appendices. Second, things like the image provided, showing the inscription on Balin's tomb in the Chamber of Mazurbal act as ""artefacts"". He also describes hobbits in the foreword, and the family trees, almost as a historian or an archaeologist might. See also the section on the literary form of the work, and how LotR comes across as a true epic. It seems that the definition of metafiction can be awfully confusing. Some definitions define metafiction as drawing attention the fictionality of the work - breaking the fourth wall, so to speak. Others define it as presenting the fiction as artefacts. Let me quote a paper on The Lord of the Rings' status as metafiction: Tolkien also set out to reproduce that singular effect of which he speaks, the effect of the work reaching us as an echo of an echo (of an echo …) from a remote antiquity, expending his art in increasing the distance between the (mostly) Modern English text the reader would be holding in his or her hands and the fictional characters and events of which it told. For this purpose, he integrated his major works of fiction into an intricate metafictional structure, presenting them within their fiction precisely as such echoes of echoes: translations of redactions of ancient works, telling of things even more ancient. (From The Books of Lost Tales: Tolkien as Metafictionist.) His work rather clearly fits the second sort of definition, but whether it fits the first sort of definition is debatable. Does The Lord of the Rings draw attention to its status as fiction? I'd argue it draws attention to its status as something other than a normal book; the foreword and the continued references to the Red Book of Westmarch do that. Perhaps, though, the scenes in LotR where we see Bilbo, Frodo, and Sam writing in the Red Book of Westmarch indicates that this that we are reading is a story, albeit a ""true"" one. So perhaps this fits the first type of definition?"
Is Doctor Adams a self-insertion in Watership Down?,"Doctor Adams is the author's father. Richard Adams is the son of Evelyn Adams, who worked as a country doctor.  I can find no definitive quote from the author to confirm this was his intention: however the similarity in name, profession and locale make it seem extremely likely. Some critics have taken the similarity as read. For instance in his essay ""The Shrinking of the Epic Hero: Richard Adams' Watership Down and the Epic Tradition"", Kenneth Ketchell of Louisiana State University says in a footnote: The doctor is named Dr. Adams and, significantly, Richard Adams's father was a country doctor. If university academics cannot source an explicit connection, it is possible that suppositions based on this strong circumstantial evidence is the best that we can do."
"Is there any evidence that this character in Harry Potter was a double agent all along, prior to the revelation?","The strongest evidence (in my opinion) is Dumbledore's unwavering trust. When other characters doubted him, Dumbledore always affirmed his confidence, but never gave others a reason to share it.  This clearly suggests that he possesses some secret knowledge. For example, when Harry and Lupin discuss Snape (Half Blood Prince) we have the following exchange ""But,"" said Harry, ""just say — just say Dumbledore's wrong about Snape
—"" ""People have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore’s judgement. I do; therefore, I trust Severus."" Lupin, who is at the heart of the Order of the Phoenix, is able to offer no better proof of Snape's fidelity than this, suggesting that Dumbledore must have some good reason that he is unwilling to share with even his closest confidants."
Why are Freud and Lacan still seen as important to literary criticism when their theories are discredited?,"I’m reminded of something that my Abnormal Psych professor said about Freud, “He remains influential because he’s esthetically pleasing.” I think that this is the core of Freud and Lacan’s continued influence in literary criticism, although most of the theoretical frameworks that were popular in the late twentieth century have been falling away as a historico-textual approach with a dose of New Criticism dominates in most critical discourse these days. Much of what appealed about literary theory was not so much its applicability but its somewhat onanistic esthetic pleasures. Most (all?) of the writing about deconstructionism was theoretical in nature with little critical writing actually applying the principles of deconstructionism. Freudian and Lacanian criticism tended to make it out of the graduate literary seminars and into the pages of journals, but this was largely because they were in a sense more practical, providing a framework for being able to look at a text in a useful interpretive manner. I can’t write a whole lot about Lacan. He’s dense to the point of being incomprehensible as evidenced by this exchange from The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis: Lacan: Have I thrown some light on your question? J.-A. Miller: Some light and some shadow. With Freud, things tend to fall into two categories: An overly complicated proto-behavioralism (e.g., the account of the woman who had trouble drinking water because she had seen a dog lapping water sloppily from the pitcher¹) and an application of literary traditions to psychoanalysis that had dubious applicability to his patients’ real problems (e.g., the Oedipus Complex). Both of these work better in a literary critical context. A Skinnerian behaviorialism might be workable for understanding a text, but it doesn’t really make for an esthetically pleasing way to write about the text and part of literary criticism is not simply making an argument, but making it in an esthetically pleasing way (your college English professors might not have acknowledge as much but it is very much an aspect of humanistic academic writing). The latter concept, on the other hand, is directly connected to literature and influenced by it as well. There was a back and forth between the literary tradition and Freudian psychoanalysis where the framework not only influenced the interpretation of texts but was influenced by the interpretation of texts. Add in the fact that post-Freud,² many writers were fascinated by Freudian concepts and deliberately inserted them into their texts and Freud ends up being more relevant in the halls of the English department than the Psychology department. This is a half-remembered anecdote which I don’t really have time to dig up now. This is also the case with Marxist thought as well."
Chilli peppers in fifteenth-century India?,"This is an error introduced by the translator. The original Portuguese text says: Sabei que estais na Índia, onde se estende
Diverso povo, rico e prosperado
De ouro luzente e fina pedraria,
Cheiro suave, ardente especiaria. A literal translation (mine) would be: Know that you are in India, where dwell diverse people, rich and prosperous from bright gold and exquisite gemstones, delicate perfumes, fiery spices. William Atkinson translates: You must know that you are now in India, the abode of a diversity of peoples who prosper and grow rich on their gleaming gold and precious stones, their cinnamon and spices. Luis Vaz de Camões. The Lusiads. Trans. William C. Atkinson. Penguin Classics. London: Penguin, 1952. P. 249. Richard Burton's much-maligned translation comes closest to Camões' original: Know, that ye look on Indo wherein extendeth
a world of nations, rich and fortunate
in lucent gold, and gems of princely price,
and odorif'erous fumes and biting spice. While both Atkinson and White flavor Camões' lines by tossing in spices not found in the original, Atkinson at least gets history and geography right; cinnamon is native to Sri Lanka. White's mention of hot chillies is anachronistic. There are other problems with White's translation. The explanatory notes sometimes baffle rather than illuminate. For example, when the Samorin asks da Gama, ""What precious gifts do you bring me?"" (VIII.62.3, p. 169), the note says: ""See canto 4.61–5"" (p. 251). But the referenced verses, about João II's sending envoys to explore Eurasia and Africa, contain nothing that seems relevant. Also, while White praises Camões for being ""no prude"" in describing the carnal pleasures of the Isle of Love, he does not appear to share this frankness, at least not when it comes to same-sex love; he coyly describes Hyacinth (IX.62.3, p. 189) as merely Apollo's ""friend"" (p. 253). Such infelicities mar what is otherwise an excellent rendition of Camões' ottava rima stanzas into English verse."
Is this the longest sentence by Twain?,"At 419 words, this whopper may indeed be the longest sentence Twain ever wrote. Searching the internet for references to longest Mark Twain sentences, the best I found was this 262-worder from The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: The first thing to see, looking away over the water, was a kind of dull line; that was the woods on t’other side–you couldn’t make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more paleness, spreading around; then the rive softened up, away off, and warn’t black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far away–trading scows, and such things; and long black streaks? rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by-and-by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there’s a snag there in the swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a log cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t’other side of the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and comes fanning you from over there so cool and fresh, and sweet to smell, on account of the woods and flowers; but sometimes not that way, because they've left dead fish laying around, gars, and such, and they do get pretty rank; and next you’ve got the full day, and everything smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it! Another source refers to a mere (!) 236-word sentence as the possible record. If these claims to fame for sentences not much more than half as long as the one you've found can be taken seriously, then yours may quite possibly be the record. As for the ""story"" behind these impressively extended and verbose sentences - clearly not just a one-off in Twain's writing, since there are several sentences scattered through his works which, although not as long as the example you've found, are nevertheless over two hundred words long and therefore pretty impressive and out of the ordinary - it may well be the case that the author was deliberately trying to create exceptionally long sentences for effect; partly, of course, longer sentences were simply more common in writing in those days, before the age of modernity, advertising and the internet, when people's attention spans shrank to the size of gnats' and it became necessary to impart information to them as swiftly and efficiently as possible before they went ""TL;DR"" and moved on to something more entertaining; partly, also, long sentences can be a practically useful writing device, as for instance when trying to include a great deal of description but make it feel compressed as though it's all happening at the same time (in your example, putting the entire description of the boat's motion and progress in a single sentence gives the reader the feeling that they're taking it all in at a single glance rather than reading about it piece by piece in a book; in the above description of a sunrise, again putting it all in one sentence is akin to compressing the experience into a single glance, the way it would be in the real world, rather than artificially extending it by a long wordy description); but in addition to their utility in writing, it may be that Twain was using these excessively long sentences for humorous effect or to make a point - a thesis supported, for example, by the following speech he once made in German on 21 November 1897, and for which he also wrote the entertainingly bad English translation which is provided below (a better translation is available here, but Twain's own has amusement value while still being comprehensible).1 I am indeed the truest friend of the German language - and not only now, but from long since - yes, before twenty years already. And never have I the desire had the noble language to hurt; to the contrary, only wished she to improve - I would her only reform. It is the dream of my life been. I have already visits by the various German governments paid and for contracts prayed. I am now to Austria in the same task come. I would only some changes effect. I would only the language method - the luxurious, elaborate construction - compress, the eternal parenthesis suppress, do away with, annihilate; the introduction of more than thirteen subjects in one sentence forbid; the verb so far to the front pull that one it without a telescope discover can. With one word, my gentlemen, I would your beloved language simplify so that, my gentlemen, when you her for prayer need, One 
  her yonder - up understands. [...] Before several days has the correspondent of a local paper a sentence constructed which hundred and twelve words contained, and therein were seven 
  parentheses smuggled in, and the subject seven times changed. Think 
  you only, my gentlemen, in the course of the voyage of a single sentence must the poor, persecuted, fatigued subject seven times change position! Now, when we the mentioned reforms execute, will it no longer so bad be. Doch noch eins. I might gladly the separable verb also a little bit reform. I might none do let what Schiller did: he has the whole history of the Thirty Years' 
  War between the two members of a separable verb in-pushed. That has even Germany itself aroused, and one has Schiller the permission refused the History of the Hundred Years' War to compose - God be it thanked! After all these reforms established be will, will the German language the noblest and the prettiest on the world be.  1 332 words."
Is Deeper Magic something more than God (the Emperor beyond the Sea) in Narnia?,"First we need to understand what the ""Deep Magic"" is/represents, before moving to the ""Deeper Magic.""  We know from chapter 13 of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe that the Deep Magic is written in several places (on the Stone Table, on the Scepter of the Emperor-beyond-the-Sea, etc.).  We also know from that chapter that it defines what Justice requires.   This closely parallels, then, the Old Testament Law, which establishes both laws and a sacrificial system for dealing with those who break the law.  Colin Duriez summarizes that the Deep Magic is: the moral order by which the world of Narnia is made and sustained.  One of its inner laws is that unless the Witch is given blood for every treachery committed all Narnia will fall apart, perishing in fire and water.  The Deep Magic has affinities with Old Testament law. (A Field Guide to Narnia, 181) So, what about the ""Deeper Magic""?  Paul Ford likens it to ""self-sacrificing love"" (Pocket Companion to Narnia, 214) and points to LWW chapter 15, where Aslan says: Though the Witch knew the Deep Magic, there is a magic deeper still which she did not know.  Her knowledge goes back only to the dawn of time.  But if she could have looked a little further back, into the stillness and the darkness before Time dawned, she would have read there a different incantation.  She would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in a traitor's stead, the Table would crack and Death itself would start working backward. This deeper magic is thus both older and less known than the Deep Magic.  This parallels in Christianity the mechanism that makes it possible for Jesus Christ's death on the cross to save (or, more specifically, atone for) law-breakers.  Lewis is purposefully vague when it comes to the exact function of this mechanism (as shown elsewhere, he did not personally commit to any particular theory of atonement).   Broadly speaking, however, the deeper magic parallels God's grace in the New Covenant: a grace that was only foreshadowed in the Old Testament, a grace that fulfills the Law and its sacrificial system, a grace that was established long before the Old Testament law was formally given. Thus Duriez writes: [The deeper magic is] a deeper principle than the natural moral order that sustains the world.  This is a principle resembling the New Testament notion of grace, which fulfills and perfects the older law. (A Field Guide to Narnia, 181)"
What is the significance of the anisotropic highway and the skeleton of a fascist chained to a machine gun?,"I interpreted the scene with the highway and the skeleton as a subtle bit of foreshadowing. It'll take some inference to get there, so bear with me if you will. Pavel says as much in the given quote: ""The highway was anisotropic, like history. You weren’t supposed to go back."" However, going back through history is exactly what Anton does. He immerses himself in the society of Arkanar, which the people of Earth consider to be at an earlier point of historical progression. More than Don Condor or Pavel himself, Anton goes native. He has real friends among the natives, like Baron Pampas. He falls in love with Kira, a native woman. He even adopts the passionate hatred of the natives, abandoning the more appropriate dispassion and pity, as he himself notes in Chapter 5: Why? What has happened to me? Where did it go, my nurtured-since-childhood respect and trust in my own kind, in man— the amazing creature called man? Nothing can help me now, he thought in horror. Because I sincerely hate and despise them. Not pity them, no— only hate and despise. I can justify the stupidity and brutality of the kid I just passed all I want— the social conditions, the appalling upbringing, anything at all— but I now clearly see that he’s my enemy, the enemy of all that I love, the enemy of my friends, the enemy of what I hold most sacred. And I don’t hate him theoretically, as a “typical specimen,” but him as himself, him as an individual. And a little further on in the same long monologue: I came here to love people, to help them unbend, see the sky. No, I’m a bad operative, he thought remorsefully. I’m a no-good historian. When exactly did I manage to fall into the swamp that Don Condor was talking about? Does a god have the right to feel anything other than pity? Even though Anton has not literally traveled through time, he's absorbed himself so thoroughly in historical conditions that he's started to adopt historical ways of thinking—hatred, vindictiveness—even while he keeps his values. Anton still values the things he was taught to value on Earth, like learning, curiosity, discovery, and peace, but he despises those who don't embody those values, instead of just condescendingly pitying them and hoping for the enlightenment of their descendants. It becomes so bad that he fantasizes about killing Don Reba and starting his own rebellion in Chapter 3: But the very thought that thousands of others— maybe less talented but also honest and truly noble people— were fatally doomed caused an icy chill in his chest and an awareness of his own vileness. Sometimes this awareness became so acute that his mind would become clouded, and Rumata could almost see the backs of the gray bastards illuminated by lilac flashes of gunfire, and Don Reba’s eternally insignificant, pale visage contorted with animal terror, and the Merry Tower collapsing on itself. Yes, that’d be sweet. That would be actual work. An actual macroscopic impact.
Hard to Be a God (Rediscovered Classics) (p. 77). Chicago Review Press. Kindle Edition.  He also thinks how he envies Arata, the consummate rebel who struggles against the crown: Arata was the only person here for whom Rumata felt neither hatred nor pity, and in his earthling’s dreams— the feverish dreams of a man who had lived for five years surrounded by stench and blood— he often imagined himself as such an Arata, having received the high right to murder the murderers, torture the torturers, and betray the traitors for having passed through all the hells of the universe.
Ibid pp. 213-214  The only thing that ends his fantasies is foreknowledge of the rapine that would follow such an uprising: Then the inevitable. Bloody chaos in the country. The surfacing of Waga’s night army, ten thousand thugs excommunicated by every church— rapists, murderers, and sadists; hordes of copper-skinned barbarians descending from the mountains and destroying everything that moves, from newborns to the aged; huge crowds of peasants and townspeople, blind with terror, fleeing to the forests, mountains, and deserts [...]
Ibid, p. 77. Neither Anka nor Pavel follow Anton up the highway. Neither feels the same temptation he does: Pavel manages to maintain a proper distance from his work, while Anka stays on Earth, ever the cautious one. In Chapter 10, Anton sums up Reba thusly: We’ve been racking our brains, vainly trying to squeeze the complicated, contradictory, enigmatic figure of our eagle Don Reba into the ranks of Richelieu, Necker, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and Monck, and he turned out to be a petty hoodlum and an idiot! He betrayed and sold out everyone he could, got tangled up in his own schemes, got scared to death, and ran to the Holy Order to be saved. In half a year he’ll be slaughtered, and the Order will remain.
Ibid, pp. 220-221. Don Reba's determination to fight, to impose his own will on the country, led to his own death; he purposefully chained himself to his weapon by refusing to stop weaving schemes within schemes, trying to improve his own lot; but in the end, chained to the gun, he couldn't stop fighting, and he had to take things to their bitter conclusion. His legacy ended there as he sank into the ground, pulled down by his weapon, the Holy Order.  Since the highway is the progress of history, the bridge was what allowed civilization to move smoothly from one age into the next. But the bridge was blown up, probably in the same battle that the fascist died in. Without the bridge, making progress up the road is difficult. But it's not impossible to ford a river or wade through a swamp or trundle through a valley. It's slow, dangerous, and many more will die than would have walking across the bridge. But some can still make it to the other side. This is Arkanar at the end of the novel: their society's bridge to the next era of history has been blown up thanks to Don Reba. People who would have survived into the next age will now die, and the path for those who survive will be much harder than it would have been. But because Anton and his colleagues managed to save at least a few of the people who will usher in the next era, it's still possible for their society to finally come out on the other side and continue down the road of history."
"Which order is recommended for the ""Commonwealth"" novels?","The Commonwealth universe consists of three series of books that should be read in publication order: The only possible exception to reading it in publication order is that the first novel, Misspent Youth (which was both published first and takes place first) has the feel of a prequel of sorts. It takes place 300 years before Pandora's Star, has a different focus, is much shorter, and is not necessary to read first to make sense of the rest of the series. Reading it first would probably be most ""coherent"", which is what you're asking about, but most fans would probably recommend to read it later on (although when you read it isn't terribly important) because it doesn't really serve as a good introduction to the universe. This publication order does pretty much correspond to the chronological order of the plot, except that the Void Trilogy and the Fallers duology take place in parallel – however, they should still be read in publication order because of how the stories unfold. Both the Void Trilogy and Fallers duology will spoil earlier novels if read out of sequence. The books within each series absolutely need to be read in sequence to make sense."
What do the other farmers symbolize in Animal Farm?,"Mr. Jones symbolizes Tsar Nicholas II, the last Tsar of Russia. He oppresses the animals, but is overthrown. Mr. Pilkington symbolizes England and the USA. They are frightened of the revolution.  He has a larger, but more unkempt farm compared to Frederick. Mr. Frederick is possibly Germany, as he's described as abusing his animals and is on bad terms with Mr. Pilkington."
"Did Thomas Hardy's books get more miserable with time, and was this because of his own life?","You could say that Thomas Hardy's work became more miserable as time went on; however, this is not explicitly true as even his earliest work was riddled with tragedy, including A Pair of Blue Eyes, Hardy's third book, written before his fourth book Far From the Madding Crowd, in which the narrative's heroine, Elfride, is rejected by her fiancé and dies in childbirth (after marrying another man, simply because he found out that she had been engaged to another man before him). This is clearly more heavy on tragedy than the latter book, so it is questionable whether his literature got progressively more tragic; I would say no as it is not consistently worse. This underlying obsession with brutal realism and tragedy stems from his own deeply unhappy life, specifically his doomed marriage to Emma Gifford. Initially they were happy together, but Emma was a higher social class to the poorer Hardy, which caused a rift in their relationship as Emma began to 'look down on him', including his novels, allegedly saying they were only fit for servants to read. Hardy was so deeply unhappy that he wrote in one statement that ""a marriage should be dissolvable as soon as it becomes a cruelty to either of the parties - being then essentially and morally no marriage."" This acted as inspiration to many of the terrible relationships in his novels, such as Bathsheba's conflict in choosing between the three suitors and Tess and Alec's toxic marriage. In 1912, Emma died, and Hardy was driven almost mad with grief (strange, considering their mutual disdain for each other when she was alive) and became the subject for many of his poems, exemplified in The Voice with the grief-stricken opening line of ""Woman much missed how you call to me, call to me"", and his tragic novels. However, the novels written before he met Emma including A Pair of Blue Eyes, were also tragic, which mars the theory that it was influenced by his personal life. Nevertheless, it can definitely be said that overall his literary subject matter was drawn from his relationship with Emma and her later death. For more information about Thomas Hardy's personal life, take a look at Claire Tomalin's Thomas Hardy: The Time-Torn Man."
Were other characters apart from Alice inspired by real life people?,"Martin Gardner's The Annotated Alice contains some excellent literary analysis of both Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, including a lot of surrounding information about Carroll in real life which helps us to analyse his books. I shall be quoting heavily from this below. Many of the group of wet animals in Chapter 3 of Alice in Wonderland - ""a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures"" - are based upon real people. From The Annotated Alice (emphasis mine) Carroll's Dodo was intended as a caricature of himself—his stammer is said to have made him pronounce his name ""Dodo-Dodgson."" The Duck is the Reverend Robinson Duckworth, who often accompanied Carroll on boating
  expeditions with the Liddell sisters. The Lory, an Australian parrot, is Lorina, who was the eldest of the sisters (this explains why, in the second paragraph of the next chapter, she says to Alice, ""I'm older than you, and must know better""). Edith Liddell is the Eaglet. It is amusing to note that when his biography entered the Encyclopaedia Britannica it was inserted just before the entry on the Dodo. The individuals in this ""queer-looking party"" represent the participants in an episode entered in Carroll's diary on June 17, 1862. Carroll took his sisters, Fanny and Elizabeth, and his Aunt Lucy Lutwidge (the ""other curious creatures""?) on a boating expedition, along with the Reverend Duckworth and the three Liddell girls. June 17 (Tu). Expedition to Nuneham. Duckworth (of Trinity) and Ina, Alice and Edith came with us. We set out about 12.30 and got to Nuneham about 2: dined there, then walked in the park and set off for home about 4.30. About a mile above Nuneham heavy rain came on, and after bearing it a short time I settled that we had better leave the boat and walk: three miles of this drenched us all pretty well. I went on first with the children, as they could walk much faster than Elizabeth, and took them to the only house I knew in Sandford, Mrs. Broughton's, where Ranken lodges. I left them with her to get their clothes dried, and went off to find a vehicle, but none was to be had there, so on the others arriving, Duckworth and I walked on to Iffley, whence we sent them a fly. In the original manuscript, Alice's Adventures Under Ground, a number of details appear relating to this experience that Carroll later deleted because he thought they would have little interest to anyone outside the circle of individuals involved. When the facsimile edition of the manuscript was published in 1886, Duckworth received a copy inscribed, ""The Duck from the Dodo."" There have been various theories about whom the Mad Hatter might be based on. From The Annotated Alice (emphasis mine): There is good reason to believe that Tenniel adopted a suggestion of Carroll's that he draw the Hatter to resemble one Theophilus Carter, a furniture dealer near Oxford (and no grounds whatever for the widespread belief at the time that the Hatter was a burlesque of Prime Minister Gladstone). Carter was known in the area as the Mad Hatter, partly
  because he always wore a top hat and partly because of his eccentric ideas. His invention of an ""alarm clock bed"" that woke the sleeper by tossing him out on the floor (it was exhibited at the Crystal Palace in 1851) may help explain why Carroll's Hatter is so concerned with time as well as with arousing a sleepy dormouse. One notes also that items of furniture—table, armchair, writing desk—are prominent in this episode. [...] ""It is impossible to describe Bertrand Russell,"" writes Norbert Wiener in Chapter 14 of his autobiography Ex-Prodigy, ""except by saying that he looks like the Mad Hatter . . . the caricature of Tenniel almost argues an anticipation on the part of the artist."" Wiener goes on to point out the likenesses of philosophers J. M. E. McTaggart and G. E. Moore, two of Russell's fellow dons at Cambridge, to the Dormouse and March Hare respectively. The three men were known in the community as the Mad Tea Party of Trinity. Ellis Hillman, writing on ""Who Was the Mad Hatter?"" in Jabberwocky (Winter 1973), provides a new candidate: Samuel Ogden, a Manchester hatter known as ""Mad Sam,"" who in 1814 designed a special hat for the czar of Russia when he visited London. Hillman also conjectures that ""Mad Hatter,"" if the H is dropped, sounds like ""Mad Adder."" This, he writes, could be taken as describing a mathematician, such as Carroll himself, or perhaps Charles Babbage, a Cambridge mathematician widely regarded as slightly mad in his efforts to build a complicated mechanical calculating machine. However, I don't think any of these theories sound especially convincing. The first one, in particular, has been refuted by Stuart Dodgson Collingwood in his book The Life And Letters of Lewis Carroll, in which he claims that there is no evidence Carroll ever invited Tenniel to Oxford for any reason. This may not really count since it's a story within a story, but the Dormouse's ""three little girls"" are again based on the Liddell sisters. From the original text (Chapter VII): ""Once upon a time there were three little sisters,"" the Dormouse began in a great hurry; ""and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie;11 and they lived at the bottom of a well—"" From The Annotated Alice (emphasis mine): The three little sisters are the three Liddell sisters. Elsie is L.C. (Lorina Charlotte), Tillie refers to Edith's family nickname Matilda, and Lacie is an anagram of Alice. The Drawling-Master referred to by the Mock Turtle is based on Alice Liddell's drawing-master John Ruskin. From the original text (Chapter IX): ""Well, there was Mystery,"" the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers,—""Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: he taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils."" From The Annotated Alice (emphasis mine): The ""Drawling-master"" who came once a week to teach ""Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils"" is a reference to none other than the art critic John Ruskin. Ruskin came once a week to the Liddell home to teach drawing, sketching, and painting in oils to the children."
"What was Dr. Seuss's intended message in ""Horton Hears a Who""?","The reason he wrote it is very interesting.  He thought of the ""person's a person, no matter how small"" from his experiences in post-war Japan.  He had drawn anti-Japanese cartoons during the war, and he realizes this: [from an interview here] Well, Japan was just emerging, the people were voting for the first time, running their own lives—and the theme was obvious: “A person’s a person no matter how small,” though I don’t know how I ended up using elephants. And of course when the little boy stands up and yells “Yop!” and saves the whole place, that’s my statement about voting—everyone counts. It’s all left over from my war experience, when I was making propaganda and indoctrination films. One of them was to encourage soldiers to vote. So the entire thing is an allegory for post-war Japan.  The kangaroos, therefore, represents Americans and the Whos are the Japanese.  The slogan ""a person's a person, no matter how small"" is really what Seuss is trying to get at. On the other hand, he also said this on the same site: Parenting: Do you use propagandistic skills in your books? Seuss: of course. However, most of my books don’t carry heavy morals. The morals sneak in, as they do in all drama."
Is there really a bawdy pun at the conclusion of Romeo and Juliet?,"Shakespeare was by no means averse to sexual puns, euphemisms and allusions. In fact Shakespeare's Bawdy by Eric Partridge is a classic of Shakespeare scholarship entirely dedicated to this sort of language. Interestingly, the glossary section in Partridge's book doesn't have entries for ""dagger"" or ""sheath"". The Romeo and Juliet editions by T. J. B. Spencer (New Penguin Shakespeare, 1967, revised 1996) and G. Blakemore Evans (New Cambridge Shakespeare, 1984) do not mention double meanings of ""dagger"" and ""sheath"" in their glosses of the passage, but that does not conclude the matter. There is debate on whether the verb should be ""rust"" (as in the 1599 Second Quarto and the 1623 First Folio) or ""rest"" (as in the 1597 First Quarto): O happy dagger thou shalt end my feare,
Rest in my bosome, thus I come to thee. The First Quarto is of such poor quality that it is not used as the starting point of modern editions but some still prefer ""rest"" of ""rust"". Blakemore Evans describes ""rest"" as ""a blander and easier reading"" (page 189), but an additional note on this point (page 207) adds, (…) The objection that a dagger 'rests', not 'rusts', in its sheath (…) is beside the point considering the nature of the present 'sheath'. Gibbons suggests a kind of phallic fulfilment in Juliet's action, completing 'the motif of Death as rival to Romeo, Death lies with Juliet'. Jill L. Levinson notes in the Oxford edition (page 349) that, the dagger in its spoken and material forms has most impact as part of the sexual wordplay in Juliet's last lines. None of the editors cited above mention whether pre-Freudian theatre goers would have picked up the sexual allusions in ""dagger"" and ""sheath"". They also don't mention when commentators first started interpreting Juliet's last words as sexual allusions, which is a question that may be worth investigating in its own right. However, the verb ""die"" in the sense of ""to experience sexual orgasm"" (E. Partridge: Shakespeare's Bawdy, page 93) occurs elsewhere in Shakespeare. For example in Much Ado About Nothing, Act 5, scene 2: I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be
buried in thy eyes; (…) And even in King Lear, Act 4, scene 6 (at least according to Partridge): I will die bravely, like a bridegroom. The above comments on ""dagger"", ""sheath"" and ""die"" provide arguments in favour of the presence of an erotic allusion, but this does not imply that this is intended humorously. With regard to the dictionary where someone wrote ""vagina"" next to ""sheath"": Wiktionary points out that ""vagina"" is etymologically a Learned borrowing from Latin vāgīna (“a sheath, scabbard; a covering, sheath, holder”). Native speakers of Dutch will also know that schede can be used for both ""sheath"" and ""vagina"". The same is true for the German word Scheide. Gefundenes Fressen for Freudian translators."
Does Jasper Fforde intend a sequel to Shades of Grey?,"Yes, more books are planned, but whether any and if so how many will actually be written seems to be unclear at this point.  The probably most up-to-date thing I can find from the author at the moment is a short note on his website about a prequel for next year: 2018: USA/UK Publication of Shades of Grey Prequel: 7 Things to do before you die in Talgarth  But according to this reddit thread this release date has been pushed back a couple of times from 2015 already. Furthermore, it seems that some early editions of the book included titles for two sequels: He plans two more books: it says in my copy that Brunswick & deMauve will return in: However, the release for Painting by Numbers has been pushed back several times. Originally, it was supposed to be released in 2013 according to the linked thread on SFF chronicles, but there is currently no official planned release date. Fforde explained this delay in an AMA in 2014: I was immensely proud of 'SoG' and had high hopes for it, but initial sales were tepid, despite generous reviews, hence the lack of a sequel. This comment also contains some information about the prequel (in spoilers, in case you don't want to know until it's out):  A prequel to 'Shades of Grey' that is essentially a standalone set in the Shades of Grey world, two weeks before the Something that Happened, referred to in Shades of Grey. Jane and Eddie won't be born for another seven hundred years, but there's still a lot of fun to be had. Then in May 2016, Fforde replied to a comment on The Guardian saying I like this book, but it has had disappointingly low sales - although things are picking up now. I'm planning on writing a sequel as the bokk [sic] after the book after the book I'm working on now, so maybe 2019. Looking at the current timeline he may also have been talking about the prequel again, but there's no way to tell for sure. This is the latest update from him I can find (apart from his website), so I'm afraid you'll still have to wait it out and see whether anything will actually be released over the next years."
"Explanation of the line 'But you don't really care for music, do you' in ""Hallelujah""","The song has many verses, some of which varied in different performances. Even sticking to the ""canonical"" verses used in the Jeff Buckley version, however, there's demonstrably no one consistent ""you"" being referred to between verses.  This can be shown by the fact that the ""you"" in the second verse seems to be a composite of Sampson and King David himself, whereas the first verse refers to David in the third person. Given that, the answer is ambiguous, but the most natural reading to me is to assume the first, third, fourth (and arguably the fifth) verses are all directed to the narrator's lover, who seems to be a somewhat distanced and indifferent figure (with the second verse taking a detour to directly address the subject of the first).  The narrator seems to idolize [her], with the first and fourth verses somewhat blasphemously conflating her with God.  Under that reading, we can picture the narrator (Cohen?), a songwriter writing a song for his girlfriend.  He pictures himself charming her with his song, like King David pleased the Lord with a ""secret chord.""  But he know that in real life, she's not even a fan of his music, or really any music.  There's no secret key to her heart, or at least, not one that he knows (compare the similar themes in Frank Ocean's Songs For Women, which directly references this line). EDIT: This source indicates that all the best-known verses come from two separate recordings by Cohen, a 1984 version with more religious imagery, and a 1988 version more focused on the relationship with a lover.  The Buckley version includes verses from both, although not the single verse shared between versions.  It's only the second verse from the first version, however, that clearly addresses someone other than the narrator's lover."
What is the meaning of the epilogue in Blood Meridian?,"More than likely the tool the man was using was a post hole digger. I'm speculating but I've used one and I can't think of what else it could be. He was probably digging post holes for a fence. When you strike rock with the blades of the digger it creates a spark. Barbed wire fencing fundamentally changed and tamed the ""wild west"" and the North American prairie. Once fences were erected it was no longer open range. It was the end of the huge cattle drives from Texas to the northern prairies, the end of free roaming buffalo, the end of the cowboy and the end of the frontier itself. A great book on the subject is Cattle Kingdom: The Hidden History of the Cowboy West by Christopher Knowlton. I've also read books about mountain men and pioneers which discuss the subject. Many of Larry McMurtry's books also attempt to demythologize our idea of the cowboy.  In All the Pretty Horses, Mccarthy wrote, ""What is constant in history is greed and foolishness and the love of blood."" Evil and ""prophets of destruction"" are common in McCarthy's novels - e.g. Judge Holden, Anton Chigurh, cannibal gangs in The Road. One of the morals I've gleaned from McCarthy's books is to never underestimate evil. There are ""true and living prophets of destruction"" in the world and they are not to be trifled with. Usually the characters in his novels meet a violent end when they allow greed or vengeance take them down a path of no return - and there is only one path in our lives and we can never return on it or start over. In No Country for Old Men, Llewellyn Moss says, ""Your notions about startin over. You don't start over... Ever step you take is forever. You can't make it go away. None of it."" Later in that same book Anton Chigurh says, ""The prospect of outsized profits leads people to exaggerate their own capabilities. In their minds. They pretend to themselves that they are in control of events where perhaps they are not. And it is always one's stance upon uncertain ground that invites the attentions of one's enemies. Or discourages it.""
Be careful what you wish for and how you seek it. Do not assume you can dip your toe in evil and not be consumed by it.  Mccarthy is so dark... and so good!"
Where is the start of Treasure Island set?,"TL;DR: The opening chapters of Treasure Island make it clear that the ""Admiral Benbow"" must be within a few miles of Lynmouth in Devon. Stevenson wrote a detailed account of the writing of Treasure Island. Although this does not mention the ""Admiral Benbow"" or its location, it does include the passage: … how troublesome the moon is! I have come to grief over the moon in Prince Otto,* and so soon as that was pointed out to me, adopted a precaution which I recommend to other men—I never write now without an almanack. With an almanack, and the map of the country, and the plan of every house, either actually plotted on paper or already and immediately apprehended in the mind, a man may hope to avoid some of the grossest possible blunders. With the map before him, he will scarce allow the sun to set in the east, as it does in The Antiquary. With the almanack at hand, he will scarce allow two horsemen, journeying on the most urgent affair, to employ six days, from three of the Monday morning till late in the Saturday night, upon a journey of, say, ninety or a hundred miles, and before the week is out, and still on the same nags, to cover fifty in one day, as may be read at length in the inimitable novel of Rob Roy. Although Prince Otto (1885) postdates Treasure Island (1883), nonetheless the passage shows that (unlike Sir Walter Scott) Stevenson cared about geographic accuracy and detail, and so he may have had in mind a specific location for the ""Admiral Benbow"", and we might be able to deduce it if we pay close attention to the text. The ""Admiral Benbow"" is somewhere on the coast of England where the topography consists of small coves backed with cliffs. Chapter 1: When it [the rum] was brought to him [Billy Bones], he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste, and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard. ""This is a handy cove,"" says he, at length; ""and a pleasant sittyated grog-shop. Much company, mate?"" Chapter 4: The hamlet lay not many hundred yards away, though out of view, on the other side of the next cove In the winter, sunlight can be seen reflecting from the sea before it shines into the cove, hence the cove faces west, north-west, or north. Chapter 2: It was one January morning, very early—a pinching, frosty morning—the cove all gray with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping softly on the stones, the sun still low, and only touching the hill-tops and shining far to seaward. A coast road to Bristol passes the inn. Chapter 1: When a seaman put up at the ""Admiral Benbow"" (as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol) To reach Bristol requires an overnight journey by stage-coach. Chapter 7: Next moment we had turned the corner, and my home was out of sight. The mail picked us up about dusk at the ""Royal George"" on the heath. I was wedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman, and in spite of the swift motion and the cold night air, I must have dozed a great deal from the very first, and then slept like a log up hill and down dale, through stage after stage; for when I was awakened at last, it was by a punch in the ribs, and I opened my eyes to find that we were standing still before a large building in a city street, and that the day had already broken a long time. ""Where are we?"" I asked. ""Bristol,"" said Tom. ""Get down."" How long would this journey have been? Wikipedia says: The stagecoach traveled at an average speed of about five miles per hour, with the total daily mileage covered being around 60 or 70 miles. A look at a map of southwest England shows that the only places meeting all the requirements are in north Devon. Lynmouth fits the bill perfectly: it has a north-facing cove, cliffs, a coast road, and it's 75 miles from Bristol. Too far east of Lynmouth and you lose the cliffs; too far west and you lose the coast road and can't reach Bristol overnight. Charles Stephen Brooks agrees with my analysis in English Spring (1930): Countisbury Headland juts into the Channel just up the coast from Lynmouth. Its huge curve might be the back of some great creature escaped from chaos. It is a long climb and it is steep. The road is cut against the headlands and has an unobstructed view. Lundy's Isle, far out at sea, marks the entrance of the Channel. A northern smudge of land is Wales. There is smoke of frequent ships. If one follows the Countisbury Hill a few miles farther towards Porlock and peers down into each hollow of the rocky shore many hundred feet below, he will presently see the very scar and beach where Stevenson placed the Admiral Benbow Inn of his Treasure Island—the very path on which Blind Pew came tapping in the night. It is a chapter so exciting that one shudders even in daylight on the safe road above. Few books have had their origins so carefully recorded as has Treasure Island. We know that its genesis was a wholly fictitious map that Stevenson once drew. We are informed of the story's progress from day to day until at last the sheets went off to London to be printed. But Stevenson never gave a precise location to the Admiral Benbow Inn, nor told where he got the couplet of verses that was bellowed so often by old Bill Bones. * If you're wonder how Stevenson came to grief over the moon in Prince Otto, here's the passage from chapter 9: Thence he proceeded alone to where, in a round clearing, a copy of Gian Bologna’s Mercury stood tiptoe in the twilight of the stars. The night was warm and windless. A shaving of new moon had lately arisen; but it was still too small and too low down in heaven to contend with the immense host of lesser luminaries; and the rough face of the earth was drenched with starlight. In the evening twilight, a new moon should be setting, not rising."
Why does Portia say this to Bassanio in Act III Scene 2 of The Merchant of Venice?,"First of all, let's take a look at the wider context around this line: Beshrew your eyes,
  They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;
  One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
  Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
  And so all yours. O, these naughty times
  Put bars between the owners and their rights!
  And so, though yours, not yours. -- The Merchant of Venice, Act 3, Scene 2, Lines 14-20 She's already talking about being divided before she starts on the ""one half yours"" thing. I'm not completely sure what she means by being overlooked and divided, but presumably it's a reference to the way her father's will allows her only to marry a man who chooses the right casket. Thus, if she fell in love with anyone who didn't choose correctly, she would be divided between love and duty. Thus, the concept of her being divided is already on the table, hence this particular roundabout way of ""saying without saying"" that she has feelings for him. But why does she say it in such a roundabout way at all? Because she doesn't want to admit that she loves him. At this point, he hasn't ""won"" her yet by passing the Trial by Casket, so in some sense she isn't ""allowed"" to love him. Earlier on she says (lines 4-6, emphasis mine): There's something tells me, but it is not love,
  I would not lose you; and you know yourself,
  Hate counsels not in such a quality. She's denying, perhaps even to herself, that she loves him. She dares not admit it at this stage, for fear of having her heart broken if he chooses wrongly. Thus the convoluted and obfuscated language. (Also, as someone mentioned in comments, it wouldn't be Shakespeare without some nice flowery verbiage!)"
Did Homer base the Iliad and the Odyssey on mythology?,"I'm going to start with a minor framing correction, before I go on to actually answer your question. The Iliad and The Odyssey aren't texts written by Homer. They're actually oral traditions. It's even debatable whether anyone named ""Homer"" even existed at all, but if they did, certainly all they did was transcribe a purely verbal story that was passed down for generations. So, the major correction to your question is: The Iliad and The Odyssey are a part of Greek mythology. They didn't arise from Greek mythology (any more than mythology arises from itself), because in oral tradition mythology, story and history quickly blend together. Stories like these may have traced real events, but they were educational tools about good manners, how to treat guests, marks of cultural significance, and just generally how the gods affect peoples' lives. These stories get told and re-told; they accrue variations, adopt easily memorizable rhythms, and underwent significant changes as time went on. So, I'm going to go out on a limb and rephrase your question for you: did The Iliad and The Odyssey develop around historical events? This question is actually more directly answerable. Note, though, that it implies that you have to take any historical basis with a grain of salt. Remember that these are oral traditions; just because they once told stories that happened doesn't necessarily mean they still do. In the case of the Iliad, the story as written is removed from its transcription by roughly four centuries. However, it does appear to have alluded to some real events and places, which means that it might actually have a historical basis. The city of Troy did exist, and the geography described matches the region. It likely corresponds to modern-day Hisarlik. ""The Trojans and Their Neighbors"" delves into this topic further, drawing parallels between story elements that appeared in the Iliad and descriptions of peoples and cultures that appeared in the area. Additionally, it seems that helmets described in the Iliad were in use at the time. However, there isn't enough evidence to draw the conclusion that the Trojan War happened as described in our transcription of events. There is barely enough to conclude that a real people were described. The Odyssey is a little more up in the air. Most of the Odyssey is spent describing events which could not possibly have happened in our non-mythic consciousness understanding of the world. However, we can plausibly map where an Odysseus might have gone. Additionally, some archaeologists believe we have found Odysseus' palace on Ithaca. There's also a lot more evidence littered around in various places in the Odyssey - for example, it's believed that a solar eclipse is described in the Odyssey, which could possibly be used to date the events. So, did the journey happen as written? Definitely not. But was there a person named Odysseus who left the Trojan War and returned to Ithaca? Honestly, it's quite possible. But one of the sources I found puts it best: Why should we think that anything Homer wrote was historically accurate? It is mainly because he wrote about things of which he could not have had first-hand knowledge, but of which we have archaeological knowledge. Why should we think that the story is not totally accurate? Because we know at least of anachronisms, of things described that did exist as he described, but not at the time of which he writes. This is a broad topic, and this post only scratches the surface of it. Hopefully I've given you both reason to consider that certain elements may be true, but don't take the historicity of the story with anything more than a grain of salt."
An imaginary young British poet who was invented as a literary hoax in the 1920s?,"As Ralph Crown comments above, is it possible you're thinking of Ern Malley? Ernest Lalor ""Ern"" Malley was a fictitious poet and the central figure in Australia's most famous literary hoax. He and his entire body of work were created in one day in 1943 by conservative writers James McAuley and Harold Stewart in order to hoax Max Harris and his modernist magazine Angry Penguins, which Harris co-edited with John Reed of Heide, Melbourne. Imitating the modernist poetry they despised, the hoaxers deliberately created what they thought was bad verse and submitted sixteen poems to Angry Penguins under the guise of Ethel, Ern Malley's surviving sister. Harris and other members of the Heide Circle fell for the hoax, and, enraptured by the poetry, devoted the next issue of Angry Penguins to Malley. The hoax was revealed soon after, resulting in a cause célèbre and the humiliation of Harris, who was put on trial, convicted and fined for publishing the poems on the grounds that they contained obscene content. Angry Penguins folded in 1946. McAuley and Steward were Australian, not from the U.K., and there was no party involved, and it's a bit later in history (1940s, not 1920s), but the rest seems to match. All seventeen poems were written in a single afternoon. There was not, as far as I can tell, any commentary on the analysis of development. In fact, the whole thing was found out in the week of publication. The preface biography: According to his inventors' fictitious biography, Ernest Lalor Malley was born in Liverpool, England, on 14 March 1918. His father died in 1920, and Malley's mother migrated to Petersham, a suburb of Sydney, Australia, with her two children: Ern, and his older sister Ethel. After his mother's death in August 1933, Ern Malley left school to work as an auto mechanic. Shortly after his seventeenth birthday, he then moved to Melbourne where he lived alone and worked as an insurance salesman, and later as a watch repairman. Diagnosed with Graves' disease sometime in the early 1940s, Malley refused treatment. He returned to Sydney, moving in with his sister in March, 1943, where he became increasingly ill (as well as temperamental and difficult) until his death at the age of 25 on 23 July of that same year. Malley's life as a poet became known only after his sister Ethel (another fictitious creation of McAuley and Stewart) found a pile of unpublished poems among his belongings. These poems featured a brief preface, which explained that they had been composed over a period of five years, but it left no instructions as to what was to be done with them. Ethel Malley supposedly knew nothing about poetry, but showed the poems to a friend, who suggested that she send the poems to someone who could examine them. Max Harris of Angry Penguins was to be that someone."
"Symbolism of ""hot gammon"" in T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land","In the paper ""Gloss on 'Gammon' in The Waste Land, II, Line 166"" (available on JSTOR), Sukhbir Singh points out that the word gammon has two meanings. Gammon can refer to a type of food, specifically the cured hind leg of a hog. But gammon is also a verb meaning ""to make pretense"" or to say deceitful things. On a very basic level, the use of the word gammon is a pun referring to both the dinner and the implied affair.  The pun goes a bit further. Gammon was thought to be an aphrodisiac, so the word gammon is yet another reference to sex. And Eliot refers to sexuality again by describing the gammon as ""hot""; hot refers to sexual desire.  These two lines make a comparison sexual desire and hunger for food. Singh makes the argument that this comparison supports the theme in The Waste Land of humanity's degeneration. If you want to learn more about that, I would encourage you to check out Singh's paper."
"Should I read the English translation of ""Khasākkinte Ithihāsam"" first, or the original?","Read the Malayalam original first. Whatever your aim in reading the English translation, you will achieve it more readily by having the knowledge of the original in mind.  As the quote you have provided from P P Ravindran says, the two works are far enough in Vijayan's career as to belong to completely different stages in the development of his sensibility. So if you are interested in understanding how Vijayan's outlook and craft changed over the years, then it makes sense to start with the earlier version and move to the later.  If on the other hand you are interested in seeing how Vijayan adapts the same story to different audiences (Malayali vs. global, regional vs. cosmopolitan, insider vs. outsider, or however you want to frame the difference), again it makes sense to start with the original and then go through the translation with an eye out for the changes.  Even if you are interested only in seeing how The Legends of Khasak fits within the tradition of Indian novels in English, knowing what the original is like will deepen your understanding of how English writing in India works when compared to the vernacular traditions.  The Malayalam version can augment your understanding of the English in all these ways;  broadly similar arguments can be made for any other goals you have in mind for reading the English version. The converse is not true. The only way that the English version will help your understanding of the Malayalam one is if it lowers some language barrier. But you've already indicated that you are equally competent in both languages, so that's not an issue.  Note: I said understanding, not appreciation. It is certainly true that juxtaposing the two versions will lead to an enhanced appreciation of both; for this reason (and many unrelated ones) your fluency in both languages is enviable. But reading the English one first won't help you trace Vijayan's development, or see how a different audience requires changes, or judge how Indian novels in English fit into the entirety of the literary traditions of the subcontinent, etc. And it would be awkward to get those insights retrospectively, by reverse-engineering them as it were while reading the Malayalam original afterwards.  If the Malayalam version had been merely an early draft that didn't stand on its own and was interesting only insofar as it was the origin of a more complete and successful English novel, then there would be no point reading it first; its value would depend solely on the later work. But given that it has its own identity and is practically a different novel altogether, reading the two texts in chronological order makes sense. "
Has The Danish Girl novel been banned in any countries?,"I'm pretty sure the answer is No. From checking the internet, it seems that the film was but the book wasn't.  Some sources that might help: Ctrl - F 'danish' comes up with nothing on any of these. As for whether or not the novel was less controversial, I don't think that even if it wasn't it would have been banned. Books are less likely to be banned. As long as they aren't religious in religion sensitive countries, then very few books are banned. There are probably quite a few transgender books, but a film is different from a book. A film is a visual and some countries may not want these images shown, but very few countries will ban (non-religious) books, because with writing you can imagine it, whereas a film you are given the images."
"Why don't people in the Chronicles of Narnia have trouble ""transitioning"" back to their old life after extended times in other worlds?","Related: Why did people appear to remember what was going on at the time they left England when they returned from Narnia? The books aren't very explicit on this point, so here are a few possibilities. While they're in one world, the world that they just left has a ""dreamlike quality"" - there was some sense in which Narnia was like an extended dream while they were in England (and vice versa for England while they were in Narnia). This would explain why, for example, they seem to have remembered details about what was going on when they left England when they returned. They evidently didn't remember the lamp-post until after they got back to England (prior to getting back to England, they only had a vague recollection of having seen it before), and they didn't seem all that disoriented when they got back to England. They appear to have remembered where they were and why they were there. (They even remembered to apologize to the Professor for losing some of his coats). This is much like you remember your whereabouts when you wake up from a dream. The world itself seems to have a good deal of influence on the characters' behavior, thought patterns, and even skills. It will often take hours or days in Narnia for characters to regain all of the skills that they had gained last time they were there. This suggests the possibility that, when they return to England, they don't really retain all of their adult-like traits or skills, which would seem to make it easier for them to transition back. The books actually don't describe much about their lives outside Narnia. In fact, in most cases, the books spend only as much time in England as is required to set up the story. (An obvious counterexample, though, is when Caspian and Aslan go to England briefly, but even then they're clearly ""out of context"" - that's fundamentally Narnians setting something about our world right, not just a story about England). After all, the books are the Chronicles of Narnia, not the chronicles of the characters' lives in England - the books are fundamentally about Narnia. One could argue that, in one sense, they're even more about Narnia than they are about the characters themselves - i.e. the books are fundamentally ""about"" things that certain people did in Narnia, not merely about those particular characters. It's quite possible that this is a genuine plot hole, and that C. S. Lewis either didn't think of it or didn't think that it was important enough to the stories to address. (The latter point could be related to the previous point - i.e. it's not important because the books aren't about the characters' actions outside of Narnia)."
What does this quote from The Great Gatsby mean?,"You should first ask who cares ""in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart!"" Who could the narrator know cares? The only person the narrator could know this about is the narrator himself. And if the narrator is talking about himself, it's a rhetorical statement; he is really reminding himself that he shouldn't be attracted to the conductor. If we accept this interpretation, it's a subtle signal that Nick Carraway is gay or bisexual. There are other signals of this in the book, some less subtle. See this essay: Gay Implications in The Great Gatsby's Nick Carraway. At the time that Fitzgerald wrote, it was difficult or impossible to get a novel published if it discussed homosexuality in more direct terms, so clues like this were the only way to convey this information to the reader."
What was supposedly satanic about the Lord of the Rings?,"I do not find JRRT's stories particularly Christian, but I do really enjoy them. Having been exposed to some radical fundamentalists any mention of Magic is an aspect of demons at work to deceive. From Bible Baptists Publications, Wizards, Witches, and the Word of God: “Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.”  (Rev. 9:21)  “And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.” (Rev. 18:23)  The above scripture comes from the book of Revelation, the final book of God’s word, which deals with the end-time.  One might expect murder, fornication, and theft to be widespread sins in the last days because we see a continual increase of these sins with every passing year.  But notice that a fourth sin is mentioned as well: sorcery.  According to God’s word, we can expect to see an increase in sorcery as the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ draws near. According to Webster, the word “sorcery” means “magic; enchantment; witchcraft; divination by the assistance or the supposed assistance of evil spirits, or the power of commanding evil spirits.” One does not have to look very far to see that God’s word is being fulfilled before our very eyes.  Along with numerous other Biblical signs that our Lord’s return is near, we are also witnessing a tremendous increase in occultism.  Much of this is obviously due to the way many books, movies, and television programs are glamorizing such evil practices as witchcraft and wizardry.  God’s word clearly condemns all such practices, yet millions of >people, especially young people, are being led to believe that it is possible to be a good witch or a good wizard.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Satan is playing a very nasty trick on our children. From Eric Barger, Lord of the Rings: Christian or Cultic? ...
  Tolkien (and Lewis) created their stories in a day when the occult was not the norm, when there was NOT a mass proliferation of occult philosophy and practice and when the majority of the church had little or no understanding of such things. This does not justify the “white vs. black” magick scenarios in their works, but could serve to explain it. In my mind, this is another very important reason that Rings and other works of its kind are off limits in our day. Then came the 1960’s and the great outpouring of evil activity that led us to the drug culture, the sexual revolution, and the blurring of truth in general. Evolution, abortion and nihilism replaced God, life and hope. Along with this cultural shift came an insatiable demonically induced hunger to experience the paranormal.
  ... and ...
  If the mind lives for any substantial amount of time in the fantasy realm of the occult, sorcery and witchcraft, there is certainly a possibility that when facing the same occultism in real life that our human response will not be one that immediately opposes it. It is obvious that rather than rejecting the occult, what is happening is that entire generations are increasingly reacting in a positive fashion to its practices and practitioners. Smaller, yet more tragic are the numbers from this group who are not just favorably reading about Satan’s playground of sorcery and spells but are instead desirous to actually participate in it! Our response as Christians is to understand that the occult – the same practices promoted by Tolkien’s heroes – is repulsive in the site of God. He condemns such in no uncertain terms with the use of the word “abomination” three times in Deuteronomy 18:9-12. The Hebrew word here is the strongest condemnatory language used in the entire Bible on any issue! Dare we react in any other way? We had better call evil “evil” and never confuse it for “good.”

"Interpreting the line ""'O keep the Dog far hence, that's friend to men"" in The Waste Land","First, I'd like to step back from this stanza a bit and look at an earlier one: What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
  Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,
  You cannot say, or guess, for you know only
  A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,
  And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,
  And the dry stone no sound of water. Only
  There is shadow under this red rock,
  (Come in under the shadow of this red rock),
  And I will show you something different from either
  Your shadow at morning striding behind you
  Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;
  I will show you fear in a handful of dust. In my answer here I interpret the meaning of the broken images in this passage as referencing the memories someone has.  With this interpretation, I read That corpse you planted last year in your garden, 
  Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year? 
  Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?  As asking if the life, and the memories left from it, have had an impact on people and have lead to a new growth yet. So we now arrive at your passage: Oh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men,
  Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again! First, I'd like to point out that Dog is capitalized, which makes me think this isn't just an ordinary dog, but a represenation of something/someone else. Looking at my earlier interpretation of this growth from the dead as the impact of the memories, my first thought for what the Dog could be representing is a critic. The critic appears to be a friend to men - many read what they say and consider it - but in reality, they can be enemies, which explains the connection with Webster's The White Devil. Further, the next line is You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!"" Which Google Translate gives as  You! Hypocrite reader!-my similar,-my brother!"" Which I think also points towards critics. ""Hypocrite reader"" - it's a common phrase that ""those who can't do, critique"" - and so critics can be seen as hypocrites, who examine something and point out all the flaws, when they themselves have many flaws and haven't created something nearly as good. As for ""my similar"" - most of us by nature critique - it's normal to notice the flaws before the perfections. So the passage is saying, keep the critics far away - else they'll dig up what's left of the person and their memories and doings and destroy the things that are growing from their work. As Peter Shor kindly pointed out, the line is actually from Au Lecteur, another poem. The last section of the poem translates as In the infamous menagerie of our vices,
  There is one more ugly, more wicked, more filthy!
  Though he does not utter great gestures or cries,
  He would gladly make earth a debris
  And in a yawn would swallow the world;
  It's Boredom! The eye loaded with an involuntary cry,
  He dreams of scaffolding by smoking his houka.
  You know him, reader, this delicate monster,
  - Hypocrite reader!-my similar,-my brother! So in fact the line is referring to boredom, not critics, but I think the two are still connected. The earlier parts of the poem refer to people's vices: Our sins are stubborn, our repentance is cowardly;
  We make ourselves pay our admissions,
  And we go cheerfully back into the muddy path,
  Believing by vile tears to wash all our spots. So by including the line, Eliot is referring to people's vices, one of which is criticizing others, being hypocritical. Thus, the interpretation still fits. "
How could Thorin and co. journey all the way to Erebor without discussing how to deal with Smaug?,"Partly: it's explored in the first chapter then hand-waved away. This ""plot hole"" is in fact the driver of the entire plot of The Hobbit: the reason why a hobbit is involved at all. ""That would be no good,"" said the wizard, ""not without a mighty Warrior, even a Hero. I tried to find one; but warriors are busy fighting one another in distant lands, and in this neighbourhood heroes are scarce, or simply lot to be found. Swords in these parts are mostly blunt, and axes are used for trees, and shields as cradles or dish-covers; and dragons are comfortably far-off (and therefore legendary). That is why I settled on burglary-especially when I remembered the existence of a Side-door. And here is our little Bilbo Baggins, the burglar, the chosen and selected burglar. So now let's get on and make some plans. "" So Gandalf has given some thought to the idea of fighting the Dragon and has decided that, as you say, the company of 14 is not enough to defeat Smaug. Instead, he reasons that knowledge of the side-door and a small and crafty hobbit will be enough to get into the mountain, explore its secrets and hopefully escape with some treasure. Bilbo summarises it well: ""Well, I should say that you ought to go East and have a look round. After all there is the Side-door, and dragons must sleep sometimes, I suppose. If you sit on the doorstep long enough, I daresay you will think of something. At this point, Thorin mentions the obvious problem: ""Before we go, I suppose you mean,"" said Thorin. ""Aren't you the burglar? And isn't sitting on the door-step your job, not to speak of getting inside the door? And then the conversation is derailed by talk of breakfast and not bought up again. So although it's clear that the company is not meant to fight Smaug, quite how the burglary is supposed to proceed and what it is hoped to accomplish is quietly hand-waved away. It's worth mentioning that this kind of plot-stretch is not uncommon in children's books, which is what The Hobbit is supposed to be. In the modern lens, due to its connection with The Lord of the Rings, readers tend to treat it more seriously. But children are more credulous than adult readers, and will just enjoy the adventure without worrying about plot holes."
Were schoolteachers really paid substantially less than $45 per month in 1990s Ukraine?,"As the OP's quote says, Ukraine's economy in the 1990s was indeed ""wretched"": Ukraine’s economy contracted annually between 9.7 and 22.7 percent in
1991–1996. The country experienced hyperinflation and an exceptionally
huge production decline...
Official GDP collapsed by almost half from 1990 to 1994, and slow
decline continued throughout the decade. (Pekka Sutela, The Underachiever: Ukraine's Economy Since 1991) Against this background, it is not surprising that the salary of government employees like teachers was extremely low. In Problems and Prospects in European Education it is noted specifically that: In Ukraine, in September 1994, the monthly wage of the teacher was
equivalent to ten dollars. This is corroborated by a news report from UPI from December 1994, covering a teachers' strike. The current average salary of a Ukrainian teacher is just over 1
million karbovantz, about $10, and a big chunk of this is eaten up by
taxes."

What suggests Edmund might be gay?,"As someone who rather likes the totally non-canonical idea of gay Edmund, there is really no textual evidence to support this idea and you are right to point out that it is extremely unlikely that Lewis intended the character to be gay. There's not even much of what most people would consider obvious gay subtext. We don't see Edmund longingly describe the appearance or other attributes of other male characters, for example. We don't see him form the kind of extremely close male friendship that seems to border on romantic that you sometimes see in other works. We don't really see other characters describe him in ways that are coded gay.  All that being said, the person in the linked article isn't the first to come up with the idea of gay Edmund. A quick look at Narnia's M/M category over on the popular fan fiction site, An Archive Of Our Own reveals that Edmund is the character most listed in male/male pairings section despite the fact that both Peter and Caspian are played by older, arguably more attractive actors in the movies. Caspian/Edmund is the most popular male/male romantic pairing.  So why do many fans see Edmund, in particular, as gay but not, say, Peter or Lucy? What you have to realize about the way that many LGBT people read or view fiction is that they sometimes connect aspects of a particular character's journey or arc to their own journey or struggles with queerness.  One rather prominent example of this is the character Elsa from the Disney movie Frozen. A lot of LGBT people read Elsa as gay, not because she pines after women, explicitly or otherwise, but because her character arc shares much in common with the type of struggles that LGBT people face. Elsa is forced by her parents to keep her powers hidden, ""conceal, don't feel."" This causes her to feel alienated from her community and family, even from her sister who loves her no matter what. Elsa eventually chooses to live alone in a literal ice fortress because this is the only place where she can be herself. This parallels the issues that many young gay people face with lack of family acceptance, feelings of alienation and isolation, feeling somehow dangerous to others, suppression of a major part of themselves, and choosing to be apart from the community that they were born into because they don't feel they can be themselves there. But someone could, of course, correctly point out that there is nothing in the movie itself that suggests Elsa is gay and her sexuality goes entirely unaddressed in the movie.  And I do think there are elements of Edmund's character that LGBT people might identify with in this way. Edmund starts out the series feeling alienated from his siblings for reasons that aren't entirely clear. Edmund started being a jerk the first time he came back from boarding school which perhaps indicates that he was experiencing some form of bullying (interestingly, the same boarding school doesn't seem to have had a similar effect on Peter -- and though I believe Peter suggests that Edmund himself has become a bully, it wouldn't be unusual for someone who is bullied to, in turn, bully others). Edmund seems to harbor a certain amount of resentment toward his more explicitly masculine older brother (this isn't to say that Edmund is feminine, just that Peter is usually given the more explicitly masculine tasks of physically protecting the girls or generally waving his sword around, for example). In his resentment, Edmund screws up big time and betrays his siblings. Edmund is forgiven, but aspects of this forgiveness are kept ""secret"" -- the books explicitly point out that the all the conversation between Edmund and Aslan was never revealed to others, but that it was a conversation that Edmund never forgot. Edmund ends up doing something heroic in a way that suits his personality (using his smarts to come up with the idea of breaking the witch's wand -- something that no one else thought of).  I'm not saying that all gay people identify with these experiences or that no straight people can identify with them, but I think there is a certain overlap between Edmund's experiences and the experiences of many LGBT people that isn't really true of the other Pevensie siblings. The feelings of alienation and isolation followed by eventual acceptance and affirmation of Edmund's particular qualities as a person is a journey that would feel familiar and comforting to many LGBT people. Actually, now that I think of it, Edmund and Elsa share quite a bit in common -- the feelings of alienation from family, the somewhat closed-off personality, the much more open, optimistic, sweet younger sister, even the association with cold and winter (Edmund goes to the White Witch's castle to ally with her, Elsa has ice powers and goes off on her own to create her own ice castle).  And to answer this question:  Conversely, is there a way to interpret the text that suggests he's not gay? No. There is nothing in the text itself that suggests he is heterosexual. We see more of adult Edmund in The Horse and His Boy than we do the other Pevensie siblings, but we don't see anything that would point to a possible sexuality. This certainly doesn't mean that he's gay -- but it is one less obstacle to people viewing him in that way. "
"What does ""Maybe it's a Big Horse I'm Morporkian"" mean?","It is a pun on ‘Maybe it’s because I’m a Londoner’, a song written to boost morale during World War II, by Hubert Gregg, but made famous by Flanagan and Allan as an expression of pride in London.

"Terminology and examples for what George Orwell calls ""good bad poetry""?","TL;DR: Orwell’s ‘good bad’ poetry is ‘bad’ because it is superficial (lacking in aesthetic, intellectual, psychological or moral depth), but ‘good’ because it is skilfully written and enjoyable to read. Orwell gave eight examples of ‘good bad’ poems, in addition to the works of Rudyard Kipling. I’ll give four lines from each, but follow the links for the full poems. ‘The Bridge of Sighs’ (1844) by Thomas Hood, about a young woman drowned in the Thames: Take her up tenderly,
  Lift her with care;
  Fashion’d so slenderly,
  Young, and so fair! ‘When all the world is young, lad’ from The Water Babies (1863) by Charles Kingsley, on the theme of tempus fugit: When all the world is young, lad,
    And all the trees are green;
  And every goose a swan, lad,
    And every lass a queen; ‘The Charge of the Light Brigade’ (1854) by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, about a disastrous maneouvre at the battle of Balaclava: “Charge,” was the captain’s cry;
  Their’s not to reason why,
  Their’s not to make reply,
  Their’s but to do and die, ‘Dickens in Camp’ by Bret Harte, which imagines a California pioneer reading aloud a novel by Charles Dickens: And then, while round them shadows gathered faster,
    And as the firelight fell,
  He read aloud the book wherein the Master
    Had writ of “Little Nell.” ‘The Burial of Sir John Moore after Corunna’ (1816) by Charles Wolfe, about the burial of General Moore after his death at A Coruña in 1809: Slowly and sadly we laid him down,
    From the field of his fame fresh and gory;
  We carved not a line, and we raised not a stone,
    But we left him alone with his glory. ‘Jenny Kissed Me’ (1838) by Leigh Hunt, also on the theme of tempus fugit: Say I’m weary, say I’m sad,
    Say that health and wealth have miss’d me,
  Say I’m growing old, but add,
    Jenny kiss’d me. ‘The Ballad of Keith of Ravelston’ by Sydney Dobell, about a wicked lord and a dead cowherd: The murmur of the mourning ghost
    That keeps the shadowy kine,
  ‘O Keith of Ravelston,
    The sorrows of thy line!’ ‘Casabianca’ (1826) by Felicia Hemans, about the death of Giocante de Casabianca at the battle of the Nile: The boy stood on the burning deck
    Whence all but he had fled;
  The flame that lit the battle’s wreck
    Shone round him o’er the dead In order to appreciate the context in which Orwell was making his literary judgments, we have to think our way back into the mindset of the educated classes of England in the first half of the 20th century. The literary education of the upper classes was based on a ‘Great Tradition’ (in the words of F. R. Leavis) that ran from Homer through the classical Greek and Latin writers, through Chaucer, Shakespeare and Milton down to Eliot and James. The tradition is characterized by aesthetic complexity, intellectual depth, psychological observation, and moral seriousness; or at least it can be interpreted as respecting those goals. To this stratum of society (to which Orwell belonged, however precariously: he was educated at Eton), ‘good’ literature consisted of the works of the great tradition and its followers, and ‘bad’ literature was everything else: comic and sentimental verse, folk songs, detective stories, ‘penny dreadfuls’, ‘three-decker’ melodramas, music hall, Western fiction, science fiction, and so on. The late 20th century exploded the idea of the Western literary canon so successfully that this attitude seems quite blinkered to us now. Nonetheless, G. K. Chesterton apparently felt it necessary to write an essay pointing out that many people do not realize that there is such a thing as a good detective story; it is to them like speaking of a good devil. […] There is, however, between a good detective story and a bad detective story as much, or, rather more, difference than there is between a good epic and a bad one. (‘A defence of detective stories’, 1900.) Orwell introduced his idea of the ‘good bad’ poem in the essay ‘Rudyard Kipling’ (1942), in which he reviewed the collection A Choice of Kipling’s Verse, edited by T. S. Eliot. At his worst, and also his most vital, in poems like ‘Gunga Din’ or ‘Danny Deever’, Kipling is almost a shameful pleasure, like the taste for cheap sweets that some people secretly carry into middle life. But even with his best passages one has the same sense of being seduced by something spurious, and yet unquestionably seduced. Unless one is merely a snob and a liar it is impossible to say that no one who cares for poetry could get any pleasure out of such lines as: For the wind is in the palm trees, and the temple bells they say,
    ‘Come you back, you British soldier, come you back to Mandalay!’ and yet those lines are not poetry in the same sense as ‘Felix Randal’ or ‘When icicles hang by the wall’ are poetry. One can, perhaps, place Kipling more satisfactorily […] if one describes him simply as a good bad poet. At this point Orwell gave the eight examples, and then commented: All of these reek of sentimentality, and yet—not these particular poems, perhaps, but poems of this kind, are capable of giving true pleasure to people who can see clearly what is wrong with them. One could fill a fair-sized anthology with good bad poems, if it were not for the significant fact that good bad poetry is usually too well known to be worth reprinting. So what Orwell seems to have had in mind is that the ‘good bad poem’ panders to popular taste, but nonetheless it is a good example of its type: it is constructed with skill and enjoyable to read. A quick note on ‘sentimentality’. The Oxford English Dictionary says sentimental, adj. 1.a. […] Addicted to indulgence in superficial emotion; apt to be swayed by sentiment It’s the superficiality that Orwell is complaining about, not the emotion. For example, consider the first of Orwell's examples, Thomas Hood's ‘The Bridge of Sighs’. This eloquently expresses the poet’s sadness, but doesn’t go any further than that. The young woman in the poem has drowned herself because she was homeless, probably due to a pregnancy, but the main matter of the poem is how beautiful her corpse looks and how her sins are forgiven now she is dead. If there is a moral, it is only “Alas! for the rarity / Of Christian charity”. This is liable to strike the modern reader as a superficial response: surely some thought ought to be given to the sexual double standard and the cruelty of the patriarchal society that shunned her? Orwell elaborated his thoughts on ‘good bad’ literature in the essay ‘Good bad books’ (1945): A type of book which we hardly seem to produce in these days, but which flowered with great richness in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, is what Chesterton called the “good bad book”: that is, the kind of book that has no literary pretensions but which remains readable when more serious productions have perished. Obviously outstanding books in this line are Raffles and the Sherlock Holmes stories, which have kept their place when innumerable “problem novels”, “human documents” and “terrible indictments” of this or that have fallen into deserved oblivion. […] The existence of good bad literature—the fact that one can be amused or excited or even moved by a book that one’s intellect simply refuses to take seriously—is a reminder that art is not the same thing as cerebration. I imagine that by any test that could be devised, Carlyle would be found to be a more intelligent man than Trollope. Yet Trollope has remained readable and Carlyle has not: with all his cleverness he had not even the wit to write in plain straightforward English."
Limerick involves a pregnant Scottish woman and anagrams,"Sweet Molly MacDougal, in labour,

How I found it: given your specifying a Scottish woman, I decided to assume British English spellings and search for the exact phrases ""in labour"" and ""like a sabre"". I removed the word ""limerick"" from my search, thinking that a source might reproduce this ditty without actually using the word limerick for it.

Jordan's line about intimate parties in The Great Gatsby?,"Jordan is remarking on the paradox that at a large party, it's possible to have a private conversation with someone without its being considered rude or unusual. The larger the party, the more people huddle in small groups of two, three, or four people, each group having its own separate conversation. So it's possible to talk with one or two people intimately without others thinking that it's anything out of the ordinary. In a small party, say six or seven people, the conversation is general. It is not possible to talk privately or intimately with one or two other people, as others will notice, probably overhear, and certainly consider it odd. That is why Jordan says, ""At small parties there isn’t any privacy.” To give an example: I have met a total stranger during a large party, talked solely with that person for about half an hour, and concluded the conversation by arranging to meet him elsewhere later to continue our very interesting encounter. Because there were around 30 other people at the party, nobody particularly noticed that he and I were spending a fair bit of time in conversation together—everybody was in one little group or another. The fact that it was a large party meant that we could talk privately. I could not have had such a conversation with said stranger if there were only a handful of other people at the party. The conversation would never have gotten intimate enough. Everybody would be participating in a single conversation."
Contrasting depictions of Asians in Tintin,"Hergé apparently met an art student called Chang Chong-Chen, the same name he gives to the man who saved Tintin in Blue Lotus. Mark Tweedale at Multiversitycomics.com writes: Why the change? Well, Hergé met a Chinese student of sculpture, Chang Chong-chen, and the two became friends. Chang had a profound influence on “The Blue Lotus,” and in fact all the Chinese text in the book was written by Chang. If you can read Mandarin, there’s a whole other level to the book. Chang also taught Hergé about Chinese art, and the influence here is unmistakable. And Here Hergé isn’t just talking about ‘many Europeans’; he’s talking about himself, about the way he had thought a mere five years earlier, and it shows his budding sense of responsibility to his readers in the way he portrays the places and peoples Tintin visits.

Why does Morpheus look like Neil Gaiman?,"Or maybe he does, just a little bit, because Gaiman sort of looks like a whole bunch of other dudes (and dudettes) who influenced Morpheus' looks. Well, at least his face hasn't been explicitly stated to be based on Gaiman's. Reading through canon (that is, word of gods - people who actually worked on The Sandman) sources, I couldn't find an indication that Gaiman was explicitly used as an inspiration for Morpheus' appearance. There's one bit where Gaiman says about his motivation with Morpheus: The inspiration for his clothes came from a print in a book of Japanese design, of a black kimono, with yellow markings at the bottom which looked vaguely like flames; and also from my desire to write a character I could have a certain amount of sympathy with. (As I wouldn't wear a costume, I couldn't imagine him wanting to wear one. And seeing that the greater part of my wardrobe is black [It's a sensible colour. It goes with anything. Well, anything black.], then his tastes in clothes echoed mine on that score as well.
From the afterword to Preludes and Nocturnes. That last part about wearing black had also come up in Gaiman's Tumblr For the record, this is the black robe with flame motif Gaiman is mentioning:   
Left - from ""Sleep of the Just""; middle - from ""Dream a Little Dream of Me"" (Constantine even joked that he wouldn't get on public transport with Morpheus looking like this); right - from ""Sound and Fury""; all collected in Preludes and Nocturnes. But according to Mike Dringenberg (the inker and then penciller of the first 8 issues), none of the characters were copied directly from real people: None of the characters are direct renderings of individual people; they're composites emerging from my memories;
src I think there's only one character that has explicitly been stated to be mostly inspired by a real person - Death: 
Left - Cinamon Hadley; right - Death of the Endless. Coming back to Morpheus, he's never stated to be based on, or even to intentionally resemble Neil Gaiman. He was a sort of collage of many people the artist knew back then: The Sandman himself is even more of a composite. Certain well-known people influenced the design -- his mop of hair came from Robert Smith and ballet dancer Farukh Ruzimatov was always in my mind for his dramatic physique, but face wasn't so much Bauhaus' Peter Murphy, but rather a type of English face, of which Murphy's is a shining example. That face can be averaged between Dirk Bogarde, as he appeared in the 1959 version of A Tale of Two Cities; the young Terrence Stamp of Billy Budd, and David Bowie in the '70s, with a dash of Syd Barrett. As for his bearing, he's an amalgam of half a dozen guys that I knew slightly in the old punk/ club scene and didn't want to know any better: they were all tall, pale, beautiful, and serious sleazebags who used women like toilet paper.
Ibid; emphasis mine. I can see Morpheus resembling the people Dringenberg mentions:  
Left - Robert Smith from The Cure (image src); right - Morpheus from ""Dream a Little Dream of Me"". 
Left - Robert Smith; right - Morpheus from ""Into The Night"", collected in The Doll's House (image src). 
Left - Farukh Ruzimatov (adapted from src); right - Morpheus from ""Sleep of the Just"". Both are fit, skinny, muscular (Ruzimatov is a ballet dancer), but it's not possible to see a direct resemblance - for one thing, there are no clear shots of Morpheus' body in the first 8 issues. Once again, it changes later in series, when the art becomes more abstract: 
Morpheus from The Kindly Ones chapter 5. 
Left and right - Morpheus; middle - Peter Murphy (adapted from src). This one is the most well-known source inspiration. Here's what Gaiman has to say: The original idea-model for Morpheus was Peter Murphy from Bauhaus. …and even that was after I’d described him a lot and Sam Kieth had sketched pages of faces, and we’d picked one. Mike Dringenberg went “Oh, you mean a Peter Murphy face” and we went, “Oh yes.”
src Thank @Slytherincess for hooking me up on Peter Murphy. Goth rules! Gaiman even mentions in his interview in The Sandman Companion that he also wanted Morpheus to have a rock-star appearance: I wanted him to look like royalty. In the late 1980s, kings and queens were dressing and behaving like ordinary people, and I felt it was celebrities - and especially rock stars - who were our true royalty. I made some drawings with that in mind, and with the Sandman dressed in a black kimono I ran across in a book of Japanese design. I sent those off to Sam Kieth, who was the first issue's penciller, and Sam developed the Dream we see in issue 1. The Mike Dringenberg, who was inking the first issue, said, ""Hey, he looks like Peter Murphy from Bauhaus."" Dave McKean and I got some Bauhaus videos and immediately saw that Mike was right; and Dave ended up making the central image on the cover of Sandman 1 a Peter Murphy-like face.
The Sandman Companion, ""Secret Origins - Origins of Dream"", page 236. The closest thing I cold find for Morpheus to resemble Gaiman was like this (the general shape of the face and all the hair): 
Left and right - Morpheus, from ""Sleep of the Just"" (Preludes and Nocturnes) and Season of Mists chapter 3, respectively; middle - Neil Gaiman somewhere in 80s or 90s (src). Neil Gaiman himself certainly doesn't believe Morpheus was modeled on him: Q: You look very much like Dream of the Endless. Is this purposeful? A: I don’t think I looked like Dream while I was writing him.  Maybe it’s a similar phenomenon to the way people grow to look like their dogs.
From Neil Gaiman's Tumblr. and: Q: I have just started reading The Sandman and I had a question. I know you said that Dream's wardrobe is based on your own but is his appearance based on you as well? I personally think the resemblance is uncanny. A: I don’t think so. This is what I looked like when SANDMAN 1 came out, after all… (Photo of Mike Dringenberg and me at the first ever Sandman signing, at Jim Hanley’s Universe. Note the non-existent crowds, and the piles of unsold copies of Sandman #1.) 
From Neil Gaiman's Tumblr. and, most recently: Q: Did you intentionally make Dream look an awful lot like you? A: Not really. I suspect we’ve grown to look more like each other over the years, like people and their dogs. I mean, at the time that that issue came out I looked like this (I’m the one on the right):  Notice that with all of these, some traits seem similar, but Morpheus doesn't really look like any of them. My point is, sure Morpheus seems to look like Neil Gaiman - Gaiman was there, he's the creator of the character - but he also looks like a lot of other people who influenced the artist at that time. And if one was to look at later issues, Morpheus looks even less like Gaiman or anyone mentioned:   He retains the basic traits, but it becomes harder and harder to identify him with any particular person. But it's only fair to point out that some artists apparently did use Neil Gaiman for their depictions of Morpheus. Here, it's Marc Hempel, who illustrated The Kindly Ones. "
What are these pink papers with book text written on them?,"It's something to do with the splicing in of new paper rolls during the printing process. I'll confess that I don't fully understand how it all works, but am confident I've tracked down something very close to what you found.  Splice rupture tabs These tabs are die cut and/or perforated to break instantly after the splice has been made to release
the new roll for unwinding. They are also used to hold down the outer spire during rotation to prevent air pockets being formed (which can burst the splice preparation during acceleration). The number and type of tabs are determined by splice speed, paper grade and pattern shape. I don't quite follow how they would end up at the orientation shown in your image, but it is certain that they should not make it through to a product for sale, those pages should have been counted as wastage. You can read more in the PDF I used as a source which might, or might not, help you to a fuller understanding!. Edit: A further PDF seems to confirm that these are ‘Splice rupture tabs’ which are used to hold a roll of paper closed prior to it being spliced to the preceding roll.
The tabs are rectangular and have adhesive on the underside at both ends but not the centre where there is a die cut line or perforation. The ungummed portion goes over the edge of the roll. Double sided splicing tape is attached further back from the leading edge than the rupture tabs. The splicing machinery, I think, picks up the new roll by pressing the double sided tape onto the roll that is finishing, and cutting that roll behind the join. The pick up applies tension to the paper on the new roll, rupturing the tabs and allowing the paper to feed into the press. I can somehow understand this without being able to picture it, so I hope it makes sense to others! "
Story about a man who bets his head but not his neck with the devil,"This is the story of Loki’s wager with Brokkr, from the Prose Edda of Snorri Sturluson. Here’s the relevant passage in the retelling by Hélène Guerber: Loki was so pleased with these proofs of the dwarfs’ skill that he declared the son of Ivald to be the most clever of smiths—words which were overheard by Brock, another dwarf, who exclaimed that he was sure his brother Sindri could produce three objects which would surpass those which Loki held, not only in intrinsic value, but also in magical properties. Loki immediately challenged the dwarf to show his skill, wagering his head against Brock’s on the result of the undertaking. […] Brock was sure of winning the wager and he did not hesitate to present himself before the gods in Asgard, where he gave Odin the ring Draupnir, Frey the boar Gullin-bursti, and Thor the hammer Miölnir, whose power none could resist. Loki in turn gave the spear Gungnir to Odin, the ship Skidbladnir to Frey, and the golden hair to Thor; but although the latter immediately grew upon Sif’s head and was unanimously declared more beautiful than her own locks had ever been, the gods decreed that Brock had won the wager, on the ground that the hammer Miölnir, in Thor’s hands, would prove invaluable against the frost giants on the last day. In order to save his head, Loki fled precipitately, but was overtaken by Thor, who brought him back and handed him over to Brock, telling him,† however, that although Loki’s head was rightfully his, he must not touch his neck. Hindered from obtaining full vengeance, the dwarf determined to punish Loki by sewing his lips together, and as his sword would not pierce them, he borrowed his brother’s awl for the purpose. However, Loki, after enduring the gods’ gibes in silence for a little while, managed to cut the string and soon after was as loquacious as ever. Snorri Sturluson (13th century). ‘Sif, the Golden-haired’. Adapted by Hélène Adeline Guerber (1909). Myths of the Norsemen, pp. 65–68. London: George G. Harrap. † In the original it is Loki (not Thor) who cautions Brokkr not to touch his neck: “Þá vildi dvergrinn ho̢ggva af Loka ho̢fuð, en Loki sagði at hann átti ho̢fuð en eigi hálsinn.” In the Rasmus B. Anderson translation (1901): “Now the dwarf wanted to cut the head off Loke, but Loke said that the head was his, but not the neck”. However, I think Guerber’s choice is defensible in the context of a retelling, as Loki, having his head on the chopping-block, might not be in the best position to impose terms on Brokkr."
"In which version of ""Snow White"" is her name really ""Lips Red as Blood, Hair Black as Ebony, Skin White as Snow""?","Here’s the start of the story ‘Sneewittchen’ as given by the brothers Grimm: Es war einmal mitten im Winter und die Schneeflocken fielen wie Federn vom Himmel, da saß eine schöne Königin an einem Fenster, das hatte einen Rahmen von schwarzem Edenholz, und nähte. Und wie sie so nähte und nach dem Schnee aufblickte, stach sie sich mit der Nadel in den Finger, und es fielen drei Tropfen Blut in den Schnee. Und weil das Rothe in dem Weißen so schön aussah, so dachte sie: hätt ich doch ein Kind so weiß wie Schnee, so roth wie Blut und so schwarz wie dieser Rahmen. Und bald darauf bekam sie ein Töchterlein, so weiß wie Schnee, so roth wie Blut, und so schwarz wie Ebenholz, und darum ward es das Sneewittchen genannt. Once upon a time, in the middle of winter, when feathery snowflakes fell from the sky, a beautiful queen sat and sewed at a window, which had a frame of black ebony. And as she sewed and looked up at the snow, she pricked her finger with the needle and three drops of blood fell onto the snow. And because the red looked so beautiful against the white, she thought: had I but a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as this frame! Soon afterwards she had a daughter, as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as ebony, and so she was called Little-snow-white. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm (1812). Kinder- und Haus-märchen, p. 238. Berlin: Realschulbuchhandlung. This is the oldest printed version of the story, and here, it is clear that although the queen’s daughter has all three attributes from her mother’s wish, her name is just “Sneewittchen”. In the Disney animated film (1937) there is a scene with the following dialogue: Queen: Magic Mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all? Magic Mirror: Famed is thy beauty, Majesty. But hold, a lovely maid I see. Rags cannot hide her gentle grace. Alas, she is more fair than thee. Queen: Alas for her! Reveal her name! Magic Mirror: Lips red as the rose. Hair black as ebony. Skin white as snow. Queen: Snow White! You can see how someone might interpret the highlighted line as the mirror revealing Snow-white’s real name. But I think a more natural interpretation is that the mirror is giving the queen a (not very difficult) riddle, in the usual manner of oracles. Another version of the story that that uses all three of Snow-white’s attributes as a kind of epithet, is a 1982 retelling by Nancy Garden: “Nothing can save you now, my beauty,” chortled the queen, “for I have used my strongest poison this time, and since you have swallowed it, you will never rise again. So, Skin-White-as-Snow, Lips-Red-as-Blood, Hair-Black-as-Ebony, what good is your beauty to you now? This time no one will ever be able to wake you up again.” Nancy Garden (1982). Favourite Tales from Grimm, p. 15. New York: Four Winds. Again, you can see how a reader of this passage in Garden’s version might conclude that “Skin-White-as-Snow, Lips-Red-as-Blood, Hair-Black-as-Ebony” is Snow-white’s real or unabbreviated name. This is an appealing kind of fairy-tale idea! But elsewhere in Garden’s version she is just called “Snow White”, so it makes as much, or more, sense to take the queen’s phrase here to be a sarcastic epithet that she made up on the spot."
What languages should one know to appreciate Finnegans Wake?,"For example, if foreign words are mostly in German and French No, the foreign words, when there are foreign words, are in all sorts of languages; learning one language won't help. By all means, learn a foreign language for the sake of learning a foreign language. But you don't need to learn a foreign language to read Finnegans Wake. Personally, I've been able to get by with just English and the footnotes (to clarify: Finnegans Wake doesn't have explanatory footnotes, you have to read along with a companion book if you want those). Here's some general advice for getting the most out of Finnegans Wake, based on my experience: If you're only going to read part of the book, Chapter 8 is probably the best place to start. You can read it online, but you'll probably get more out of Finnegans Wake if you read it aloud from a print copy. The real meaning of Finnegans Wake comes from the sound of the words, and you won't get that looking at letters on a computer screen.  If you don't get anything out of reading Finnegans Wake, don't be afraid to stop. Read it if you enjoy it, don't read it if you're only interested because it's a ""hard"" book. People might make fun of me for saying this, but I personally enjoy reading about Finnegans Wake more than I enjoy reading Finnegans Wake itself. Some of the academic papers/books are really, really interesting, even if you don't read a word of the actual book. There are also some really interesting blogs (1,2) out there."
Is there any textual evidence that this death in Deathly Hallows symbolized the end of childhood?,"WARNING: Spoilers ahead. (Emphasis mine on all quotes below) Other than the twitter link provided in the question, Rowling gave a fuller explanation in an interview (full transcript of the interview can be found here): Twinkletoes*: ""Why did you feel that Hedwig's death was necessary?""
J.K. Rowling: ""The loss of Hedwig represented a loss of innocence and security. She has been almost like a cuddly toy to Harry at times. Voldemort killing her marked the end of childhood. I’m sorry… I know that death upset a LOT of people!""
* Username of person asking question Hedwig was the last remaining part of his childhood. Ron and Hermione both had grown up, and this supposedly caused Harry to become an adult. 'Hedwig' symbolises other things too. St. Hedwig was the patron saint of orphans, making the owl even more special to Harry, who was himself an orphan: He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it [the scar].
""In the car crash when your parents died,"" she had said. ""And don't ask
questions.""
-- Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone - Chapter 2 Harry also chooses the name 'Hedwig' from one of his schoolbooks: Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to
call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school
books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the
night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased.
-- Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone - Chapter 6 The fact that the name came from his schoolbook, suggests that with the death of Hedwig, his schooldays and childhood was over along with his innocence. Hedwig in the book was white, a symbol of innocence and the protection of other, saint like, people. When she was killed this innocence was gone. The purity and innocence of Harry when he is a child is represented by the colour white, and Hedwig is a snowy owl, the whitest owl there is. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing.
-- Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone - Chapter 5 Back at the Dursleys', Hedwig was also basically Harry's only childhood friend outside of Hogwarts and magic. This is summed up perfectly in this extract: In addition to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty
that he’d been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only friend he had at
number four, Privet Drive.
-- Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Chapter 3 And perhaps even better, this quote from when Harry has just lost Hedwig: ""Wait a moment,"" said Hagrid, looking around. ""Harry, where’s
Hedwig?""
""She . . . she got hit,"" said Harry.
The realization crashed over him: He felt ashamed of himself as
the tears stung his eyes. The owl had been his companion, his one
great link with the magical world whenever he had been forced to
return to the Dursleys. He misses her when she is gone: Hedwig had been absent for two nights now. Harry wasn’t worried about her: she’d been gone this long before. But he hoped she’d be back soon — she was the only living creature in this house who didn’t flinch at the sight of him.
-- Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - Chapter 1 They have a mutual friendship: She, too, was carrying a parcel and looked extremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate nip with her beak as he removed her burden, then flew across the room to join Errol.
-- Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - Chapter 1 The snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affectionately as Harry stroked her feathers.
-- Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Chapter 4 He walked away from them, looking around, with Hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder, but this room was not likely to raise his spirits
-- Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Chapter 4 Hedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe, then took off through the window; Harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting.
-- Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - Chapter 5 Her death shows once again how the remnants of Harry's childhood were gone. Credit to Torisuda for posting a comment that got me started on this bit. While Dudley is always getting a ton of birthday presents: Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.
""Thirty-six,"" he said, looking up at his mother and father. ""That's two
less than last year.""
-- Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone - Chapter 2 All Harry got for his tenth birthday was a coat hanger and a pair of socks: ...then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of
course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys
had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.
Still, you weren't eleven every day.
-- Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone - Chapter 3 So when Hagrid gets Harry his first true birthday present, on his first birthday as a wizard, he instantly becomes attached: ""Just yer wand left - A yeah, an' I still haven't got yeh a birthday
present.""
Harry felt himself go red.
""You don't have to --""
""I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. Not a toad,
toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an' I don'
like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'.""
Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been
dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now
carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with
her head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks,
sounding just like Professor Quirrell.
""Don' mention it,"" said Hagrid gruffly. ""Don' expect you've had a lotta
presents from them Dursleys.
-- Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone - Chapter 5 And then a couple of weeks before the day of his seventeenth birthday, his first birthday as an adult wizard: [Mrs Weasley] Actually, I’ve been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday, Harry. Seventeen, after all, it’s an important day. . . .”
-- Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Chapter 6 Hedwig dies, leaving Harry distraught: A second’s relief, and then another burst of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage.
“No — NO!”
The motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering as Hagrid blasted through their circle.
“Hedwig — Hedwig —”
But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of
her cage. He could not take it in, and his terror for the others was
paramount.
-- Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Chapter 4 It seems more than just a coincidence that Harry received Hedwig on his first wizard birthday, in the first book, and lost her on just before his first adult wizard birthday, in the last book. She was present throughout his wizarding childhood, and died just before he left it. It has been a recurring theme that Hedwig was almost a child's toy to Harry. Rowling mentions it in the aforementioned interview: She has been almost like a cuddly toy to Harry at times. And it is mentioned once again when she dies in the book. But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of
her cage.
-- Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Chapter 4 This 'cuddly toy' idea, attaches Hedwig in a special way to Harry. She was his pet, his toy, his friend, and so much else. I hope this provides an answer, there is a lot of evidence, you just have to take a second look. I developed this answer over a few days, mostly because I didn't have the time to do it all at once. First I checked through the first and last books, before checking the rest. To search through a book, I would open up a pdf of it and then search through it using Ctrl+F. I searched 'Hedwig' in each and came up with the quotes above. I obviously added the emphasis myself. After a couple of edits, it is the answer you know see before you."
"In the ""Neverending Story"", what judgement do Falkor and Atreyu make of the Childlike Empress?","It is important to distinguish between the original text and the English translation. If one only allows for text-immanent interpretation and considers the translation the sole text, all my following arguments are pointless. Furthermore, I'm not saying that the interpretation of Atreyu considering the queen to be a monster is wrong per se, but I want to explain how this couldn't be the original intent of the author. Nevertheless, modern literature usually rejects the author as an instance of authority and claims that the reader is the authority: Even if the author intended A, that doesn't mean the story is about A if no reader agrees with the author. Or likewise, if the author claims a story is not B, it can still be considered B if the readers agree that it is B. Rand al'Thor's answer is just as valid. Actually, my answer supports Rand al'Thor's interpretation, just not the fact that they would call her monster. . Because of the way the German language is constructed, a German sentence (even an unfinished one) at word level bears more information than the English counterpart. German relies less on context and more on explicitness. In German, every noun has a grammatical gender, it's either masculine, female or neutral. Adjectives and articles get inflected depending on the gender of the noun they belong to. As an example, a sun would be eine Sonne1 (female), a moon would be ein Mond (male), and a car would be ein Auto (neutral)2. The German quote of the above extract is »Glaubst du, Fuchur [Falkor]«, fragte Atreju, «daß es der Kindlichen Kaisern gleichgültig ist was aus Bastian wird?« »Wer weiß«, antwortete Fuchur [Falkor], »sie macht keine Unterschiede.« »Aber dann«, fuhr Atreju fort, »ist sie wahrlich eine...« It is important to note that the form of the article a that is used here is female. Although we do not know what follows, at some point a female noun must come. To me, because of the context, everything hints at the fact that it is going to be adjective + empress (which is female in German). Monster, and most other insults are male and thus can not be meant by Atreyu. If Ende had cut the article, making the stub Then she really is..., the ambiguity of what she is would be preserved in German as well. But Ende deliberately put the eine at the end of the sentence. I'll reiterate that everything hints at the missing words being a negative adjective and empress. As an example, monstrous empress. This seems like a small difference to monster, but in German that difference is quite large. Monster would have been neutral, as I said above. But calling anyone a neutral thing (basically an inanimate object) is almost always derogatory. An important part of NS Propaganda is the principle of dehumanisation: the humanity of Jews was being stripped away by referring to them with a neutral gender or comparing them to animals. Atreyu does not dehumanise the Childlike Empress with the negative adjective because it must still be of female grammatical gender. Also, by acknowledging her position of authority (referring to her as Empress), he basically gives the reason for not finishing that sentence. Whatever she does, however she abuses Bastian, she's still their Empress and as such has to be accepted. So while Atreyu probably is upset with the behaviour of his Empress, he not only never articulates his disapproval but if he did would have mitigated the harshness of criticism greatly. 1: Please don't ask why the sun is female and the moon is male despite the moon being female in most romanic languages (Latin, French, Spanish, Italien etc. Also, please don't ask me why inanimate objects are supposed to have a gender. It's just the way it's always been... 2: Yes, occasionally different genders can have the same form. Both the masculine and the neutral form of ""a"" are ""ein"". You see, this language never was meant to be easy..."
Was Afghanistan considered tropical or was Holmes wrong?,"Don't interpret ""the tropics"" with such scientific precision. You originally posted this question on the Earth Sciences site, and you seem to have been thinking of this quote with a literal (I'd even say pedantic, noting that I consider this a compliment) interpretation of the word ""tropics"". But in everyday English, the word isn't always used so precisely - I'd wager most English people aren't aware even today that the tropics refers specifically to the region between 23°N and 23°S, and that was probably even more true in the days of the British Empire when people travelled less and knew less about the world beyond their own country. A tropical climate is characterised as one that's both hot and humid. This is another potential meaning of ""tropics"" (short for ""tropical climates""), which may include regions above the Tropic of Cancer or below the Tropic of Capricorn. However, the climate of Afghanistan is hot and dry, so this definition doesn't strictly work either. But, checking the quote again: He has just come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin ... the important point about the region is not its latitude, nor its humidity, but its temperature and the intensity of the sun, which cause people to become tanned. While ""tropics"" doesn't actually cover Afghanistan, it probably does cover most places in the world with the most intense tan-inducing heat and sunlight. ""Tropics"" will do as a catch-all term. Even a precise intellect like Holmes's (or Doyle's) doesn't need to split hairs when it's not necessary. I can't find any specific information on how the word ""tropics"" was generally used in the late 19th century, but it seems plausible that it was used more loosely than today, in an era when many ""foreign parts"" could be bunched together as ""the colonies"" and mostly ignored by Englishmen. It may be worth noting that the Köppen climate classification was first published in 1884, after the time of ""A Study in Scarlet"", so ""tropical climate"" may not have been defined at all at this time except vaguely as something like ""hot parts of the world""."
What is up with the oracle's prophecy in the story of Cupid and Psyche?,"This is a translation in verse, so don't set too much store on the exact wording. Some of the words may have been chosen for rhythm and rhyme rather than for precise meaning. For reference, here's the Latin original (or at least one of the preserved Latin texts, I don't know if we know what the exact original is): Montis in excelsi scopulo, rex siste puellam
  ornatam mundo funerei thalami.
  Nec speres generum mortali stirpe creatum,
  sed saevum atque ferum vipereumque malum,
  quod pinnis volitans super aethera cuncta fatigat
  flammaque et ferro singula debilitat,
  quod tremit ipse Iovis quo numina terrificantur,
  fluminaque horrescunt et Stygiae tenebrae.   An advantage with this classic is that multiple translations are often available for comparison. You have the translation by William Adlington in a modernized spelling. I didn't find another English translation online but I used two French translations (Nisard 1865, Bastien 1787) to write this answer. Cupid is not exactly described as a “fiery winged serpent”: his wings and the fiery aspect are mentioned separately. The fiery aspect is mentioned in the line “flammaque et ferro singula debilitat”: he cripples (debilitat) with fire (flamma) and iron (ferro). The word ferro can mean any of many objects made of iron, most commonly the sword, but here I think it refers to arrow tips. Although today Cupid's best known attribute is his arrows, the Romans also often had him carry a torch, as seen in the (modern) sculpture Cupid and Hymen George Rennie. The symbol of the lit flame standing for love that burns the heart was common in Roman culture, and some Roman wedding traditions involved a lit torch. This, by the way, is the origin of the English idiom “carry a torch”. So my understanding of this line is that “fire and iron” is a way to refer to Cupid's two attributes, the torch and the arrows, in a generic way that makes him not obviously identifiable, but rather evokes a terrible monster or warrior. A similar interpretation is given by Thomas McCreight (“Psyche's Sisters as Medicae? Allusions to Medecine in Cupid and Psyche”, in Lectiones Scrupulosae: Essays on the Text and Interpretation of Apuleius's Metamorphoses in Honour of Maaike Zimmerman, p.159). He points out that the dual use of flame and iron is used again later in the story (V:20) when Psyche carries a lamp and a dagger to kill her husband who she still believes to be a monster. McCreight further analyses fire and iron as medical symbols. In the light of the fact that fire and iron is a recurring theme, it is a bit unfortunate that Adlington dropped the association here, as did Nisard. Bastien describes him as “waging war with flame and iron”, which is closer to the original. The serpent aspect comes from the line “sed saevum atque ferum vipereumque malum”. A word-for-word translation goes something like this: “but violent/wild/cruel/beastly (saevum, ferum) and evil (malum) like a viper (vipereum)”. The Latin vipera can mean either a snake in general or a viper in particular, and the adjective form used here is prone to being used in a metaphorical way, in particular to mean poisonous (as in viperea anima, quoted from Virgil, meaning “poisonous breath”). The viper a poisonous snake, I think the most common one around the Mediterranean. Love is commonly described as having a poisoning effect because it muddles people's judgement. The last two lines describe the unnamed Cupid as “making Jupiter himself tremble” (“tremit ipse Iovis”), “terrifying gods” (“numina terrificantur”), and causing rivers (“flumina”) and the dark hell (“Stygiae tenebrae”) to become terrified (“horrescunt”). I'm not sure what the last verse means literally. Etymologically, Stygiae refers to the river Styx, which is the boundary between earth (where humans live) and Hell (the Underworld where the dead live), but it often refers metonymically to the Underworld, i.e. Hell. Merriam-Webster notes that English speakers have been using stygian to mean ""of or relating to the river Styx"" since the early 16th century. From there the meaning broadened to describe things that are as dark, dreary, and menacing as one might imagine Hades and the river Styx to be. but the association between “Stygian darkness” and the dreadriness of Hell in fact dates back from well before its adoption in English, as evidence by its use by Virgil (Georgica, III:551). So I don't think that the river (flumina) is Styx or is dark in any remarkable way, but rather the author insists that there is no barrier to Cupid's power. Love (or lust, this passage does not distinguish between the two) has affected Jupiter and other gods many times in Roman mythology. One of the best known myths about Pluto, ruler of Hell, is his abduction of Persephone, so love has reached Hell itself. As for the river, I don't know if this alludes to a specific mythological tale. Nisard translates this passage by stating that the gods themselves have been affected by Cupid and Styx failed to defend Hell against him, without mentioning a river (not Jupiter nominally). Bastien states that Cupid is feared by “the master of the gods” and that he is feared by “sea, hell and heavens”. My take on this passage is that the important point is the universality of the fear of the unnamed monster, that he affects not only humans but even the most powerful and fearsome gods. Prophecies are always cryptic or incomplete, and often misleading. Prophecy Twist is by no means a recent trope. The oracle didn't get anything wrong, but his words have three possible interpretations. The prophecy is definitely meant to make Psyche and her entourage believe that Psyche is supposed to be killed. But this point in the story, the reader knows that Venus has wished Psyche a fate worse than death: she is to fall in love with the worst possible person (IV:31: “hominis extremi, quem (…) Fortuna damnavit (…)”: the most extreme human damned by fortune (…)). So for the reader, the prophecy ostensibly suggests that Psyche will fall in love with the monster that it describes rather than being killed by it. If we interpret the description of the monster symbolically rather than literally, it fits the embodiment of love."
"What is the ""Intentional Fallacy""?","The Intentional Fallacy is the fallacy of defining the meaning of a work using the author's intentions: The author intended their work to mean this, and so it means this. However, this has problems: Quoting Wimsatt and Beardsley: If the poet succeeded in doing it, then the poem itself shows what he
  was trying to do. And if the poet did not succeed, then the poem is
  not adequate evidence, and the critic must go outside the poem‑for
  evidence of an intention that did not become effective in the poem. So, either the intention to convey a particular meaning is evident in the work, and therefore it already means that, or the work doesn't convey that intention, making it irrelevant. This itself could be a fallacy: Does the author even have intentions? - as James Downey argues: Sometimes an author deliberately composes without thematic intentions.
  ... So, let us consider the method which Salvador Dalí claims that he
  and Luis Buñuel used when creating Un Chien Andalou, to put together
  whatever images came to their mind without any particular intentions
  directing them. ... In such a work of art, it is not possible that
  any such intentions be shown, since there are none. But there is still a definite intention behind such art, namely, the intention to compose with no thematic intentions. This intention
  could be successfully shown to an audience through a work, certainly.
  However, Dalís often intend otherwise (so they say). They may intend
  not to reveal whether or not there are certain, or even any, thematic
  intentions (perhaps that is an intentional anti-religious theme in
  that scene in Un Chien Andalou, after all; we do not know.) Perhaps,
  even, Dalí does not want us to know whether he wants us not to know.
  An intention not to reveal might apply to the intention not to reveal. What a grand game... Related trope: The curtains are blue. Human language is imperfect, and humans as well. The author may have tried to communicate and idea, yet they may have an imperfect command of the language, or of the art of story-telling, or may have used devices which undermined their intentions. It is still relevant today, and it shall remain relevant: As time passes, language changes, the context changes, and it becomes more and more difficult to divine authorial intent. An author's creation often far outlives the author. Works are read without any knowledge of the author or the circumstances in which the work was created, and acquire a meaning of their own in the minds of the reader. This meaning cannot be dismissed because the author seemed to have intended another meaning."
Why is black evil and white good?,"In western culture, black has been a symbol for death, mourning, sin & evil, and the strange or the ""other"", but also of humility, and of writing and literature. In western culture, white has been a symbol of innocence, virginity, virtue, the holy but sometimes also of death.  (White as a symbol of death is much more recent; there are several examples in 19th-century German literature.) Works of literature that specifically use the contrast between black and white are also old. For example, in Plutarch's Theseus, Theseus promises to his father to return on a ship with white sails if he survived, otherwise the ship would have black sails. Due to an unforeseen incident on the way back, the sailors forget to put up the white sails, and Theseus's father Aegeus, seeing the black sails, commits suicide before the ship reaches the harbour. However, the Theseus myth uses a distinction between white and black sails, not on black and white as skin colour. An example of this can be found in Jean Bodel's La Chanson des Saisnes (""Song of the Saxons"", late 12th century, France), in which Saxons and black Nubians fight against white Franks. The Saxons are the enemies and are portrayed as oriental Saracens. In this way, ""white"" and the Franks (""we"") are associated with the good side, and the ""others"" (Saxons and black Nubians) and black with the bad side of the story. Main source: Günter Butzer and Joachim Jacob (ed.): Metzler Lexikon literarischer Symbole. Second edition. Stuttgart: J. B. Metzler, 2012. Update: Sometimes, the meaning of ""white"" is unclear. One example of this is the ""white rider"", the first of the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse in Revelation, 6, 1-2: And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. This figure has sometimes been interpreted as Jesus, because is described as riding a white horse in Revelation, 19, 11 and sometimes as the antichrist.

"Children's book with ""a ring, a stone, a finger bone""","Could this be “The Winter Players”, from Companions on the Road by Tanith Lee? Googling the phrase quoted in the question led me to this Google Books result She could hear instead a priestess, speaking the Ritual in the shrine. It began with one voice, but shortly there were countless voices. She was hearing all the priestesses who had ever served the shrine. She was reaching back, back into the past of the shrine, back to its beginning, to the Relics themselves, which were the source of the shrine's holiness. A Ring, a Stone,
A Finger-Bone- Abruptly, she was no longer in the cedar. She was running on a black road in a black mist, and something hopped before her-the Bone. It's frustratingly difficult to find more detailed information about this book that would prove its match to the question. Wikipedia and Goodreads puts it at a 1977 publish date - exactly 45 years ago. A blurb: The Ring, The Jewel, The Bone: These are the Relics. The Mysteries of the Shrine, known only to the priestess. Only to Oaive. Yet he knows of them--the wolflike stranger from beyond the mists. And when he profanes them, there begins a game of cold sorceries and burning shadows to be played through all eternity...one way or another."
"What did Melville mean by the ""Pythagorean Maxim"" in ""Moby Dick""?","By “the Pythagorean maxim” Melville means the forbidding of eating beans, which was believed in antiquity to have been one of the rules of the Pythagorean cult. Plato then asserts that we should bring our bodies into such a disposition before we go to sleep as to leave nothing which may occasion error or perturbation in our dreams. For this reason, perhaps, Pythagoras laid it down as a rule, that his disciples should not eat beans, because this food is very flatulent, and contrary to that tranquillity of mind which a truth-seeking spirit should possess. Marcus Tullius Cicero (44 BCE). On Divination 1.30. Translated by C. D. Yonge (1853). The passage from Moby-Dick is thus a fart joke: if you “violate the Pythagorean maxim” (eat beans) then you will find that “winds from astern” (farts) become prevalent."
Was Neil Gaiman's Stardust influenced by C.S. Lewis?,"While we can't rule out an influence from Lewis, he was not Gaiman's primary motivation. Gaiman has named different influences for Stardust. Stardust has a much closer parallel to the 1926 book Lud-In-The-Mist by Hope Mirrlees. Gaiman has praised the book, including it in a list of his all-time favourite novels. In this newspaper feature, he makes clear that Lud-in-the-Mist was an influence of Stardust and names some other inspirations too. Happily ever after by Neil Gaiman, in The Guardian, 13 October 2007. I started writing Stardust in 1994, but mentally timeslipped about 70
years to do it. The mid-1920s seemed like a time when people enjoyed
writing those sorts of things, before there were fantasy shelves in
the bookshops, before trilogies and books ""in the great tradition of
The Lord of the Rings"". This, on the other hand, would be in the
tradition of Lud-in-the-Mist and The King of Elfland's Daughter. All I
was certain of was that nobody had written books on computers back in
the 1920s, so I bought a large book of unlined pages, the first
fountain pen I had owned since my schooldays and a copy of Katharine
Briggs' Dictionary of Fairies. I filled the pen and began. One could even argue that Lewis fits within 'the great tradition of Lord of the Rings' that Gaiman was seeking to escape. Lewis was of course contemporary with Tolkien and both were members of Oxford University literary club The Inklings. One might suggest this places them as working within the same literary tradition, although the two produced stylistically different fantasy epics for different reasons. Of the works mentioned by Gaiman as inspirations, Stardust has a particular parallel with Lud-in-the-Mist. The two books share a close story arc: a mundane town bordering on fairyland, a place of which the common folk are afraid. Up until one character plucks up the courage to visit. There are also tonal and stylistic associations between the two. Critics have noted that Stardust sounds quite unlike Gaiman's normally somewhat frenetic writing and is more of a hark back to classic English Victoriana."
Are quotes from a character technically quotes from the author?,"In answer to the title: Not at all Let's take a quote from Dickens' novel A Christmas Carol: “If I could work my will,every idiot who goes about with Merry Christmas’ on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart.” This quote was of course from the Christmas hating Ebenezer Scrooge. However, if we quote this as coming from Dickens, someone not familiar with his book may assume that Dickens hated Christmas, which we have no evidence for. He may have written the words, but it isn't his quote. He is giving the words to a character. But if we quote it to Ebenezer Scrooge, again someone not familiar with the name may assume they are a real person. So it seems we can't just quote one or the other. Someone made the point that if the character is really famous we can just quote their name, but that's not true. Not everyone will have heard of a character, and someone else made the point they won't be as famous in a couple of hundred years. There have been discussions similar on English.SE and Writing.SE, but none give a definite answer. However, one of the answers gives a link to this site. It reaches the conclusion at the bottom that: The fair, honest and ethical way to quote a fictional character is to note the speaker first, then the book, play or movie, and finally the author. This isn't an official guideline, but it seems good advice. So in the case of my example, like this: “If I could work my will,every idiot who goes about with Merry Christmas’ on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart.” - Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens. The character deserves to be connected to words they say, it defines who they are as a character. But we don't want to give the idea that they aren't fictional. But a character usually does not express the ideas of the author. So we can't just say the author. The best, and in my opinion fairest way to say both, and the novel. In your example, the quote should go as follows: ""The truth. It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution."" - Albus Dumbledore in Harry Potter by JK Rowling There is no definite answer, but I think this makes the most sense. EDIT After some comments, I'm going to clarify and expand on a couple of different contexts. If all the audience know the character If the audience definitely knows the character (e.g. If someone goes to a book meeting after everyone's read a book) then you can probably just quote the character. The audience will know they are a fictional person. If you are quoting multiple times The first time I would go with character, book, author. After that, the reader will know that the character isn't real, and you can just quote the character. If the character is used as the author's 'mouthpiece' Sometimes authors write a sort of biography, but use a character instead of themselves. In this case, and if you have to be absolutely sure this is the case, it would probably be best to quote the author, as that is their thought, not the character's. In all other situations Include all the information, author, character and book. If one person doesn't know the character is fictional, then you need to include all information, at least the first time. Sources, and examples of sites that agree with the character, book, author format: Reddit It depends on the context in which you're giving the quote, I would generally quote the character, if I wasn't sure that everybody would know who I was talking about I would go on to cite the book title and author. The problem with just quoting the author on the matter when it's a character saying whatever it is you're quoting is that it might suggest that the character's opinion is the author's opinion. But that doesn't make any sense. It's not that Shakespeare loves Juliet, but rather he wrote about Romeo loving Juliet. I agree with this, especially where it says 'if I wasn't sure that everybody would know who I was talking about I would go on to cite the book title and author.' and the Shakespeare/Juliet example Yahoo One answer: I'm pretty sure it goes ""Quote."" Character. Work (title underlined). Author. Another gives an alternate way: As [character] said in [Book] by [Author], ""QUOTE."" fansofrealitytv I would think ""Quote"" - character in title by author. You have to credit the author of the words. Here is a guide to citing fiction by Monmouth University. It doesn't say anything about quoting characters, but it does say the following: A WORK OF FICTION BY A SINGLE AUTHOR:
Author’s Name. Title of Work. Publisher, Year. TWO WORKS OF FICTION BY THE SAME AUTHOR:
Author’s Name. Title of Work. Publisher, Year.
Title of Work. Publisher, Year. And I imagine it would include the character's name if it said about quoting a character."
"Why are there three different versions of the ""solid/sullied/sallied flesh"" line in Hamlet?","Since Hamlet was published in several editions during the Jacobethan era, it is worth looking at how these early editions rendered these lines, using the old-spelling editions published by Internet Shakespeare Editions. The first quarto (Q1), published in 1603, which has sometimes been called a ""bad quarto"", gives the lines as follows: O that this too much grieu'd and sallied flesh 
Would melt to nothing, or that the vniuersall 
Globe of heauen would turne al to a Chaos! The second quarto (Q2), published in 1604, gives the lines as follows: Oh, that this too too sallied flesh would melt, 
Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew! Finally, the First Folio, published in 1623,  gives the lines as follows: Oh that this too too solid Flesh, would melt, 
Thaw, and resolue it selfe into a Dew: So originally, we only had the alternatives ""sallied"" and ""solid"". In present-day English ""sallied"" only exists as the past tense and the past participle of the verb sally, which does not make sense in the context of the above lines. Hence, a modern editor needs to decide what to do with ""sallied"" or ""solid"" and this decision will be based on several factors and principles: For a book-length discussion of these types of issues, I refer the reader to How to Read a Shakespearean Play Text by Eugene Giddens (Cambridge University Press, 2011). The first quarto of Hamlet (1603) is just over half the length of the second quarto (1604) (2200 lines versus 3800 lines) and many speeches appear ""mangled"" compared to how modern readers know them. One striking example is the famous ""To be or not to be"" speech in the first quarto's seventh scene: ""To be, or not to be, I there's the point, / To Die, to sleepe, is that all? I all:/ (...)"" The first quartos of Romeo and Juliet, Henry V and Pericles have also been considered ""bad quartos"". The term was introduced by A. W. Pollard in Shakespeare Folios and Quartos (1909) and has often been challenged. The concept of ""bad quarto"" is relevant here because it influences an editor's choice of a base text. Historically, there have been different tendencies in modern Shakespeare scholarship. For a long time, editors created ""conflated editions"" of plays that were available in both quarto and folio editions. Simply put, the editor looked at both the quarto and folio texts and somehow combined them: lines that appeared in one edition but not in the other might end up in the conflated edition. Later, editors changed their approach. Currently, what used to be known as ""bad quartos"" are now treated as legitimate editions in their own right. This has led to editions that just print the quarto text, e.g. The First Quarto of Hamlet edited by Kathleen O. Irace (Cambridge University Press, 1999). There have also been editions that print a/the quarto and the folio edition side by side, e.g. King Lear: Parallel Text Edition, edited by René Weis (Longman, 1993, 2nd edition, 2010). Compared to the earlier approach, in which an editor intervened much more heavily, this has sometimes been called ""unediting"". But the choice of a base text does not solve all editorial issues, since editors also need to make decisions that affect readability: So even an editor of Hamlet who wants to use the second quarto as a base text (or use only that text because it would have been closest to Shakespeare's manuscript) would need to decide whether to regularise the spelling and punctuation and decide what to do with ""sallied"". For example, should ""sallied"" be left in place and glossed as a variant of ""sullied"" or should it be replaced by ""sullied"" for the sake of readability? Or when using the Folio as a base text, is it possible to adduce arguments to replace ""solid"" with the quarto's ""sallied"" or even ""sullied""? T. J. B. Spencer's edition (New Penguin Shakespeare, 1980) uses the second quarto (Q2) as a base text and uses a number of lines and readings from the Folio (F). As his ""Account of the Text"" explains: In this edition, changes made in F are admitted into the text when they seem to represent a genuine amendment of a probable error in Q2. When the changes are merely a 'modernization' of grammar or of the form of a word, the Q2 reading is usually retained. The longer passages contained in F but printed in Q2 are included. Spencer emends ""sallied"" to ""sullied"": Q2 reads 'sallied' (which could be a spelling of sullied). F reads 'solid', which contrasts well with melt, | Thaw, and resolve itself... and until the twentieth century was generally preferred by editors. But it may have an unpleasantly comic effect, especially if Richard Burbage, the actor who first played Hamlet, were putting on weight (compare He's fat and scant of breath, V.2.281). Sullied fits well into the feeling of contamination expressed by Hamlet; and for sullies (F 'sulleyes') at II.1.39. Q2 has the spelling 'sallies'. Harold Jenkins (Arden Shakespeare, 1982) also uses the second quarto as a base text (see ""The Editorial Problem and the Present Text"" in the introduction). Like Spencer, Jenkins prints ""sullied"". The decision is discussed in one of the ""longer notes"" near the end of the volume (pages 436-438), which notes that this ""is the most debated reading in the play in recent years."" He admits that ""solid"" would also be apt in this context and cites lines from Henry IV, part two, III.1, as a parallel (emphasis added): that one might (...) 
(...) see (...) 
the continent 
Weary of solide firmenesse melt it selfe 
Into the sea, (...) Citing S. Warhaft, Jenkins mentions that ""solid"" also makes sense in the context of the theory of humours. He then goes on to provide arguments in favour of ""sullied"": The textual evidence for sullied, ..., cannot be dismissed. For sallied is less likely to be a corruption of solid than the other way about, and though Q2 may have derived it from Q1, this suggests that solid did not occur in Q2's manuscript authority, while Q1 is against it having been familiar in performance (...). Further, the fact that Q2 sallied here and sallies at II.i.40 occur in the work of different compositors argues for a manuscript origin. G. R. Hibbard's edition (Oxford Shakespeare, 1987) use the First Folio text as a base text and therefore has ""solid"". This decision is discussed in a long note near the end of the volume (pages 382-384). Until John Dover Wilson's The Manuscript of Shakespeare's Hamlet and the Problems of its Transmission (2 volumes, 1934), editors had usually preferred the Folio's ""solid"" over the quarto reading. After Wilson's 1934 monograph and his Hamlet edition of the same year, editors began to prefer the Second Quarto's ""sallied"", which Wilson took for a misprint of ""sullied"". Hibbard provides several arguments to favour ""solid"" over ""sallied"" or ""sullied"": Cyrus Hoy's edition (Norton Critical Editions, W. W. Norton, second edition, 1992) considers the second quarto as the most authoritative version of the play (page 103): For all its typographical imperfections, the second quarto gives as a text of Hamlet that must be regarded as superior to that of the folio, not only because it is fuller, but because it is closer to a Shakespearean manuscript source. Hoy prints ""sallied"" (not ""sullied""!) with the following footnote: ""Sallied"" is the reading of Q2 (and Q1). F reads ""solid"". Since Hamlet's primary concern is with the fact of the flesh's impurity, not with its corporeality, the choice between Q and F clearly lies with Q. ""Sally"" is a legitimate sixteenth-century form of ""sully""; it occurs in Dekker's Patient Grissil (I.i.12), printed in 1603, as F. T. Bowers has pointed out (in ""Hamlet's 'Sullied' or 'Solid' Flesh. A Bibliographical Case-History"", Shakespeare Survey 9 [1956]: p. 44); and it occurs as a noun at II.i.39 of Hamlet. Based on this non-representative sample of editions, ""sallied"" seems to have been the most frequently preferred reading since John Dover Wilson's 1934 monograph on and edition of the play. However, Shakespeare scholars appear to have been moving away from the idea that the quartos have greater authority over the folio or vice versa, or that it is possible to establish once and for all which version comes closest to what Shakespeare wrote (especially when considering that Shakespeare may have revised his texts after the quarto publication)."
What was Captain Hook's name before losing his hand?,"The text suggests that he was originally a well-known figure (known for something other than being a villainous pirate), probably from the English aristocracy: He was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the quietude of the night. It was because he was so terribly alone. This inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs. They were socially inferior to him. Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze; but as those who read between the lines must already have guessed, he had been at a famous public school; and its traditions still clung to him like garments, with which indeed they are largely concerned. Thus it was offensive to him even now to board a ship in the same dress in which he grappled her, and he still adhered in his walk to the school’s distinguished slouch. But above all he retained the passion for good form. -- Chapter 14, ""The Pirate Ship"" (emphasis mine) (A note on terminology: ""public school"" in the British sense does not mean a public-sector school; it refers to an elite group of private schools, including Eton, Winchester, Harrow, and Rugby. This is where the children of the British ruling class are educated.) I doubt that Barrie has a particular person in mind when writing this passage; probably it was just for effect, to give Hook an air of mystique and add more depth to his character. Certainly his public-school background and adherence to ""good form"" does give him more depth, and (at least in my view) it's one of the more memorable things about him, making him more than just a villainous murderer. And to give him a specific name, link him to an actual real-life figure of the British aristocracy, would take away from that mystique. It's better for the story that we don't know his true name; then each reader can exercise their own imagination to come up with whichever possibility would be most interesting or scandalous for them."
"Why does the poem ""Naming of Parts"" contrast war with nature?","This question is best answered using a technique called close reading. So unfortunately, if you're just looking for an answer about the poem ""Naming of Parts"", you're going to have to read about close reading first. But since close reading is a useful and important concept that explains so much about literature, I think you will find it worth your while! Close reading is a way of reading a text that is completely different from how you would normally read. When you read normally, the words enter into your mind and you remember the general idea of what the words say. But when you read normally, you don't pay much attention to each individual word itself, or the order and arrangement of the words, or to the punctuation. Close reading is the opposite. When you close read, you ignore the big picture and focus on the little details. This means asking questions such as:  These little details may seem insignificant. But it's the little details that contain the most information. Resist the urge to think about the big picture, at least right away. The big picture will emerge slowly from the little details. Another difference between close reading and normal reading is speed. You may be a slow reader, you may be a fast reader, but when you read normally, your eyes move from left to right, and you don't go backwards unless you missed something. Close reading is different. Because you're focusing on all these little details, you will spend a lot of time close reading a very small passage of text. And you won't just be reading left to right: you'll have to move backwards, reread things, underline things, and pause and think about things. For this reason, close reading is typically done with a very small passage. That passage can range in size from a single sentence to a few paragraphs. But unless you have a lot of time on your hands, you aren't going to close read an entire novel. For this reason, this answer will only focus on the fourth and fifth stanzas of ""Naming of Parts."" I'm focusing on these stanzas because I find them the most interesting. Here they are below: And this you can see is the bolt. The purpose of this
  Is to open the breech, as you see. We can slide it
  Rapidly backwards and forwards: we call this
  Easing the spring. And rapidly backwards and forwards
  The early bees are assaulting and fumbling the flowers
      They call it easing the Spring. They call it easing the Spring: it is perfectly easy
  If you have any strength in your thumb: like the bolt,
  And the breech, and the cocking-piece, and the point of balance,
  Which in our case we have not got; and the almond-blossom
  Silent in all of the gardens and the bees going backwards and forwards,
      For today we have naming of parts. One last thing about close reading. Don't close read on a computer. Print out the passage you want to close read. That way, you can underline words and jot down notes. Trust me, it helps. So now that we understand what close reading is, the next step is to actually close read the fourth and fifth stanzas of ""Naming of Parts."" To do this, I need to print out the passage, look at all the tiny little details, move backwards and forwards through the text, and write down my notes. I need to ask questions of the little details: what are the exact meanings of this word? Why is this word capitalized? What is the purpose of this period? I asked all of these questions, and took notes on a piece of paper. I then typed up my notes, which I reproduce below: The word spring has several connotations: it can mean the season, it can mean to spring (i.e. to jump), or it can mean a spring (an object that if pushed or pulled, will return to its original shape). The line ""They call it easing the Spring"" is emphasized by its indentation and the fact that it is at the end of the fourth stanza. The repetition with variation of the phrase ""we call this \ Easing the spring"" v. ""They call it easing the Spring"" is interesting. The change in pronouns seems to be important. A bolt could be interpreted as a phallic object (i.e. it looks like a penis). A ""breech"" can mean a crack in something, which could be interpreted as a vulvic or yonic object (i.e. it looks like a vagina -- BTW here's a discussion of whether vagina or vulva is the more appropriate term to use in this context, and here's a Stack Exchange question about whether vulvic or yonic is the more appropriate term to use). The phrase ""rapidly backwards and forwards"" is repeated twice, making it hard to miss.  The first time the phrase ""rapidly backwards and forwards"" is mentioned, it is in the context of instructions for how to use the ""bolt"". Given the symbolism of the bold and the breech, it's pretty clear that ""slide it rapidly backwards and forwards"" is a reference to sex. The second time the phrase ""rapidly backwards and forwards"" is mentioned, it's in the context of ""And rapidly backwards and forwards / The early bees are assaulting and fumbling the flowers.""  Bees and flowers have a sexual relationship: bees transfer pollen from one flower to another, which allows the plants to reproduce. Given the fact that this stanza is filled with sexual references, when I hear the words ""fumbling"" and ""assaulting,"" especially after the phrase ""rapidly backwards and forwards,"" I immediately think of how those words can describe sex. In list item #3 I mention the change in pronouns between ""we call this / Easing the spring"" and. ""They call it easing the Spring"". The we and they creates an us and them affect in the poem: ""we"" is identified with the military trainees, and the pronoun ""they"" is used to refer to the bees (""The early bees are assaulting and fumbling the flowers / They call it easing the Spring."") and thus to nature. The effect of this is to identify the humans as separate and different from nature: nature is not considered part of the group identified with the pronoun ""we"". However, the comparison is also a very strange one. Why on earth contrast human sexuality to non-human sexuality? Those are two very different things. The poem also comments on the inadequacy of the soldiers. The poem lists ""the point of balance"" as an important element of the weapon (it's one of the parts that is named), but tells us that ""Which in our case we have not got"" the point of balance. To be balanced, one needs to be calm and controlled; not being balanced means being clumsy.  Depending on how you read the poem, it either teases or encourages the soldiers. The soldiers are told that ""easing the spring... is perfectly easy / If you have any strength in your thumb."" Telling someone that something is easy can encourage them (it's easy; you can do it!) or discourage them (it's easy; why can't you do it?). The poem deliberately obscures the full context of this phrase to create this ambiguity. Nature is described as ""the almond-blossom / Silent in all of the gardens."" This is in direct contrast to the soldiers naming (i.e. speaking out loud) the various parts of their weapon. The sexual references in the poem are about watching sex. With the phrase ""as you see"", the poem implies that someone is demonstrating how ""The purpose of [the bolt] / Is to open the breech"" and that we are observing. There is no indication that the narrator is doing anything, the narrator is simply watching. The instructions (the ""naming of parts"") are designed for a masculine audience. The soldiers are instructed on how to use the phallic bolt (""We can slide it / Rapidly backwards and forwards"") but not on the use of the yonic breech. I want to return to the phrase ""easing the Spring"" which I discussed in list items #1 and #2. A spring is something that goes back and forth; given the amount of sexual references in this stanza alone, and the frequent references to ""rapidly backwards and forwards (which perfectly describes a spring's motion) it seems reasonable to interpret the word ""Spring"" not just as a season but as another reference to sex. This interpretation is supported by the placement of the word ""easing"" next to the word ""Spring"": easing can imply slowly moving something, which is another reference to sex in the context of the phrase ""We can slide it / Rapidly backwards and forwards."" I could honestly go on for at least twenty more bullet points. I'm going to stop now because this answer has to end sometime.  The close reading is finished! We have the little details. But we aren't done yet. My notes aren't coherent, and there is no overarching argument--the big picture--that can make sense of these little details. To fix this, we will use the little details as pieces of evidence to support a larger argument. What the larger argument is is up to you, but you need to support your argument with evidence from your close reading. Otherwise, it's an opinion, not an argument. The following paragraphs represent my final argument about ""Naming of Parts,"" based on the evidence I found using close reading. (It functions as my answer to the OP's original question): Reed's poem ""Naming of Parts"" contrasts nature with war as a way of critiquing the culture surrounding the military. The poem uses metaphor to make a parallel between learning to use weapons and sex. The narrator's inexperience with both subjects is evidenced by the fact that he (the soldier is only instructed in phallic weaponry) observes rather than participates. Therefore, this poem describes an initiation rite, where violence (using a weapon) is a necessary component in sexual maturity and thus adulthood. Among other things, this poem implies a commentary on the gendered violence of the military, a commentary justified by the military's sexual assault epidemic, as well as the use of systematic rape as a military tactic.  The comparison between the military and nature serves to emphasize the strangeness, alienness, and absurdity of the situation. As the military conducts its initiation rite, it is contrasted with an image of sexual relationships in nature. This image is foreign, and its foreignness is emphasized by the contrast between ""we"" (the soldiers) and ""them"" (nature); the poem supposes that nature is fundamentally separate from the soldiers. In addition, nature is ""silent"" and has ""balance"" while the soldiers are inadequate (""it is perfectly easy / If you have any strength in your thumb""). While the soldiers struggle with the initiation rite, an alternative exists. The nature portrayed in the poem doesn't need a rite: it is self-assured and doesn't need to learn because it merely exists. This contrast highlights the absurdity of the soldiers, their initiation rite, and their violence. So that's close reading! I hope this answer was interesting, and I hope you walk away with an understanding of how close reading is a powerful tool that can answer all sorts of interesting questions about literary texts. If you have questions about any of this, please ask! As you read my answer, you may have disagreed with some of my interpretations of the text. You may also have thought of interpretations that I completely overlooked. That's completely normal. Different people will notice different things. In my opinion, close reading is best done as a collaborative exercise: that way no stone is left unturned. If you're interested in learning more about how and why people read the same text differently, there's a great tool called ""reader response criticism"" that I hope to discuss on this site at a later point. Finally, I want to emphasize that learning how to close read is like learning how to read normally. It takes time and practice. If you want to learn to close read, I encourage you to find a passage you find interesting and just try close reading. See what you can do. And keep trying. You won't get anywhere without practice."

Mais, la verité est toujours tellement ennuyante que pour les journalistes j'ai inventé la fiction que j'étais sur, dans un autobus de Londres, et j'ai vû un magasin de chaussures et il s'appelait le magasin ""John Le Carré"", j'ai volé le nom, mais c'est un mensonge. In English: Interviewer: First, something obvious enough: your real name is David John Moore Cornwell, but you chose for a pseudonym a name which sounds rather French—Le Carré—why? Le Carré: So, I will tell you the truth, and then I will tell you a lie! The truth is that I was, at the time I made my début as a writer, I was still in the Foreign Office and someone said to me that it was the official view, that it was necessary to choose a pen name. So, I went to my editor, and he said, ""so, choose something very simple, very Anglo-Saxon: Jack Smith, Herb Brown, etc."" And then, I chose ""John Le Carré"". And the truth, is that I do not know where this name comes from. But, the truth is always so boring that for journalists I invented the fiction that I was on, in a London bus, and I saw a shoe shop and it was called ""John Le Carré"", and I stole the name, but it's a lie."
What was the earlier expose of racism that Twain wrote that was censored?,"I think that this references the same incident described by Shelley Fisher Fishkin in her essay Mark Twain, Race, and Huckleberry Finn. Fishkin notes that in Huckleberry Finn, Twain ""explored  the  subject  of  racism through satire and irony"" a strategy he developed ""when a direct expose of racism that he wrote was censored"" - very similar to the wording of the article cited in the question. Fishkin describes the events as follows. As  a  young  reporter  in  San  Francisco  in  the  mid-1860s,  Twain
witnessed  an  incident  he  considered  outrageous:  several
policemen stood idly by, apparently amused, as young white hooligans
attacked a Chinese man who was going about his business. Twain’s
publishers refused to run the account he wrote of the incident, caring
more about not  offending  the  paper’s  subscribers  (who  shared
the  police’s prejudices) than about the truth. Twain quickly
learned that exposés of racism in San Francisco would not be printed
in newspapers there. The incident concerns racism rather than slavery, but it seems to be relevant to the ironic form that Finn took, and definitely involves censorship. In The Autobiography of Mark Twain, the text is quoted as: One Sunday afternoon I saw some hoodlums chasing and stoning a
Chinaman who was heavily laden with the weekly wash of his Christian
customers, and I noticed that a policeman was observing this
performance with an amused interest—nothing more. According to Mark Twain’s Racial Ideologies and His Portrayal of the Chinese, an article published by Hsin-yun Ou (Concentric: Literary and Cultural Studies 36.2Sept. 2010: 33-59) Twain rewrote the story with a satirical strategy of irony, and
published it in a paper in  the  next  state  and  in  a  national
magazine. In  “What  Have  the  Police Been Doing?”  (Territorial
Enterprise [Virginia  City],  Jan.  16-18,  1866),  the  narrator,
posing  as  the  policemen’s  loyal  friend,  satirizes  corrupt
police  officers  who constantly victimized the local Chinese
population."
Dickens invented the scary clown?,"The claim that ‘Dickens invented the scary clown’ seems to be rooted in the work of Andrew McConnel Scott, Professor of English at the University of Buffalo, through his paper ‘Clowns on the Verge of a nervous breakdown: Dickens coulrophobia and the Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi' where Through a focus on the career of the British pantomimist Joseph Grimaldi (1778–1837) and a reading of his Memoirs (1838), edited posthumously by Charles Dickens, this essay seeks to demonstrate that what we often term coulrophobia (the fear of clowns) has its origins in a narrative of memorializing that takes place in the midst of rapid social change. Just to set the scene a little, Grimaldi is credited with being the essential creator of clowns as we know them today, including being the originator of whiteface make-up.
Per Wikipedia: J. S. Grimaldi: In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of Clown in the harlequinade that formed part of British pantomimes, notably at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and the Sadler's Wells and Covent Garden theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that the harlequinade role of Clown became known as ""Joey"", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns.
Dickens was invited to edit and improve an existing ‘clumsily written life of Grimaldi, which had been based on the clown's own notes’, which Dickens did under his regular nom de plume, ""Boz"". According to an article on the Smithsonian Magazine website ""The History and Psychology of Clowns Being Scary"" (by Linda Rodriguez McRobbie, July 31, 2013): Grimaldi’s real life was anything but comedy—he’d grown up with a tyrant of a stage father; he was prone to bouts of depression; his first wife died during childbirth; his son was an alcoholic clown who’d drank himself to death by age 31; and Grimaldi’s physical gyrations, the leaps and tumbles and violent slapstick that had made him famous, left him in constant pain and prematurely disabled. As Grimaldi himself joked, “I am GRIM ALL DAY, but I make you laugh at night.” In his essay Stott states: Dickens shared a suspicion of theatricality with many of his contemporaries, even to the extent of viewing performance as an “inherently destructive endeavor,” in which the ideal of sympathetic imagination so prized by Romantic theater critics was viewed as “antithetical to reason, deliberation and control” by the generation that followed (Woods 144).23 In the case of clowns, this distrust is redoubled by his view of pantomime clowning as not just anachronistic, but also somehow constituting an affront toward the cherished memories of childhood. To this end, Dickens can be considered one of the first artists to substantively represent clowning in terms that were to significantly influence later formulations of coulrophobia. Referencing the reference to a beggar in clown’s attire in the Pickwick Papers, he goes on to say In what is certainly the first example of “dark carnival” in English literature, “Stroller’s Tale” portrays the clown as a monstrous contradiction, a ghoul disfigured by the immorality of the man who plays him and who later dies in a fit of terrifying hallucinations that blur fiction with reality. It is the foundational statement of coulrophobia: all humor having fled, the object of spectatorship resents being watched, is unable to differentiate between the play world and the real world, and transposes his personal demons onto the supposed joviality of his mask. The Smithsonian article, referencing the work of Stott states that he goes ‘so far as to say that Dickens invented the scary clown’ by creating a figure who is literally destroying himself to make his audiences laugh. What Dickens did was to make it difficult to look at a clown without wondering what was going on underneath the make-up: Says Stott, “It becomes impossible to disassociate the character from the actor.” That Dickens’s version of Grimaldi’s memoirs was massively popular meant that this perception, of something dark and troubled masked by humor, would stick.

"How familiar would the ""Blind men and an elephant"" tale be in the West?","The story of the Blind Men and the Elephant is well-known in the West. Perhaps mostly due to the version of the tale written by John Godfrey Saxe, a 19th-century US poet who retold the story as a poem, attributing it to ""a Hindoo fable""; you can read his version here. It's also been told as a song in a 21st-century album by a US singer. Wikipedia also mentions other retellings and references to this story throughout western culture, in everything from scientific literature to children's stories (all with citations): The story is seen as a metaphor in many disciplines, being pressed into service as an analogy in fields well beyond the traditional. In physics, it has been seen as an analogy for the wave–particle duality.[19] In biology, the way the blind men hold onto different parts of the elephant has been seen as a good analogy for the Polyclonal B cell response.[20] [...] The story enjoys a continuing appeal, as shown by the number of illustrated children's books of the fable; there is one for instance by Paul Galdone and another, Seven Blind Mice, by Ed Young (1992). [...] Touching the Elephant was a 1997 BBC Radio 4 documentary in which four people of varying ages, all blind from birth, were brought to London Zoo to touch an elephant and describe their response.[24] So I don't think you need to replace it by another story. It will do perfectly well as it stands."
Did the mechanical hound signify anything in Fahrenheit 451?,"It's a symbol of how good, useful tools we grant to or accept from our government can quickly and easily become tools of oppression. As an example, some would argue that modern US equivalent of this might be the NSA. Mechanical Hounds were, as Easterly Irk notes, a useful invention, originally. They've found people who might be injured or unconscious. They were good tools. However, as time went on, they grew increasingly oppressive. The government took the technology, what started out as a strong positive influence in the world of Fahrenheit 451, and encouraged its use for illicit purposes, abusing it to suppress free thought."
Was Rowling inspired by the railway station scene in Prince Caspian?,"Oddly enough, Rowling has cited The Chronicles of Narnia as an inspiration for her King's Cross entryway to the world of magic, but not the part you're thinking of! I found myself thinking about the wardrobe route to Narnia when Harry is told he has to hurl himself at a barrier in Kings Cross Station - it dissolves and he's on platform Nine and Three-Quarters, and there's the train for Hogwarts. Source: an interview she did for the Sydney Morning Herald in 2001. She's also claimed, in a piece of ""writing by J. K. Rowling"" on Pottermore, that she chose King's Cross as the point of entry for getting to Hogwarts because of its personal significance to her: King’s Cross, which is one of London’s main railway stations, has a very personal significance for me, because my parents met on a train to Scotland which departed from King’s Cross station. For this reason, and because it has such an evocative and symbolic name, and because it is actually the right station to leave from if you were heading to Caledonia, I never knew the slightest indecision about the location of the portal that would take Harry to Hogwarts, or the means of transport that would take him there. (It's possible that both of these are true - she could have been inspired by her personal/family history to use King's Cross, and inspired by Narnia to have Harry hurl himself at a wall - but if we're to take them as conflicting pieces of evidence, I'd much rather rely on the earlier statement from an interview than the later one from Pottermore. I'm frankly doubtful that all of those pieces of ""writing by J. K. Rowling"" on Pottermore were really written by her, and even if so, she seems to be putting less care into her new additions to the Potterverse lore these days than she did back when she was writing the books. It's worth noting that she misremembered King's Cross when writing the platform scene.)"
African dystopia with children on the run,"You stated in chat that you found it (and asked someone to post an answer): The Ear, the Eye and the Arm by Nancy Farmer.  From Wikipedia: In the year 2194, in Zimbabwe, the Chief of Security, General Matsika, leads a battle against the gangs which terrorize the nation. His three children, Tendai, Rita, and Kuda are kept in a fortified mansion to ensure their security. Seeking adventure to earn the Scout Badge, they escape the house with the help of the Mellower, a praise singer employed by their parents. The children then find themselves in the busy streets of Mbare Musika, where they are kidnapped and taken to Dead Man's Vlei, the lair of the She Elephant. There, they have to work in the plastic mines. ...  While the Masks attempt to sacrifice Tendai as a messenger to the gods, Arm is possessed by a mhondoro, a holy and legendary spirit of the land, who helps him to find the children. When Arm is knocked out, the mhondoro helps Tendai and his friends to temporarily destroy the Big-Head Mask, which had been going to kill Tendai. When the children's parents arrive, the She Elephant crushes the Mask, and the mhondoro revives Arm. The gang is destroyed and their stolen wealth is redistributed among the poor; while General Matsika finally realizes that his children need more freedom."
Should Go Set A Watchman be read before To Kill A Mockingbird?,"Definitely read To Kill a Mockingbird first. Although Go Set a Watchman reads more as a first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, without reading Mockingbird, much of the bigotry Atticus displays in Watchman will not be unusual. In Mockingbird, Atticus is portrayed as a hero defending the underprivileged blacks, and in Watchman, that illusion of him is completely shattered. They're both great reads, but reading To Kill a Mockingbird first allows you to have a greater conceptual understanding and appreciation for Go Set a Watchman."

"Meaning of ""all the boards did shrink"" in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner","You are correct in that the boards are the planks of wood from which the ship is constructed.  Although nautically, ""boards"" is more often used to refer to the decking than to the hull. In hot dry conditions, wood will shrink.  It was common in the 18th Century for wooden sailing ships travelling from Europe to the tropics to suffer shrinkage of the deck boards.  This often required the decks to be recaulked to prevent leaks. Later, wood treatment improved.  Significantly reducing the risk of such shrinkage. So the phrase is being used to set the scene of hot weather."

Identify a story about murders of homeless people,"Stone Cold, by Robert Swindells?  Stone Cold is a realistic young-adult novel by Robert Swindells, published by Heinemann in 1993. Set on the streets of London, the first-person narrative switches between Link, a newly homeless sixteen-year-old adjusting to his situation, and Shelter, an ex-army officer scorned after being dismissed from his job, supposedly on 'medical grounds'. Just from that Wikipedia blurb, we see that it's a newly homeless person, up against an ex-army officer, who wants to kill the homeless people. And Penguin Books has this to say: A tense thriller plot is combined with a perceptive and harrowing portrait of life on the streets as a serial killer preys on the young and vulnerable homeless. Link, aged 17, is distrustful of people until he pairs up with Deb, another homeless youngster. But what Deb doesn't tell him is that she's an ambitious young journalist on a self-imposed assignment to track down the killer and she's prepared to use herself as bait... Deb appears to match your description of the girl in the story."
Would a reader of Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea miss anything essential without knowing about Jane Eyre?,"Yes, a reader of Wide Sargasso Sea who is unaware of its connection to Jane Eyre is pretty much guaranteed to have missed the entire point of the novel. Jane Eyre is so iconic that Rhys could simply assume knowledge of its plot while writing her own book. The heroine of Wide Sargasso Sea, her husband, and her half-brother are all very important characters in Brontë's novel. Without prior knowledge of those characters as they are in Jane Eyre, one would not get much out of Rhys's work. The power of Wide Sargasso Sea is that it forces us not merely to rethink where our sympathies lie vis-à-vis those characters in Brontë, but also to re-evaluate the entire world view that Brontë as well as her readers (ourselves included) take unquestioningly for granted. So closely does Rhys's novel depend on  Brontë's that there's no way to discuss their relationship without spoilers. Spoiler alert: the following reveals important plot points about both Jane Eyre and Wide Sargasso Sea. In Jane Eyre, the eponymous heroine falls in love with her employer, a rich man named Mr Rochester. She is a governess in his household. She has noticed some mysterious goings-on: strange laughter, an unexplained murderous attack on one of Rochester's guests, etc. But she accepts the stated explanation that a drunken servant named Grace Poole is responsible for these events. When Jane and Rochester are in the church about to be married, it is revealed, shockingly, that Rochester in fact already has a wife. She is a rich Caribbean heiress named Bertha Mason, and Rochester says he was ""tricked"" by his father into marrying her for her money. But as his father knew, Bertha is mad. So Rochester has kept his wife shut up in the attic. Grace Poole is in fact the servant who looks after Bertha, and the latter is the one responsible for the mysterious incidents. Brontë's novel has no sympathy for Bertha. She is simply the inconvenient impediment that keeps Rochester and Jane apart. She cannot be a true wife to him, but prevents him from being able to marry the woman he truly loves. Ultimately she is responsible for burning down his house, killing herself and grievously injuring him in the process. Indeed, Rochester is supposed to be the sympathetic figure. Poor man, tied to a mad wife! Thwarted in his true love because of a marriage he was tricked into! Nice enough to keep the lunatic at home instead of dumping her in an asylum! Punished for his attempted bigamy by being blinded and rendered lame while attempting to rescue the cray-cray bitch from a fire she set herself! Wide Sargasso Sea neatly inverts these sympathies by showing us Bertha's point of view and telling her back story. Despised by the English for being a colonial; shut out of Jamaican society by virtue of being white and identifying with the English; married off to a cold and manipulative Englishman who carts her off to a cold and lonely island. Her husband becomes tremendously rich because of her money, then locks her up in the attic with nobody but a drunken servant for company; he then proceeds to have a love affair with the governess and is on the point of bigamy. Jane Eyre is popularly regarded as a feminist heroine because of her independent-mindedness, but Rhys shows that the feminist independence of Jane, and the eventual triumph of her ""true love"" with Rochester, depend on the unacknowledged suffering of those who were exploited by Victorian imperialism and mercantilism. Being from the West Indies herself, she saw the violence inherent in the vast mechanisms of trade. The mercantile wealth of Victorian England was built on various sorts of exploitation: slavery, colonialism, sexism. Rochester's wealth comes from his wife, who in turn inherits it from her stepfather, who ran a plantation in Jamaica where slaves worked. Jane too inherits money from a distant relative who has become rich in the West Indies. The source of this tremendous wealth goes unexamined in Brontë, because imperial exploitation was an unremarkable fact in the Victorian world-view. But by retelling the well-worn narrative from a fresh perspective, Rhys opens our eyes and causes us to reassess our values. tl;dr Read Jane Eyre, then re-read Wide Sargasso Sea to get what the latter novel is really about."

Is it common practice for cover art to be designed without direct input from the author?,"In my experience, having worked in-house in the publishing industry for more than 10 years, it is quite usual for the cover to be decided by anyone other than the author. It's usually done through consultations in long meetings between the publisher, production and marketing who have commissioned designers to make about a zillion options.   I imagine once authors are sufficiently popular, however, they may be able to make a suggestion. Edited to add: I am involved in educational and academic publishing in Australia. Our covers are done by designers rather than illustrators – except in the case of children's books. Even then, an illustrator is usually commissioned by the publisher. The author is certainly welcome to make suggestions for the cover illustration, but again, the ultimate decision remains largely with the publisher/ marketing."
"Whose were the ""best minds"" being destroyed in Ginsberg's ""Howl""?","My view of Howl is that the first lines are the introduction to the first part, painting an image with a broad brush, and that the next follows on in more detail. In fact, we can take all of Part I as commentary on its subjects' actions, which means that we can actually figure out a lot of what those best minds did. Most of them were Beat poets or members of the rising counterculture tide that swept across the country in the next decade or two. Here are just a few: who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge That would be Tuli Kupferberg, a fellow Beat poet and artist who jumped off the Manhattan Bridge in 1944 at the age of 21. The idea that it was the Brooklyn Bridge was perpetuated in part by Ginsburg. who sang out of their windows in despair, fell out of the subway window . . . This entire section (and beyond) refers to Bill Cannastra, who awkwardly jumped out of a subway window for reasons involving liquor and died by decapitation. Cannastra was energetic, a drinker, a partier, and extremely smart. His death and his personality are referenced in the writings of several Beat poets, including John Clellon Holmes and Jack Kerouac. who went out whoring through Colorado in myriad stolen night-cars, N.C., secret hero of these poems, cocksman and Adonis of Denver . . . This is Neal Cassady, a Beat poet and close friend of Jack Kerouac, known for his extensive drug use. It may have led to his death, in 1968. Cassady was viewed similarly to Cannastra, and their deaths while still young (though Cassady died much later) drove this home. who threw potato salad at CCNY lecturers on Dadaism. . . This incident pertains to Carl Solomon, who strongly influenced and inspired the poem (including Part III). His psychiatric problems in particular and Ginsberg's reactions to them play a large role in this part, and of course show up earlier. Solomon's actual madness is seen again in the collective figurative madness of the rest of the Beat Generation; his suffering is their suffering. There are plenty of other allusions to real-life incidents and people - these are only a few. The entire group was largely composed of the artists and writers and poets that Ginsberg knew firsthand, or through other friends. They collectively make up the ""madness"" that Ginsberg saw - in particular, in Solomon. He feels that he sees the madness and destructive tendencies in all the artists and poets and non-conformists around him. The point, though, is that he is attributing the madness to the societal conditions of the time - which is what Howl is all about!"
The name of a poem about a poet being happy that someone has forgotten the title of their poem,"I actually found it myself. I remembered the collection I had read it in and searched through it. It is The Secret by Denise Levertov. Two girls discover

Does the Abrahamic God exist in the Cthulhu Mythos?,"Not in the mythos as Lovecraft conceived it It is hard to prove a negative: there is no categorical statement in Lovecraft's oeuvre that definitively rejects the Abrahamic God. Even if there was, since it is fiction the writer would be free to change their mind from tale to tale as it suited. Nevertheless, we can say with some certainty that it was not Lovecraft's intention for three key reasons. It stood against what he felt was the source of horror Lovecraft's key aim in writing horror stories was to make the reader feel small and powerless. He was constantly at pains to emphasise how feeble humanity was in the face of the impossible cosmic horrors lurking at the edge of our ""guarded threshold"". He explained this many times in essays and letters. The true weird tale has something more than secret murder, bloody bones, or a sheeted form clanking chains according to rule. A certain atmosphere of breathless and unexplainable dread of outer, unknown forces must be present; and there must be a hint, expressed with a seriousness and portentousness becoming its subject, of that most terrible conception of the human brain — a malign and particular suspension or defeat of those fixed laws of Nature which are our only safeguard against the assaults of chaos and the daemons of unplumbed space. The ""fixed laws of Nature"" would be the preserve of a benevolent God. The basis of all true cosmic horror is violation of the order of nature, and the profoundest violations are always the least concrete and describable. Again, God here would be master of the ""order of nature"". The world is indeed comic, but the joke is on mankind. This would seem a direct rejection of the concept of a loving creator-God. Horrors, I believe, should be original - the use of common myths and legends being a weakening influence. It's perhaps a stretch but the Biblical testament could be seen among the ""common myths and legends"". In all of this, we have to note that the Abrahamic God is supposed to care for humanity and to be all-powerful. If people in Lovecraft's mythos could call on the support of a loving and omnipotent deity with confidence, it would weaken the effect of horror he was seeing to achieve. Even if that God were unreachable and somehow allowed such cosmic terrors to exist in the universe where they held dominion, the existence of such a being would bring spiritual comfort, at odds with the chasms of lunacy Lovecraft sought to portray as yawning under his protagonists. There already was a supreme being Several of Lovecraft's tales discuss the being Azathoth. They are pretty unequivocal that this being was the ultimate ruler of the mythos. He must meet the Black Man, and go with them all to the throne of Azathoth at the centre of ultimate Chaos ... to the throne of Chaos where the thin flutes pipe mindlessly was the fact that he had seen the name 'Azathoth' in the Necronomicon, and knew it stood for a primal horror too horrible for description the ancient legends of Ultimate Chaos, at whose center sprawls the blind idiot god Azathoth, Lord of All Things, encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers, and lulled by the thin monotonous piping of a demonic flute held in nameless paws"" If this madly chaotic creature is ""Lord of All Things"", it doesn't leave much room for the Abrahamic God to share that title. Again, it's worth referencing the effect of Azathoth in terms of Lovecraft's goals for horror stories listed in point one. By reducing the ""Lord of All Things"" to a gibbering wreck, it makes a nonsense of mankind's desire to see order and meaning in the universe. A God who created the universe for a fixed purpose, however unknowable, stands in opposition to this source of horror. Lovecraft himself was an atheist In a 1932 letter to Robert E Howard he wrote All I say is that I think it is damned unlikely that anything like a central cosmic will, a spirit world, or an eternal survival of personality exist. They are the most preposterous and unjustified of all the guesses which can be made about the universe, and I am not enough of a hairsplitter to pretend that I don't regard them as arrant and negligible moonshine. In theory, I am an agnostic, but pending the appearance of radical evidence I must be classed, practically and provisionally, as an atheist. Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi goes further, noting in an interview: Lovecraft constantly engaged in (more or less) genial debates on religion with several colleagues, notably the pious writer and teacher Maurice W. Moe. Lovecraft was a strong and antireligious atheist; he considered religion not merely false but dangerous to social and political progress. It seems very unlikely that someone taking such a strong stance on the existence of God, especially in a far more religious age than our current one, would specifically seek to verify the reality of God in their fiction."
Did Cummings' editors try to fix his works' eccentricities?,"They cut his work a lot, and he couldn't do much about it. His first book of poetry, Tulips and Chimneys (T&C), was especially edited. The original manuscript contained 152 poems, but only 86 were actually published in the books. The others were published two years later in 1925 under the title '&' - Cummings wanted the original book to be titled 'Tulips & Chimneys (with an ampersand)' but was overruled by his editor - Thomas Seltzer. Thomas changed the title to just Tulips and Chimneys, and then published the later poems under the title & (changing 'ampersand' to just 'and') When Cummings reviewed the cut-down T&C, he was unhappy. However, he conceded, but insisted that the original order of the poems was kept. So in answer to your question - yes, they knew about his intent and disagreed. I assume thy had conversations about it though. Sources: 1, 2, 3 and 4"
Is there evidence of anti-Semitism in Dostoyevsky's books?,"I'm not well acquainted with most of Dostoevsky's writings, but The House of the Dead stands out as a controversial case. In it, we see the character Isay Fomitch Bumstein, who worked as both a jeweler and a pawnbroker (close enough to the stereotypical Jewish moneylender). Apart from his job, Dostoevsky's physical characterization of Bumstein is not quite flattering. This short essay puts together some criticisms of the jeweler's appearance: As Goldstein states, ""The caricature quality of the portrait is potent, and the intention of the author is unmistakably clear: to laugh at the little Jew and provoke laughter at his expense.""6 Dostoevsky reminds us that Isay Fomitch is a ""skinny, feeble, puny man of around fifty...with a white body like a chicken's"" (IX, pg. 105). Immediately after drawing this image, Dostoevsky marshals a series of moral traits which stigmatize Isay Fomitch and to a certain extent, the larger Jewish nation. He calls attention to Isay Fomitch as ""a most comical mixture of naiveté, stupidity, craft, impudence, good nature, timidity, boastfulness and insistence"" (IX, pg. 106). In Chapter X, Bumstein's first arrival to the prison actually involves moneylending, as he is intimidated into letting a convict pawn his (worthless) raggedy clothing. It would be wrong to characterize Dostoevsky's treatment of the main as wholly repugnant, but it falls squarely into the category of ""clear evidence"". As the essay points out, we also see some anti-Semitic tones in The Brothers Karamazov. While there are some minor side references to Jews in the moneylending business (again, a negative stereotype), there is one passage where a character suggests that some believe that Jews kill and eat children. While there is no clear indication that anyone treats this claims as anything but ridiculous, there is certainly no clear rejection of the general tone. Yes, you see the moneylending stereotype perpetuated on several of Dostoevsky's works. But there are additional negative characterizations - the overt characterization of Bumstein as a fool and the references to savage Jewish rituals - that seem to at least waggle some eyebrows at the phrase ""anti-Semitism"", if not point to it directly."
Why is Nausicaa named 'burner of ships'?,"I'm going to attempt an answer with the caveats that the materialists often find my etymological ideas on names to be poetic as opposed to scientific, and that I'd want to know what Graves thought but don't have access to his Greek Myths at the moment.   Gallifreyan posted an excellent link to a scholar who pondered this question.  My take on the essay is that this interpretation is very much in question.  This leads me to believe that the Wikipedia assertion is misleading in that it makes the proposed etymology ""burner of ships"" a definite, rather than a proposed, meaning.  (i.e. no one knows for sure, which is the case with many Ancient Greek names. A strictly materialist viewpoint would hold that everyone is guessing, which is why I like to check the Graves, with the idea that his guesses could be categorized as ""as good as any, better than most"", per his keen poetic insight.) The ""ka"" could be meaningless, and not based on the Greek work κάω (káō), but assuming it is based on that verb, I'll propose an alternate meaning: I propose this because one of the meanings of κάω is burning in the sense of passion. Pindar uses it in this manner, speaking of Medea:  ""...and a longing for Greece would lash her, her mind on fire...""Source: Pindar, Pythian Odes, 4.219 [Greek excerpt: ""ἐν φρασὶ καιομένα”]  This association does not seem to be merely poetic in that the The American Heritage Dictionary Indo-European Roots has an entry for kā-: kā- To like, desire. Oldest form *keh2‑, colored to *kah2‑, becoming *kā‑. This root isn't listed for Ancient Greek (although ambiguity in relation to the meaning of names is sometimes an indicator of pre-Greek origins) except loosely in the word kardia for heart.  Kardia comes from a ker root (the d is eventually dropped in the Romance languages) and the AHDIR has a subsequent entry:  ker-3 Heat, fire.  Passion or desire actually makes more sense from a narrative perspective because there is an element of romance in Odysseus' interaction with Nausicaa, who would marry him if he didn't have to return to Penelope.  She later marries Telemachus, Odysseus' son, and so I'd go so far as to propose her name could mean: because ναυτικός (nautikos) ""mariner, sailor, seaman"" is derived from ναῦς (naûs) ""ship"". Nausicaa chooses the seashore to do the washing with her handmaidens, and this is clearly not random.  The beach is a decent place to watch for sails, especially in an era where it is prudent for ships to stay in sight of land.  The beach is also a great place to keep watch for flotsam, such as shipwrecked sailors. But it occurs to me this second meaning could be inverted so that Nausicaa means: because Odysseus washes up on her beach through divine intervention, and Telemachus returns to marry her. End Note: The wikipedia entry omits Eliot's mention of her in a famous poem, which could be taken as a corroboration of the passion/desire interpretation: Paint me a cavernous waste shore / Cast in the unstilled Cyclades, / Paint me the bold anfractuous rocks / Faced by the snarled and yelping seas.    // Display me Aeolus above / Reviewing the insurgent gales / Which tangle Ariadne’s hair / And swell with haste the perjured sails. // Morning stirs the feet and hands / (Nausicaa and Polypheme) / Gesture of orang-outang / Rises from the sheets in steam // ....  "
"Why is the king 'baffled' in ""Hallelujah""?","Now, I've heard there was a secret chord
  That David played, and it pleased the Lord
  But you don't really care for music, do you?
  It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
  The minor fall, the major lift
  The baffled king composing hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Your faith was strong but you needed proof
  You saw her bathing on the roof
  Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
  She tied you to a kitchen chair
  She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
  And from your lips she drew the hallelujah I'd like to point out the second verse is all about failures. ""Your faith was strong but you needed proof"" probably references Gideon, who had God perform miracles to prove that he was really the one God wanted. ""You saw her bathing on the roof / Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya"" references, of course, David and Bathsheba - David saw her, killed Bathsheba's husband, and took her as wife. ""She tied you to a kitchen chair / She broke your throne and she cut your hair"" probably all references the story of Samson and Delilah - Samson wanted Delilah even though he'd been warned not to be with her, and then she tricked him and cut his hair, removing his God given power. His actions eventually caused his death. A lot of the Old Testament is about God choosing a hero or rescuer, and the hero, rescuer, Israel, or all of the above, failing, and God forgives again. Just look, for example, at the book of Judges (though really almost any Old Testament book would do).  David is baffled for several reasons, then: To explain #2 a little more - David was incredibly ashamed after he committed adultery with Bathsheba. In Psalm 51, listed in the NIV as ""A psalm of David. When the prophet Nathan came to him after David had committed adultery with Bathsheba"" David says Have mercy on me, O God (51:1) and later Do not cast me from your presence (51:11) In an earlier Psalm that David wrote in another time of trouble and his own sin, he writes O Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger 
  or discipline me in your wrath (38:1) and later My guilt has overwhelmed me 
  like a burden too heavy to bear (38:4) Note that the phrase ""overwhelmed me"" here reflects the phrase ""overthrew ya"" in Cohen's song. Psalm 39 continues his expression of pain and guilt, and then in Psalm 40 [...] the Lord 
  turned to me and heard my cry. 
  He lifted me out of the slimy pit, 
  out of the mud and mire; 
  he [sic] set my feet on a rock
  and gave me a firm place to stand.
  He put a new song in my mouth (40:1 - 3) In 2nd Samuel, it says Then David said to Nathan [God's prophet], ""I have sinned against the Lord."" Nathan replied, ""The Lord has taken away your sin. You are not going to die."" (2 Samuel 12:13) Normally, the penalty for adultery and murder was death, but God forgave him and removed the death penalty for him, though David was still punished. Interestingly, after David was punished (his child by Bathsheba died), he immediately washed and ""went into the house of the Lord and worshiped"" (2 Samuel 12:20), which is reminiscent of Cohen's line ""And from your lips she drew the hallelujah"" - David's sin in a way caused him to praise God. Throughout the Psalms, David's poetry alternates between begging for forgiveness, thanking God for the forgiveness, and praising God. Throughout the Psalms, David also asks God a lot of questions - showing he's quite often baffled by God's actions - but the best one explaining this verse of Hallelujah is What is man that You are mindful of him? (8:4) David is literally in awe and astonishment that God pays any attention to man, forgives man, has given man ownership of anything (later in the Psalm David says ""You [...] crowned [man] with glory and honor""). No wonder David is ""the baffled king"" in Cohen's verse. Later in the same Psalm, David says ""O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!"" (Psalm 8:9) - he is literally a ""baffled king composing hallelujah"" - he goes right from being baffled to praising God. This is exactly Cohen's line. The term ""baffled"" may also refer to Cohen's own creative process: Its composition famously reduced Cohen to sitting in his underwear on the carpeted floor of his room at the Royalton Hotel in New York, filling notebooks, banging his head against the floor. - The Guardian Cohen may have pictured David similarly ""banging his head"" and then coming up with the ""secret chord [that] pleased the Lord"" and being a bit baffled on what happened inbetween. As for this being a nonlinear story, I think it was kind of meant to be. Cohen wrote over 80 verses of the course of an impressively long period of time (I think around a year). The various covers of the song pick and choose verses, and mix them up, to represent their own subtheme (love, forgiveness, etc). As Wikipedia says: Cohen's lyrical poetry and his view that ""many different hallelujahs exist"" is reflected in wide-ranging covers with very different intents or tones, allowing the song to be ""melancholic, fragile, uplifting [or] joyous"" depending on the performer: The Welsh singer-songwriter John Cale, the first person to record a cover version of the song (in 1991), promoted a message of ""soberness and sincerity"" in contrast to Cohen's dispassionate tone; the cover by Jeff Buckley, an American singer-songwriter, is more sorrowful and was described by Buckley as ""a hallelujah to the orgasm""; Crowe interpreted the song as a ""very sexual"" composition that discussed relationships; Wainwright offered a ""purifying and almost liturgical"" interpretation; and Guy Garvey of the British band Elbow made the hallelujah a ""stately creature"" and incorporated his religious interpretation of the song into his band's recordings. All quotes from the Bible in this answer are from the NIV Study Bible from 1995, edited primarily by Kenneth Barker, though with help from Burdick, Stek, Wessel, and Youngblood."
Why is the hero's journey so ubiquitous across world literature?,"This answer is essentially a re-post of my answer to the same question from the Mythology Stack Exchange. Although Joseph Campbell is very popular with the general public, there are a number of significant flaws in his theory that people tend to ignore. To quote from Alan Dundes, a professor of Folklore and Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley: My  sole  point  in  mentioning this disheartening  incident is to  suggest that for  many  members of the literate public, the  study  of folklore means precisely Campbell and his writings. Yet professional folklorists  have said very little about the huge corpus of Campbelliana.  I do not know if  any  of his many books were ever even reviewed in JAF.  Is this a case of ""silence gives assent""?  Very likely more people were introduced  to the  subject  matter of folklore by  the writings  of  Campbell or the PBS television series of lectures by  him than by any  other source. And yet we folklorists have said little or nothing about him and his theories. Dundes makes a number of criticisms of Joseph Campbell. One of these is of his assumption that myths are universal, which, as Dundes quickly proves, is not the case. To quote from Dundes: It has  long  been a  popular fantasy among  amateur students of  myth  that all peoples share the same stories. This is  clearly  an  example  of wishful thinking.  Examples of myths that Joseph Campbell claims to be universal but which are not are include: I think it would be safe to say that Joseph Campbell's arguments that the monomyth is ""universal"" aren't very sound. If you are interested in reading more, Dundes' article is available on JSTOR, which you can usually access for free from a public library. Dundes has other criticisms of of Campbell, but they aren't relevant to the question asked by the OP. I also recently wrote a blog post about Joseph Campbell that might interest you. It elaborates on the points that I made in this post."
"How does the golden bough in ""Sailing to Byzantium"" relate to the story in the Aeneid, if at all?","I think it does refer to the episode from The Aeneid. I say this with confidence because there are many classical references. First, there is the name Byzantium, the Latin name for the city (Greek: Byzantion). Next, there is a reference to Grecian goldsmiths, which is not surprising, as the city was Greek from about 660 BC to the 2nd century CE. Additionally, there is the idea of body-soul duality, which is a Platonic idea. The narrator is contemplating what will happen to his soul once he departs this life. ""Once out of nature I shall never take / My bodily form from any natural thing"". He goes on to say that he might live on through human artifice, such as the ""hammered gold"" or ""gold enamelling"" of Grecian goldsmiths. This is one view of eternal life. But another thought occurs to him. Perhaps some ""golden bough"" will take him to the lords and ladies of Byzantium.  The golden bough evokes the underworld, and in particular, the Elysian Fields. The idea of the narrator telling lords and ladies of ""what is past, or passing, or to come"" reminds me of the story that Anchises tells Aeneas, explaining how life came to be, and what their descendants will go on to do. This speech takes place in the Elysian Fields. Anchises starts by describing the spirit inside every body. The seeds of life—
  fiery is their force, divine their birth, but they
  are weighed down by the bodies' ills or dulled
  by earthly limbs and flesh that's born for death.
  That is the source of all men's fears and longings,
  joys and sorrows, nor can they see the heavens' light,
  shut up in the body's tomb, a prison dark and deep. (Aeneid VI:843-848) Thematically similar to the poem, don't you think? If the narrator is searching for a spiritual life, then it's not surprising that he mentions the golden bough. The golden bough gives Aeneas not just passage to the underworld, but also a chance to receive spiritual advice from his father. I think the narrator sees the bough as a talisman through which his dream of a spiritual life may be realized."
Is it a common motif in (western) storytelling that the antagonists are located to the east?,"From the Voluspa, 1999 Larrington translation: From the east falls, from poison valleys 
a river of knives and swords, Cutting it is called (stanza 36) In the east sat an old woman in Iron-wood 
and nurtured there offspring of Fenrir;
a certain one of them in monstrous form 
will be the snatcher of the moon (stanza 40) Hrym drives from the east, he has his shield before him,
the great serpent writhes in giant rage ... (stanza 50; Hrym is a giant and captain of Naglfar) A ship journeys from the east, Muspell's people are coming 
over the waves, and Loki steers.
There are the monstrous brood with all the raveners,
The brother of Byleist is in company with them. (stanza 51, Byleist is brother of Loki; this last line is a kenning, a common poetic device in eddaic and skaldic poetry) It should be noted, however, that as per stanza 52, ""Surt comes from the south"" (the stanzas seem to be misnumbered in my edition or something, it goes stanzas 47, 49, 50, 51, 48, 52, and then carries on up from 52 as normal). Anyway, evil does primarily seem to come from the east in Norse myth. In Finnish myth, Louhi  is a wicked queen of the land known as Pohjola; Pohjola is located in the far north; to quote the Kalevala: ""In these dismal Northern regions / In the dreary land of Pohja"". To quote wikipedia here: the idea of an otherworldly far north is a widespread motif in both Classical and medieval European literature There seems to be, at the minimum, no association of the east with the evil in Finnish myth as far as I can tell. Greek myth was actually influenced a bit by the east, but the closest thing I could find to an association of evil with the east was Dionysus fighting all the way to India and then getting stopped there, but that had a sort of positive light, as it was a weird drunken revelry war thing. Dionysus is weird. Anyway, interestingly, as you move into Roman myth (which is obviously closely associated with Greek myth) it incorporates stuff from Eastern mythology: For instance, the cult of Sun was introduced in Rome after Aurelian's successful campaigns in Syria. The Asiatic divinities Mithras (that is to say, the Sun) and Ba'al were combined with Apollo and Helios into one Sol Invictus, with conglomerated rites and compound attributes. So not a negative connotation at all. Further, I can see very little beyond Norse association of the east with evil. This does make some sense wrt Tolkien though, because he was heavily influenced by Norse myth, and was one of his predominant studies. It should be noted that Tolkien was also heavily influenced by the Kalevala especially wrt the story of Turin Turambar. Another note, though, to quote Tolkien's letter 229: The placing of Mordor in the east was due to simple narrative and geographical necessity, within my 'mythology'. The original stronghold of Evil [Thangorodrim] was (as traditionally) in the North; but as that had been destroyed, and was indeed under the sea, there had to be a new stronghold, far removed from the Valar, the Elves, and the sea-power of Númenor. See also this sci fi and fantasy question."
About l. 3 of the second stanza of Sappho's Ὠδὴ εἰς Ἀνακτωρίαν (Ode to Anactoria),"To begin with, we must remember that the famous Sappho 31 is preserved only in (Pseudo-)Longinus's On the Sublime, a first century work whose authorship is disputed. Wharton, in his preface, says: I have not concerned myself much with textual criticism, for I do not arrogate any power of discernment greater than that possessed by a scholar like Bergk. Where he is satisfied, I am content. (pg. xi) It is certainly incongruous, then, that Bergk's Poetae Lyrici Graeci (pg. 600-601) does not agree with this reading in its proposed text. (Note, however, some counter-examples below.) In fact, it does not even honor this reading with a mention in its apparatus criticus: Bergk's reading: ὥς σε γὰρ ϝίδω, βροχέως με φώνας
  οὐδὲν ἔτ' ἴκει He mentions two other readings for this line: Blomfieldius & Ahrensius: ὡς γὰρ σ' ἰδω βρόχεως... Hermannus: ὡς ἴδω γάρ σε βρόχε', ὥς... So where does the ""εὔιδον"" reading come from? I found that it is cited in Merrill's Commentary to Catullus 51 (Harvard University Press, 1893). Strangely enough, the Slovak Wikipedia article on Sappho also gives the ""εὔιδον"" reading, citing Bergk's Teubner edition. In addition, Bernardakis' commentary to Plutarch's Amatorius cites the same reading from Bergk, though I cannot find it. It is possible that Bergk emended the text between editions, but I am not in a position to verify that. Roberts, in the 1907 Cambridge University of Press edition of Longinus' De Sublimitate, follows the text of Bergk almost exactly: ὥς σε γὰρ ἴδω βροχέως με φωνᾶς οὐδὲν ἔτ̓ εἴκει  The Loeb edition (1995), reviewed by Russell, is very close to this as well: ὥς γὰρ <ἐς> σ' ἴδω βρόχε' ὥς με... Obviously, the ""<ἐς>"" suggests the editor's suggested addition. I unfortunately don't have access to the latest Teubner edition, but the overwhelming consensus seems to be in favor of the reading without εὔιδον. Given the many divergent readings of this line, it is likely that it was bungled very early in its manuscript tradition: it was, after all, a relatively obscure work."
How much weight should we give authors' declarations of their intent after the fact?,"The way that this question is worded implies a particular theory about how literature is interpreted (that is, it's a theory-laden question). The implicit theory seems to be that we interpret literature by treating it as if it were documentary evidence for a fictional universe. In this theory, there is a single fictional universe, and our task as readers is to determine facts about that universe by interpreting the texts we are given. The question asks about how to resolve the difficulty that arises when there are multiple texts apparently describing the same fictional universe: in this situation we have to decide which texts are canonical and which are not. The theoretical picture thus looks like this:  (I am not suggesting that you necessarily believe this theory. But the question as asked only makes sense within a picture like this.) This theory resembles the situation in history, where what actually happened is a matter of fact, but our knowledge about what happened is based on a collection of unreliable and incomplete texts (combined with physical evidence like archaeology and genetics). In history, when we ask a question like, ""did Richard III order the murder of Edward V?"", we know there is a fact of the matter even if our texts don't give us any confidence in what it is. But is this really the best theory about literature? When we ask a question like, ""Did Heathcliff murder Hindley Earnshaw in Wuthering Heights?"", there is no fact of the matter independent of the texts. We are free to imagine a fictional universe in which Heathcliff murdered Hindley, and also to imagine a fictional universe in which Hindley died accidentally. The theoretical situation is more like this:  In this picture I've drawn the interpretations in different shapes to suggest that ""imagining a fictional universe"" is not the only kind of way in which we might interpret a text: we might have a formalist interpretation looking at syntactic features of the text like vocabulary and metre, or a psychoanalytic interpretation relating the text to theories of mind, or a political interpretation relating the text to political and social movements, or many other kinds of approaches."
Was Dan Simmons' Hyperion Cantos based on the story beats of the same Keats poems?,"I'm fairly confident that the parallels are present, intentional, and real. Some portions, however, are about as clear as mud. You'll have to decide for yourself what exactly these parallels are and what they mean. I imagine writing that out would take a Hyperion-length book, and the only true answer would be one by the author.  Thinking about this at all starts with a structural consideration: Hyperion (Simmons) is written in the style of the Canterbury Tales, whereas Hyperion (Keats), although a fragment, seems to be written as a relatively linear tale, dotted with encomia and philosophical considerations.  This difference alone might give reason to be skeptical of a total structural parallel. However, the structure of Simmons' story seems to permit some deeper connection. Simmons' Hyperion follows a pattern where there's a non-narrative sequence of events, and then it delves into a story. Hyperion the poem seems to go down a related path: each book starts with a section that sets the scene, and then people very often tell stories or discover history together.  (Rather than write much of the Keats summary myself, I'm going to quote from this page about Keats' poem, all emphasis mine. I also feel the need to note at this point that it's been a couple years since I read either book or poem in significant detail, and I'd encourage you to draw your own conclusions.) Book 1 opens in media res with the deposed god Saturn mourning the loss of his empire to Jupiter. Thea, another of the Titans and sister/wife to Hyperion, attempts to comfort him, but, also despairing, she can only weep at his feet. Saturn rouses himself to renewed resistance and is led by Thea to where the other fallen Titans are assembled. The second part of Book 1 focuses on Hyperion, still unvanquished and defiant but apprehensive and suffering from premonitions of death and disaster, preparing to go to the aid of Saturn. Simmons' prologue seems to take something of a different turn than the poem. It opens with the Consul receiving a message from Meina Gladstone. Unless we're supposed to view the Consul as connected to a deposed Saturn, and Meina as the sister/wife to Hyperion, I find this to be an unlikely comparison. While under some lines of thought Meina could be analogous to a Titan, the Consul is certainly not portrayed in the manner of a deposed god. I'd suggest that the prologue isn't intended to make a parallel to Keats' poem. The first chapter, however, follows exactly what's happening in that section. The Consul wakes up from cryogenic sleep. Het Masteen is there, and informs him that the other pilgrims are aboard the Yggdrasil. I'm not sure how that could possibly be a closer parallel. The first ""chapter"" of Simmons' novel does also appear to actually end ""[focusing on Hyperion],"" in a tone ""apprehensive and suffering from premonitions of death and disaster."" Recall that Hoyt's story ends with a discussion of continuous resurrection and crucifixion on a Tesla tree - something that is, in and of itself, foreshadowing. This suggests that maybe we're not supposed to consider the prologue in the story as part of the parallel to Keats' Hyperion.  So at this point, I'd consider the question of ""who is Saturn, and who are the Titans?"" to be somewhat unanswered. But the possibility for a parallel in the generic is there. I also think it's more likely that no single specific person or group was intended to represent any specific person or figure in the poem, and that facets of the Pilgrims and facets of the people in the stories told are supposed to present comparative ideas only.  The second chapter of the story presents a much more clear parallel: Book 2 describes the council of the deposed Titans, as they attempt to come to terms with their new powerlessness... Much of the opening of chapter 2 of Simmons' Hyperion describes the pilgrims' journey through the capital city named Keats (which is definitely a total coincidence with no meaning). The Consul encounters Theo Lane, and has a discussion about how the city of Keats has grown and changed.  The speech given by Oceanus is the most positive; he urges his fellow Titans to come to terms with change as an inevitable part of the natual process, and ends by praising the beauty of his own supplanter, the new god of the seas, Neptune. Structurally, these conversations are very similar. Lane is pushing the Consul not to go on the pilgrimage, and the Consul rejects it, describing the pilgrimage in a very similar way.  Kassad spends the rest of the chapter recounting his story; this seems to mirror the rest of Book 2 of the poem:  Her lament declares the uselessness of philosophical arguments in dispelling grief, but also comforts Oceanus's wisdom when she describes the beautiful music with which the earth greeted the arrival of Apollo, the new god of song. Enceladus does not agree and urges them all to challenge the enemy, reminding them that Hyperion is still unfallen. Hyperion himself arrives, but he has now accepted defeat. This honestly exactly mirrors the pacing of the story. Kassad's story starts out as a militaristic reminder that philosophical arguments won't really help that much in the face of this kind of struggle. It then sidetracks into the arrival of Moneta, and his relationship to/with her, in a way that could only be uncomfortably described as pretty close to divine and divine intervention. Besides, Kassad's story ends after the Shrike arrives. Book 3 gets a little less clear again, but I think the parallel is still there. The brief, fragmentary Book 3 describes the valley where Apollo, who will be the new sun god, is coming into his powers. Mnemosyne, herself a Titan, the goddess of memory and mother of the nine Muses, presides over the initiation ceremony. Apollo, whose poetic associations are emphasized by his possession of a lyre, reads a 'wondrous lesson' (book 3, line 112) in her face, and 'Knowledge enormous' (Book 3, line 113) transforms him into a god. Book 3 breaks off with his assumption of godhead. Simmons' chapter 3 opens with the destruction of Naiad (also definitely not a meaningful name worth thinking about), being burned to ashes. It's a little confusing, and this is where the parallel starts to break down. Coincidentally, this is also where the poem by Keats ends. The closest parallel here has to do with ""the nine Muses"" in Sad King Billy's City of Poets. Silenus in this appears to mirror the path of Apollo: he writes endlessly.  The ending, however, appears to be more of a meta-point: Silenus' tale ends with the destruction of the Cantos, and he wishes to return only to complete his unfinished work. This is plainly a reference to Hyperion itself going unfinished. Does the pattern go on past here? I'm not sure. It's hard to say, what with the poem itself being unfinished, and it being so many years since I've read either in much detail. It does leave open a pretty important question: what about the remaining three and a half chapters? But I think this definitively answers the questions: there is some kind of parallel here, though the book as a whole likely doesn't end when the poem does. The exact way to interpret this might just not be clear."
What is the origin of the trope of an evil character whose name is not permitted to be spoken?,"As Obie pointed out in a comment, the expression speak of the devil and he shall appear is a remnant of a naming taboo that was taken very seriously in days long gone. Religions have known many more naming taboos. The Wikipedia article Names of God in Judaism points out that most English editions of the Bible use the phrase ""the Lord"", ""owing to the Jewish tradition increasingly viewing the divine name as too sacred to be uttered."" (See also Why Don’t Jews Say G‑d’s Name?.) In imperial China, there was a taboo on using the emperor's name. Somewhat similar is the prohibition against creating images of a god (or of living beings in general), notably in Islam. See for example the article The Religious Prohibition Against Images, which quotes the Sahih Muslim hadith: He who creates pictures in this world will be ordered to breathe life into them on the Day of Judgment, but he will be unable to do so. Finding the origin of such prohibitions, requires a theory about the origin of religion generally, and I don't believe there is a consensus about this topic in anthropology. One theory that is capable of explaining the above is the one proposed by René Girard (1923 – 2015), especially in his works La Violence et le sacré (1972; English: Violence and the Sacred) and Des choses cachées depuis la fondation du monde (1978; English: Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World). I can only give an extremely condensed summary of his theory here. In his earliest works, René Girard had explained that the human capacity to imitate (""mimesis"") does not only help us learn things (see Aristotle's view on mimesis) but that it can also lead to conflict when one individual imitates another's desire for something. His next step was to ask what this insuppressible tendency to imitate would have meant for early human culture. The increase in brain size during the evolution from primates to hominids did not only imply a greater capacity to learn but also a potential increase in mimetic conflicts. Looking at a wide range of myths and religions, Girard used a process that may be described as abductive inference to arrive at the following hypothesis: The above theory does not explain the origin of all religions. It is a theory about describes the emergence of religious practices as psycho-social mechanisms to keep internal violence in check, not about religions that have a historical ""founding father"" (e.g. Christianity, Islam and Buddhism). Note about the history of this answer: Within less than an hour of its submission, the original version of this answer was shortened to 36 percent of its original length on the grounds that it contained ""unnecessary proselytising"". The discussion in the chat led to questions and comments such as ""Did I misunderstand something, or is the non-existence of any actual deity an unstated assumption in that entire theory?"" (source) and ""Preaching (or worse, treating as a natural assumption) the non-existence of any deity is equally much proselytising as preaching a deity-based religion"" (source). The speed of the edit (within an hour), its size (74 percent) and its ""justification"" have led me to believe that the deletion was an attempt at censorship for faith-based reasons, with the argument about the answer's length serving only as a fig leaf. To the best of my knowledge, Stack Exchange does not approve of censorship. The theory described above does not make assumptions about the existence (or non-existence) of deities; it is perfectly agnostic in this regard. (Even a theory that assumed the existence of a deity would still need to explain how belief in a deity (either the same one or a different one) came into the world.) The length of the answer is due to an effort to explain why an anthropological theory would claim that early humans would develop naming taboos, instead of simply stating that there is such a theory and be done with it."
Why did iambic pentameter become so 'standard' in classical English poetry?,"Iambic meters are the most common of all classical and modern meters generally, and iambic pentameter is closest to the natural patterns of English speech. Plus, it was a successful conspiracy cooked up by Marlowe, Sidney, and the Great Vowel Shift. The word iamb comes from an ancient Greek genre of invective poetry. The metrical term takes its name from the genre with which it was associated. Deriving from this Greek origin, a foot of one short and one long syllable was called an iamb in Latin poetry as well.  The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics says: Iambic was thought in antiquity to be the rhythm nearest to common speech. Throughout Gr. and Lat. poetry, iambic in trimeter and tetrameter is the standard meter for recitation forms, esp. dramatic dialogue.... The same claim has been made in mod. times about Eng. as was made by the ancients about Gr. (Aristotle, Rhetoric, bk. 3)—namely, that iambic is the rhythm of common speech. Interestingly, even though English prosody is accentual-syllabic, i.e., based on stressed and unstressed syllables, whereas classical prosody is quantitative, i.e., based on long and short syllables, the tendency to see iambic rhythms as nearest to common speech prevails in both. With regard to English poetry specifically, we could begin by asking why spoken English falls into iambic patterns. We could then explore how poets exploit these patterns, and ask why pentameter is the most common meter. In A Prosody Handbook, Karl Shapiro and Robert Beum write that in English: intensity of expression is nearly always accompanied by an abundance of stress. Now, in English prose the ratio of nonstresses to stresses ranges from about 2:1 to 3:1. This means that in the rather more intense language of poetry, one should expect the ratio to be closer to 1:1, and we find that in fact 9:7 is a common figure. Clearly, then, a balance or near balance between troughs and crests is called for.    (p. 34) Shapiro and Beum argue that iambs are common in English speech because stressed monosyllables are typically preceded by unstressed articles, prepositions, or conjunctions. In words of two syllables, the stress more commonly falls on the first syllable rather than the second, and since these too would be introduced by unstressed articles or the like, speech patterns tend to default to iambic. An earlier edition of the Princeton Encyclopedia provides a couple of examples (slightly modified here): Of course poets do not merely transcribe ordinary speech. Transforming everyday language into poetry involves, inter alia, manipulating its stress patterns. How did poets turn to iambic meter as the default for English poetry? John Thompson's The Founding of English Metre provides a synopsis of how the naturally occurring iambic patterns of English were standardized as the norm between the publication of the first printed anthology of English poetry, Tottel's Miscellany in 1567, and the circulation of Philip Sidney's Astrophil and Stella poems in the 1580s. It is true that Chaucer and Wyatt, among others, had used iambic meter earlier. But the 15th and 16th centuries were a time of tremendous change in the English language. The Great Vowel Shift, which separates Middle English from its modern counterpart, was underway through this period. Chaucer's late 14th C. poetry was firmly in Middle English, and Sidney's late 16th C. poetry just as firmly in Modern English. The very different pronunciation the phrase pale knight would have between Chaucer and Sidney immediately calls into question any easy statement such as ""Chaucer used iambs, so English poetry followed Chaucer in that regard"". Chaucer would have pronounced pale knight as an amphimacer (‘ x ‘); Sidney as a single spondee ( ‘ ‘ ). As for Wyatt, nobody tf knows how to pronounce, let alone scan, Wyatt. There's a wonderful Lit SE question to be asked about that, as I've said before (see Note 2 in that answer). Thompson's argument is that as modE pronunciation and the conventions of English poetry began to be more or less standardized, iambic meter began to predominate because iambs are the natural pattern of English. Thompson credits Sidney with establishing iambic pentameter as the default for English poetry because he exploited the principle of tension. Tension is the difference between the abstract structure of a metrical pattern, and the actual stresses that prevail when a line of verse is spoken aloud. For example, a poem in iambic pentameter would by definition have this pattern: Yet, few poems would conform unvaryingly to this pattern throughout. In fact, doing so would yield a rigid and stilted work. Sidney's achievement was to play natural speech rhythms against the abstract framework of iambic pentameter so that the tension between the two could be manipulated for poetic effect. Thompson discusses poem 5 of Astrophel and Stella: The deviations from the abstract pattern puts extra emphasis on phrases such as ""most true"". The deferred stress of the pyrrhic ""It is"" makes ""most"" emphatic in a way that reinforces Sidney's meaning. An equally long deferral of stress also highlights ""heaven"", as is appropriate. And the inverted first foot, trochaic rather than iambic, of ""Ought to"", emphasizes what Sidney is saying: ""this OUGHT to be the case [but is not]"". These effects are possible not only because the natural stress patterns of English would emphasize those words, but because the abstract metrical pattern is manipulated to generate tension that puts those words in greater relief. This sort manipulation requires a flexible substructure. The reason iambic pentameter works so well is not simply that it mimics the natural rhythms of English speech; it's that iambic rhythms, at least in English, reassert themselves even when they're not rigidly adhered to. By contrast, patterns of trochees, anapests, and dactyls tend to be fragile. Take Blake's famous trochaic lines: That second line could so easily be scanned as anapestic: Only the fact that it's surrounded by fairly regular trochaic lines allows us to scan this line as trochaic as well. But this regularity is a necessity; a trochaic poem of any length that attempts the sort of tension that iambs allow would soon be very difficult to sustainedly hear as trochaic. As a result, iambs predominate in English poetry. Shapiro and Beum estimate that some 70% of English poetry is iambic. One possible reason we hear alternating patterns of unstressed and stressed syllables as iambic rather trochaic is that generally, there is a brief pause after a stressed syllable. In trochaic meters, the pause after the stress works against the pattern of the whole line, as the pause occurs in the middle of the foot. In iambic meters, on the other hand, the pause of the stress works naturally with the pause between feet. This makes iambic meter supple and flexible in a way that other patterns aren't. The first sonnet of Astrophil and Stella is in alexandrines. Yet the default meter of English poetry is pentameter rather than hexameter or tetrameter. Why? Because pentameter is long enough to be flexible, yet short enough not to fall naturally into divisions. Sidney's poem itself has strong caesuras in most lines: Loving in truth || and fain in verse my love to show
That she, dear she || might take some pleasure of my pain Iambic trimeters would be rather choppy. They can, of course, be used to great effect precisely for that reason, as in Theodore Roethke's small masterpiece: The whiskey on your breath
Could make a small boy dizzy;
But I hung on like death:
Such waltzing was not easy. But the trimeters work only because of the context: a waltz. The deviations from regular meter capture the drunken missteps well, as in the hypermetric endings ""dizzy"" or ""easy"". It's hard to imagine this working as a default to hold capacious variations the way pentameter does. Iambic tetrameter does give iambic pentameter a run for its money. One of the most justly celebrated poems in the language is in iambic tetrameter: Come live with me and be my love,
And we will all the pleasures prove,
That Valleys, groves, hills, and fields,
Woods, or steepy mountain yields. Another iambic tetrameter is simply a Marvell: Had we but world enough and time,
This coyness, lady, were no crime.
We would sit down, and think which way
To walk, and pass our long love’s day. The question of why pentameter feels more natural than tetrameter is hard to answer definitively. The fact that pentameter is by definition more capacious probably has something to do with it. Both Marlowe's and Marvell's poems are urgent invitations to love, and pentameter would probably feel too languorous. But a relatively shorter line, while working great when the poet is eagerly soliciting the favors of his inamorata, is somewhat less effective as an all-purpose solution. The popularity of sonnet sequences in the 16th century also boosted pentameter over tetrameter, because the ten-syllable pentameter line more closely approximated Petrarch's hendecasyllables. And of course, Marlowe's mighty line firmly established blank verse, i.e., unrhymed iambic pentameter, as the default for the Elizabethan stage: Was this the face that launched a thousand ships,
And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?
Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss:
Her lips suck forth my soul, see where it flies!
Come Helen, come, give me my soul again. Chaucer and Wyatt are, frankly, too remote and too hard to scan, respectively, to claim that their influence established iambic pentameter as the default for English poetry. But Sidney and Marlowe are not. They provided enduring exemplars of what English poetry should sound like, and they established iambic pentameter as the default. The question of what English poetry should be like was a real one during the 16th C. Poets such as Thomas Campion argued that English should use quantitative meter. Poets such as Sidney (An Apology for Poetry) and Samuel Daniel (A Defense of Rhyme) countered that accentual-syllabic, rhymed lines were more natural to the language. It was not a given that English poetry would end up with iambic pentameter as the default. It just so happened that the 16th C. was a time that lent itself to the establishment of a default: It needs to be stated that poets didn't consciously set out to imitate Sidney and Marlowe in choosing iambic pentameter for poetry and drama respectively. Iambic pentameter in English has a well-documented history before those poets. The point here is that iambic pentameter has certain built-in advantages for poetic effects in English. These poets were writing when Modern English was in the late stages of its emergence as something drastically different from Middle English. As English poets sought appropriate vehicles for poetic expression in the wake of the Great Vowel Shift, Marlowe and Sidney showed that iambic pentameter was an assertive, flexible, and supple pattern that allowed poetic achievement of a high order in what was practically a new language. Their example made that meter the default for English poetry. We tend to think of Shakespeare as the default poet for English. And indeed, his achievements in iambic pentameter are better-known (some might argue ""better"" tout court) than those of Sidney and Marlowe with that same meter in poetry and drama respectively. But Sidney and Marlowe were those who first showed the tremendous possibilities that iambic pentameter offered English poetry, and they established it as the default that endured until Ezra Pound: ""To break the pentameter, that was the first heave"". As @PeterShor points out, entirely correctly, in the comments, Middle English poets such as Chaucer and Gower used iambic pentameter extensively. The practice of iambic pentameter could have continued throughout the Great Vowel Shift that marks the transition from ME to ModE. Poets could have imitated what they saw Chaucer doing, even if Chaucer's own scansion became impenetrable to them as the shift occurred. This argument deserves more consideration than is practical in this already overlong answer, but there is another question on this site that takes up the issue."
Were R.A. Salvatore's works inspired by real world D&D campaigns?,"In this AMA-thread on reddit, we find the questions I want to know, where do you draw your inspiration from? Do you write about games you've played/ran, or is it straight from your head? To which R.A. Salvatore answers Straight from my head, which is a jumble of everything around me: the people I meet, the stories I hear, the music I hear, the sights and sounds of life. Writers take it all in, chew it up into little pieces, and spit it back out, hopefully in entertaining ways. Which I would take to mean that while some of the stories he's heard may have been told in DnD campaigns, it doesn't seem like they are a major inspiration for him."
Was Théoden's revival inspired by Mark Twain?,"While I really couldn't find much on this topic, here is what I found. As a comment mentioned, there's Clyde Kilby's observation that he ""was pleasantly surprised at the familiarity he showed with American literature, especially that of Mark Twain"" (TOLKIEN & THE SILMARILLION, pages 30-31) from this website; the same however also points out that what was believed to be a reference to Steinbeck was in fact not, and a comment on the blogpost by Hammond and Scull, two of the foremost researchers of Tolkien and authors of (among other works) the massively definitive J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide, said: Wayne has read Mark Twain, whose books were required in American schools, while Christina's knowledge of them from an English upbringing is second-hand; and talking about this, we agreed that although neither of us has read a word of, say, G.A. Henty, we both recognize titles such as With Clive in India as typical of his works, and we've read enough about British children’s literature to know what kind of books Henty produced. Which in turn made us wonder how much Twain Tolkien had actually read when he spoke with Kilby, as opposed to having enough familiarity through other avenues to carry on a casual conversation. Which also seems to cast doubt on Tolkien having known of Mark Twain. Then, I found this little gem, a transcript of a letter by J.R.R. Tolkien to Naomi Mitchel which seems to clearly indicate that Tolkien was indeed aware of at least some of the works of Mark Twain - the letter contrasts Michel's book, The Chapel Perilous, and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court: I hope that the Chapel Perilous went and is going well [though I seldom see or read reviews, and but for a cutting agency should not see my own – In spite of them I do not read them all] A curious and rather disturbing blend. I hope you won’t mind my mentioning “a Yankee at the Court of King Arthur.” I only do so, because of the shattering difference. Of course there are the deliberate mechanical anachronisms in both. the hello–girls and telephones, and electrified wire; and dwarfs with photographic apparatus: I don’t like ‘em, of course, and think it better if the satire arises out of the material as it is; but there are umbrellas in the Shire—but M.T. [Mark Twain]was merely vulgarly romantic, whereas you undermine, or (perhaps fairer) transform the whole thing. See this site. It should be noted that Joan of Arc was not one of Twain's more...popular works. To quote Wikipedia on the matter, Twain's opinion notwithstanding, critics, then and now, have not labeled Recollections his best work. Today, the book is hardly read or acknowledged in the mainstream, especially compared to Twain's comedic works, such as Huckleberry Finn, Pudd 'nHead Wilson, and Tom Sawyer. (A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court could probably be added to the list of ""more popular comedic"" works.) On the other hand, at the minimum, Tolkien was probably familiar with the legends of Joan of Arc. This paper for example, compares the character of Eowyn to Joan of Arc and cites multiple others that do the same. In the digging I've done up to this point, a bunch of sites cite (sorry, bad pun) Eowyn as a Joan of Arc figure, and as a reader of the stories, I do have to agree that that seems like a pretty clear analogy (though on the other hand, if you're trying to write a female character that ""does something"" into a medieval society, a Joan of Arc character is kind of what you're going to get at first pass; take that how you will). What is also of note is that Twain based the book off of actual sources of the story of Joan of Arc - to quote the book itself: Authorities examined in verification of the truthfulness of this narrative: J. E. J. QUICHERAT, Condamnation et Rehabilitation de Jeanne d'Arc.
J. FABRE, Proces de Condamnation de Jeanne d'Arc.
H. A. WALLON, Jeanne d'Arc.
M. SEPET, Jeanne d'Arc.
J. MICHELET, Jeanne d'Arc.
BERRIAT DE SAINT-PRIX, La Famille de Jeanne d'Arc.
La Comtesse A. DE CHABANNES, La Vierge Lorraine.
Monseigneur RICARD, Jeanne d'Arc la Venerable.
Lord RONALD GOWER, F.S.A., Joan of Arc. JOHN O'HAGAN, Joan of Arc.
JANET TUCKEY, Joan of Arc the Maid. So it could very well be that Tolkien was not in fact familiar with this particular tale of Twain but was familiar with the source material from which Twain drew. On the other hand, these sources are primarily in French, and to quote letter 213: For instance I dislike French So I'm not sure he would have necessarily read these sources which are mostly in French, it seems. Yes, he was probably familiar with Twain, and he might have had a passing familiarity with the story of Joan of Arc, but he probably did not have the level of awareness necessary to have Theoden be influenced by the Dauphin/Joan of Arc, and even if he was, Twain was probably not the transmitter in this case. Of course, all of this must be taken with a grain of salt; see Rand al'Thor's comment."
How old was Hercule Poirot?,"According to the Wikipedia page on Hercule Poirot and based on quotations from Curtain, Poirot died in October 1949, thirty-three years after he first met Captain Hastings in June 1916. (He wasn't actually retired by that point, but he was a refugee escaping from World War I: it's unclear when exactly he retired). We know that he was a detective with the Brussels police force by 1893, when he tried to solve the case of The Chocolate Box. If we assume that he was 20-40 years old in 1893, he would have been born between 1853 and 1873, fled as a refuge to Britain at the age of 43 to 63, and would have died somewhere around the age of 76 to 96, which makes sense to me. If he was 55 when he moved to Britain -- at or around retirement age -- that gives us a birth year of 1861 and a death age of 88."
"How was ""A Passage to India"" received in Britain and India?","It's difficult to try and judge a reception of a novel that's nearly 100 years old. Especially as reviews seem to be 'nicer' in those days than some of the scathing remarks you see in the present day. However, there is a review of the book from the Guardian in 1924 : We have had novels about India from the British point of view and from the native point of view, and in each case with sympathy for the other side; but the sympathy has been intended, and in this novel there is not the slightest suggestion of anything but a personal impression, with the prejudices and limitations of the writer frankly exposed.

"Identify a book, love triangle, death of a woman, no Personal Computers","""The Little Lady of the Big House"" by Jack London. It can be found on gutenberg.org The story concerns a love triangle. The protagonist, Dick Forrest, is
a rancher with a poetic streak (his ""acorn song"" recalls London's
play, ""The Acorn Planters""). His wife, Paula, is a vivacious,
athletic, and sexually self-aware woman, who falls in love with Evan
Graham, an old friend of her husband's. The Little Lady of the Big House (Wikipedia) The tractor scene: “Behold,” he said, “the one-man and no-horse farm where the farmer
sits on the porch. Please imagine the porch.” In the center of the field was a stout steel pole, at least twenty
feet in height and guyed very low. From a drum on top of the pole a thin wire cable ran to the extreme
edge of the field and was attached to the steering lever of a small
gasoline tractor. About the tractor two mechanics fluttered. At
command from Dick they cranked the motor and started it on its way. “This is the porch,” Dick said. “Just imagine we’re all that future
farmer sitting in the shade and reading the morning paper while the
manless, horseless plowing goes on.” Alone, unguided, the drum on the head of the pole in the center
winding up the cable, the tractor, at the circumference permitted by
the cable, turned a single furrow as it described a circle, or,
rather, an inward trending spiral about the field. “No horse, no driver, no plowman, nothing but the farmer to crank the
tractor and start it on its way,” Dick exulted, as the uncanny
mechanism turned up the brown soil and continued unguided, ever
spiraling toward the field’s center. “Plow, harrow, roll, seed,
fertilize, cultivate, harvest—­all from the front porch. And where the
farmer can buy juice from a power company, all he, or his wife, will
have to do is press the button, and he to his newspaper, and she to
her pie-crust.” In the end, she wounds herself mortally with a rifle in what her husband is certain is a suicide. Doctor Robinson made his examination. When he arose with an air of
finality, Dick looked his question. Robinson shook his head. “Nothing to be done,” he said. “It is a matter of hours, maybe of
minutes.” He hesitated, studying Dick’s face for a moment. “I can ease
her off if you say the word. She might possibly recover consciousness
and suffer for a space.” ... “How long?” she queried. “Not long,” came his answer. “You can ease off any time.” “You mean...?” She glanced aside curiously at the doctor and back to
Dick, who nodded. “It’s only what I should have expected from you, Red Cloud,” she
murmured gratefully."
"Juvenile literature about a group of children living in a castle, looking for a treasure","The book you are thinking of may be The Sword of Glendower by Aylmer Hall. It was first published in 1960. This is the blurb in my edition: Naturally Sir Owen Pryce, a man of considerable standing and dignity, is annoyed when the press dubs him ""the man with the fairy sword"". But that is bound to happen when the rumour goes around that not only an ancient sword but a fairy sword is hidden somewhere at Llanviar Castle. This is the story of how everyone turns out secretly to hunt for the sword -even Mark who thought at first everyone was ""batty"". A good and unusual adventure tale, with no fairies in it at all. It's been a while since I read it, but I remember the castle being described in detail, as well as one of the tours of the castle. Two of the children live there (children of Sir Owen) and their cousin is staying with them. The castle is, however, open for tours by the public, it is in one of these that there is a good deal of description. The search for the sword leads them underground and if I remember correctly renovations are being made to the castle."
"What was the first book that explicitly used ""A Hero's Journey"" as a checklist?","Giles Goat-Boy, which was published in 1966, by John Barth is an early example, though perhaps not the earliest, of a novel that consciously uses the Hero's Journey as a structuring principle. In his essay, ""Mystery and Tragedy: The Twin Forces of Ritual Heroism"", Barth remarks how he studied comparative mythologists Otto Rank and Joseph Campbell, after a reviewer suggested that his novel, The Sot-Weed Factor was a ""parodic implementation"" of Lord Raglan's ""Wandering Hero Myth."" Barth read Rank's Myth of the Birth of the Ritual Hero and Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces in preparation for his novel, Giles Goat-Boy (Clavier 166). Giles Goat-Boy features a miraculous birth (George Giles is a boy raised as a goat). He has some revelations about the truth of his birth, which is his call to adventure, and he faces many trials on his way to New Tammany College. Even earlier perhaps, relative to The Hero with a Thousand Face's 1949 publication date, is William Gaddis's The Recognitions from 1955, which, in the introduction to the Dalkey Archive edition, William Gass compares its structure to the Hero's Journey, monomyth, or urmyth. Though, I cannot find an explicit reference that Gaddis has made regarding consciously using the Hero's Journey to structure his novel, he did read James George Frazier's The Golden Bough during the composition of The Recognitions, which is known to have been influential on Joseph Campbell as well. Critic, Steven Moore also makes a similar argument to Gass's about The Recognition's monomythic structuring in the foreword to his reader's guide to the novel, but I do not have the source available at the moment. The case for Giles Goat-Boy's indebtedness to the Hero's Journey is stronger than The Recognition's, but there may be an even earlier text that more explicitly references the Hero's Journey that I am unaware of."
Who can nominate candidates for a Nobel Prize in Literature?,"The identities of nominating bodies are a strictly held secret. The statutes of the Nobel Foundation restrict disclosure of information about the nominations, whether publicly or privately, for 50 years. The restriction concerns the nominees and nominators, as well as investigations and opinions related to the award of a prize. That being said, looking at the released Nobel nomination archives (from 1960-1966), we have a few examples to guide us. In short, the bulk of these associations appear to be those with a direct relation to Pen International or where their current president was a significant member of Pen, prior to becoming the leader of their country's writer's organisation. Whether that remains true today is anyone's guess. Ask again in 50 years."
Why is Macondo a city of mirages?,"In the beginning, Macondo was a city solidly set in reality. Magical things happened, but everybody agreed they happened. However, as time passed by, gradually the hold of Macondo on reality started slipping. Things became increasingly illusory. There are several instances of this: Of these, I think the massacre is the strongest bit of evidence. Three thousand four hundred and eight people were slaughtered, and history was so convincingly re-written that nobody except José Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano believed it happened. Consider Úrsula's thoughts about José Arcadio Segundo when the latter spoke of these deaths to her: Only then did Úrsula realize that he was in a world of shadows more impenetrable than hers, as unreachable and solitary as that of his great-grandfather. Yet José Arcadio Segundo was the one who had the most complete grasp of the real world. The description of the brothel that Aureliano frequented is also telling: Her eternal smile seemed to have been brought on by the credulity of
  her customers, who accepted as something certain an establishment that
  did not exist except in the imagination, because even the tangible
  things where unreal: the furniture that fell apart when one sat on it,
  […] the frames with prints cut out of magazines that had never been
  published. Even the timid little whores who came from the
  neighborhood: when the proprietress informed them that customers had
  arrived they were nothing but an invention. […] [As] soon as they got
  their peso and fifty cents they would spend it on a roll with cheese
  that the proprietress sold them, smiling more than ever, because only
  she knew that that meal was not real either. These things seem to indicate that, a little by little, Macondo was slowly becoming less and less real, more and more mirage, until, of course, it was wiped out from reality in its entirety. ""Oh, my son,"" he sighed. ""It's enough for me to be sure that you and I
  exist at this moment."""
"Does Théoden actually say that he misses Gríma (his ""old advisor"") at one point in The Two Towers?","The word ""to miss"" usually means ""to regret no longer having"". But it may mean simply ""to no longer have"", ""to have lost"", without experiencing regret. This seems to be the meaning here. See definition on wiktionary: [8] (transitive) To be wanting; to lack something that should be present. The car is missing essential features. Note also that Tolkien is using a (pseudo?) archaic language for his heroes' speech, so while a modern person would be unlikely to use the word ""to miss someone"" without emotional meaning, this might not be the case for Théoden. The quote from ""The Two Towers"" actually could speak in favour of this interpretation: ‘Has aught been seen of Gandalf?’ asked Théoden. ...
‘It will go ill with Wormtongue, if Gandalf comes upon him,’ said Théoden. ‘Nonetheless I miss now both my counsellors, the old and the new. But in this need we have no better choice than to go on, as Gandalf said, to Helm’s Gate, whether Erkenbrand be there or no. What could this mean? That he has warm feelings towards Grima (and Gandalf), but has to go to Helm’s Gate? Hardly makes sense. It looks like a statement of fact: a situation arose which would normally involve seeking advice from a counsellor, but none is present, so the King has to make a decision on his own."
Were all of Shakespeare's plays fully in iambic pentameter?,"In fact, much of the content of Shakespeare's plays isn't even written in verse. There's plenty of prose in Shakespeare - indeed, at least one play (Merry Wives of Windsor) is written almost entirely in prose. But when he did use verse, it's usually iambic pentameter, with some exceptions. Note that none of this is by chance. There's actually a pretty consistent pattern governing when he used prose and when he used verse, and similarly, when he broke the pattern of iambic pentameter, there was usually a reason for it based on the nature of that particular speech.

The types of writing in Shakespeare's plays is usually split into three distinct types: rhyming verse, blank verse, and prose. As a general rule of thumb, blank verse is the standard, while rhyming verse is reserved for more flowery speeches or occasions when it's OK to sound a little unnatural, and prose is used for more down-to-earth talk, often between lower-class people. This excellent introductory article to prose and verse in Shakespeare covers not only the meanings and some examples of each of the three (you're probably already familiar with these terms) but also a nice summary of how each of them tends to be used in Shakespeare's plays specifically. Quoting this article with some added emphasis: PROSE is used whenever verse would seem bizarre:  in serious letters (Macbeth to Lady Macbeth; Hamlet to Horatio), in proclamations, and in the speeches of characters actually or pretending to be mad (Lady Macbeth; Hamlet and Ophelia; Edgar and King Lear) -- verse is apparently too regular and orderly for expressing madness.  Prose is used for cynical commentary (e.g. Jacques and Touchstone in As You Like It; Edmund in King Lear) or reducing flowery speech to common sense terms (all over As You Like It).  It is used when the rational is contrasted with the emotional (Brutus vs. Antony in Julius Caesar).  It is used for simple exposition, transitions, or contrast (the first scenes of As You Like It, The Tempest, King Lear or A Winter's Tale).  It is used for scenes of everyday life (Bottom and company in A Midsummer Night's Dream; Corin in As You Like It; William, Bates and Court in Henry V); for low comedy (Bottom and company; Touchstone and Audrey in As You Like It; Fluellen and Pistol in Henry V; Sir Toby Belch, Maria and Malvolio in Twelfth Night); and for bantering, relaxed or unbuttoned conversation (Celia, Rosalind and Touchstone in As You Like It; Gower, Fluellen, MacMorris and Jamie in Henry V; Prince Hal and Falstaff in 2 Henry IV). PLEASE NOTE: it is NOT ACCURATE to say that ""the lower classes speak prose and the upper classes speak verse."" The highborn cousins Rosalind and Celia speak prose to one another in As You Like It, as do King Henry and Katherine of France in Henry V. Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, tends to use prose both when he is being very rational and when he is very irrational (but the passionate Hamlet speaks in verse). Similarly, when the lower classes figure in serious or romantic situations, they may speak verse (e.g. Silvius and Phebe in As You Like It; the gardeners in Richard II). RHYME is often used for ritualistic or choral effects and for highly lyrical or sententious passages that give advice or point to a moral (the Duke's speeech at the end of Act 3 in Measure for Measure). Rhyme is used for songs (Amiens in As You Like It; Feste in Twelfth Night; Ariel in The Tempest); in examples of bad verse (the Pyramus and Thisbe play in A Midsummer Night's Dream and Orlando's bad poetry in As You Like It); in Prologues, Epilogues and Choruses (the Chorus in Henry V; Puck's epilogue); in masques (Hymen in As You Like It; Iris, Ceres and Juno in The Tempest) and in plays-within-plays (Pyramus and Thisbe in A Midsummer Night's Dream; the Mousetrap play in Hamlet), where it distinguishes these imaginary performances from the ""real world"" of the play.  It is also used for many manifestations of the supernatural (e.g. the witches in Macbeth; the fairies in A Midsummer Night's Dream; Ariel in The Tempest) -- but not for ghosts (e.g. Hamlet's father), who retain the human use of blank verse. BLANK VERSE is employed in a wide range of situations because it comes close to the natural speaking rhythms of English but raises it above the ordinary without sounding artificial (unlike the ""singsong"" effect produced by dialogue in rhyme). Art elevates and distills the everyday; writing in blank verse helps sharpen that distinction. Blank verse, as opposed to prose, is used mainly for passionate, lofty or momentous occasions and for introspection; it may suggest a refinement of character. Many of Shakespeare's most famous speeches are written in blank verse: Macbeth's and Lady Macbeth's plotting; the great soliloquies of Henry V and Hamlet; Caliban's complaints and Prospero's farewell to magic in The Tempest. As noted above, a speech or scene in blank verse may end with a single rhyming couplet known as a capping couplet.  It is used to lend a final punch, a concluding flourish or a note of climax to the end of a speech or scene. When reading a play in written form, it's easy to tell the difference: prose runs all the way to the end of the line and doesn't have capital letters at the start of every line, while in verse (either blank or rhyming) each line usually ends after roughly the same number of syllables and the next line starts with a capital letter. When seeing a play being performed - at least if it's performed well - it can be hard to distinguish by ear between prose and blank verse, but rhyming verse is more noticeable. It's interesting to note the historical context here. Shakespeare was writing at just around the time that prose was supplanting verse as the primary means for writing fiction, which explains why we see such a mixture in his plays, as well as why the proportion of prose to verse generally increases from earlier plays to later ones. Quoting from this very informative British Library article: A mix of [prose and verse] is unusual in much of literature, but commonplace in the plays of Shakespeare and other dramatists of his age. Although we would probably expect a modern play to be written in prose, the practice of English dramatists before Shakespeare was to write in rhyming verse. Poetry was regarded as the chief literary form, although prose was used for some types of storytelling, such as chivalric romances and travellers’ tales. (The novel as we know it didn’t emerge until the 18th century). The use of prose alongside verse was something that gradually crept into English drama towards the end of the 16th century. Shakespeare’s early comedies make use of both prose and verse, but his first tragedy, the Roman play Titus Andronicus, is – according to convention – written almost entirely in verse, except for Act 4, Scene 3 when Titus has a brief exchange with a simple-minded messenger. The ‘clown’, as he is listed in the dramatis personae, speaks in prose, and at one point Titus, a renowned general in the Roman army, slips into this mode while talking to the clown. Shakespeare wrote Titus Andronicus in 1593–94. By the time he wrote his later tragedies, he was using a much greater proportion of prose, and in Hamlet (composed 1600–01), for example, this is used to telling effect. The same article also analyses several specific passages taken from The Taming of the Shrew, Much Ado About Nothing, etc. I'll consider a couple of these which focus on places where Shakespeare derived from the usual iambic pentameter scheme. The quality of mercy is not strain’d,
  It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
  Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:
  It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
  ‘Tis mightiest in the mightiest, it becomes
  The throned monarch better than his crown. -- The Merchant of Venice, Act IV Scene I The third line here ends with two stressed syllables. Rather than being an unintentional slip away from iambic pentameter, this is likely a deliberate technique used to emphasise the words twice blest. Similarly, the paucity of stressed syllables in the fifth line helps to make ""might"" stand out from the rest of the line, which is another form of emphasis. More examples can be found in some early scenes of Hamlet, when Hamlet speaks in broken verse with many lines much longer than ten syllables, and towards the end of The Tempest, when Prospero speaks in shorter, iambic tetrameter, lines of verse. Both of these deviations from the norm (the BL article argues) can be interpreted in terms of semantic meaning. Hamlet is cracking up under the stress of his father's death and his mother's distance from him, and this shows in the extended lines which can hardly contain his emotion. Prospero is weakened, having lost his magic, and this shows in the diminished, seven or eight syllable, lines of his final speech."
"How did they cover 1,000 miles in 110 days at a speed of 5 miles per day?","The phrase ""can make five miles a day better going."" does not refer to the absolute speed of the ""Zulu cattle"".  It is saying that they can go five miles further a day than the ""Africanders"" can.  We would first need to know the speed of the ""Africanders"" to be able to estimate the speed of the ""Zulu"". Nonetheless your calculations are admirable."
"What is the source of ""You can achieve a lot with hate, but even more with love"" (Shakespeare?)","Since you say the quote isn't exact, the best I can remember is the following from Romeo and Juliet (emphasis mine): Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
  Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
  Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
  Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
  Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
  O any thing, of nothing first create!
  O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
  Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
  Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
  Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
  This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
  Dost thou not laugh? The above text is from Act 1 Scene 1. Romeo says this after he comes to the place where the Montagues and Capulets' servants had been fighting. The fight, he says, is more about love than it is about hatred. Even though they are representing hatred by fighting with each other, they are doing so out of the love and loyalty they have for their respective masters."
"What is ""Galacian tobacco"" and what is its significance?","Galician, not Galacian. During the 1970s and 1980s, Galician smuggling cartels specialised in cigarettes and tobacco. It was a big illegal industry in Iberia, and perhaps extending further afield in Europe too. More recently, they've started dealing in cocaine imported from Colombia, but the tobacco smuggling still continues as well. Even in 2023, large-scale illegal tobacco operations in Galicia are exploiting Ukrainian refugees. In the 70s several Galician fishermen organized themselves to create routes that favored the smuggling of tobacco from Portugal When under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, Spaniards smuggled in tobacco.

"Pride and Prejudice: Why did Elizabeth think ""my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me""?","First, we should note that Elizabeth is very specific here: she is only talking about her uncle and aunt, not of any other relatives. While it is perhaps natural that her thoughts should first go to those she was in company with, it is not so natural that they should not continue to her closer family. If it was a matter of shutting out all her family, then surely her father and Jane would be missed as much or more than the Gardiners. So, why the Gardiners? They certainly seem like the most respectably behaved of all her relations we meet. The answer lies in the class system of the time, and what was considered a genteel occupation. In another passage, Elizabeth describes hers and Darcy's position in life as equal:  He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal.
Chapter 56 This is at least formally correct. While the staggering difference in income would likely have precluded such a match in practice, there were no formal difference in rank, partly because the incomes were still derived from the same sources: land, and interest.  One formal requirement of being genteel was how money was generated. Land and interest were the most unobjectionable sources of income, and what the country gentry that is the focus of most of Austen's novels lived on. There were also a few occupations that were also considered acceptable, suitable for younger sons without any hope of a grand inheritance: the army, the navy, the church, and law. These are the occupations of all the romantic interests we meet in Austen that has to earn their living. Anything else, and you were not strictly genteel. Medicine was on the rise in respectability, but not there yet. Back to the Gardiners: We are told that Mr Gardiner is a merchant. This is not acceptable society to someone who is strict about this kind of thing, and Mr. Darcy even says that such relatives [...] must very materially lessen [the Bennet sisters'] chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world.
Chapter 8 The way out of this situation for someone who has made a large sum in trade is to buy a suitable country estate; this was the aspiration of the late Mr. Bingley, and the novel is kicked into action by his son attempting to do this very thing: it might take a generation or two, but eventually the stigma of having been in trade would disappear. By the standards set forth already by Mr Darcy and Lady Catherine de Bourgh, the Gardiners are of far too low a class to be acceptable company.   Thus, given that Mr Darcy has indeed show great pride before, Elizabeth really has no hope that he would entertain such relatives, when he had already shown how deeply he had objected to most of her immediate family, who at least formally belonged to the same class as him. I should probably also say much of Austen's writing actaully is an examination of this class system: in Pride and Prejudice, the character that is perhaps the best behaved is Mr Bingley, who does not care very much for such matters and instead is generally kind and attentive. A large part of the redemption of Mr Darcy in the eyes of both Elizabeth and the reader is when he adopts such an attitude to the Gardiners and treats them as being of similar social standing. I've used the essay ""Class"" by Juliet McMaster in The Cambridge companion to Jane Austen; apart form pointing out useful passages in the novel it also discusses the class system as it was during Austen's time and how she depicted it in her novels."

"""My father declared he should invent a slip button""","The Kentucky Age for 10th February 1857 contains a short story which opens as follows: A celebrated wit once said he had found out a patent “slip button,” so that when a bore laid hold of him, and was detaining him with a long story, he had only to slip the button, leaving it in the bore’s fingers, and make his escape. The contrivance was an ingenious and valuable one, and had the inventor, as threatened, taken out a patent, many would doubtless have adopted the useful article. Anon (1857). ‘A Bachelor’s Button’. In The Kentucky Age (10th February 1857), p. 1. The “celebrated wit” must be Sydney Smith himself: Lady Holland’s memoirs, published two years previously, supplying the inspiration for the story. I think this story makes it clear how contemporary readers would have understood the phrase “slip button”. The bore is imagined to be grasping a button on the coat of the victim,† who makes an escape in the manner of a ship that “slips the cable” and leaves its anchor on the seabed. † This was a common figure of speech. The Oxford English Dictionary has: button-hold, v. To accost (a person) and detain him or her in conversation as if by taking hold of a button on his or her clothing. As pointed out by Peter Shor in comments, “buttonhole” has a similar meaning, except that it is the hole that is imagined as being grasped rather than the button."
"Would ""most unkindest"" have been considered poor grammar in Shakespeare's time?","One of Shakespeare's contemporaries, the dramatist Ben Jonson, published an English Grammar in 1640. Chapter XII, Of Comparisons, discusses the comparative and superlative degrees for adjectives and does not mention the adverbs ""more"" and ""most"". However, the chapter ""Of the Syntax of Adjectives"" points out that (bold emphasis mine), Oftentimes both degrees are expressed by these two adverbs, more, and most: as more excellent, most excellent. Whereof the latter seemeth to have his proper place in those that are spoken in a certain kind of excellency, but yet without comparison: Hector was a most valiant man; that is, inter fortissimos. Furthermore, these adverbs, more and most, are added to the comparative and superlative degrees themselves, which should be before the positive: Sir Thomas More : Forasmuch as she saw the cardinal more readier to depart than the remnant; for not only the high dignity of the civil magistrate, but the most basest handicrafts are holy, when they are directed to the honour of God. And this is a certain kind of English Atticism, or eloquent phrase of speech, imitating the manner of the most ancientest and finest Grecians, who, for more emphasis and vehemencies sake, used so to speak. So not only was it acceptable, it was also good style. Source: Jonson, Ben: The English Grammar. Edited with an Introduction and Notes by Alice Vinton Waite.

"Meaning of ""none so poor to do him reverence"" in Shakespeare's ""Julius Cæsar""","Samuel Johnson glossed this line as follows: And none so poor—] The meanest man is now too high to do reverence to Caesar. Samuel Johnson (1766). The Plays of William Shakespeare, volume 9, p. 58, footnote. Dublin: A. Leathley. To “do reverence” to someone is to pay homage or show respect to them, as people of lower rank are required to do to their social superiors. So Johnson says that we should take “poor” in the sense “mean, lowly, inferior in rank and status” and interpret the line as saying that Caesar has fallen so low (by being assassinated) that the lowliest man is now superior to him (by virtue of being alive). Antony contrasts Caesar’s current state with that of the day before, when he was master of the world and everyone had to pay homage to him."
What are the challenges in translating a work of literature?,"Many works of literature derive a lot of value from implied context. Cultural norms. Idioms. Insider jokes.  This is especially a big factor in a book which contains elements of humor (especially parody) - but not necessarily. When translating, this layer of implied information is frequently irrevocably lost - both due to the new audience's unfamiliarity with cultural norms and idioms and references. I have observed this frequently. Russian translations of ""Ivanhoe"" almost entirely missed out on anti-semitic and general religious angle associated with Rebeccah and Isaac characters, despite that being an important part of the work. Much of ""Three Musketeers"" translations suffer from readers being unaware of the actual role and impact of Cardinal Richelieu, his sociopolitical reasons for prohibiting duels (which was a driving plot), and French perspective on Britain around 30-year-war. Arkady and Boris Strugatsky (who were intimately familiar with the issues, due to their side work as professional translators and interpreters - Japanese and English iirc) poignantly covered some of the issues involved in ""Ugly Swans"" novel, whose protagonist is a successful writer, and in the course of the novel is shown to work with a Japanese translator of his books, trying in vain to explain Russian idiomatic expressions. Linguistic nuances. Better quality literary works don't just contain information - their use of language matters greatly. The writer's style and language use is extremely difficult to relay when translating, even for a true well-meaning expert. Language concepts and linguistic relativity. This is getting into the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis territory. Certain things simply come packaged with the language, including mental concepts. A well publicized research[1] even showed that concepts of tense can influence economic behavior. This relativity is again lost when translating, unless care is taken. [1] - The Effect of Language on Economic Behavior: Evidence from
Savings Rates, Health Behaviors, and Retirement Assets; M. Keith Chen Difficulty in translating specific words I think it's the lesser of the problems, but even when translating my own internal thoughts between English and Russian (i'm fluent in both) I frequently get stumped when trying to translate a pithy term that's lacking in another language. Partly, that's also due to implied concept."
"How does soap undermine the church in ""A Connecticut Yankee""?","This is a joke that Mark Twain used more than once. When he satirically wrote of a callow private secretary answering the letters written to a congressman in “The Facts Concerning The Recent Resignation“, he had the fool recommend ""Inflict soap and a spelling-book on every Indian that ravages the Plains, and let them die!"" In both of these cases, the joke is a comical exaggeration of conventional Victorian morality and historiography. In the late Nineteenth Century, when these stories were written, the people of Europe and America liked to think of themselves as modern. They had seen rapid technological progress that would have bewildered their grandparents. In Samuel Clemens's case, he had also broken free from some of the theocratic norms of his childhood. One tendency of these new moderns reading history was to consider the past as utterly backwards, promoting superstition, revelling in ignorance. One of the conventional tropes to mark medieval thinking was that of uncleanliness. The Victorians had inherited ""Cleanliness is next to Godliness"" from the Reformation and read that as a reaction to supposed medieval dirtiness.  This kind of thinking was bolstered by new scientific discoveries like Dr. John Snow's linking of the Broad Street Pump to an 1854 Cholera epidemic and Louis Pasteur's experiments in the 1860’s proving germ theory.  There are multiple layers of irony here because in actual fact, medieval times were not as dirty as commonly portrayed, and Victorian cities like London were disgusting by today's standards with horse waste, thick smog, and diseased water being commonplace. Nonetheless to the Victorian mind, especially among the educated classes, the root cause of medieval ignorance and superstition was the Catholic Church. The largely Protestant upper class, newly enthused with representative government, convinced itself that hierarchies (at least Catholic ones where they weren't at the top) bred servility, squalor, and ignorance. The thinking was that medieval people could have created canals, steam engines, and constitutions if they hadn't been constantly oppressed. I don't want to take the space to discredit this thinking here, but suffice it to say that the medieval era had plenty of very smart people and they weren't all engaged in futile debates like the proverbial ""number of angels dancing of the head of a pin'. In this Nineteenth Century intellectual environment, the connection between ignorance, Catholicism, and squalor would have been accepted as an axiom. This gave Twain, who always enjoyed pricking fallacies of snobs, an opportunity to exaggerate and satirize this attitude by touting soap as the cure for all social ills and as a stealth agent of modernization. Soap has been around since prehistoric times, but in the Nineteenth Century it became a packaged commercial product rather than something made in the home. It works as both a modern symbol and as contrast between the goals of the Connecticut Yankee and the surrounding medieval milliu. It functions in the quote above about American Indians in a similar way, a proposed ""quick fix"" to an ongoing culture clash that the Victorians would have seen as a fight against barbarism. Needless to say, to both our eyes and to Twain, such a simplistic conception of culture is foolish. Neither the Connecticut Yankee nor the congressman's secretary are author stand-ins. They represent the eagerness of modern enthusiasts to solve social problems as easily as modern scientists and engineers had solved physical problems. This hope, running up against stubborn human nature and existing social systems, is the real theme of the novel."
Why is the month of Aprill masculine?,"There have been a couple of different explanations given for this, but the upshot seems to be that there's nothing particularly significant about the masculinity of April - it was more a product of the way language was used at the time than any kind of symbolic statement about masculinity. In his Notes to the Canterbury Tales (2014), Prof Walter Skeat says that the masculinity of Aprille is derived from that of the Latin Aprilis. Latin was of course much more widely used, especially in literature, in Chaucer's day. However, in his notes published here and based on those of Alfred Pollard, Prof Edwin Duncan cites Skeat and then points out that: as his in Chaucer's time was the neuter, as well as the masculine, genitive, there is no evidence that Chaucer here personified either the month or the wind as a masculine. The reason why ""his"" was used as a neuter pronoun is that the word ""its"" didn't exist yet. According to Etymology Online, the neuter possessive pronoun ""its"" dates back to around the 16th century, well after Chaucer's time. (Thanks to @GarethRees for pointing this out to me.)"
Is this fictional event of a ship becoming airborne because of a storm based on a real event?,"There are many instances of boats, some of them quite large, being carried inland by a tsunami.  For example...  ...which is from the Japanese tsunami of 2011. It is quite likely that Terry Pratchett took events of this nature as inspiration for the book.  Although, wind alone isn't going to lift a boat any distance, the story doesn't have to be scientifically accurate."
Understanding a reference to Tom Sawyer in the context of avoiding work,"This is referencing the plot of the second chapter of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, by Mark Twain. In this chapter, Tom tricks the other boys into doing his work for him: “What do you call work?” “Why, ain’t that work?” Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly: “Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain’t. All I know, is, it suits Tom Sawyer.” “Oh come, now, you don’t mean to let on that you like it?” The brush continued to move. “Like it? Well, I don’t see why I oughtn’t to like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?” That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth – stepped back to note the effect – added a touch here and there – criticised the effect again – Ben watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed. Presently he said: “Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.” Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind: “No – no – I reckon it wouldn’t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly’s awful particular about this fence – right here on the street, you know – but if it was the back fence I wouldn’t mind and she wouldn’t. Yes, she’s awful particular about this fence; it’s got to be done very careful; I reckon there ain’t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it the way it’s got to be done.” “No – is that so? Oh come, now – lemme, just try. Only just a little – I’d let you, if you was me, Tom.” “Ben, I’d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly – well, Jim wanted to do it, but she wouldn’t let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn’t let Sid. Now don’t you see how I’m fixed? If you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it – ” “Oh, shucks, I’ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say – I’ll give you the core of my apple.” “Well, here – No, Ben, now don’t. I’m afeard – ” “I’ll give you all of it!”
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, chapter 2 - taken from the PBS site What they are saying here, is that this character is making the other people do his work for him - and that these people are doing the same thing, pushing their work onto other people. (FWIW, they are commonly referred to as help vampires across the Stack Exchange network.) Since Tom Sawyer tricked the other people into doing the work that he was supposed to do, they are comparing these people to him."
"What is the ""heap of broken images"" in The Waste Land?","To say anything definitive about The Waste Land is challenging; indeed, this work seems to evade interpretation with each new line and stanza. With many interpretations carry with them some merit, I contend that the line ""heap of broken images"" is meant to evoke something broader about modernist art: this line is a metatextual reference to the poem itself and its underlying epistemology. Eliot writes, ""[Y]ou know only / A heap of broken images."" I want to focus on that word ""know."" Eliot is calling into question that which we can know in this waste land. The mirror that we used to be able to hold up to reality is broken; the self is fractured. There is no unifying epistemology, or, in post-modern terms, meta-narrative. Everything is a broken image. Reading the poem in this light, one can realize that what Eliot is presenting us with broken images of a broken world. Moreover, in A Genealogy of Modernism: A study of English literary doctrine 1908-1922, Michael Levenson argues, ""The principle of order in The Waste Land depends on a plurality of
  consciousnesses, an ever-increasing series of points of view, which
  struggle towards an emergent unity and then continue to struggle past
  that unity."" (source) In the aftermath of the destruction of World War I, the social and political institutions can longer be trusted to hold society together. Instead, rather than unification, we have separation and multiplicity. We have an epistemology that jumps from image to image, each time only seeing a part of the whole. The whole has been destroyed. Consider this line amidst the plethora of allusions and annotations. The meaning of The Waste Land relies on other texts and other writers. Its meaning is fractured insofar as it is not self-contained; it is allusive. In that sense ""heap of broken images"" is an apt description for the poetic effort Eliot is making in this work. It evokes Eliot's essay ""Traditional and the Individual Talent."" In it, Eliot writes, ""No poet, no artist of any art, has his complete meaning alone. His
  significance, his appreciation is the appreciation of his relation to
  the dead poets and artists. You cannot value him alone; you must set
  him, for contrast and comparison, among the dead."" [emphasis added] That is exactly where we are in the first section of this opus: in the midst of burying the dead, tracing meaning back through the work of other artists and finding meaning in the broken images of humanity. This constitutes what the artist can know."
Do the Bible and the Epic of Gilgamesh really contain the same rare proverb about the strength of a triple-stranded rope?,"The relevant passage in the Bible is easy enough to find: it is Ecclesiates 4:12 (see Bible Hub): And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. (King James Bible) Finding the (possibly) corresponding passage in the Epic of Gilgamesh took a bit more effort.
Apparently, there is a close verbal parallel in Maureen Gallery Kovacs's translation of the Epic of Gilgamesh (Stanford University Press, 1989),
which can be found on Dust off the Bible and Academy of Ancient Texts.
(Since Kovacs's translation was published just over 30 years ago, I assume it is still copyrighted and that the owners of those websites cannot legally reproduce the text without the translator's permission or a licence from Stanford University Press, but I am unable to check whether these conditions were met.) Kovacs's translation of Tablet IV contains the following passage: 'Strangers ...
'A slippery path is not feared by two people who help each
other.'
'Twice three times...
'A three-ply rope cannot be cut.'
'The mighty lioness cubs can roll him over.""' Kovacs's translation of Tablet V contains the following passage: 'Strangers ...
'A slippery path is not feared by two people who help each other.
'Twice three times...
'A three-ply rope cannot be cut.
'The mighty lion--two cubs can roll him over.""' This seems to confirm Wikipedia's claim, but the repetition of the same text on two different tablets looks odd; moreover, the elisions suggest that the tablets are very damaged here, so the translator may have made extrapolations to fill in gaps in the original text. For this reason, I also checked three other, more recent, translations. Andrew George's translation (The Epic of Gilgamesh: The Babylonian Epic Poem and Other Texts in Akkadian and Sumerian. Translated with an introduction by Andrew George. London: Penguin, 1999. Reprinted with minor revisions in 2003) does not contain a corresponding passage in Tablet IV and presents the following passage from Tablet V: [Two] garments, however, ......, 
even a glacis-slope two [climbing can conquer.]
Two ..........
a three-ply rope [is not easily broken]
[Even] a mighty lion two cubs [can overcome.] (The italics inside the square brackets are from George's translation; they indicate ""restorations"" that are not certain or simply conjectural. Regular text between square brackets is less conjectural because based on parallel passages that can be found elsewhere.) Benjamin R. Foster's translation (The Epic of Gilgamesh. Translated and edited by Benjamin R. Foster. Second Edition. Norton, 2019) similarly does not contain a corresponding passage in Tablet IV and presents the following passage from Tablet V: Though one be weak, two [together are strong]. 
If one cannot scale a slippery slope, two [can do it together].
A three-strand rope [is stronger when doubled],
Two cubs are [stronger] than a mighty lion. (Foster does not use italics between square brackets to indicate a higher level of uncertainty about the content of the source text.) Stefan Maul's translation (Das Gilgamesch-Epos. Neu Übersetzt und kommentiert von Stefan M. Maul. München: C. H. Beck, 2005. Sixth edition, 2014) does not contain anything that corresponds with the above passages. Presumably, the German assyriologist found the Akkadian text too fragmentary to translate. What can be seen from George's and Foster's translations is that My conclusion: to the extent that the Epic of Gilgamesh and Ecclesiastes 4:12 have a proverb in common, this appears to be based on a conjectural translation of a damaged passage in the Epic that translators formulated (whether consciously or not) to echo a passage from the Old Testament."
Is Macbeth or Lady Macbeth the real villain in Shakespeare's play?,"Lady Macbeth is the villain. Macbeth is, in fact, a tragic hero. The first time I ever read Macbeth I was struck by the feeling of sympathy I had for the eponymous character at the end of the play. He had - surely - brought on his own downfall and demise and deserved his fate. Why the strange twinges of empathy for such a monster? In fact, from the very beginning, Shakespeare sets Macbeth up not as an active protagonist, but as an instrument of fate. The opening scenes of the play set Macbeth up as a person of great stature. He is a captain, honoured by the King and loved by his friends. What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won. (emphasis mine) He is also honoured by the witches, although it is not clear whether or not this is in mockery. In any respect, the witches tell Macbeth he will gain further honour and titles. This begs another open question: when the witches deliver their prophecies unto Macbeth, are they binding him to fate? Or are they corrupting him with promises, like devils tempting a mortal's weakness? Because it's clear that Macbeth's great weaknesses are pride and ambition. So the witches' words seem calculated to send Macbeth down the path to red ruin. This is never answered, but that makes it at least a possibility that Macbeth is no longer in charge of his destiny. And even if he is, he's being manipulated by diabolical forces which are impossible for him to resist due to his character flaws. Either way, when his inevitable fall comes, we can see him sympathetically as a victim of circumstance as well as the tyrant and murderer he has become. Contrast this with Lady Macbeth. She is described in much less glowing terms. In fact, at the end of the play, Malcolm says Producing forth the cruel ministers
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen, Her behaviour, in contrast to Macbeth's, is purposefully callous. Macbeth initially does not want to kill the king - it is his wife who persuades him to do so. Note this is partly because she is impatient for the power and riches that it brings. Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great; (emphasis mine) Impatience is a poor excuse for murder. Note also that she attempts to persuade Macbeth to do the deed in truly nefarious means – insulting her husband and claiming she herself would not hesitate to violently kill a child. Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
And live a coward in thine own esteem, I would, while it was smiling in my face,
Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
Have done to this. One could argue that she, too, is in the grip of evil magic and her actions are beyond her control. Evil spirits are invoked: The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood; But note a key difference. Macbeth met the witches either by chance or at their behest. His wife is deliberately inviting the devil to make her even more wicked than she already is. Every cruel choice she makes is of her own volition. Eventually, of course, it catches up with her in her nightmares. And now the audience might feel a twinge of sympathy - yet it is clear she has brought this on herself, by choice. One of the many fascinating things about Macbeth, besides its open questions of fate and destiny, is how it shows us an unusually tender side to villainy in all its forms."
Is Simon epileptic?,"Dictionary definition of Epilepsy: A neurological disorder marked by sudden recurrent episodes of sensory disturbance, loss of consciousness, or convulsions, associated with abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Let's have a look at Simon: [...] the choir huddled into line and stood there swaying in the sun [...]
  one of the boys flopped on his face in the sand and the line broke up. // Simon is particularly delicate. Victims of epilepsy are more likely to faint as a result of over-heating.  ""He's always throwing a faint"", said Merridew. ""He did in Gib.; and Addis; and at matins over the precentor."" // Epileptic victims are more likely to faint in stressful situations, such as performing in a choir, or as a result of tiredness. Modern-day causes of epilepsy involve taking drugs, which similarly degrade your body's functionality. Note 'recurrent episodes' in the definition, and that Simon is 'always throwing a faint'. Now that the pallor of his faint was over, Simon was a skinny, vivid little boy, with a glance coming up from under a hut of straight hair that hung down, black and course. // Epilepsy is characterised by its suddenness. Similarly, Simon's fits seem to turn on and off at the flick of a switch. For a moment or two Simon was happy to be accepted and then he ceased to think about himself. When he bashed into a tree Ralph looked sideways and Robert sniggered. Simon reeled and a white spot on his forehead turned read and trickled. // Epileptic victims suffer from sensory disturbance, making Simon more likely to get distracted from something as small as the fact that Ralph 'smiled constrainedly' at him. The fact that he is 'reeling' even though he has 'allowed his pace to slacken until he was walking', hints that he gets dizzy easily, which is something that causes epileptic attacks and so is a common attribute of epileptic victims.  Simon lowered his head, carefully keeping his eyes shut, then sheltered them with his hand. // It's well known that epileptic victims are prone to seizures/fainting as a result of abnormal electrical activity triggered in the brain because of flashing light. Simon was experiencing something similar beneath a veil of leaves. Sunlight spread across a forest canopy will cause a 'dappled' effect of irregular light/dark patterns which are associated with with flashing lights. This would have been heightened by swaying branches and Simon's movement underfoot.  [...] the Lord of the Flies hung on his stick and grinned. [...] In Simon's right temple, a pulse began to beat on the brain. // That about says it all. Normal victims of fainting don't hallucinate like this. Golding may well have known about the correlation between religious experience and epilepsy. Simon is probably a christ-like figure. It is more likely that the pig-lord Simon saw was an epiphany about human nature, than a convenient figment of his stressed-out imagination. Yet the way we refer to an event is lot more telling than the details of the event itself. Crucially, Golding did not say Simon 'felt rather faint so he soon passed out'. If he had, that would imply that he viewed it as an isolated, random, and unexpected event that anyone could experience. Instead, Golding explains that Simon 'knew that one of his times was coming on'. Therefore, Simon's continual fainting is more likely to be a diagnosed condition of which he is fully aware, such as epilepsy.   It's also worth noting that the boys may lack sleep. Sleep deprivation, if Simon has it, is something that would make him more likely to have epileptic attacks. Although Ralph is the only boy who helps Simon with the shelters, he describes them as 'tottery'. So the boys rest in 'tottery' shelters on a deserted island, but have up to this point enjoyed living in a first-world country where even Piggy had a warm bed. It's like camping night after night without a sleeping bag, for someone who has never gone camping before. In addition, Simon has the burden of moral conscience - he alone voices the littluns' fears of the 'beastie', saying 'maybe it's only us'/'what's the dirtiest thing there is?', but when the boys laugh in his face they make it clear that Simon is alone in his traumatic fear. Simon is probably no older than ten, given that he is so short (see below) and Piggy calls him 'young Simon'. From all this, are we supposed to gather that Simon is sleep-deprived?  Simon, walking in front of Ralph, felt a flicker of incredulity - a beast with claws that scratched, that sat on the mountain-top, that left no tracks and yet was not fast enough to catch Samneric. Simon does not believe, like Jack, that the beast is something that they can hunt and kill. He is too mature for that: 'his eyes were dim with the infinite cynicism of adult life'. His free indirect speech shows that he thinks of the beast as the people, something they can't control. If had to lose sleep as a pre-teen kid, it would be over an indestructible evil residing inside us (""my"" belief), rather than a freak bogeyman on the top of a mountain (everyone else's belief). However Simon thought of the beast, there rose before his inward sight a picture that was at once heroic and sick.  Apart from evidence to suggests Simon is epileptic, Golding had incentive to give him epilepsy in the first place. Simon is a genius. In spite of his youth, he has incredible perception that Golding believed no-one of the time actually possessed. But his unique insight - that the 'beastie' lies in the people - helps make him an outsider. He is indeed epileptic. In the context of a barbaric society, epilepsy is not just a medical condition but a weakness. Epilepsy is a tool that makes him more delicate, easier to victimise, and thus even more of an outsider. (Not because epilepsy makes him frail, but because people who are more frail are more likely to have epilepsy). This drawback makes it more believable that he could be killed, and didn't manage to flee/put up any fight. If he had optimal physical ability, no-one would buy it.  His epileptic attacks no doubt take their toll on both his energy and the minimal respect that people have for to him. All the while, this effect contributes to Golding's theme of outsiders (see below), relating to the wartime prosecution that made him believe ""man produces evil as a bee produces honey"", which is the whole point of the book. Simon is described as 'skinny', and Ralph's language implies that he is short -  ""If Simon walks in the middle of us"", said Ralph, ""then we could talk over his head.""  Not to mention the fact that he can hardly keep up -  The three of them fell into step. This meant that every now and then Simon had to do a double shuffle to catch up with the others. Golding's revulsion of Nazism was less than a decade old when he wrote the novel, so survival of the fittest and the rejection of outsiders is a recurring theme. The theme of outsiders is important, making Simon's epilepsy important too. Much like the child with the birthmark who was burned in wildfire, the democratic leader who was hunted down, and the overweight geek who was knocked off a cliff, Simon (ironically mistaken for 'beastie') was murdered by savages. Ralph says to Simon in chapter 7 'you're batty' and to Jack that 'He's queer. He's funny', and Piggy also dismisses him: 'he's cracked'. Simon is also too kind for his own good: he gives Piggy his share of the meat, thereby vexing Jack at his worst. He advises Jack to suck his wound despite having been bullied by him. He selflessly picks food for the littluns. He helps Ralph carry Percival to the shelter, remains loyal to him, and works consistently hard on the shelters (despite Ralph's taunts).  Simon's 'goodness' goes hand-in-hand with his earlier drawback, epilepsy, as they both portray him as a pushover (easier to kill). Given how convenient it would have been for Golding to give Simon epilepsy, and all the evidence that backs it up, I believe that Simon is epileptic."
Was Tess raped?,"I would disagree about there being ambiguity as to whether Tess was raped. I think this question misunderstands the actual debate about that specific scene. Let's take a look at the scene in question There was no answer. The obscurity was now so great that he could see absolutely nothing but a pale nebulousness at his feet, which represented the white muslin figure he had left upon the dead leaves. Everything else was blackness alike. D'Urberville stooped; and heard a gentle regular breathing. He knelt and bent lower, till her breath warmed his face, and in a moment his cheek was in contact with hers. She was sleeping soundly, and upon her eyelashes there lingered tears.  Tess is asleep. Tess can not give consent. Consent means that you give permission for something to happen. Tess can not give permission because she is literally unconscious.  The ambiguity in this scene isn't about whether Tess was raped. The ambiguity stems from how the scene was written. After Hardy tells us that Tess is asleep, the narrative essentially ends. The next chapter begins ""some few weeks subsequent to the night ride in The Chase"". The question of why this gap occurs, and what affect the gap has on the story, is a very interesting question best addressed in a followup question. Another interesting question is about what this scene tells us about gender and class. Hardy is clearly trying to make some sort of criticism of the dynamics in this scene: in the next paragraph, he essentially asks why this scene occurs over and over again. Why it was that upon this beautiful feminine tissue, sensitive as gossamer, and practically blank as snow as yet, there should have been traced such a coarse pattern as it was doomed to receive; why so often the coarse appropriates the finer thus, the wrong man the woman, the wrong woman the man, many thousand years of analytical philosophy have failed to explain to our sense of order.  There's a lot you can critique about Hardy's portrayal of this scene. For example, the passage seems to imply that we should give up trying to stop sexual assault. The sentence ""many thousand years of analytical philosophy have failed to explain to our sense of order"" implies that sexual assault is a strange, unexplainable phenomena that can never be stopped. Another interesting followup question would be to ask about the political message this passage conveys about rape, class, and gender. There are a lot of interesting questions about this passage where there's a lot of room for debate. I don't see how there can be any debate about whether Tess was raped, given what actually happened."
Why did the stars throw down their spears?,"One approach to interpreting these lines is to read them semi-literally: the tiger is such a fearsome creature that even the stars themselves threw down their weapons rather than face it, and wept at its power. Stanzas 2–4 use the conceit of describing the tiger's making as the construction of a machine of war: something mechanical, unfeeling, cruel by creation. Even the famous phrase “fearful symmetry” of the first stanza alludes to this: machines and technology are symmetrical, and their construction is plotted and planned, “framed”, in the case of the tiger by some “immortal hand or eye” which is equal to the task of constructing such a weapon. Stanza 2: In what distant deeps or skies.
  Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
  On what wings dare he aspire?
  What the hand, dare seize the fire?  This stanza places the origin of the fire burning in the tiger's eyes in some far-off place, either deep in the depths or far off in the sky, and questions what being would have the strength and the gall to claim it for the tiger's construction. To me this rings of the Promethean myth: like Prometheus, the tiger's creator dared to steal a powerful flame from somewhere beyond human ken and bring it back to Earth.  Stanzas 3 and 4: And what shoulder, & what art,
  Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
  And when thy heart began to beat,
  What dread hand? & what dread feet?   What the hammer? what the chain,
  In what furnace was thy brain?
  What the anvil? what dread grasp,
  Dare its deadly terrors clasp!   The phrase “twist the sinews of thy heart” in stanza 3 alludes to rope-making, like the ropes used in siege machines or to restrain the cannons of Blake's time when on-board a ship. Stanza 4 describes a forge (the furnace where the tiger's brain was crafted) and other blacksmith's tools (hammers, chains, anvils).  Next come the two lines in question: “When the stars threw down their spears / And water'd heaven with their tears”. The previous stanzas  implied a process of technological advancement, starting with the Promethean theft of the fire, advancing to rope-making, and then using the flame for metallurgy. The Tiger, a machine of war so fierce that not even the stars themselves could stand against it, is the culmination. But in something of a twist ending, Blake reveals in the next two lines that the Tiger is not a human creation: “Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?” The immortal hand or eye that dared frame the fearsome Tiger is the same benevolent creator who made the innocent lamb from “The Lamb”.  This leaves one question: why, specifically, the stars? Because it helps set up the “twist ending”. The first four stanzas, describing the tiger's creation, allude to a human creator with the reference to Prometheus and the mentions of physical body parts, such as shoulders, hands, and feet, and human tools such as hammers, chains, and anvils. The stars are clearly beyond all human power, but lines 17 and 18 imply that a human might have created something capable of overcoming them until the “twist” in lines 19 and 20. (I'm putting “twist” in quotes because it's not terribly surprising to anyone who's read “The Lamb” and recognized the parallel structure of the two Songs books, though line 20 does contain the explicit callback to “The Lamb”.)  This study help page says the two lines about the stars “may refer to the casting down of the angels after Satan rebelled against God”, which would make “stars” a metaphorical term for angels. This interpretation, when taken with lines 19 and 20, also helps set up the “twist”. Now we can interpret line 19, “Did he smile his work to see?”, as asking whether God, upon defeating the rogue angels, making them throw down their spears and weep as they were cast out of Heaven, smiled and took pleasure in his victory at war. In this light, line 20, “Did he who made the Lamb make thee?”, becomes an allusion to the dual nature of God, who, to the poet's disbelief, is both the loving, gentle being who made the innocent Lamb, and the vengeful, warlike being who made the vicious Tiger and smiled to see his defeated enemies weep.

"How old was Tatiana during the main events of ""Eugene Onegin""?","I found this article, which summarises an analysis by Russian sexologist A. Kotrovsky and columnist E. Tchernych and concludes that Tatiana was probably only thirteen: Pushkin uses the word otrokovitsa. This hard-to-pronounce Russian word is usually translated as maiden but in Pushkin’s time otrok (male) and otrokovitsa (female) referred to children from 7 to 15 years old. In Chapter Three of Eugene Onegin Tatiana asks her nyanya (nanny) if she was in love in her age, and gets the answer: “What nonsense, Tanya! In those other ages we’d never heard of love: why, at the thought, my husband’s mother had chased me to the world above.” ”How did you come to marry, nyanya?” “I reckon, by God’s will. My Vanya was younger still, but at that stage I was just THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE.” Then, in famous Chapter Four, Pushkin says: To listen to the same tedious objections, Do battle with rooted convictions, Such as never were and never have been Even in a young girl WHO’S JUST THIRTEEN! In a letter of 29 November 1824 to his fellow poet Pyotr Vyazemsky, Pushkin wrote: the sense is not quite precise, there is more truth in the letter - the letter of a woman - and, on top of that, a seventeen-year-old one - and on top of that a woman in love. (quote found on pp. 85-86 of Pushkin's Tatiana by Olga Peters Hasty)"
What is the purpose of all the lists in chapter 12 of Joyce's Ulysses?,"To add to andejons' answer regarding the Gilbert schema's technique of ""gigantism"", I'd suggest Joyce may also have been referencing, parodying or even honouring the 16th century Gargantua and Pantagruel by François Rabelais. It's the story, told over five books, of two giants, and is replete with numerous lists and catalogues, some of which go on for several pages. Significantly, book four - ""The Fourth Book of Pantagruel"" - describes an epic sea voyage, and can itself be viewed as a parody of The Odyssey.  There are a number of lists in the Fourth Book:  I would not be in the least surprised if Joyce had delighted in the sheer extravagance and absurdity of Rabelais, and was paying tribute to the Fourth Book in the Cyclops chapter of Ulysses."
What does it mean to greet a guest with an unsheathed sword?,"This is a sign of hostility.  Times are hard between the Starks and Tyrion at this time, since Tyrion is suspected for trying to murder Bran earlier in the book. The scene that follows between Rob and Tyrion is filled with hostile comments, glares, and movements.  This is hinted at in the unsheathed sword quote; the hospitality laws are very important in Westeros, and so greeting with an unsheathed sword is like saying ""I want to kill you, but unfortunately it's illegal.""  Here's a quote from later in the chapter, after Tyrion gives Bran a pretty awesome gift: “Is this some trap, Lannister? What’s Bran to you? Why should you want to help him?” In addition, the very quote in your answer hints at this.  Saying that any man of the Watch is welcome is all but slamming the door in Tyrion's face, since Tyrion is not of the Watch. Edit: Thanks to this answer on Scifi.SE for this material! A lord with a bared sword across his knees is making a traditional sign that he is denying guest right from here.  The guest right is sacred in Westeros, and Robb later sheathes his sword, inviting Tyrion in. Robb Stark finally sheathed his sword. “I . . . I may have
  been hasty with you,” he said. “You’ve done Bran a
  kindness, and, well . . .” Robb composed himself with an
  effort. “The hospitality of Winterfell is yours if you wish it,
  Lannister.”"
Who chained the albatross to the mariner's neck?,"Here is the verse in additional context: Ah! well a-day! what evil looks
   Had I from old and young!Instead of the cross, the albatross
  About my neck was hung. Why is the albatross there? Well, it is evidently taking place of ""the cross"". In the first two lines of this stanza, he speaks of how the people give him ""evil looks"", that is, disapproving ones. They do this, of course, because they killed the albatross. This was a maritime symbol of good luck. Now, since it has been slain, the mariner most likely willingly put the bird across his neck. I'm not so sure ""chained"" is the correct word. Whether or not is literal, I'd say, is besides the point. When reading poetry, you read not to read an account of what happened, but rather try to read into the meaning of the text. Back to the bit about the cross. This text has evidently some type of Christian background. Not to say that it is a Christian poem; the two mentions of Christ's name, on lines 123 and 488 are not so much as invoking Christ as speaking his name. Now, let's take ""the cross"" to mean the Christian cross. This is a symbol of faith. To say that the slain albatross displaced the cross on his next (or as would be customary to be found on his neck) is most likely a statement about faith: that instead of having faith, the mariner ""believes"" for the lack of a better term, in luck. So perhaps this albatross could be said to be a statement of faith (rather, the lack thereof). The quality of said albatross being dead, however, leaves something to think about..."
"What happened on April 22, 1838?","After looking into this further based on some hints in the book's footnotes, it turns out that Taras Shevchenko was a serf. He was trained as a painter for awhile, but he wanted to continue his studies under Karl Briullov, which required that he be released from serfdom. In order to secure Shevchenko's freedom (at a cost of 2500 Rubles), Brillouv painted a portrait of Vasilli Andreyevich Zhukovski (1783 - 1852), who was a Russian poet, and auctioned it off in order to raise the needed money. Shevchenko's freedom was secured on April 22, 1838. Incidentally, Kateryna was also his mother's name, who died when Shevchenko was 9. His father subsequently became a chumak (also referred to in the poem) and he also died in 1825. Sources: Wikipedia page on Taras Shevchenko as well as the book's footnotes."
"Does ""The Soul selects her own Society"" by Emily Dickinson have a simile?","Taking the elements of style in turn: (A) Almost every concrete noun in the poem is used metaphorically, including door, chariots, gate, emperor, mat, nation, valve. (B) You are right that “I’ve known her close the Valves of her attention — Like Stone” contains a simile. There's some ambiguity and ellipsis here: you can read it as “I’ve known her close the valves of her attention like stone [closes the valves of its attention]” or as “I’ve known her close the valves of her attention [so that it is] like stone” but in either case there is a simile. (C) ‘Grammar’ is sometimes used so as to include spelling and punctuation (in addition to the usual elements of inflection and syntax), so in this sense the unconventional choice of punctuation (dashes instead of commas and stops) counts as a ‘grammatical irregularity’. (D) The poem has two slant rhymes: gate / mat and one / stone. The rhyme pausing / kneeling would not normally be described as a ‘slant rhyme’, I think, because the stressed syllables (paus- / kneel-) have no similarity in sound. Rhymes where only the unstressed syllables (here -sing / -ling) are similar, are known as ‘unstressed rhymes’: There is also “unstressed rhyme,” where the rhyming syllables are both unstressed or weak: e.g., honey / motley, mysteries / litanies, wretchedness /  featureless. But there is some question whether this constitutes rhyme at all. Stephen Cushman, Clare Cavanagh, Jahan Ramazani, Paul Rouzer (eds.), The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics: Fourth Edition, p. 1187 (E) Metaphors and similes are types of figurative language, so this follows from (A) and (B). All elements are present in the poem and so this question is unanswerable as written. This isn’t the only case where the book is in error: see here for another. I guess SAT II Success: Literature must have been put together with some haste or lack of care."
"Source of quote: ""Speaking the truth that somebody wants you not to publish is journalism. Everything else is marketing.""","I began my investigation of this question by doing a web search for quote speaking truth wants publish journalism marketing. In the results, among a lot of serious discussions about journalism, was a Goodreads page which attributes the following quote to George Orwell: “Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed: everything else is public relations.” ― George Orwell  Actually I do think this sounds a lot more like George Orwell than Oscar Wilde. The former had worked as a journalist, but also described journalists (in Homage to Catalonia) as people who lie for a living. So my next search was for the exact quote cited in the Goodreads article. The top result on that search was ""Even if it looks, sounds, walks, and quacks like an Orwell quote, it still might NOT be an Orwell quote"" (25 September 2012), a blog post which points out that it's hard to track down this quote as really being from Orwell. One of the links on that page was to the Wikiquote talk page about George Orwell, where several contributors were trying to track down an original source for this quote, Orwellian or otherwise. One user claimed (29 June 2012) that the original version is due to William Randolph Hearst: “News is something somebody doesn't want printed; all else is advertising.” - William Randolph Hearst Another user found (24 November 2012) a similar quote from Alfred Harmsworth, Lord Northcliffe: ""News is what somebody somewhere wants to suppress; all the rest is advertising."" Yet another user found another similar quote from Horacio Verbitsky (in Spanish): “Journalism is to spread what someone does not want you to know; the rest is propaganda.” And finally - finally! - someone linked to the Quote Investigator page on this quote, from 20 January 2013. Quote Investigator, by the way, is an absolutely invaluable resource for answering quote-identification questions here: they do really in-depth research to puzzle out the true origins of a quote, and everything is properly sourced and verifiable. So here's the final answer.  A version of this quote first appeared on 30 November 1918, in page 18, column 4 of The Fourth Estate: A Newspaper for the Makers of Newspapers, Ernest F, Birmingham, Fourth Estate Publishing Company, New York. The quote is as follows: “Whatever a patron desires to get published is advertising; whatever he wants to keep out of the paper is news,” is the sentiment expressed in a little framed placard on the desk of L. E. Edwardson, day city editor of the Chicago Herald and Examiner.

Why are manga panels read differently than Japanese text?,"There are two traditional ways of writing in Japanese - in regular writing, it often does go vertically, but it can also go right to left in regular writing, too. The vertical form of writing is called tategaki (縦書き), and the horizontal form is called yokogaki (横書き). Vertical writing is largely used in printed novels, newspapers. Horizontal writing is largely useful in contexts where words from other languages need to be embedded.  It's important to note, however, that manga does use both vertical and horizontal text. The reason why mostly comes down to available space and framing. Being able to write both directions and still be understood confers a lot of opportunity to better utilize the page. You can push descriptions in a horizontal panel to the sides, where they can be written in a vertical column, and write horizontally where appropriate in horizontal and vertical panels.  The direction of text is also a good aid to determine where you should keep reading - while only occasionally used for this purpose, it can easily serve as a guide for the reader's eye.  So, why do the panels go in the order they do? The long and short of it is that the direction books are typically read in manga, mixed with the directions that text are read, give rise to the panel direction order. Yokogaki is read top to bottom, which leads to the vertical row-based panel reading method. Tategaki, the dominant writing method, is read right to left, which does two things to the reading order. First, it makes it so that the book's pages themselves are read from the Western ""back"" to ""front."" Second, it makes it so that the panels themselves are read right to left.   On this page, the eye tracks the left to right text in panel 1. In panel 2, the eye is now tracking vertical columns, but is doing so right to left. By the time you reach the end of the panel, you're visually adjacent to the next panel you want to read.   In other words, the way manga are written tends to expect you to track the writing on the page in an entirely different way. That motivates the use of right-to-left panels, because the columns of text move that direction. However, they're still read top to bottom, because both horizontal and vertical text are mixed together.  So, why does it goes right to left and then top to bottom rather than the other way around? This is likely simply because tategaki is the dominant writing method in manga and Japanese graphic novels. Because it's more common, the page layout tends to favor it, simply for ease of reading."
A detective story about money printing,"This is Lee Child's Killing Floor, the first published Jack Reacher book. Jack Reacher gets off a Greyhound bus in the town of Margrave, Georgia, because he remembers his brother mentioning that a blues musician named Blind Blake had died there. Much to his surprise, shortly after his arrival, he is arrested in a local diner for murder on the orders of the sheriff, Morrison, who falsely claims he saw Reacher leave the scene. While in custody, Reacher meets Finlay, the chief of detectives, and Roscoe, a female officer who believes him to be innocent. Reacher persuades Finlay to call a number on a piece of paper found in the dead man's shoe; the number leads them to Paul Hubble, a retired banker who instantly confesses to the murder. Before Reacher can be released, he and Hubble are transferred to a state prison in Warburton, where Reacher manages to thwart an attempt on their lives by the Aryan Brotherhood. Suspecting that the deputy warden set them up, Reacher joins Finlay's investigation, while Hubble is presumed dead after vanishing from his house in the middle of the day. Reacher learns that the murdered man is his brother, Joe, who was running an investigation into a counterfeiting ring operated by the Kliner family under the protection of Morrison, several dirty cops, and the corrupt mayor, Grover Teale. A second body, belonging to truck driver Sherman Stoller, is found, and Morrison and his wife are brutally murdered shortly thereafter. Roscoe theorizes that the Kliners are using Margrave as a distribution hub for their counterfeit money, but this is eventually disproven when Reacher searches one of their trucks and finds it empty. He then realizes that the opposite is true: the Kliners have been hoarding the money in response to a Coast Guard operation cutting off their supply of bills from Venezuela, and plan to resume distribution once the operation is shut down as a cost-saving measure. Sending Hubble's family into hiding to protect them from Kliner, Reacher kills his son and several other associates after luring them into an ambush. He then informs Finlay of the secret behind Kliner's operation, which his brother had been trying to prove: to obtain the special paper required to make undetectable forgeries, the criminals had employed Hubble to collect hundreds of thousands of used $1 bills and send them to ports in Florida through Stoller and other drivers, whereupon they would be bleached in Venezuela to remove the ink and then used to make forged $100 bills. However, when they return to Margrave, they are taken captive by Kliner, Teale, and Finlay's FBI contact Picard, who reveals that he's been keeping track of their progress, and has Roscoe and Hubble's family in his custody. Kliner reveals that Hubble isn't dead, but in hiding, and threatens to kill his hostages unless Reacher finds him. En route, Reacher stages a distraction and kills Picard's escorts, before apparently shooting him dead. He then locates Hubble in a nearby motel, and brings him back to Margrave. Finding the criminals gone, they spring Finlay from captivity in the police station and set it on fire, before locating the hostages at Kliner's warehouse. Reacher kills a dirty cop named Baker, shoots Teale and Kliner, and sets fire to the rest of their money. A wounded Picard shows up and beats Reacher down, but Finlay distracts him long enough for Reacher to kill him. The group then escapes as the warehouse explodes, and Reacher ends up spending the night with Roscoe. Realizing that his actions will attract a lot of unwanted attention from the authorities, Reacher decides to leave Georgia. Roscoe gives him one last gift: a picture of his brother retrieved from one of Kliner's victims. The scene where Reacher is tackled into the swimming pool sounded familiar, so I did a quick search, finding the other details matched. As much as anything, the factory blowing up is kind of a Reacher trademark in that he's more of a force of righteous destruction than a detective (something I remember having a great deal of ""Fridge Horror"" to me in one book where he blows up a facility processing radioactive metal... so much for living within a few hundred miles of that spot)."
Why did Bill Watterson choose the character names he did?,"With regards to Calvin and Hobbes: Later, when Watterson was creating names for the characters in his comic strip, he decided upon Calvin (after the Protestant reformer John Calvin) and Hobbes (after the social philosopher Thomas Hobbes), allegedly as a ""tip of the hat"" to the political science department at Kenyon. In The Complete Calvin and Hobbes, Watterson stated that Calvin is named for ""a 16th-century theologian who believed in predestination,"" and Hobbes for ""a 17th-century philosopher with a dim view of human nature."" (From the Wikipedia article; unfortunately this particular section is only cited by a dead link to a personal autobiography.) Looking at the Amazon preview/Google book preview of Looking for Calvin and Hobbes: The Unconventional Story of Bill Watterson, it says He later told an interviewer in 1987 that the names Calvin and Hobbes were ""a tip of the hat to the political science department at Kenyon College...I thought it was funny."" Calvin was named after the sixteenth-century Protestant theologian who believed in predestination, Hobbes after the philosopher a century later who once observed that ""life is nasty, brutish, and short"". Or that's what Watterson would have you believe. ""That's not true,"" Rich West told me. ""The linking of the two names wasn't natural. The strip did not come from the idea that both characters would be named after philosophical thinkers. However, Hobbes was definitely a tip of the hat - and perhaps a bit of a smirk at - his political science degree from Kenyon. Calvin was just a coincidence."" This makes the origin of Calvin and Hobbes' names fairly clear; now for Miss Wormwood's. In the same book just quoted, it says ""I have a lot of sympathy for Miss Wormwood,"" Watterson admitted in his interview with The Comics Journal. ""We see hints that she's waiting to retire, that she smokes too much, and that she takes a lot of medication. I think she seriously believes in the value of education, so needless to say, she's an unhappy person."" 
  Wormwood's name is borrowed from the apprentice devil in C.S. Lewis' novel The Screwtape Letters. This devil's job is to keep his human charge on a course that will ultimately lead him away from God and into the awaiting arms of the devil. The other authority figures at the school are portrayed with equal disdain [...] These characters represent censorship, they embody the idea of institutional control and loss of self. They seek to dampen Calvin's imaginative life by trying to force him, an unusually shaped peg, into a square hole. Their goal is to lead him away from who he truly is [...] Which I think summarizes the meaning of Miss Wormwood's name quite nicely."
"What evidence was there in ""The Naked Sun"" to suggest that Baley had feelings for Gladia?","We see several times that he considered her attractive: She lifted her arms above her head, running her fingers through the hair and spreading it out as though to hasten drying. Her arms were slim and graceful. Very attractive, Baley thought.    Chapter 4  ... She looked up, her face as pretty as ever, despite its obvious distress -  perhaps because of it.    Chapter 5  We then start to see signs that he is beginning to fall in love with her: Or was it Gladia? He would be seeing her soon, not viewing her. Was that what gave him confidence and this odd feeling of mixed apprehension and anticipation?
 Chapter 15  ... ""Are you perhaps being influenced by extraneous motives of your own, Partner Elijah? Mrs. Delmarre is an attractive woman and you are an Earthman in whom a preference for the personal presence of an attractive woman is not psychotic.""
  ""I have better reasons,"" said Baley uneasily. (Daneel's cool glance was too penetrating and soul-dissecting by half. Jehoshaphat! The thing was only a machine.)    Chapter 16  And now, towards the end, there is this quote, which is possibly the most telling.  ""You will."" Baley looked at the slim girl who stood before him and said, not without a momentary pang, ""And you will be married someday, too. Really married, I mean.""    Chapter 18  ... Even the thought that a ship was waiting to take him back to Earth did not wipe out the sense of loss he felt at that moment. Undersecretary Albert Minnim's look was intended to be one of prim welcome. ""I am glad to see you back on Earth. Your report, of course, arrived before you did and is being studied. You did a good job. The matter will look well in your record.""
  ""Thank you,"" said Baley. There was no room for further elation in him. Being back on Earth; being safe in the Caves; being in hearing of Jessie's voice (he had spoken to her already) had left him strangely empty.    Chapter 18 "
What inspired the writing of Sredni Vashtar?,"It seems that Sredni Vashtar, like many of Saki's stories pitting children against adults, was inspired from his childhood. Saki had lost his parents at an early age, and was fostered by tyrannical aunts. From Reading Saki: The Fiction of H.H. Munro by Brian Gibson: Munro's true mother was run over by a cow and Ethel notes that Aunt
  Augusta was afraid of the creatures, [...] this bovine-induced tragedy
  seems significant, given Saki's ""preoccupation with animals that
  attack women""; these attacks seem both imaginative recreations
  and reworkings of Mary Munro's death — perhaps helping her son
  to deal vicariously with the loss — and fantasies of
  surrogate-mothers' deaths. Ethel Munro herself notes that Aunt Augusta
  and Aunt Tom were ""guilty of mental cruelty; we often longed for
  revenge"". Saki's stories, perhaps reflecting Munro's absence of or yearning for
  his mother, do not show the defeat of a mother as often as they revel
  in the defeat of aunts or other female guardian figures by fate,
  animals and children. [...] In the much-anthologized ""Sredni Vashtar"",
  Conradin's revered polecat-ferret kills his strict cousin-guardian
  Mrs. De Ropp after she kills Conradin's pet Houdan hen, echoing
  Munro's childhood loss of a favourite Houdan cock. (Ethel Munro is Saki's sister.) And later on, while discussing The Lumber-Room, The Penance and Sredni Vashtar: This sense of surveillance, of being trapped by a guardian's watchful
  eye, more in keeping with Victorian than Edwardian settings for
  child-centered fiction, suggests these tales tap into the adult
  Munro's remembrance of his 1870s childhood."
How did the authors of The 39 Clues decide on a plot outline?,"The 39 Clues series is currently maintained by Scholastic, with them choosing the next author. The storyline is pre-decided, and each author writes the next part of the plot.  For example, Scholastic came up with the outline and Rick Riordan fleshed out the main storyline and wrote the first book, The Maze of Bones. See here for a slightly old (but still accurate as far I as can tell) explanation. Here's a quote from that page: Who is writing The 39 Clues books?
Rick Riordan, #1 NYT bestselling author of the Percy Jackson series, kicks off the action with the first book, MAZE OF BONES, which introduces the main characters, sets the tone for the series, and reveals the first big clue. Riordan is also the architect of THE 39 CLUES story arc; he’s created the entire plot outline for the central mystery. Millioncopy selling author Gordon Korman (Island, Everest, Dive) has written Book 2.
Acclaimed author Peter Lerangis (The Watchers, Antarctica, Spy-X) will write Book 3. Jude Watson, New York Times bestselling Star Wars Series author will write Book 4. Patrick Carman, author of the internationally bestselling Land of Elyon series, will write Book 5. Emphasis added."
How does the old norse kenning 'nausta blakks hlé-mána gífrs drífu gim-slöngvir' break down into 'warrior',"It unpacks as follows: nausta blakks ‘steed of boathouses’ = ship
hlémána ‘protecting moon’ of the ship = shield
gífr ‘terror’ of the shield = sword
drífa ‘storm’ of the sword = battle
gim ‘fire’ of battle = sword
slöngvir ‘slinger’ of the sword = warrior Thomas Andrew DuBois (2008). Sanctity in the North: Saints, Lives, and Cults in Medieval Scandinavia, p. 127. University of Toronto Press. gífr seems to mean literally “witch, hag” (A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic, p. 165), hence “ogress” in Wikipedia, whereas DuBois takes it in the more abstract sense of “terror”, but clearly the kenning works much the same either way."
"How much of ""The Adventure of the Second Stain"" did Conan Doyle have planned when he wrote ""The Naval Treaty""?","I haven't been able to find any primary source material from Doyle on the matter, and after a decent amount of reading, it doesn't seem like anyone else has, either. However, that doesn't mean I can't give it a good shot, because we've certainly got some material to go on, especially if we consider the stories in the context of all of Doyle's stories about Holmes. First, while there are certainly some similarities between ""The Adventure of the Second Stain"" (which I will use to refer to the actual printed story) and the imaginary one, there are also quite a few differences (all quotes in the bullets from Watson's writing in ""The Adventure of the Naval Treaty""): The first of these, however, deals with interest of such importance and implicates so many of the first families in the kingdom No, it doesn't. By my count, the people who knew about the problem in England were the Prime Minister (Lord Bellinger), the Secretary for European Affairs (Trelawney Hope), Hope's wife, and, according to Hope, ""each member of the Cabinet"" as well as ""two, or possibly three, departmental officials"" - as plus Eduardo Lucas, who I'll get to in a moment. What about anyone outside England? According to the Secretary, ""no one abroad"" knew of the letter. Only one ""first family"", therefore, is implicated, and that is the family of the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope. Yes, Scotland Yard and the French police were conducting investigations at the time that had a bearing on the case, but these were just into the murder of Eduardo Lucas, also known as Henri Fournaye. I won't spoil the plot for anyone who hasn't read ""The Adventure of the Second Stain"", but I will say that the police didn't find out about the connection between Lucas and the lost letter. No case, however, in which Holmes was engaged has ever illustrated the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply. This is absolutely not true. In fact, precisely three people knew - prior to the story's publication - how Holmes solved the real case: Watson, the person who took the letter (whom I shall leave anonymous), and, of course, Holmes himself. In fact, Holmes actually ends the narrative with an enigmatic reply to the Prime Minister, when asked how he did it: ""We also have our diplomatic secrets,"" said he, and picking up his hat he turned to the door. First, that's my favorite line in any Holmes story. Second, Holmes' methods weren't illustrated to anyone besides Watson! Perhaps others were indeed impressed, but that's only because they were intentionally kept in the dark about it. So I think there's a discrepancy here. I still retain an almost verbatim report of the interview in which he demonstrated the true facts of the case to Monsieur Dubugue of the Paris police, and Fritz von Waldbaum, the well-known specialist of Dantzig. For a discussion about how Holmes actually did not explain things to people, see my above point. If he didn't explain his methods to the bloody Prime Minister, there's no way he talked to foreign officials about it, given that the British government - at least, those who knew about it - wanted the whole thing kept secret. Plus, while there was a French police investigation (with no mention of Dubugue) involved during the real adventure, it had to do with the death of Eduardo Lucas/Henri Fournaye, not the missing letter. I can also assure you that neither von Waldbaum nor the city of Dantzig were even mentioned. In other words, all three sentences Watson dedicates to describing the story bear almost no resemblance to the actual published adventure. Now, it is possible - possible - that this is intentional deception on the part of Watson (and thus Doyle), to grab the readers' attention without telling them anything of substance, and not revealing any specifics, to protect Holmes and his request for secrecy. We do know that Watson is at times an unreliable narrator. However, using that assumption here is a generous interpretation of the problems. Second, Thomas Vranken's The Public, the Press, and Celebrities in The Return of Sherlock Holmes establishes many ties and underlying themes among all the stories in this collection, implying that the published version of ""The Adventure of the Second Stain"" was written during this same period. For instance, secrecy and the troubles of those in power are touched upon in quite a few adventures, including ""The Adventure of the Priory School"". Additionally, Watson himself becomes much less willing to give details of certain cases: I should be guilty of an indiscretion if I were even to hint at the identity of some of the illustrious clients who crossed our humble threshold in Baker Street (""The Adventure of Black Peter"") It is years since the incidents of which I speak took place, and yet it is with diffidence that I allude to them. . . with due suppression the story may be told in such fashion as to injure no one. (""The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton"") If in telling the story I seem to be somewhat vague in certain details the public will readily understand that there is an excellent reason for my reticence. (""The Adventure of the Second Stain"") Watson as a narrator has clearly evolved. He's much more reluctant to share details, a pattern which was not as apparent before, if it even existed. This may be in part because Doyle's stories involve more and more prestigious figures (although that was also true for certain cases in the past; see ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", as well as ""The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle"", ""The Adventure of the Naval Treaty"", and others). Yes, Watson of course refused to give much information the first time around, but when Doyle actually wrote stories about people in power, he did not shy away from naming names, even though the characters were fictional. Vranken touches upon other similarities. He connects the many references to struggles with aristocratic composure in ""The Adventure of the Second Stain"" with Doyle's experiences with being knighted in 1902, and also states In the Return . . . the connection between sexualised feminine power and celebrity becomes far stronger citing the actions of Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope - which I, like Watson, will only allude to, so as not to give the whole plot away. Finally, for anyone wondering how the story could have changed so much in the intervening years - if it was indeed just an idea at first, which is what the evidence indicates - there may be an explanation. In Bed with Sherlock Holmes suggests that Jean Leckie, Doyle's second wife, may have written ""more than 1,000 words"" (page 100) of ""The Adventure of the Second Stain"", as well as influencing other stories. This would certainly account for many discrepancies between the two versions, suggesting that the published one was largely written later."
Why do some books warn that books with missing covers may be unauthorised?,"Paperbacks without covers are stripped books (hat tip user14111). The Economics of the Publishing and Information Industries: The Search for Yield in a Disintermediated World has a pretty good explanation of why they exist: All books can be returned for a full refund as long as the basic (and publically announced) terms and conditions of sale are followed. Returns are a blight on book publishing since a book sold today can be returned tomorrow, which makes planning, especially in the short term, exceptionally difficult. Problems in estimating the proper market for a book, uncertainty in the marketplace, and inefficiencies in the channels of distribution contribute to this serious problem. A book can be returned for full credit (in essence, this is a consignment sale) to the publisher as long as clearly promulgated terms of sale conditions are followed. In some instances, a bookstore or distributor has up to two years to return a title. The entire hardbound book (including the dust jacket) is returned; however, a trade or mass market paperback is stripped of its cover and only the coer is returned. The remaining stripped book is supposed to be pulped, although some street merchants in many major cities obtain (almost certainly illegally) and sell stripped books, for a fraction of the suggested retail price. There's a pretty good argument that this practice is wasteful. This blog posts in Publisher's Weekly makes the argument that if you aren't going to sell the book, then there's no reason why you can't give it away for free to someone living in a book desert. (Credit to Gallifreyan to linking to the tweet that linked to the Publisher's Weekly article). As Rand suggested in a comment, this answer might be a good place to explain how to use search engines to find reputable sources. In the comments, someone mentioned that ""Sometimes you just get lucky with your search terms."" The thing about luck is that when you need it you don't have it. Relying on luck is not an effective research strategy. Let me describe my strategy for researching this question, which as you will see, relies not on luck but on persistence. To find Economics of the Publishing and Information Industries, I used two separate search engines: Google and Google Scholar. Google Scholar is a version of Google that only indexes academic resources (e.g. books or journal articles). Since academics tend to cite sources, academic sources are almost always, but not always, more reliable. From a comment/now deleted answer from user14111, I learned that the term for a book that is missing its cover is a ""stripped book."" I started my research by Googling the term ""stripped book,"" but I did not get any results other than the Wikipedia article that user14111's now deleted answer cited. Since Wikipedia is not a reputable source, and since the Wikipedia article did not cite any sources for its definition of stripped books, I kept searching. I then tried using Google Scholar to search for the phrase ""stripped books"". I did not find any results. I knew then that the keyword ""stripped books"" was too broad, and that I needed to narrow it down. Thinking that ""stripped books"" were a practice of the publishing industry, I tried ""stripped books publishing"" in a normal Google search. I still didn't get any results. I then reasoned that this was a question about the business practices of the publishing industry. I then added the keyword ""economics"" to make the query ""stripped books publishing economics"". And I finally found The Economics of the Publishing and Information Industries, which was the fourth result of my query. If I hadn't found it then, I would have kept trying different queries. I don't select queries at random, usually, my strategy for search keywords is to be as specific as possible. No luck is involved. It's just persistence and a little bit of skills and experience."
Where did Saruman know Frodo from?,"This is immediately after the following short speech from Frodo: ""No, Sam!"" said Frodo. ""Do not kill him even now. For he has not hurt me. And in any case I do not wish him to be slain in this evil mood. He was great once, of a noble kind that we should not dare to raise our hands against. He is fallen, and his cure is beyond us; but I would still spare him, in the hope that he may find it."" It is Frodo's knowledge of Saruman's nature, his level-headed wisdom in telling the others to spare his life, and his easy, unconscious claiming of the moral high ground that causes Saruman's ""wonder and respect and hatred"". But is it Frodo saying this that surprises Saruman so, or just the fact that any hobbit had such wisdom in him? Unlike Gandalf, Saruman has never been one to respect small things or see the greatness in them. He was always ambitious, his mind on high affairs, and hobbits were beneath his attention until he found out about the Ring. While Gandalf the wanderer was already a known face in the Shire even before the events of The Hobbit, let alone The Lord of the Rings, Saruman remained in his tower at Isengard, too proud to concern himself with lesser beings. Even after he knew a hobbit was the Ring-bearer, I doubt he appreciated the inner strength and resilience of these little people. Thus we can see why it would be a surprise to him for any hobbit to speak such noble and insightful words as Frodo did. He thought of them as insignificant, unworthy of any respect, and suddenly one of them rears up and talks like a lord of men. Saruman, then, stares at this upstart, who must surely have ""grown very much"" from a Halfling's humble roots to be able to address an Istari so. Perhaps significantly, it is precisely Saruman's lack of respect towards those he considers beneath him which causes his death only moments later. Despite all they've been through together, he doesn't respect Wormtongue but kicks him and treats him like a dog. If he'd been kinder to his last loyal companion, or even had enough respect for him to realise that he was capable of ""not being able to stand it any more"", he would have lived a longer life. We already know the power of the Voice of Saruman, the power to cajole and persuade people beyond what their reason tells them. And this Istari has other tricks up his sleeve as well, even in his weakened state. As we saw back in The Two Towers: ""But come now,"" said the soft voice. ""Two at least of you I know by name. Gandalf I know too well to have much hope that he seeks help or counsel here. But you, Théoden Lord of the Mark of Rohan, are declared by your noble devices, and still more by the fair countenance of the House of Eorl. O worthy son of Thengel the Thrice-renowned! Why have you not come before, and as a friend? Much have I desired to see you, mightiest king of western lands, and especially in these latter years, to save you from the unwise and evil counsels that beset you! Is it yet too late? Despite the injuries that have been done to me, in which the men of Rohan, alas! have had some part, still I would save you, and deliver you from the ruin that draws nigh inevitably, if you ride upon this road which you have taken. Indeed I alone can aid you now."" Théoden opened his mouth as if to speak, but he said nothing. He looked up at the face of Saruman with its dark solemn eyes bent down upon him, and then to Gandalf at his side; and he seemed to hesitate. Gandalf made no sign; but stood silent as stone, as one waiting patiently for some call that has not yet come. The Riders stirred at first, murmuring with approval of the words of Saruman; and then they too were silent, as men spell-bound. It seemed to them that Gandalf had never spoken so fair and fittingly to their lord. Rough and proud now seemed all his dealings with Théoden. And over their hearts crept a shadow, the fear of a great danger: the end of the Mark in a darkness to which Gandalf was driving them, while Saruman stood beside a door of escape, holding it half open so that a ray of light came through. There was a heavy silence. It was Gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenly. ""The words of this wizard stand on their heads,"" he growled, gripping the handle of his axe. ""In the language of Orthanc help means ruin, and saving means slaying, that is plain. But we do not come here to beg."" ""Peace!"" said Saruman, and for a fleeting moment his voice was less suave, and a light flickered in his eyes and was gone. ""I do not speak to you yet, Gimli Glóin’s son,"" he said. ""Far away is your home and small concern of yours are the troubles of this land. But it was not by design of your own that you became embroiled in them, and so I will not blame such part as you have played – a valiant one, I doubt not. But I pray you, allow me first to speak with the King of Rohan, my neighbour, and once my friend."" -- The Two Towers, Book III, Chapter 10: ""The Voice of Saruman"" The most obvious tool Saruman is using here is his Voice, his power of persuasion, in a last-ditch attempt to hypnotise Theoden and the men of the Mark into his thrall. But he also seems to have some power of insight or recognition. How does he know Gimli's name and origins? As far as we know, he's never met the dwarf before, and by the time the Fellowship of the Ring was formed, Saruman's treachery was well known. He must have conduits of information of which we know nothing. Perhaps he used the same sources to learn about Frodo, long before meeting him face to face. What means does he use to spy on people and find out about them before he meets them? Well, it could be some secret Maiar power, some art of divining a person's name and nature from a glance at their face ... or it could be as simple a tool as spies. We know that at least one of his servants - and a trusted one at that - had encountered Frodo back in Bree in The Fellowship of the Ring: Some while ago one of Saruman's most trusted servants (yet a ruffianly fellow, an outlaw driven from Dunland, where many said that he had Orc-blood) had returned from the borders of the Shire, where he had been negotiating for the purpose of ""leaf"" and other supplies ... He was the squint-eyed southerner at the Inn. -- Unfinished Tales, ""The Hunt for the Ring"" And we know that he, like Sauron, could use birds as his agents to scout for him. Perhaps these spies of his, human or avian, were Saruman's tools for gathering information, so that he always appeared well-informed and knew much about people before he ever set eyes on them.  Much of this answer was inspired by the excellent answer on another SE site from Darth Melkor (user8719), although the words and some of the ideas are my own."
Identify a book about a boy who has hypnotic powers,"It's Gordon Korman's The Hypnotists, published June 2014:  This matches your description of the cover. Here's the book jacket description, emphasis mine: Is it a gift... or is it a curse? Jax Opus can use his color-changing eyes to make people do things they don't want to do. (Only his color-blind best friend, Tommy, seems immune.) At first, Jax doesn't know what he's doing -- temporarily hypnotizing friends, foes, and strangers. But then his power pushes things way too far, and his secret isn't a secret any longer. Soon Jax finds himself meeting Dr. Elias Mako, who wants him to join a special institution that will teach him how to use his powers. But what will his powers be used for? That's the big question for Jax as his hypnotic abilities draw him into a conspiracy that will have him racing against time and a mysterious mastermind to save his best friend, his parents, and the entire United States. This seems like a pretty close match to what you remember. Plus, the main character's name does indeed start with a J. Also, the character who Jax meets and tells him that Elias isn't good is named Axel Braintree, and he runs the Sandman's Guild, who meets in a Laundromat. Elias Mako tried to get Senator Douglas Trey to be the president, but Jax hypnotized him into dropping out. Trey is indeed the name of a character in the-shadow-children."
What does the raven symbolize (besides death)?,"I don't believe the Raven symbolizes death at all, but rather life, in grief of having to live after a loved one is dead. As Poe himself put it in his essay Philosophy of Composition: The reader begins now to regard the Raven as emblematical — but it is
  not until the very last line of the very last stanza, that the
  intention of making him emblematical of Mournful and Never-ending
  Remembrance is permitted distinctly to be seen The phrase ""mournful and never-ending remembrance"" is the title of a biography of Poe. It's a theme Poe returned to several times, such as in Annabel Lee. Of course authorial intent is only one factor to consider in interpreting a work; see this discussion. It does, however, jibe with my own understanding of the poem even before I read Poe's explicit thoughts on it. The Raven is thus even sadder than death itself. The speaker craves forgetfulness, and will never have it: his heart shall be ""lifted -- Nevermore"". He could be content, or at least cope, with loneliness. But the Raven is a constant reminder: he lives not just with the loss but the knowledge of the loss."
Why do the March sisters call their mother Marmee?,"From this blog post written by someone involved with the musical Little Women (emphasis mine): I was asked by one of the assistant stage managers why the girls refer to their mother as “Marmee”.  To be honest, this question has haunted my mind for a few years and finding the answers was much harder than I expected, so I put the quest for the answer to rest.  I called my great-grandmother, “Mamaw” and there are hundreds of different terms for mother that is used all over the United States.  So, Marmee isn’t necessarily anything odd or unique from that day, one would assume. In the book, the girls do address Marmee as “Mother” on several occasions along with “Marmee”.   In the musical, it is only the latter.  As I was browsing the internet, I was trying to research nicknames for mothers back in Alcott’s time and I bumped into a dialect website.  In the beginning, Brandon, the director, wanted me to look into dialects from the time period…but trying to find accurate answers for 1860’s Concord proved to be challenging. In Alcott’s time, and in the time set in the book, Alcott most likely spoke with an Eastern Massachusetts accents, meaning that it was non-rhotic..aka…she dropped her r’s.  Sounding similar to a Boston accent, this is just a theory.  And then it hit me.  Drop the r from Marmee and you have a different way of spelling Mommy. A letter published in the New York Times subscribes to the same theory, and provides even more supporting evidence (again, emphasis mine): Wineapple mentions the unusual nickname — “ ‘Marmee,’ as her daughters called her” — but does not discuss its pronunciation. The Alcott (and March) girls, New Englanders all, would have pronounced the “r” as “ah” when they referred to their mother. In other words, they called her “Mahmee” — or “Mommy”! As the archivist of the town of Brewster, Mass., I have found many other examples in old letters and other papers of the New England r/ah pronunciation. The more usual parental nicknames “Ma” and “Pa” are sometimes written “Mar” and “Par,” and in a reverse instance, the once common first name “Desire” was often written, even in official documents, as it was evidently pronounced: “Desiah.” I think this is enough to conclude that it was a common thing, not just in Alcott's family, and - when you take accent into account - not so strange either."
Did James Bond ever experience doubts about having to end people's lives in Fleming's novels?,"Before setting out on this search, I first looked at a compendium of James Bond lore entitled Amazing and Extraordinary Facts - James Bond by Michael Paterson, to confirm if such ""existential"" inner dialogue existed in the books. . . . He was often exhausted, wounded or traumatized; he lacked humour, and occasionally even confidence. He felt periodic melancholy with his role and sometimes doubted whether the West had any right to feel morally superior to is communist enemy. He even, in one novel, 'shredded his nerves' with worry. Interest piqued with the mention of ""periodic melancholy with his role"", and ""sometimes doubted whether the West had any right to feel morally superior"", I went to the complete library of Fleming's Bond stories. After scanning the library, I can say that he did at times express doubts, and even regret, but mostly he tried to suppress these feelings as they would only interfere in the performance of his duties. I will present the pertinent passages in the same order in which the books were published; however, the most telling information probably comes from Goldfinger (1959). In the beginning of From Russia with Love (1957), Bond begins thinking over his youth, and the changes he has gone through. what would that youth think of him, the secret agent, the older James Bond? Would he recognize himself beneath the surface of this man who was tarnished with years of treachery and ruthlessness... Then, in Goldfinger (1959), it is mentioned several times that he does not actually enjoy killing, that it is his duty. It was part of his profession to kill people. He had never liked doing it and when he had to kill he did it as well as he knew how and forgot about it. As a secret agent who held the rare double-O prefix - the licence to kill in the Secret Service - it was his duty to be as cool about death as a surgeon. If it happened, it happened. Regret was unprofessional - worse, it was death-watch beetle in the soul. Later, he tries to rationalize his role as an assassin. He was too tense, too introspective. What the hell was he doing, glooming about this Mexican, this capungo who had been sent to kill him? It had been kill or get killed. Anyway, people were killing other people all the time, all over the world. People were using their motor cars to kill with. They were carrying infectious diseases around, blowing microbes in other people's faces, leaving gasjets turned on in kitchens, pumping out carbon monoxide in closed garages. How many people, for instance, were involved in manufacturing H-bombs, from the miners who mined the uranium to the shareholders who owned the mining shares? Was there any person in the world who wasn't somehow, perhaps only statistically, involved in killing his neighbour? But then he suppresses these feelings. Bond's lips turned down. Cut it out. Stop being so damned morbid. All this is just reaction from a dirty assignment. You're stale, tired of having to be tough. You want a change. You've seen too much death. In You Only Live Twice (1964), following the murder of his wife Tracy, Bond suffers a type of emotional breakdown. It is of a type that we would easily recognize today--a result of too much repression of emotions, and probably regrets over his life. He felt like hell and knew that he also looked it. For months, without telling anyone, he had tramped Harley Street, Wigmore Street and Wimpole Street looking for any kind of doctor who would make him feel better. He had appealed to specialists, GPs, quacks - even to a hypnotist. He had told them, 'I feel like hell. I sleep badly. I eat practically nothing. I drink too much and my work has gone to blazes. I'm shot to pieces. Make me better.' And each man had taken his blood pressure, a specimen of his urine, listened to his heart and chest, asked him questions he had answered truthfully, and had told him there was nothing basically wrong with him. In The Man with the Golden Gun (1965), it is mentioned twice that he does not enjoy killing: It was all very fine to be told to “eliminate” the man, but James Bond had never liked killing in cold blood and then again... James Bond got into the car behind Scaramanga and wondered whether to shoot the man now, in the back of the head--the old Gestapo-K.G.B. point of puncture. A mixture of reasons prevented him--the itch of curiosity, an inbuilt dislike of cold murder, the feeling that this was not the predestined moment, the likelihood that he would have to murder the chauffeur also. And then in the last story The Living Daylights (1965),  Bond refrained from killing his target in an unusually merciful stay of a licensed execution. There is no adequate rationalization given: possibly he had finally found a way of reconciling his past with his future, or more likely, Fleming was looking to give more dimensionality to his most famous creation."
"Why is the title of ""Le Morte d'Arthur"" in French if the book is in English?","We don't know very much about the life of Thomas Malory, but it is clear that Le Morte Darthur draws on French sources. For example, in ""Capitulum tercium"" (in the version printed by Caxton, which is available at the University of Michigan), Malory writes (emphasis mine),  Soo in the grettest chirch of london whether it were Powlis or not the Frensshe booke maketh no mencyon Le Morte Darthur makes frequent references to ""the Frensshe book"". According to scholars, the sources used by Mallory include the following, not all of which are actually in French: Most (or all) of the Arthurian materials in French and English literature were influenced by the 12th-century French poet Chrétien de Troyes. Wikipedia also notes that Private and commercial correspondence was carried out in Anglo-Norman or Anglo-French from the 13th to the 15th century though its spelling forms were often displaced by continental spellings. Social classes other than the nobility became keen to learn French: manuscripts containing materials for instructing non-native speakers still exist, dating mostly from the late 14th century onwards.  So Malory probably chose a French title for two reasons: French sources and familiarity with either French or Anglo-French in part of the English population. Sources not linked or listed above:"
What happened to the epic poem?,"The epic poem gradually disappeared after the Middle Ages. Late examples include Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando furioso (1516 – 1532) 
and Torquato Tasso's La Gerusalemme liberata (1581). By that time, the humanists had started attacking the chivalric romance (which could be in prose or in verse).
For example, in English Literature In The Sixteenth Century Excluding Drama (1954), C. S. Lewis writes (p. 29): Erasmus would forbid a young prince to read 'Arthurs and Lancelots' which 'smacke of tyrannie and moreouer rude (ineruditi), foolish and anile' (Inst. Principis Christiani, ii).
  Montaigne congratulates himself on an education which had made Ovid his nursery book and kept him from hearing even the names of Amadis, Huon, and such trumpery (I, xxv).
  Vives condemns book 'such as are Amadis and Florisand in Spain or Lancelot and the Round Table in France, the which were made and compiled of idle fellows (hominibus otiosis) and stuffed fulle of leasings' (De Causis, ii). The epic poem can't simply be equated with the chivalric romance, but some of the criticism would also apply to epic poems. In addition, Cervantes published a parody on chivalric romances (especially Amadís de Gaula) that became a great success: El Ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quijote de la Mancha (volume 1 in 1605, volume 2 in 1615). With this background, Milton's epic poems Paradise Lost (1667) and Paradise Regained (1671) are exceptions. That does not mean there have no epic poems since Milton. However, Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock and Byron's Don Juan (1819–1824) are satires on the genre. Two more recent, non-satyrical, examples are Christopher Logue's War Music and Omeros (1990) by Nobel Prize laureate Derek Walcott."
Which German book was Poe referring to?,"Poe’s source for the opening sentence was an essay on ‘Style’ by Thomas de Quincey, published in July 1840, just five months before Poe’s ‘The Man of the Crowd’: Of a German book, otherwise entitled to respect, it was said—er lässt sich nicht lesen, it does not permit itself to be read: such and so repulsive was the style. Thomas de Quincey (1840). ‘Style’. In Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine (July 1840), p. 17. The similarity of wording between de Quincey and Poe is too close for coincidence: In any case, Poe was a prolific plagiarist (see this answer for more examples), so it is not a surprise to find him copying from de Quincey here. De Quincey does not name the German book, so we have no reason to expect Poe to have identified it correctly when he says in the story it was the Hortulus Animæ. By searching for “lässt sich nicht lesen” we can find some candidates, of which the best (in my opinion) is from a review in the Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek, comparing two translations of the New Testament into German: Damm† hat nicht mit so viel Geschmack, als Bahrdt,‡ übersetzt. Sein Deutsch läßt sich nicht lesen. Damm† has not translated with as much taste as Bahrdt.‡ His German cannot be read. ‘Fb’ (1784). Review of David Gottlieb Niemeyer (1783), Oder beschribendes Verzeichniß der branchbarsten Schriften für Prediger und künftige Geistliche. In Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek, volume 57, p. 374. Berlin: Friedrich Nicolai. † Christian Tobias Damm ‡ Karl Friedrich Bahrdt The reviewer was being ironic here in grading Damm’s taste below Bahrdt’s, because Bahrdt’s translation of the New Testament was notoriously a “watery paraphrase” that had been mocked by Goethe in a comic sketch, Prolog zu den neuesten Offenbarungen Gottes verdeutscht durch Dr. Carl Friedrich Bahrdt (1774), in which the four Evangelists come to visit Bahrdt, but he objects to their uncouth appearance and manners and turns them away."
"Creepy children's illustrated book, like Jumanji, about boy waiting for parents to come home with new baby, sees faces in walls","This is Changes, by Anthony Browne, published in 1990. I can't lay hands on my copy at the moment but below is the cover, copied from this website.  Some of his illustrations can be quite surreal, which may be why he illustrated an edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Gorillas are also a favourite of his to draw, and he has written several books starring Willy, a chimp."
Why did Tolkien publish as J.R.R. Tolkien?,"In the present day, when an author like J. K. Rowling uses initials in the author's name on books, it is plausible that this was an explicit choice / conscious decision, and the author had a special reason for doing so. (In Rowling's case, the reason was that the publishers thought young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman.) This plausibility is based on certain assumptions about ""normal"" names in the English-speaking world: Based on such assumptions, it is reasonable to wonder about other authors, like J. R. R. Tolkien: for example, one may speculate that he used initials because he was an academic scholar wishing to adopt a somewhat different pen name in his books for children, just as Charles Lutwidge Dodgson became ""Lewis Carroll"". Most of us know, I guess, that these assumptions do not necessarily hold across different cultures. Even ""obvious"" assumptions may be false, and personal names around the world vary. (For instance, the children of V. S. Achuthanandan are named V. A. Arunkumar and V. V. Asha, and this is perfectly natural.) Pointers on Wikipedia: personal name, anthroponymy, personal names, personal names by culture. But cultures vary not just across space but also across time: it is easy to forget that “The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there”. So if one is willing to abandon one's cultural conditioning and be a little open-minded about what sort of names people are allowed to have, it turns out that: This applies not just to Tolkien but to many early 20th-century English authors (as asked at the now-deleted question). Many authors used initials simply because many people in the late 19th / early 20th centuries used initials. We do not need to look for special literary reasons, because these authors were not doing anything special. The names with initials were not their noms de plume but simply their conventional names that they used in other aspects of life. Let me elaborate on both these points separately. We can take a deeper look at the milieu of E. M. Forster (born 1879), J. R. R. Tolkien (born 1892) and T. S. Eliot (born 1888), by looking at the styles of names in fields other than literature. As a proxy for getting a representative list of names, let's look at: There are even more that did not use initials, of course. This cherry-picked list of names is only to illustrate that people using names with initials were not uncommon, and presumably there aren't necessarily special literary reasons for being part of that trend. (It does seem to be a trend: the occurrence seems to peak in that rough period.) Note that these non-literary people did not use their initials as ""pen names"" for some special literary purpose — these were simply the names by which they were known in real life, the names by which articles about them are still titled. [I picked only people from the UK, but you can also look at people in the broader British-influenced countries: we have scientists like C. V. Raman, S. N. Bose, J. C. Bose (continuing to the present day), and people from the literary world like R. K. Narayan or V. S. Naipaul.] Doing a statistical analysis over some larger and more representative dataset of names will let you know whether authors like Forster and Tolkien were picking a name style unusual for their time. Was the name with initials a nom de plume he adopted for non-scholarly works? No! Here are the covers of a 1922 scholarly work of his, and the second edition of another:    (Middle English, not Middle Earth!) Tolkien first published a work of fiction in 1937 (The Hobbit). If we search on Google Books for books before 1935, and look for strings like ""Mr. J. R. R. Tolkien"", ""Mr. John Tolkien"", ""Mr. Ronald Tolkien"", ""Mr. John Ronald Tolkien"" and ""Mr. John Ronald Reuel Tolkien"", we find results only for the first one. Transactions of the Yorkshire Dialect Society, 1921:
 The University Bulletin, 1922
 The Periodical, 1923:
 Studies in English, 1927:
 British Books in Print, 1920:
 Take a look at these, especially the last one: do we really want to look for special literary reasons for, or even consider unusual, the fact that all these people had initials in their formal terms of address?"
"Fairy tale story in two parts: ""as I first heard it"" and ""when I wanted to know more""","I found it! I was thinking about this book again, and went into a sort of meditative state, seeing the book's cover in my mind's eye and trying to recall the title. It wasn't quite ""The Lost World"" ... but maybe something similar? Eventually the phrase ""The Land Beyond"" floated into my mind, and I thought why not give it a try. The name ""Maria Gripe"" also floated into my mind around the same time, but I thought Gripe sounded like an odd name, and just Googled ""The Land Beyond"" Maria. Voila! From Goodreads: The Land Beyond is the same story, told twice. The first is a simplistic version, written in (or translated into) the nonsensical style of a 19th century fairy tale, complete with symbolism and allegory. An explorer walks into a kingdom and tells the king he’s found a land that does not appear on any map. Other characters try to find it. The second story retells the first, and expands it, which allows all of the unnamed characters to have long, dull conversations about life. There is even more symbolism, allegory and political satire. There's a slightly longer review here. This is the cover I remembered: "
Have any Elves explored Rhûn or the lands to the east?,"Dorwinion is a land adjacent to the Sea of Rhun, at least according to this map by Pauline Baynes:  And the Elves of Mirkwood, at least, drank wine which came from Dorwinion. From The Hobbit, Chapter 9: ""Now come with me,"" he said, ""and taste the new wine that has just come in. I shall be hard at work tonight clearing the cellars of the empty wood, so let us have a drink first to help the labour."" [...] It must be potent wine to make a wood-elf drowsy; but this wine, it would seem, was the heady vintage of the great gardens of Dorwinion, not meant for his soldiers or his servants, but for the king's feasts only, and for smaller bowls not for the butler's great flagons. Dorwinion, or Dor-Winion, is also mentioned as a source of fine wine in The Lay of the Children of Hurin, line 230: There baked flesh and bread from his wallet
  they had to their hearts’ joy; but their heads were mazed
  by the wine of Dor-Winion that went in their veins,
  and they soundly slept on the soft needles
  of the tall pine-trees that towered above. In an unpublished essay, which can be found cited in various places on the internet, Tolkien said that: [Dorwinion] was probably far south down the R. Running, and its Sindarin name a testimony to the spread of Sindarin: in this case expectable since the the cultivation of vines was not known originally to the Nandor or Avari. This suggests that Dorwinion was inhabited at least partially by the Nandor or the Avari, and perhaps (but not necessarily, given the spread of the Sindarin language) also the Sindar. All three of these groups consisted of Elves who did not complete the Great Journey to Valinor. Now the Silvan elves of Mirkwood were descendants of the Nandor, who, despite not having gone all the way to Valinor, were still among those who left Cuiviénen. You say ""specifically, the Eldar, not the Avari"", without mentioning any of the other groups of Elves, but I'm guessing that you'll count the Elves of Mirkwood, who dwell much further east than Rhun. So we know that at the least, there was trade between the western Elves and the lands around Rhun. Anything more than that will, I think, be a matter of speculation; as far as I can tell, none of Tolkien's writings describe Elven expeditions to the East, but nor do they say that such expeditions never happened. And there's a lot of discussion on the internet about this and related issues: The fact that there is so much discussion and speculation indicates that there's no 'canonical' answer, beyond the pieced-together facts about Dorwinion which I've outlined above.  (Some of this answer is based on the same idea - Dorwinion - as Riker's now-deleted answer. But I've provided a lot more evidence, links, and quotes, so I think I can safely say that this answer is my own work.)"
How does interrupting Kubla Khan save humanity?,"It seems a bit unclear.  In the author's own words: Ahem. All I can say is that it was as clear as day to me when I wrote it and now I can't figure it out myself. Sorry about that. Later on that discussion thread someone quotes from an FAQ written on an alt.fan site: In the book, Kubla Khan has a second part. The book is not actually set in our existence. It is set in an existence in which the second part of Kubla Khan exists. This second part of the poem tells the ghost about the existence of the time machine and how to travel back and stop the ship from exploding. As we well know the explosion of the ship is what caused life to begin on this miserable little planet of ours. When Dirk and Reg realised this they simply went forward in time to when Coleridge was writing the second part of Kubla Khan and stopped him. Dirk just interrupted him and talked so much that Coleridge forgot what the second part was going to be about and therefore could not finish it! This change of history sent reality back into our perspective and the human race lived on (Yay, yippee!). That in and of itself doesn't quite make sense to me either but here is what I figure. First, as for the change in the poem happening billions of years after the ghost heads back to the ship, Adams seems to be following a sort of time-travel ""synchronicity"" logic which says if someone goes back to the past and takes 1 hour to change things, you have 1 hour to do things in that continuum (no matter where in time you are) until the change happens.  From Chapter 34: ""How long,"" said Dirk, quite calmly, ""would you guess that it's going to take that fat self-deluding bastard to reach his ship?  Because that's how long we have. This chapter ends with them trying to figure out what to do and a book (which is surely the Coleridge anthology that Michael took out earlier) falling out of Michael's discarded jacket.  This causes them to realize they need to stop Coleridge from completing Kubla Khan.  Since we don't actually get to see the second part of Kubla Khan, it seems hard to say exactly why this is, but here are two guesses: The second part of Kubla Khan contains the key to building the time machine, so this interruption prevents the ghost from going back in time.  This would explain why the time-travel device no longer works at the end. The second part of Kubla Khan is what makes Michael sympathetic to the ghost's story.  This POV is espoused in this SFF answer."
How ‘stream of consciousness’ was On the Road? Was it planned or edited?,"I'll sum it up like this: He planned it on notebooks when travelling, and spent 7 years revising and editing it. The original however was very 'stream of consciousness' - it was written in continuous form in just 3 weeks. Obviously when you are trying to publish a 120 foot long scroll, some editing is needed. As for the planning, there didn't seem to be much. During 1947 and 1950, Kerouac went on his travels that the book tells us about. He wrote about the trips in small notebooks in which a lot of the text was written. He first started writing the novel in 1948 beaded in his 1947 travels. However he wasn't satisfied. He was inspired to write the long script when he received a 1000 word letter that rambles on from Neal Cassady, a great friend, he decided to write the novel as if it was a letter. The first draft was written in three weeks in 1951. It was the continuous 120 foot scroll that has become so famous. After this Kerouac continued to edit and delete sections of the manuscript to replace them with shorter passages, so there was some editing. He rewrote many parts and there was an unfortunate incident where a dog mistook part of the scroll for homework. There was an estimated 6 drafts between 1951 and 1957, as his work was constantly rejected by his publishers. There were several inserts that weren't included in On the Road, and were put in another novel Visions of Cody On the Road was finally  published in 1957, based on revisions of the 1951 scroll. The major edits were the fact that it was shorter and the main characters had pseudonyms. Sources: NPR and Wikipedia"
"Why is Camus asserting that ""Marx scientific Messianism"" is Bourgeois?","In this chapter, Camus is comparing ""the Christian and Marxist world,"" and finds that the two have much more in common with each other than either does with the ""ancient world"" – by which he largely means Aristotelian Greece. ""For the Christian, as for the Marxist, nature must be subdued;"" he writes. It may help to understand if we restore the full text of the quoted sentence: Progress, the future of science, the cult of technology and of production, are bourgeois myths, which in the nineteenth century became dogma. In defending this view, Camus refers to Renan's ""Future of Science"" - which he says  gives the most accurate idea of the almost mystic hopes aroused in the
  nineteenth century by the expansion of industry and the surprising
  progress made by science. Camus argues that ""this hope is the hope of bourgeois society itself"" because bourgeois society is  the final beneficiary of technical progress…[w]hen we are assured that tomorrow, in the natural order of events, will be better than today, we can enjoy ourselves in peace. Progress, paradoxically, can be used to justify conservatism. A draft drawn on confidence in the future, it allows the master to have a clear conscience. The slave and those whose present life is miserable and who can find no consolation in the heavens are assured that at least the future belongs to them. The future is the only kind of property that the masters willingly concede to the slaves. Both Marx and Hegel, Camus states continued on the path of nineteenth-century bourgeois thought…that: ""The gradual and progressive development of equality is both the past and the future of the history of man."" Perhaps another part of the question may be rooted in the definition of the word ""myth."" In modern times, many take it as the second definition used here  [a] person or thing existing only in imagination, or whose actual existence is not verifiable. However, if we instead read the use of the word myth here to lean toward the first definition a story…[which embodies] a belief…in which often the forces of nature and of the soul are personified. we might better be able to understand Camus' point. Or, as a more recent touchstone might phrase it: On this immediate level of life and structure, myths offer life models. But the models have to be appropriate to the time in which you are living, and our time has changed so fast that what was proper fifty years ago is not proper today."
Who or what does Benjamin the donkey represent in Animal Farm?,"It's unknown for sure, but it most likely refers to either: The Mensheviks, a non-communist party in Russia, because he's another viewpoint from the pigs but is mostly ignored. He also could be the older population of Russia, because he is old and skeptical. He could also just be the skeptical people, who don't believe communism will really help them much. He could be the Jews, who weren't helped really at all by communism. Finally, he could be Orwell (inserted into the story, not really fitting the allegory). Just along for the ride, not really in favor of communism/the pigs either."
Why are Drizzt's eyes purple?,"There appears to be very little behind the colour difference. Salvatore thought up a misfit drow character on the spur of a moment while very little was defined on the drow race. Drizzt was ahead of the actual setting. Novelist R.A. Salvatore crosses over into his newest magical realm and brings along his favorite character  (SciFi.com, archived by the Wayback Machine): The editor called me at work and said, ""I've got to go to a marketing meeting to sell the book, and we can't use [that character], and I really need to be able to tell marketing."" I said, ""Give me a little while. I'll call you back."" She said, ""Oh, no. You don't understand. I'm two minutes away from where I have to be five minutes ago."" And off the top of my head I said a Dark Elf. And there was this long pause. ""Yeah, a Dark Elf Ranger, that's cool. Nobody's done that."" And there was a long pause, and she said, ""There's a reason why no one's done that."" I said, ""No. It will be all right. It will be all right. It's just a sidekick character."" And another pause. ""What's his name?"" And off the top of my head I said, ""Drizzt Do'Urden?"" Then a long pause. ""Can you spell it?"" I said, ""Not a chance."" It came to me off the top of my head. The character's gotten more popular as time's gone on. After the third book, around 1990, people really wanted to know where this guy came from, and so I wrote the Dark Elf trilogy, a prequel to the other three books. And in doing that I created this society of Dark Elves, the Drow, in Forgotten Realms. And he kept going like the Energizer bunny. It's amazing to me. I don't know how. I don't know why. I try not to ask too many questions. [Laughs] For continuity reasons alone the eye colour never changed. Salvatore never commented on it leaving the field to fan conjecture and trope theories. These vary from possible human ancestry to logical reasoning setting Drizzt apart from his red-eyed race: The Legend of Drizzt on TV Tropes. Drizzt's lavender eyes are remarked upon by anyone who sees it and are a pretty unique identifier as most drow have red eyes. They symbolically represent his more gentle and heroic nature compared to the rest of his brethren. The Dark Elf Trilogy on TV Tropes: Drizzt has Lavender Eyes, an unusual color for drow to the extent that his family initially wonders if he's blind. Has some Innocent Blue Eyes thrown in, since they come from combining a blue tint with the regular red glow from infravision. Apparently drow eye colours became more varied eventually, as the setting grew over the years. Reasons for this were equally colourful. Some more background:"
How and why did the story of King Cnut change?,"The post says, “The original account … uses it to illustrate Cnut’s humility.” But note that Henry of Huntingdon only wrote that Cnut was humble afterwards, not that he intended this beforehand. His version did not explain the king’s motive at all, leaving a gap that later historians filled. Cnut’s motive seems to have been introduced into the story accidentally and in stages: (i) Henry of Huntingdon’s introduction “when at the summit of his power”, which fixed the episode chronologically, was reinterpreted as its cause. (ii) The king’s pride in his power was reworded to emphasize the moral. (iii) The king’s pride was explicitly given as the reason for his attempt to command the tide. (iv) Flattering courtiers were introduced to explain the king’s overweening pride. (v) The flattering courtiers remained but the king’s motive was changed to rebuking them. While the evolution of the story is interesting, I doubt that the proverbial use of the story of Cnut trying to stop the tide has spread via this kind of written tradition. Instead, what I suspect has happened many times is that someone has alluded to the story as a vivid instance of the fact that events exceed our power to control them, without assigning any particular motive to the king; and someone else has heard the allusion and found that the easiest way to interpret it was if it was Cnut who believed he could stop the tide. Thus the popular version has undergone a process of continual reinvention, no matter how often historians explain that it has no historical basis. I found it hard to find written versions of story (as opposed to proverbial uses) in which Cnut really believed that he could command the tide. This must be because this version is not remotely credible as history. No man who had made as many sea-voyages as Cnut could have believed he had any power over the tide, and no historian who cared about the plausibility of their account could have accepted it uncritically. In nearly all modern versions of the story, Cnut’s motive in staging the scene was to rebuke his courtiers for their flattery. But this motive does not appear in any of the early sources, and although it is an improvement on the idea that Cnut believed he could command the tide, it is not particularly credible either, as Charles Dickens pointed out: We may learn from this, I think, that a little sense will go a long way in a king; and that courtiers are not easily cured of flattery, nor kings of a liking for it. If the courtiers of Canute had not known long before, that the King was fond of flattery, they would have known better than to offer it in such large doses. And if they had not known that he was vain of this speech […], they would not have been at such great pains to repeat it. I fancy I see them all on the sea-shore together; the King’s chair sinking in the sand; the King in a mighty good humor with his own wisdom; and the courtiers pretending to be quite stunned by it! Charles Dickens (1852). A Child’s History of England, Chapter V. Henry of Huntington is not the only source for the story! In the 1130s, Geoffrey Gaimar wrote a chronicle of the English people in Anglo-Norman rhyming couplets: Donc fu Cnuth de treis regnés sire;
  Poi trovot ki l’osout desdire.
  E nepurquant si fut desdit,
  E son comandement despit.
  A Londres ert desur Tamise;
  Li floz veneit près de l’eglise
  Ki Westmuster ert apelé.
  Li reis à pié s’est aresté […] His version of the story is different in detail from Henry’s: Then Cnut was lord of three kingdoms; he found few who dared to disobey him. 
  And nevertheless he was disobeyed, and his command despised. He was in London on the Thames; the tide was flowing near the church which is called Westminster. The king stood afoot at the strand; on the sand the tide came struggling onward; it advanced much, and came near the king. Cnut held his sceptre in his hand, and he said to the tide, “Return back; flee from me, lest I strike thee.” The sea did not retire for him,—more and more the tide rose; the king remained, he waited, and struck the water with his sceptre. The river retired not for that, so it reached the king and wetted him. When the king saw he had waited too long, and that the tide did not regard him, he withdrew himself back from the strand; then standing upon a stone, he stretched out his hands towards the east. Hear what he said while his people were listening:—“Him who made the sea to rise, men ought indeed to believe and adore. He is a good King, I am a poor creature; I am a mortal man, but He lives for ever; His command annihilates everything; I pray Him that He may be my Protector. To 
  Rome I will go to petition Him; of Him I will hold all my lands.”  Geoffrey Gaimar (1130s). Estoire des Engleis, lines 4695–4728. English translation from The Gentleman’s Magazine (1857). Gaimar wrote no more about the king’s motives than Henry, but by setting the story before Cnut’s visit to Rome (rather than afterwards, as later writers did) he made it possible to imagine a different and more plausible motive. Perhaps someone had objected to Cnut’s pilgrimage to Rome on the grounds that he would be subjecting himself to the Pope, and Cnut replied that he would only be subjecting himself to God, to whom he was already subject, as demonstrated by his inability to command the tide. The Old Palace of Westminster (which Cnut had ordered constructed) was at that time on an island in the Thames and it would only have been a few steps from the church to the river bank. Gaimar’s version does not seem to have been much read: I could not find any version of the story that derived from it. This is no doubt because there are only four surviving manuscripts and the poem was not printed until the mid-19th century. Later versions derived instead from five sources in Latin. Henry of Huntingdon’s Historia Anglorum, written 1129–1154, is quoted in the question. The other four are: Each of these was closely derived from the text in Henry of Huntingdon. Paris, Higden and Brompton made minor changes to the Latin wording, but added nothing to Henry’s version. Rudburn, however, had another source, which gave the story’s location: And when he gracefully prospered in the kingdom he had conquered, he ordered a seat to be placed for him on the sea-shore; as some say, at Southampton, according to the author of Concordantiis Historiarum under the letter K, the tide was coming in. Thomas Rudburn (c. 1454). Historia Maior Wintoniensis. My translation. (‘K’ stands for ‘Kanutus’.) The work referred to, a concordance of English history, written by a monk of Winchester, is now lost. Where did this monk get “Southampton” from? Perhaps he was reporting a local tradition, Southampton being the nearest point on the coast to Winchester. Unfortunately, nothing is known about De Concordantiis Historiarum Angliae other than the handful of facts preserved by Rudburn. We only know that it was written by someone from Winchester because Rudburn says so: “For this same author wrote a great deal about the Church of Winchester, in which he was formerly brought up” (Ipse enim Auctor multa scribit de Ecclesia Wyntoniensi, in qua quondam nutritus erat). Henry of Huntingdon introduced the story with the phrase “when at the summit of his power” (cum maximo vigore), which fixed the story chronologically. But it would have been easy to read this introduction causatively, understanding ‘when’ as ‘because’ (cum has both meanings in Latin); and if you understood it this way then you would have been tempted to modify “at the summit of his power” in order to clarify the moral. The first chronicler to do so was Robert Fabyan: Then let us return to Canute, of whom it is read, that after his coming from Rome, he began somedeal to presume in pride, and let more of himself than good wisdom would. In time of which exaltation of his mind, he went unto the Thames side, and beheld how the water swelled or flowed: and so standing near the water, the water touched his feet. Then he charged the water that he should flow no higher, and that, in no wise, he should touch his lord’s clothes; but the water kept his course, and wet, at length, the king’s thighs: wherewith the king abashed, started back and said, “All earthly kings may know that their powers be vain, and that none is worthy to have the name of a king but he that hath all things subject to his hests, as here is shown, by working of his creature by this water.  Robert Fabyan (1516). The New Chronicles of England and France part VI. Spelling modernized. Note that Fabyan linked the introduction to the story using “in time of which”, not “therefore”, and so his version remained ambiguous as to the king’s motive. Fabyan gave his source as Henry of Huntingdon, so where did he get “Thames” from? It seems unlikely that he had read Gaimar, otherwise he would surely have mentioned the detail of the church at Westminster. Perhaps instead, since he lived in London, he was reporting a local tradition. Raphael Holinshed went one step further than Fabyan: [W]hen he came home (as some write) he did grow greatly into pride, insomuch that being he caused his chair to be set there, as near to the Thames, or rather (as other write) upon the sea strand, near to Southampton, and perceiving the water to rise by reason of the tide, he cast off his gown, and wrapping it round together, threw it on the sands very near the increasing water, and sat him down upon it, speaking these or the like words to the sea: “Thou art (saith he) within the compass of my dominion, and the ground whereon I sit is mine, and thou knowest that no wight dare disobey my commandments; I therefore do now command thee not to rise upon my ground, nor to presume to wet any part of thy sovereign lord and governor.” But the sea keeping her course, rose still higher and higher, and overflowed not only the kings feet, but also flashed up unto his legs and knees. Wherewith the king started suddenly up, and withdrew from it, saying withall to his nobles that were about him: “Behold you noble men, you call me king, which can not so much as stay by my commandment this small portion of water. But know ye for certain, that there is no king but the father only of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom he reigneth, and at whose beck all things are governed. Let us therefore honour him, let us confess and profess him to be the ruler of heaven, earth, and sea, and besides him none other.” Raphael Holinshed (1577). Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland, volume 2 chapter 13. Spelling modernized. Holinshed wrote that his sources are Henry of Huntingdon and ‘Matthew of Westminster’, but this can’t have been the whole story, because neither of those sources mentioned the location. Holinshed must surely have consulted Fabyan (who located the event on the Thames) and Rudburn (who located it at Southampton). It seems likely that he followed Fabyan’s introduction, but replaced “In time of which” with “insomuch that” in order to better link the introduction and the story, perhaps not even realising that he was making a connection that was not previously there. John Norden introduced flattering courtiers as an explanation for why Cnut believed he could command the tide: [A]fter his return from Rome into England, who in regard of his quadruplicity of kingdoms, esteemed himself, more than a man mortal: for his Sycophants had so bewitched him with their enchanted flatteries, that he deemed himself no less then a God. And in this proud conceit on a day he passed by the Thames, which ran by that palace, at the flowing of the tide, & making stay near the water, the waves cast forth some part of the water towards him, this Canute conjured the waves by his regal command to proceed no farther: the Thames unacquainted with this new God, held on it course, flowing as of custom it used to do, and refrained not to assail him near to the knees: whereat this high conceited man as one amazed, began to tremble, starting back protesting that he was but a man, though a mighty king. And that he that governed those waters, was only worthy to be called a king, and all mortal men, most mighty kings, ought to subject them unto him. John Norden (1593). Speculum Britanniae, part first. Spelling modernized. Richard Baker retained the courtiers, but removed the idea that the king believed their flatteries: One strange act is recorded, which he did for convincing his fawning flatterers, who used to tell him that his powers were more than humane; For being one time at Southampton, he commanded that his Chair of State should be set on the shore when the Sea began to flow, and then sitting down there in the presence of his many attendants, he spake thus to that Element: I charge thee that thou presume not to enter my Land, nor wet these Robes of thy Lord that are about me. But the Sea giving no heed to his command, but keeping on his usual course of Tide, first wet his skirts, and after his thighs, whereupon suddenly arising, he thus spake in the hearing of them all: Let all the worlds Inhabitants know, that vain and weak is the power of their Kings; and that none is worthy of the name of King, but be that keeps both Heaven and Earth and Sea in obedience. Richard Baker (1643). A Chronicle of the Kings of England. Spelling modernized. Baker included a general bibliography but did not give line or chapter sources, so I don’t know which sources he consulted, but ‘Southampton’ and ‘Chair’ suggest Holinshed, and ‘thighs’ suggest Fabyan. David Hume included the courtiers and made it explicit that the king knew he could not command the tide: Canute, who was the greatest and most powerful prince of his time, sovereign of Denmark and Norway, as well as of England, could not fail to meet with adulation from his courtiers; a tribute which is liberally paid even to the meanest and weakest princes. Some of his flatterers breaking out, one day, in admiration of his grandeur, exclaimed that every thing was possible for him: Upon which the monarch, it is said, ordered his chair to be set on the sea-shore, while the tide was making; and as the waters approached, he commanded them to retire, and to obey the voice of him who was lord of the ocean. He feigned to sit some time in expectation of their submission; but when the sea still advanced towards him, and began to wash him with its billows, he turned to his courtiers, and remarked to them, that every creature in the universe was feeble and impotent, and that power resided with one Being alone, in whose hands were all the elements of nature, who could say to the ocean, Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther, and who could level with his nod the most towering piles of human pride and ambition. David Hume (1762). The History of England, volume I chapter III. Hume gave as his sources Ranulph Higden, John Brompton, ‘Matthew of Westminster’ and Henry of Huntingdon, but none of these mentioned the courtiers, so it is hard to avoid suspecting that he was also influenced by Baker. Many versions of the story derived from Hume’s, for example that of Charles Dickens: The old writers of history relate how that Canute was one day disgusted with his courtiers for their flattery, and how he caused his chair to be set on the sea-shore, and feigned to command the tide as it came up not to wet the edge of his robe, for the land was his; how the tide came up, of course, without regarding him; and how he then turned to his flatterers, and rebuked them, saying, what was the might of any earthly king, to the might of the Creator, who could say unto the sea, “Thus far shalt thou go, and no further!” Charles Dickens (1852). A Child’s History of England, Chapter V. and the Ladybird book:  Brenda Ralph Lewis (1954). Kings and Queens of England Book 1. Illustrated by John Leigh-Pemberton and Peter Robinson. I don’t want to give the impression that everyone in the early modern period was incapable of basic scholarship. The historians I selected above were those that contributed to the game of whispers, but contrast them with John Milton: I must not omit one remarkable action done by him, as Huntingdon reports it, with great scene of circumstance and emphatical expression, to show the small power of kings in respect of God; which, unless to court-parasites, needed no such laborious demonstration. He caused his royal seat to be set on the shore, while the tide was coming in; and with all the state that royalty could put into his countenance, said thus to the sea; “Thou, sea, belongest to me, and the land whereon I sit, is mine; nor hath any one, unpunished, resisted my commands; I charge thee come no farther upon my land, neither presume to wet the feet of thy sovereign lord.” But the sea, as before, came rolling-on, and, without reverence, both wetted and dashed him. Whereat the king quickly rising “wished all about him to behold and consider the weak and frivolous power of a king, and that none indeed deserved the name of a king, but he whose eternal laws both Heaven, earth, and sea obey.” A truth so evident of itself, as I said before, that, unless to shame his court-flatterers, who would not else be convinced, Canute needed not to have gone wet-shod home. John Milton (1670). The History of Britain. You’ll see that Milton managed to correctly reference his source, accurately quote it, and separate his own commentary from it. Would that all historians had done so!"
Where are the white folks in The Expanse?,"The very short answer is that in the future, racial difference have largely been sidelined and pale-skinned caucasians are a relative rarity due to racial intermingling. This question was addressed in a four-way interview between TheVerge.com, show co-producer Naren Shankar and authors Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck (who write together as ""James S. A. Corey""). He [Shankar] credits authors Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck (who write together
  under the pseudonym James S. A. Corey) with the show's broad ethnic
  mix, because it's such a significant part of their books. ""They always
  said, ‘The people who make it out into space, it's not just going to
  be Neil Armstrong, clean-cut, classically white Americans. It's going
  to be Indian, Chinese, Russian [people], a mix of everybody, every
  ethnicity. And that's just going to melt and mingle.' We really wanted
  to reflect that, and retain that in the show, because it does say
  something about humanity, and that movement out into space."" and We're trying to really represent human beings, and to extrapolate, to
  the extent it's possible with this kind of drama, where humanity might
  go, how ethnicities might mix, how people might look."" and The authors describe their racial blend as ""aspirational."" ""Part of the mandate when you're writing a future is to write the kind of
  future you want to see,"" says Abraham. ""Not that we're utopian, but

"In Wind in the Willows, why is Mole's garden full of Italian heroes?","I looked at The Annotated Wind in the Willows - not annotated by Grahame himself, for the record - and found some interesting notes (pages 118-119): Garibaldi merchandise was quite commonplace in Europe and elsewhere at the time, and it was not expensive. Mole is not well-off, as he tells Ratty before they go to his house: ‘I know it’s a—shabby, dingy little place,’ he sobbed forth at last, brokenly: ‘not like—your cosy quarters—or Toad’s beautiful hall—or Badger’s great house—but it was my own little home—and I was fond of it' Therefore, small ornamental statues - relatively cheap, but not tacky - seem to fit Mole's persona very well. For what it's worth, a contemporary biography of Garibaldi explains that he had great affection for the English people. He wrote, 'The English nation is by no means exempt from imperfections, yet the English are the only people who can be compared with the ancient Romans.' Even before his fight for reunification in 1860 - which Britain helped, by the way, in part to keep France in check - Garibaldi's exploits in South America had become a hit among all classes. He also shared anti-Catholic sentiments, which of course permeated England, and was quite grateful for British help in Italy. In other words, Giuseppe Garibaldi was a big hit in Britain in the mid to late 19th century, and it's no stretch for him or his comrades to be in Mole's garden."
What is close reading?,"In literary criticism, close reading is the careful, sustained
  interpretation of a brief passage of a text. A close reading
  emphasizes the single and the particular over the general, effected by
  close attention to individual words, the syntax, and the order in
  which the sentences unfold ideas, as the reader scans the line of
  text. — Wikipedia Close reading expects readers to focus on the information that a text
  provides, without relying on a lot of information or support. This is
  different from other kinds of reading lessons you teach, in which you
  may start out by introducing teacher-set purposes, discussions of
  students’ life experiences, picture walks, and so on. Close reading discourages such front-loading. The goal of close
  reading instruction is to foster independent readers who are able to
  plumb the depths of a text by considering only the text itself. We all know that it’s not enough to just understand what a text says.
  Close readers not only grasp an author’s message, but they also take a
  look under the hood, so to speak. They try to recognize the author’s
  tone or perspective, the implications of the author’s word choices,
  and why a text is structured or organized as it is. Additionally,
  readers should go beyond a text, evaluating its quality or value,
  comparing it with other texts, or determining its implications. It’s a
  lot to ask of students, but with appropriate scaffolding and support,
  they can do it. — Scholastic I think that means that when doing a close reading one examines writing by moving slowly through the text, examining very small distinctions such as the choice of a single word."
Why does Stanley Uris react so gruesomely to It returning?,"Is it possible Stan is obsessive-compulsive? In the book, King makes it clear how neat Stan is, even referring to him as the smallest adult in Derry. In the bathroom-cleaning scene in the book, the care with which Stan cleans the blood off the wallpaper is deliberately pointed out. When he's thinking to himself about IT in the laundromat, he seems more bothered by the ""wrongness"" of IT than its blood lust; order is the most important thing to him, and disruption of that order bothers him more than anything. It's also mentioned throughout the adult part of the book that Stan couldn't stand being dirty, and, although I can't remember where this part is, one of the grown-up kids goes so far as to say that maybe Stan decided he would rather be dead than dirty. If he is obsessive-compulsive, he would be at higher risk of suicide, and I believe Stan is higher risk in general, because he was ready to kill himself after they got out of the tunnels, when they were cutting their palms. He decides to not slit his wrist at that time, but I believe that if he knew IT were still alive he would have gone through with it. "
Did Charles Dickens change the endings of any of his books other than Great Expectations?,"The New York Times report in an article from 1996,  on a then current exhibition 'Serial Publications: Essential Parts of the 19th-Century Imagination', and the Grolier Club which featured 50 books from the collection of Robert H Jackson, a Cleveland lawyer. The report states: For authors, serialization enabled them to revise plots so as not to disappoint readers. Mr. Jackson noted that Dickens changed the ending of ""The Personal History of David Copperfield"" before the final part was published ""because of reader sentiment."" Instead of having David remaining alone after the death of his first wife, Dora, Dickens had him marry the angelic Agnes. The reader is left believing that David lived, if not happily ever after, then at least with someone to share his troubles. Although copies of the catalogue from this exhibition are for sale in various places online, I've not been able to find a digitised copy anywhere to see if it contains any more information or source for Jackson's assertion. Nor have I been able to track down any other reference, but it does not seem from the phrasing that Jackson believes an alternative ending was actually published. I've searched Forster's Life of Charles Dickens, which is sometimes insightful as to Dickens' progress with works, but could find nothing relevant to Copperfield, though it does reveal that his original intention was not to kill off Little Nell in The Old Curiosity Shop, that suggestion coming from Forster, but probably too early in the process for it to count as 'changing the ending'. He had not thought of killing her, when, about half-way through, I asked him to consider whether it did not necessarily belong even to his own conception, after taking so mere a child through such a tragedy of sorrow, to lift her also out of the commonplace of ordinary happy endings so that the gentle pure little figure and form should never change to the fancy. All that I meant he seized at once, and never turned aside from it again."
Political allegory in Lukyanenko's Watch series?,"Communities of the Light Ones and the Dark Ones can be interpreted as a political allegory. Here is a dialog from the first book ""Night Watch"", Story 2, Chapter 2: Anton: «A Dark Magician can heal; a Light Magician can kill,» I said. «That's the truth. Do you know what the difference is between Light and Darkness?» Svetlana: «No, I don't. For some reason, they don't teach us that. I expect it's hard to formulate clearly?» Anton: «Not at all. If you always put yourself and your own interests first, then your path leads through the Darkness. If you think about others, it leads toward the Light.» Contrast between interests of the society and one's personal interests is a typical comparison of socialism and capitalism. I don't see an analogy for the Watches in the real life though. UPDATE In the descriptions of  major conflicts of the 20th century the Light Ones participate on the communist/socialist side: 1. Revolution Anton: A passionate heart, clean hands, a cool head… Surely it was no accident that during the Revolution and the Civil War, almost all the Light Ones had attached themselves to the Cheka? And most of those who didn't had died, at the hands of the Dark Ones, or even more often at the hands of those they were defending. (Night Watch, Story 3, Chapter 3) Anton: «A new revolution?» Olga: «We didn't want the last one. It was all supposed to happen almost completely without bloodshed. You understand: We can win only through ordinary people. When they become enlightened, when their spirit is uplifted. Communism was a wonderfully well-calculated system, and it's all my fault that it wasn't realized.» (Night Watch, Story 3, Chapter 3) 2. World War 2 Olga: «Of course. You don't get sudden eruptions of hatred like that during times of peace. That son of a bitch Adolf… he had plenty of admirers, but he would have been incinerated in the very first year of the war. And the whole of Germany with him. The situation with Stalin was a different case, adoration on a monstrous scale like that is a powerful shield. Anton, I'm a simple Russian woman…«—the smile that flitted across Olga's face showed what she really felt about the word «simple»—«and I spent all the last war shielding the enemies of my own country against curses. (Night Watch, Story 1, Chapter 3) So while Olga was protecting Hitler during WW2, she was doing it on an order against her own loyalties. 3. Cold War The watches were not involved. The puny conflict between the USA and the Islamic world was nothing in comparison… Even the old Cold War between the USA and the USSR that was now a part of history hadn't come close to the war of the Watches. They were just childish games for foolish human beings. (Day Watch, Story 3, Chapter 1) Accusations On a few occasions the Light Ones are blamed for the failures of communism, and support of nazism.  Such accusations are made by the Dark Ones, but are not admitted by the Light Ones.  Such statements are either left without a response, or are rebuked. When the Light Ones respond they shift the blame for the tragedies onto the Dark Ones. Zabulon: «There's no point in beating about the bush. In the last hundred years the forces of Light have launched three global experiments. The revolution in Russia. The Second World War. And now this new project. Following the same scenario.» Anton: «I don't know what you're talking about,» I said. I suddenly had this desperate, aching feeling in my chest. (Night Watch, Story 3, Chapter 5) Edgar: ""At the time the Night Watch and the Day Watch were fighting for the right to conduct a social experiment,"" Edgar told me. ""Communism, as you know, was invented by the Light Ones…"" Anton: ""And subverted by the Dark Ones,"" I couldn't resist remarking. (Twilight Watch, Story 2, Chapter 4) Semyon: «Very neat,» said Semyon. «I remember during the Civil War I was sent to capture a were-tiger. The bastard worked in the Cheka, and pretty high up too…« (Night Watch, Story 2, Chapter 1) UPDATE 2 Arina's Story Soviet Union is presented as a joint experiment by Night Watch, Day Watch and Inquisition. The Light Ones were hoping to build a better society. The Dark Ones were hoping that it would create hostility towards Soviets. Dark witch Arina was ordered to remoralize large number of people in USSR (e.g. make them believe in communism). Svetlana: ""What are you accused of?"" Arina: ""On the instructions of an unidentified Light One I modified the recipe for a potion and so ruined a joint experiment by the Inquisition, the Night Watch, and the Day Watch."" Arina: ""The experiment was supported by all the Others,"" Arina said. ""The Dark Ones believed that the appearance of thousands of convinced communists in the leadership of the country-the bread plant's output mostly went to the Kremlin and the People's Commissariats-wouldn't improve anything. On the contrary, it would only provoke hostility to the Soviets in the rest of the world. But the Light Ones believed that after a hard, but victorious war against Germany-the likelihood of that was already clear to the clairvoyants by then-the Soviet Union could become a genuinely attractive society. There was a secret report… basically, people would have built communism by 1980…"" < snip > Arina: ""... but they were supposed to have built a city on the moon in the '70s. And fly to Mars, and something else. The whole of Europe would have been communist. And not under constraint either. And by now here on earth we'd have had a huge Soviet Union, a huge United States… I think Britain, Canada, and Australia were part of it… And there was China left on its own."" Anton: ""So the Light Ones miscalculated?"" I asked. Arina: ""No."" Arina shook her head. ""They didn't miscalculate. Of course, the blood would have flowed in rivers. But what came at the end of it all wouldn't have been too bad. Far better than all the regimes we have now… The Light Ones overlooked something else. If things had gone that way, then around about now people would have learned that the Others existed."" (Twilight Watch, Story 2, Chapter 7)"
"What sources influenced Byron's ""Fragment of a Novel""?","Byron's ""Fragment of a Novel"" was based on Polidori's The Vampyre, which in turn was based on a story told verbally by Byron as part of the same competition which produced Frankenstein. The story of the competition is all too familiar to enthusiasts of horror literature. In the summer of 1816, Byron, Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley, and Polidori were stranded together for a few days in the Villa Diodati on Lake Geneva, until the thunderstorms blew over. The game - a contest in telling ghost stories - was intended to be a match between Shelley and Byron, despite being open to all four ... but it was Mary Shelley and Polidori whose works, Frankenstein and The Vampyre, have been better known up to this very day. The Vampyre went on to inspire Edgar Allan Poe and Bram Stoker himself. From this detailed essay (emphasis mine): What was it then that inspired Polidori to create a short story which so many other writers right up to the present day – whether they realise it or not, taking their inspiration direct from Bram Stoker without being aware of his own influences – have admired and sought to emulate? The short answer is Byron. 'The Vampyre', to give it its proper credit, was inspired by a tale told earlier in the evening by Byron, one which was very much later published as 'A Fragment', and which bears startling theoretical and literary similarities to Polidori's piece. The influence of Byron was such that when 'The Vampyre' was originally published in 'The New Monthly Magazine' in April 1819 it was attributed to him. The rift between the two men having widened in the interim few years however, Byron denied all authorship and a month later Polidori stepped out of the shadows and claimed it for his own whilst admitting the influence of his great friend in its conception. ""I beg leave to state that your correspondent has been mistaken in attributing that tale in its present form to Lord Byron. The fact is that though the groundwork is certainly Lord Byron's, its development is mine."" Note that The Vampyre was published on 1 April 1819 while ""Fragment of a Novel"" was published together with Byron's Mazeppa on 28 June 1819. It is speculated that Byron wrote ""Fragment of a Vampire"" as a sort of counterstroke to Polidori's publication of The Vampyre, trying to prove himself and distance himself from association with the latter work: On its publication ""The Vampyre"" was widely attributed to Byron, much to his irritation, and as a form of self-defence maybe, he lost no time in quickly publishing his own ""Fragment"", in which the vampire elements to be found in Polidori’s work are noticeably missing - perhaps eradicated to make the story as removed from ""The Vampyre"" as possible."
What is the role of Jane Eyre in The Cider House Rules?,"John Irving speaking in Columbia: A Journal of Literature and Art[1] when asked about parallels between David Copperfield and Jane Eyre and The Cider House Rules, spoke of his appreciation of the Victorian 'orphan novel' I consider the orphan novel to be a really valuable contribution to Victorian literature but not only Victorian literature. This is a very deliberately David Copperfield kind of novel. But he also cautioned into reading too much into any parallels between The Cider House Rules, Jane Eyre and David Copperfield, saying: I made a point of steeping myself in some of these books so I could think about characters whose only reference was to them. I wanted to have Homer and Melony out in the world with these books as their only reference. But at the same time I tried very hard, except for some playful examples, not to make literal parallels between this book and either Jane Eyre or David Copperfield. When I say ‘playful; Clara is an obvious admitted reference to David Copperfield’s mother. But I’m not very interested in that; that’s not the important thing to me. When pushed on whether he wanted to invite readers to draw parallels he responded: the parallels in this book to those novels are playful because they are so obvious. I’m not trying to conceal anything from the readers. The books are quoted obviously, heavy-handedly throughout, and so I’m chiefly interested in having a good time with those references. But by association I certainly think the concerns of a writer like Bronte and the concerns of a writer like Dickens are far more interesting to me than the concerns of writers who are my contemporaries of at least more modern. What else is more important to think about than whether you’re going to end up with kids who like you or hate you or that kind of thing? I’m always disappointed to see how little modern novels are about; how a small story is sufficient. So he included the references for a variety of reasons, having read them as background himself, he wanted his characters to also have them as background when they went out into the world, and he wanted his storytelling to have a complexity which he feels is absent from many modern works.

How did Madeline Usher survive without food or water?,"The human body can survive for a pretty long time without food or water.  A famous example, Mahatma Gandhi, survived 21 days with only small sips of water. However, that's with a bit of water. According to Scientific American, the human body can last (on average) around a hundred hours without water, at the far end. However, this depends on the temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors.  Madeline was put into a tomb underground, where I assume it was cold and damp.  There was a storm outside, so that wouldn't help. Maybe she was in a tomb instead of an actual coffin? When Madeline's body had been placed in a coffin, Usher and I alone carried it to it's temporary tomb. This was a vault, or compartment, in the foundation walls of the mansion. It was small, damp, and without any light. It was directly under the room in which I was staying.  It's highly unlikely she'd be able to survive without any water for 7 days, even in those conditions however. It's more likely that there was a small trickle or pool of water in the tomb and that she wasn't confined to a coffin. TL;DR: Not really feasible, she had to have some water. Either Poe made a mistake, this is a different universe, or Madeline became some sort of zombie who didn't need water."
Are the inconsistencies in Harry Potter symbolic or allegorical?,"If you want you can interpret the books this way. But I honestly just think that she didn't care about such things. I believe that the way a Quidditch game ends simply serves as her goal to write a compelling story. It's useful when the main character can be super important in something. In the end, it is a book for children (specifically the first few) so it doesn't have to be super complex. I believe her books simply have some flaws that she either didn't care for because they don't hinder the way she can tell a story, or that she didn't realize exist. So No. I don't think the inconsistencies in the Harry Potter books are symbolic or allegorical. But that's fine she still wrote some cool books which I enjoyed tremendously in my childhood. But again. if you wanna read or interpret the books this way, you totally can."
"What's the point of the hen in Juan Rulfo's ""They Gave Us the Land""?","It serves to demonstrate the loneliness that the men, Esteban in particular, feel because of the Revolution. The men feel lost and disillusioned, and Esteban feels alone and isolated. The presence of the hidden hen is to show that Esteban wants to show compassion to something or someone in the aftermath of the Revolution. The hen is his own, from his yard, and Esteban dearly protects it as the men make their trek. He holds the hen by its legs to prevent it from hitting its head on the rocks. The hen is Rulfo's way of making a subtle jab at how the Revolution promised the peasants fertile, arable land, but instead delivers only a dry wasteland, which is essentially worthless for farming (which was the whole reason the Mexican Revolution occurred)."
Does Thomas the Tank Engine have free will?,"The Thomas the Tank Engine stories were originally stories about a toy engine made for Awdry’s son Christopher. So, the question really is, do toys have free will? This is perhaps a more profound question than it appears on the surface. Toys are metaphors. Like toys, are we automata? Are we programmed by nature and nurture to perform in predictable ways? This predestination view of toys was humorously but elegantly expressed in “The Mouse and his Child”, 1967, by Russell Hoban, the adventures of two wind-up toy mice. Hoban writes “Toys must do what they are wound to do.” However, later in the book these toys make choices that seem to change their future. The book is an exploration of exactly this question: do toys have free will? Do our decisions have real effects, changing the outcome of events? New discoveries in non-linear mathematics and quantum physics suggest that our decisions create new realities that come into existence as a result. For example, we cannot accurately predict weather far into the future because it results from infinitesimally small beginnings that blow up into radically different outcomes. This suggests that the mechanistic metaphor represented by toys is too simplistic. Yet, this mechanistic metaphor still dominates our thinking and shapes our world-view."
Why don't the modern printings of Campion novels use the original artwork?,"It may not be accurate to say that his style became associated with her work, per se. It seems more that it was associated with a range of authors in that period. Before the war Youngman Carter became a prolific graphic artist, distinguished particularly in the undervalued field of dustwrapper design for books. His designs enhanced the work of many of the most celebrated writers of the day: H.G.Wells, G.K.Chesterton, Eden Phillpotts, Margaret Kennedy, Daphne du Maurier, Rebecca West, John Steinbeck, J.B.Priestley, Georgette Heyer and Graham Greene. and after the war He continued to design dustwrappers, including a long series for Simenon, and in the early sixties produced paperback covers for several of Dorothy L. Sayers’ Wimsey novels. The source of both quotes is the Margery Allingham Society website. More generally publishers make a habit of refreshing artwork for books which remain in publication for extended time. If you consider books which have remained popular over several generations, it would be unrealistic to expect the books to remain wedded to unaltering cover art when the style of all the new books around them, for which them must compete for sales, are up to the minute and modish. For books which have remained popular for so long, the original cover art might now be considered elegant and appropriately 'period', but ten, twenty, thirty, forty years ago it may just have looked dated, dowdy and tired. An article on the BBC entitled 'What makes and Iconic Book Cover' speaks to several people in the industry on the topic: Jon Gray, who over a 20-year career has designed covers for authors including Zadie Smith, Sally Rooney, Salmon Rushdie and David Foster Wallace, says there’s more pressure than ever to get covers right. “Bookshops are such a riot,” he says. “It’s like a big crowded party and you’re trying to get your face to stand out in the crowd. To make an impact and get someone to pick up a book and turn it over is getting harder and harder.” It’s not just in shops that books need to stand out, but online too – whether that’s on social media or the sites people buy from – and that’s had an impact on how they look, says Gray. “Online marketing and media has led to a trend for brighter, super-saturated covers in print. The use of fluorescent and special colours and saturated imagery with white-out text. Print is being asked to match the brightness of screen.” [Donna] Payne, [creative director at Faber & Faber] claims that designing a new cover for a classic novel is also a chance to bring out an aspect of the book that hasn’t been explored before. “You have so many books published every day, it’s important to get those classic titles back on the table in front of store, and a new jacket will help to do that,” she says."
Did William Shakespeare hide things in his writings?,I think you're reading too much into this - Shakespeare was known to capitalize significant nouns fairly commonly in his writings (several examples can be seen here). Remember that when Shakespeare was writing he was using very early Modern English and the style rules then were far looser as the language shifted from Middle English towards the more modern forms of the language. We don't generally capitalize season names now but he was writing some ~400 years ago!
"Why is a ""cucumber sandwich"" specifically used as what English faith has ""only just enough teeth to get through""?","Cucumber sandwiches, specifically, are a stereotypical part of English ""posh"" culture, along with afternoon tea and ""More tea, vicar?"" From Wikipedia: Cucumber sandwiches formed an integral part of the stereotypical afternoon tea affair. By contrast, people of the era's lower working classes were thought to prefer a coarser but more satisfying protein-filled sandwich, in a ""meat tea"" that might substitute for supper. Some writers have attempted to draw out an association between the daintiness of the sandwich and the perceived effeteness of the UK's aristocracy. Cucumber sandwiches are often used as a kind of shorthand in novels and films to identify upper-class people, occasionally in a derogatory manner. [...] In addition, the sandwiches were once considered appropriate delicacies to offer to visiting clergy, in times when such visits were still a common feature of English middle class life. The popularity of the cucumber sandwich reached its upper-class zenith in the Edwardian era, when cheap labour and plentiful coal enabled cucumbers to be produced in hotbeds under glass through most of the year. With the declining popularity of tea as a meal in the United Kingdom, there was a corresponding decline in the popularity of cucumber sandwiches, but they are still frequently served at teas, luncheons, and gatherings. Note that it's not just part of upper-class English tradition, but relates specifically to the practice of inviting clergymen around for tea. This explains why it would be used in that specific sentence about English parsons. You've already noted that cucumbers are a soft filling, but it's worth emphasising that traditional English cucumber sandwiches would be particularly tender and easy to bite into. They'd often be prepared thinly cut, with the crust of the bread and/or the peel of the cucumber removed, so there's literally nothing to bite through except soft white bread and cucumber flesh.

"What is meant by ""without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob Marley"" in A Christmas Carol?","I think that by this point in the story, Scrooge can sense himself starting to reform. In this scene he is saying that had he devoted more time to paying attention to little, pleasant things like Fran's song, he might have reformed then - rather than needing Marley to die, and then visit him as a ghost, to kick off the ghostly visitations that are causing him to instead begin to reform at that moment. He seems to be recognizing Marley's death as the inciting act, here - but imagining a different path he might have taken, where that inciting act would not have been necessary."
"Why couldn't Mr Dobbins become a doctor in ""Tom Sawyer""?","The U.S. Department of Education has published a brief paper on the history of teaching in the U.S. here. Since Tom Sawyer takes place in the 1840s, there is really no chance that a college education would have been required, except in some extraordinary local circumstances. Mr. Dobbins may have wanted to become a doctor, but couldn't afford the necessary and expensive medical training. During the 19th century, no formal educational requirements were in place for teachers. Teacher certification was inconsistent, but there was no ""teaching profession"" and no formal education was required. You just needed to persuade your local government that you were good enough to be a teacher. Teacher certification in the nineteenth century was irregular and diverse. There was no single pattern, and there was no teaching profession as such. In the first half of the nineteenth century, the requirements for entry into teaching were modest: new teachers had to persuade a local school board of their moral character, and in some districts, pass a test of their general knowledge. In 1834, Pennsylvania became the first state to require future teachers to pass a test of reading, writing, and arithmetic. By 1867, most states required teachers to pass a locally administered test to get a state certificate, which usually included not only the basic skills, but also U.S. history, geography, spelling, and grammar. At this point in history, some states had required basic skills tests. However, more than likely any requirements would be imposed by the local district and not by the state. It wasn't until the 20th century that formal teacher's certifications appeared in the United States. During this time there was an increasing professionalization of teachers. Pedagogy degrees (like a bachelor's degree in education) appeared, and eventually became the norm for teacher certification. Physicians' training on the other hand, was both expensive and required in practice (though perhaps not formally required). According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, medical licensure in the U.S. dates back to the colonial period (that is, prior to the American Revolution). By the 1800s medical societies (essentially professional organizations) were regulating medical practice and certifying physicians. Your regional medical society would be responsible for certifying you as a doctor. Universities and medical societies both offered medical degrees. Slawson(2012) summarizes medical training in the United States throughout this period. Medical degrees typically consisted of 2 years of lecture and 3 years of apprenticeship. This cost about between about $790 - $1,250 in total, at a time when the annual income for a factory laborer was about $360 a year - half that for rural labor. Unless your family already had money, it would be difficult to afford this education. It seems that actually having a medical degree was often not necessary for practice. Perhaps only 40% of practitioners had medical degrees (though they may have attended lectures and had some apprenticeship before their own practice). Nonetheless, affording this education at all would have been difficult for a laborer's family."
"In Kerouac's On The Road, what is snakejuice?","“Snake juice” is whisky: snake juice, n. slang (chiefly Australian) whisky; also loosely, any alcoholic drink. Oxford English Dictionary. Although the OED says “chiefly Australian”, my searches on Google Books and the Internet Archive found the earliest uses in the USA. In particular, the following two citations antedate the OED’s earliest (1900) citation: But its redeeming feature is Esquire May and his little shop around the corner. The ’Squire is an expounder of law, moral virtue and distilled snake juice, and altogether is a jolly fellow. The Field, 27 November 1875, p. 266. Chicago. “Thet’s the stuff, dog-gone me ef ’t ain’t,—the reg’lar snake-medicine, boys, an’ it was rale thoughtful uv yer to brung it. Dog-my-cats ef I ain’t afeard I shall be snake-bit to-day ef I don’t hist in some of thet ther snake-juice plum-quick. Here ’s to ye, boys; may yer never be snake-bit!” Frederick A. Ober (1887). The Knockabout Club in the Everglades, p. 185. Boston: Estes and Lauriat. Eric Partridge suggested that “snake juice” might have been derived from earlier phrases linking alcoholic delirium with snakes: snake-juice. Whiskey: Australian: from ca. 1890. C. J. Dennis. Ex see snakes. see snakes. To have delirium tremens: U.S. anglicised as coll. ca. 1900. Earlier form: have or have got snakes in one’s boots remained U.S. Eric Partridge (1923). A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, 5th edition, p. 791. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul. A couple of early appearances of these phrases: Dick Weldon died of delirium tremens (or snakes in his boots). The Latter-day Saints’ Millennial Star, 1 October 1872, p. 631. London. “He may also have delirium tremens, which means delirium with trembling of the limbs. Another name for this disease is mania à potu, or drinking mania, which you just now called ‘jim-jams.’ There are other popular names for it, such as ‘D.T.,’ ‘del. trem.,’ ‘seeing snakes,’ and ‘got ’em.’” Thomas Wallace Knox (1890). Teetotaler Dick: His Adventures, Temptations and Triumphs, p. 119. New York: Ward & Drummond. As for Kerouac’s use of “snakejuice” in On the Road, the word may have been adopted as an African-American dialect term, like “jazz” and “blues” (though I was unable to find any evidence of this), or perhaps the word was associated with remote or rural dialects, that the characters might have expected to hear in the swamps of east Texas. But most likely is that the swamps themselves suggested the snakes, which suggested the juice: We were surrounded by a great forest of viny trees in which we could almost hear the slither of a million copperheads. Jack Kerouac (1957). On the Road, p. 131. New York: New American Library."
Why would Henry want to close the breach?,"By starting the second line with “or”, the king indicates that this is the worse of two alternative actions: closing up the wall with English dead would of course be good for the defenders of Harfleur and bad for the English. Samuel Johnson suggested that there might originally have been an “either” that has been lost: Or close the wall, &c.] Here is apparently a chasm. One line at least is lost, which contained the other part of a disjunctive proposition. The King’s speech is, Dear friends, either win the town, or close up the wall with dead. The old quarto gives no help. Samuel Johnson (1766). The Plays of William Shakespeare, volume 6, p. 47. Dublin: A. Leathley. However, most commentators think that the “either” is already stated clearly enough in the first line of the speech, for example: I do not perceive the chasm which Dr. Johnson complains of. What the King means to say, is,—Re-enter the breach you have made, or fill it up with your own dead bodies; i.e. Pursue your advantage, or give it up with your lives. Mount the breach in the wall, or repair it by leaving your own carcases in lieu of the stones you have displaced: in short—Do one thing or the other. George Steevens (1773). Quoted in Isaac Reed, ed. (1813). The Plays of William Shakespeare, volume 12, pp. 366–367. London: J. Nichols. Alternatively, we can interpret the king’s appeal as, “attack the breach again, or all we will have achieved is to fill it with the dead bodies of our comrades.” There have been some other, less plausible, suggestions. Henry Halford Vaughan considered the possibility that “close” was a misprint for “scale”: The command, therefore, would be either “Once more mount the breach, my friends, or scale up the unbreached wall itself, by the dead bodies of our slain countrymen.” ‘Scale’ and ‘close’ have precisely the same letters, the same in number varied only by the very trivial difference between ‘a’ and ‘o’. […] This amendment is rendered all the more probable from the fact that, according to the old copy, the stage direction for this scene is: ‘Enter the King, Exeter, Bedford, and Gloucester. Alarum: scaling ladders at Harfleur.’ Modern copies say ‘soldiers with scaling ladders.’ It would therefore be an apt and stirring command, ‘No ladders are necessary, my friends; either mount the breach once more, or scale with the dead bodies of Englishmen.’ Henry Halford Vaughan (1881). New Readings & New Renderings of Shakespeare’s Tragedies, volume 2, pp. 73–74. London: C. Kegan Paul. I quote Vaughan not because I think his theory is remotely likely, but to show how far some commentators have had to reach to resolve the difficulty in the line."
"Why does Valentine refer to her father's second wife as her ""mother-in-law""?","This is a translation error! The original French is as follows: — Oh! monsieur, dit-elle, pourquoi donc êtes vous venu si tard aujourd’hui? Savez-vous que l’on va dîner bientôt, et qu’il m’a fallu bien de la diplomatie et bien de la promptitude pour me débarrasser de ma belle-mère qui m’épie, de ma femme de chambre qui m’espionne, et de mon frère qui me tourmente, pour venir travailler ici à cette broderie, qui, j’en ai peur, ne sera pas finie de longtemps? Alexandre Dumas (1845). Le Comte de Monte Cristo, volume 7, p. 283. Paris: Pétion. The French “belle-mère” means both “mother-in-law” and “step-mother”, and the anonymous translator of the 1894 Crowell edition picked the wrong one: “And why do you come so late today? It is almost dinner-time, and I had to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful mother-in-law, my too-devoted maid, and my troublesome brother, who is always teasing me about coming to work at my embroidery, which I am in a fair way never to get done.” Alexandre Dumas (1845). The Count of Monte Cristo, volume 1, p. 516. New York: Crowell & Co (1894). The mistake was corrected in the 1901 Crowell edition, which has “stepmother” on page 516, but Project Gutenberg used the 1894 edition as the basis for its e-book, and the mis-translation duly appeared in chapter 51 (but no longer; see below). Another answer points out that “mother-in-law” can be used with the sense “stepmother” in English too, but this doesn’t apply to The Count of Monte Cristo, for the following reasons: The Oxford English Dictionary marks this sense as “now regional”: that is, it is not standard usage, and so is the wrong register to represent the speech of Valentine, a member of the aristocracy who has grown up in Paris. The fact that Crowell issued a corrected edition shows that they considered it a mistake. The translator chose “stepmother” in six other places to refer to the relationship between Valentine and Héloïse, for example, this passage: Elle extra donc, et voyant près de sa mère l’étranger dont elle avait tant entendu parler déjà, elle salua sans aucune minauderie de jeune fille et sans baisser les yeux, avec une grâce qui redoubla l’attention du comte. Alexandre Dumas (1845). Le Comte de Monte Cristo, volume 8, p. 7. Paris: Pétion. became, in the 1894 Crowell edition: She entered the apartment, and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had already heard so much, saluted him without any girlish awkwardness, or even lowering her eyes, and with an elegance that redoubled the count's attention. Alexandre Dumas (1845). The Count of Monte Cristo, volume 1, p. 526. New York: Crowell & Co (1894). Accordingly, I submitted some errata to Project Gutenberg, and the six occurrences of “mother-in-law” in chapter 51 are now corrected to “stepmother”, following the 1901 Crowell edition."
Where was Homer born?,"A great deal of what is believed to have happened this long ago is based on accounts written centuries later and/or archaeological finds that are open to interpretation. If Homer did exist, it shouldn't surprise us that there would be no evidence of it. If Homer didn't exist, it shouldn't surprise us that for a couple thousand years most people said he did.  While any sort of evidence of the existence (or non-existence) of Homer is scant and speculative, there is a good reason why someone from Ionia in Asia Minor some number of centuries before the peak of classical Athens would write from the Greek perspective.  After the traditional (and by traditional I mean the Ancient Greek tradition) date of the Trojan War, Ionian Greeks colonized the area where Troy supposedly was. From Wikipedia: According to Greek tradition, the cities of Ionia were founded by
  colonists from the other side of the Aegean. Their settlement was
  connected with the legendary history of the Ionic people in Attica,
  which asserts that the colonists were led by Neleus and Androclus,
  sons of Codrus, the last king of Athens. In accordance with this view
  the ""Ionic migration"", as it was called by later chronologers, was
  dated by them one hundred and forty years after the Trojan War, or
  sixty years after the return of the Heracleidae into the Peloponnese. People think the author of the Illiad may be from there because he accurately describes a handful of distinct climate patterns, geographical features, and uses their dialect."
Did the Lord of the Flies have any kind of religious reference more specific than just the Devil?,"The entire book can be seen as an allegory for the Bible.  It has a startlingly large number of allusions to Jewish and Christian myths and stories.  Here are some of them: Basically, the Lord of the Flies tries to demonstrate that the Bible was wrong; that men have always had evil inside of us, and that it was not the snake's fault, that is just human nature. It doesn't hurt that the whole thing comes from World War II, in which Golding fought; this is probably where he got those ideas about human nature."
"What literary work is being referred to in this limerick in which ""The earth, like an orange, is blue""?","The key phrase is “blue like an orange”. This is from a poem by French surrealist Paul Éluard, published in L'Amour la poésie. The poem is somewhat well known in France, and has been analyzed by many, but I've never read it. It may be less well-known in English, although “blue like an orange” does seem to be a somewhat well-known phrase in English as well. Here is my translation of the first stanza. (This is a very literal translation which likely misses some subtext. The original does not rhyme.) The earth is blue like an orange
Never an error words do not lie
They no longer give you something to sing

The mad and the loves

All the secrets all the smiles
And what indulging clothes

Is there any animal internal monologue in The Lord of the Rings?,"Yes. When leaving the Shire, the hobbits disturbed a fox: A fox passing through the wood on business of his own stopped several minutes and sniffed. 'Hobbits!' he thought. 'Well, what next? I have heard of strange doings in this land, but I have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out of doors under a tree. Three of them! There's something mighty queer behind this.' He was quite right, but he never found out any more about it. -- The Fellowship of the Ring, Chapter 3: ""Three is Company"""
What is the name of a short story where a computer insists 2+2 is 5?,"This sounds very much like Trurl's Machine (Maszyna Trurla), from Stanislaw Lem's collection of short stories The Cyberiad -  except that the computer insisted that two plus two was equal to seven, rather than five. The computer was built by the inventor Trurl, and was the height of an eight storey building. When he finished it, he asked it the question as a test and received the answer ""SEVEN"". He makes several efforts to fix it, but the machine insists on its answer. Eventually the computer feels insulted, and chases Trurl and his companion out of the building until they take refuge in a cave. There it tries to dig down to reach them, but in the process causes a landslide that crushes it. They saw the machine. It lay smashed and flattened, nearly broken in
half by an enormous boulder that had landed in the middle of its eight
floors... The machine still quivered slightly, and one could hear
something turning, creaking feebly within. ""Yes, this is the bad end you've come to and two and two is - as it
always was -"" began Trurl, but just then the machine made a faint
barely audible croaking noise and said, for the last time, ""SEVEN."""
"Is ""The Ice Dragon"" set in the same universe as ""A Song of Ice and Fire""?","Someone asked the author this question on his LiveJournal page, and for once he gave a straight answer: Is The Ice Dragon in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire like the back cover of it says? GRRM: No, it is not. The world of Ice & Fire did not exist when I wrote THE ICE DRAGON."
Why did Isaac Bashevis Singer win the Nobel Prize for Literature?,"Because the Nobel committee felt his writing expressed ""universal human conditions"". According to the official Nobel Prize website: The Nobel Prize in Literature 1978 was awarded to Isaac Bashevis Singer ""for his impassioned narrative art which, with roots in a Polish-Jewish cultural tradition, brings universal human conditions to life"". Although Singer's stories themselves were written in Yiddish and therefore only accessible (pre-translation) to a rather small audience, it seems the Nobel committee felt that they expressed something far bigger than the Yiddish-speaking or Jewish communities, something which any human could identify with regardless of their cultural background.

I know this isn't much info to go on, but it's all we're going to get for a long time. According to the Statutes of the Nobel Foundation: A prize-awarding body may, however, after due consideration in each individual case, permit access to material which formed the basis for the evaluation and decision concerning a prize, for purposes of research in intellectual history. Such permission may not, however, be granted until at least 50 years have elapsed after the date on which the decision in question was made. So they won't be releasing any more information about the reasoning for their decision until around 2028 - still another ten years to go! Anything else we can say now would be informed speculation."
"YA Adventure/Survival Novel, Written Late 1940's Through Late 1970's","The book is Canyon Winter by Walt Morey, originally published in 1972.   The private plane taking Peter to his wealthy father's ranch crashes in the Rockies, and its pilot is killed. Struggling to survive, and sure that no one will rescue him, Peter stumbles across rough and unforgiving Omar Pickett, who has lived in the mountains for years. Peter must rely on Omar--and learn to rely on himself. It's on this list of YA adventure stories about plane crash survival, immediately above another fondly-remembered book, Danny Dunn on a Desert Island, by Jay Williams.  Key words used for the Google search were: ya wilderness survival stories published before 1980. Update: I grabbed a copy from Amazon and it was definitely Canyon Winter.  Interestingly, I totally forgot about the stuff that happened after Peter was rescued.  That must not have interested me the last time I read it, when I was 9 or 10.  I think this must also have been the book that started my life-long love of sourdough, which I know started before I was 15."

What is the foundation of the religion in Watership Down?,"El-ahrairah is much more legendary than mythical, more like a hero than a god. Here's how the text describes him the very first time his name appears: What Robin Hood is to the English and John Henry to the American Negroes, Elil-Hrair-Rah, or El-ahrairah - The Prince with a Thousand Enemies - is to rabbits. Uncle Remus might well have heard of him, for some of El-ahrairah's adventures are those of Brer Rabbit. For that matter, Odysseus himself might have borrowed a trick or two from the rabbit hero, for he is very old and was never at a loss for a trick to deceive his enemies. Once, so they say, he had to get home by swimming across a river in which there was a large and hungry pike. El-ahrairah combed himself until he had enough fur to cover a clay rabbit, which he pushed into the water. The pike rushed at it, bit it and left it in disgust. After a little, it drifted to the bank and El-ahrairah dragged it out and waited a while before pushing it in again. After an hour of this, the pike left it alone, and when it had done so for the fifth time, El-ahrairah swam across himself and went home. Some rabbits say he controls the weather, because the wind, the damp and the dew are friends and instruments to rabbits against their enemies. El-ahrairah is not a god; he didn't create the universe or its inhabitants. Nor is he a mighty warrior (like many of the characters in ancient Greek legends, say), nor yet a prophet, preacher, or saint, in the traditions of more modern religions. His awe and glamour, in the eyes of rabbits, comes from his ability to escape his many enemies through cunning alone. This makes sense, of course, since strength is not the best survival trick for rabbits. If the entire company had been made up of Bigwigs, they would never have got as far as they did. Not to diminish Bigwig's contributions, it was the rabbits with more intellectual skills - leadership, intuition, and intelligence, as found in Hazel, Fiver, and Blackberry - who really enabled the success of our heroic band of rabbits. They are the one who exemplify the traits of El-ahrairah. Of course, El-ahrairah isn't the only character in the Lapine mythos. There is Frith, the god and creator of all things, and the Black Rabbit of Inle, guardian of the underworld and the dead, as well as Prince Rainbow, King Darzin, and other characters. How literally are these stories taken? Do the rabbits truly believe that Frith created the world, and that El-ahrairah was a real rabbit prince who got up to all these wild adventures? Most probably not - the way they treat the stories Dandelion tells makes clear that they don't care that much about getting the details 'right', and see them more as entertaining tales than religious instruction. How about historical accuracy? Well, it's possible that there was a real El-ahrairah many years ago, whose adventures have simply been wildly exaggerated and caricaturised as they passed from history to legend. But it's perhaps more likely that many different stories have been put to his name, some from various real rabbit leaders and some made up by imaginative storytellers like Dandelion. Perhaps some of Hazel's escapades will one day be retold under the name of El-ahrairah. (In fact, according to comments below, this actually happened in canon.) Most of what we know about the legendary background of the rabbits comes from the stories told by Dandelion and others at intervals throughout the novel. In these stories: When we examine all of these characters and the stories in which they appear, we see a model which looks, if anything, like popular folk tales, with perhaps a touch of influence from the tales of ancient Greek heroes. This fits well with the way Adams tells the story of Watership Down: it's very pastoral and folksy, a tale of the English countryside. Stories akin to Robin Hood and Brer Rabbit suit this model much better than those of Jesus or Moses. It's worth noting that Watership Down started off as stories told by Adams to his young daughters to entertain them during the school run. They didn't have a deep philosophical or religious meaning, and those who try to find such a meaning in his writing are falling prey to the common trap of overanalysing. Well one day we were going to Stratford-upon-Avon to see Judi Dench in Twelfth Night. Before I said anything in particular my elder daughter, who was eight at the time, said 'Now daddy we're going on a long car journey, so we want you to while away the time by telling us a completely new story, one that we have never heard before and without any delay. Please start now!'. This called for spontanaiety, it had to, and I just began off the top of my head: 'Once upon a time there were two rabbits, called eh, let me see, Hazel and Fiver, and I'm going to tell you about some of their adventures'. What followed was really the essence of Watership Down. -- source Adams has also directly answered questions about religious allegory in Watership Down: There's also been criticism of Watership Down about whether it has Christian symbolism or anti-Christian symbolisms. Well, I don't think there's any pro or anti-society in Watership Down, it's simply a tale. If I tell a tale there has to be some baddies as well as some goodies and there are several baddies in Watership Down. It's only a made-up story, it's in no sense an allegory or parable or any kind of political myth. I simply wrote down a story I told to my little girls. So you can put to bed once and for all after 30-odd years of debate that you weren't out to parody or parallel any religious concepts in Watership Down? Nothing like that at all. Of course it's true in Watership Down that rabbits have their own religion. They don't worship but they believe passionately in El-ahrairah, their sort of Robin Hood, they tell stories about El-ahrairah and there are lots of El-ahrairah stories included in Watership Down. -- ibid (bold emphasis mine) Finally, in a different interview published only last week (!), Adams acknowledged an important source for the ideas he used when writing Watership Down, as well as remarking explicitly that it's intended to be written in the spirit of folk tales. I think this is the answer you're looking for: SFS: How did the idea of the rabbits having a mythology begin? RA: Well, one of the happiest things that has happened to me is my friendship with Joseph Campbell. [...] SFS: How did you meet him? One of the epigraphs in Watership Down quotes his book The Hero With A Thousand Faces; had you met him already when you wrote it? RA: I'd bought The Hero With A Thousand Faces when it came out in 1949, and I read it straight through twice, and on and off ever since. Then, when I was in New York and had a day or two to spare, I discovered Joseph Campbell's address; he lived in Greenwich. [...] I told him how much I'd enjoyed it, and I told him all about Watership Down. SFS: What did he think of it? RA: Of course it's very like some of Joseph Campbell's stories; it was very much up his street. He thought it was marvellous! What he specialised in was folk tales, he knew all about folk tales. There's a 3-volume work, The Masks Of God, it's wonderful. He was by far the most interesting person I think that I've met in the course of my life. [...] The Hero With A Thousand Faces hit me like a bomb when I read it. I was in a great muddle at the time about my religious ideas, and trying to make sense of the cosmos. The Hero just sorted that out for me. Religious ideas made sense now; you could see how they occurred in similar format in all nations and all races. And the conception of the cosmos for the first time in my life made sense. Oh, it was a wonderful thing to know Joseph Campbell, and I re-read that book every now and then. SFS: Did it also influence the main narrative of Watership Down – the way in which Hazel becomes a rabbit hero; the way Fiver is really a shaman? RA: Yes, of course, it's closely modelled on the ideas of The Hero. Hazel, and Bigwig of course becomes very important as the book goes on – well they all do, Blackberry, Dandelion… Yes, I certainly owe that to Joseph Campbell. -- source (emphasis mine) So the final answer is that Watership Down was influenced strongly by The Hero with a Thousand Faces, which was a study of (as I believe Watership Down is also based on) many different myths and legends, with an emphasis on heroes and traditional folk tales. Note that even the names are similar: Campbell's ""Hero with a Thousand Faces"" becomes Adams's ""Prince with a Thousand Enemies""."
What is an epic and why is there “only one epic in English Language so far”?,"Since Milton is often discussed in the context of Renaissance literature, I'll quote the definition of ""epic"" from The Renaissance (edited by Marion Wynne-Davies, Bloomsbury Guides to English Literature, Bloomsbury, 1992): A narrative of heroic actions, often with a principal hero, usually mythical in its content, offering inspiration and ennoblement within a particular cultural or national tradition. John Milton wrote two works that fit this definition, namely Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained, thereby disproving the claim that he wrote ""the only epic composed in English Language"".
Another Renaissance poet, Edmund Spenser, wrote the epic poem The Faerie Queene (published in the 1590s). In addition, Wikipedia lists more than 40 epic poems in the English language, including the following: If a handbook claims that John Milton wrote the only epic poem in the English language, its author or authors are wrong. They may not be competent enough to write about the history of English literature."
Why do the witches in Macbeth rarely speak in iambic pentameter?,"The metre in Macbeth is already fairly irregular but the lines spoken by the Witches or ""Weird Sisters"" still stand out. In Act 1, scene 3, Banquo describes the witches as follows (quoted from Open Source Shakespeare): (...) What are these 
  So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
  That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth, 
  And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught 
  That man may question? (...) 
  (...) you should be women,  
  And yet your beards forbid me to interpret  
  That you are so. Based on their appearance, they clearly stand apart from normal human beings. Giving them tetrameter to speak instead of iambic pentameter carries over this ""weirdness"" into the verse. What's more, many (though clearly not all) of their lines also rhyme. This can be seen in the first examples quoted in the question. There are also a few examples in Act 1, scene 3, before the arrival of Macbeth and Banquo: I myself have all the other, 
  And the very ports they blow, 
  All the quarters that they know 
  I' the shipman's card.
  I will drain him dry as hay: 
  Sleep shall neither night nor day 
  Hang upon his pent-house lid; 
  He shall live a man forbid: 
  Weary se'nnights nine times nine
  Shall he dwindle, peak and pine: 
  Though his bark cannot be lost, 
  Yet it shall be tempest-tost. 
  Look what I have. Rhyme isn't just a bit of fancy dress for verse; it makes verse more memorable. It has even be argued that the rhyming tetrameters do not simply set them apart from the other characters but put them above nobility. (""Ordinary people""  speak in prose, noble characters usually speak in blank verse, while rhyming lines are normally reserved for a special purpose. See Why do the witches in 'Macbeth' speak in rhyme? on eNotes.)"
"In To Kill a Mockingbird, what does ""let the dead bury the dead"" mean?","In the book In To Kill a Mockingbird, Boo Radley (The one who killed Bob Ewell) and Tom Robinson are seen as ""mockingbirds"".  Atticus said previously in the book that it is ""wrong to kill a mockingbird as they do nothing for us other than sing their hearts out"". Heck Tate realizes that Jem didn't kill Bob Ewell but it was in fact Boo Radley. Heck already saw one innocent man have his life ruined because of the community
(Tom Robinson). Tom was killed because of pure racism and hatred in the white society and Heck knew that if the whole of Maycomb were to know Boo Radley killed Bob Ewell everyone would come and thank him and bring presents etc. Heck realizes that Boo does not like this kind of attention and he killed Bob Ewell out of pure kindness. Heck stated ""let the dead bury the dead"". He states that they should just say Bob Ewell fell on his knife while drunk and killed himself, but what he actually means is that we should let Tom Robinson (a man who was innocently killed) bury the dead (Bob Ewell, the man who played a massive part in the death of Tom Robinson). It is also a quote from Luke 9:60 in the Bible. It might also be that Heck feels that Bob Ewell's death cancels out the death of Tom Robinson. Even Scout the little girl realizes that its wrong to put Boo in the spotlight as she said to Atticus ""well Atticus, its a bit like shooting a Mockingbird"" hence the title of the book. ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", the mockingbirds in this book are all those who are persecuted by society as a ""malevolent phantom"" (Boo Radley) or as a ""negro"" (Tom Robinson) are Mockingbirds because Tom and Boo has done nothing other than help the community. Some other Mockingbirds might be Mayella Ewell who is abused by her father and forced to look after the many kids in her house to only get beaten by her father and forced to testify ""rape"" against Tom. ""Let the dead bury the dead"" is an old expression which originates from the New Testament. When a man wished to follow Jesus and become a disciple, he asked if he could first bury his father, who had just died. But, Jesus replied, Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom
  of God [Luke 9: 59-60] This response's meaning is that the man must not put earthly duties before spiritual ones. After the children are attacked by the reprobate Bob Ewell and Jem left arm is seriously injured, Atticus discusses the matter with Sheriff Tate, alluding to Jem's having to go to court and testify to what has occurred. ""Mr. Finch, do you think Jem killed Bob Ewell? Do you think that?"" In the ensuing argument between the two men, Heck Tate explains that Bob Ewell fell upon his own knife because he disbelieves what Atticus proposes, that Jem stabbed Ewell; furthermore, he sees no need to involve Jem in this matter of the death of the despicable Ewell. The honorable Atticus does not want Jem to lose respect for his father if he covers the truth for his son. But, Tate insists on giving his report of the incident. He tells Atticus that this is his town, and he knows everything that goes on. There's a black boy dead for no reason, and the man responsible for
  it's dead. Let the dead bury the dead this time, Mr. Finch. Let the
  dead bury the dead."" In other words, let Tom Robinson ""bury"" Bob Ewell as an act of poetic justice, and the incident will be taken care of; in this way, Boo Radley with his ""shy ways"" will not be exposed to the gossip and cruelties of the public. The town can ""move on"" from the repercussions of the trial as all the injustice connected to it will finally end. The dead will take care of the dead, and the living will go on living in their own ways. Otherwise, it would be like killing a mockingbird to bring Boo to court. Atticus finally understands the wisdom of Sheriff Tate and agrees with him. There is also an implication that the dead are dead and nothing can be done for them, so the living should continue with their lives and more worthwhile endeavors. In this case, allowing Boo Radley to not be drawn into the spotlight."
"Can anyone remind me who wrote this essay about qualifying remarks? (Mark Twain, maybe?)","The essay you're thinking of is possibly ""William Dean Howells"" by Mark Twain. Towards the end of the piece, he criticizes those who ape the greatness of Mr. Howells by attempting to imitate his ""stage directions,"" and succeed only in making their work boring by the meaningless repetition of the same few tired phrases. Here is the relevant passage: Mr. Howells does not repeat his forms, and does not need to; he can invent fresh ones without limit. It is mainly the repetition over and over again, by the third-rates, of worn and commonplace and juiceless forms that makes their novels such a weariness and vexation to us, I think. We do not mind one or two deliveries of their wares, but as we turn the pages over and keep on meeting them we presently get tired of them and wish they would do other things for a change. “... replied Alfred, flipping the ash from his cigar.” “... responded Richard, with a laugh.” “... murmured Gladys, blushing.” “... repeated Evelyn, bursting into tears.” “... replied the Earl, flipping the ash from his cigar.” “... responded the undertaker, with a laugh.” “... murmured the chambermaid, blushing.” “... repeated the burglar, bursting into tears.” “... replied the conductor, flipping the ash from his cigar.” “... responded Arkwright, with a laugh.” “... murmured the chief of police, blushing.” “... repeated the house-cat, bursting into tears.” And so on and so on; till at last it ceases to excite. I always notice stage directions, because they fret me and keep me trying to get out of their way, just as the automobiles do. At first; then by and by they become monotonous and I get run over."
Why does A Wind in the Door contradict A Wrinkle in Time on conformity?,"You make a lot of good points here. I would like to offer a slightly different perspective, though, that add something to this. To me, A Wind in the Door is all about growing up, which you touch on in your comments. I don’t see conformity as the real issue here, certainly not in the same way as in A Wrinkle in Time. In AWT, the crucial point is that IT was using force to elicit compliance and conformity from the residents of Camazotz for ITs own benefit – all taking, no giving. Camazotz no doubt represents Meg’s view of her experiences at school, but it also stands as a warning about what can happen, has happened, if certain parts of Man’s sinful nature are allowed to operate unchecked. This theme returns a couple of times in AWD. In AWD the issue, to me, is not so much that Sporos must conform to some vague cosmic plan, but rather that he needs to be true to his own nature. His task is to step up and take his own unique place in the world. The idea of a unique individual embedded in a social matrix is a major part of the message of AWD. It is first overtly stated in the scene where Jenkins, still unnerved by his Echthroi impersonators, realized “Nobody should be exactly like anybody else.” (chap. 7, p. 128) This stands in distinct contrast to the situation in Camazotz, where everyone was exactly alike, and highlights the difference between forced conformity and the natural order. The two examples are again contrasted in the final scene. On the one hand we have the adult fara Senex filling his role in the natural order. He helps the mitochondrion function properly, giving energy and life to Charles Wallace. In turn, Charles Wallace provides the environment where the farae can live and thrive. It is a mutually beneficial relationship, each serving the other. On the other hand is the immature farandola Sporos, who temporarily buys the Echthroi lie that he doesn’t have to, indeed shouldn’t, grow up. The young farandolae cannot fill an adult role, so they maintain a parasitic existence on the adult farae. In fact, so long as they are under the influence of the Echthroi they revel in their parasitism. It is all taking and no giving again, just like IT. But Sporos and the others cannot become other than adult farae; that is their nature. Their only options are either to become adults and take their place in the world, or remain parasites, kill their host, and die. Yet each is an individual, just as Senex is an individual. They will not be cookie-cutter replica farae. Each one will bring his own personality to his new role and make his unique contribution to the natural order. When Meg sees the situations beginning to look hopeless, she panics and falls back on her sinful nature. She is ready to invade the dance, grab Sporos, smack him around, plant his punk butt, and make him deepen. Senex stops her, saying, “Not that way. Not by force.” He might just as well have said, “No, Meg, that’s the way things work on Camazotz.” (Except he could not know of Meg’s experiences there.) Instead, Calvin, Meg, and Proginoskes get Sporos to see and understand the truth of the natural order. They “raise him up in the way he should go” so to speak. Fortunately for all, it works and Sporos leads all the delinquent farandolae to deepen and become adults, and Charles Wallace recovers. The key point is that Sporos made the transition voluntarily, based on his understanding of the natural order. He and the others then come into proper relationship with each other, their host, and the universe, as Proginoskes said. That it was voluntary is what makes the difference. That’s why there is not really a contradiction here. Instead, it is a contrast between people being forced into roles for which they are not naturally suited, like the little boy on Camazotz who was not very good at bouncing a ball, solely for the benefit of the coercive authority, and people who are true to their nature and take their unique place in the world in a web of mutually beneficial relationships. For L’Engle, the quality of one’s life is defined by the nature of one’s relationships. A lesson for our times, possibly even more so than when the story was first written."
Who does Mollie represent in Animal Farm?,"Before the rebellion, Mollie is a vain horse that likes eating sugar and wearing ribbons in her manes. (She has a lump of sugar at the time of the first meeting.) After the rebellion, she still wants to wear ribbons and she tries to avoid work (by showing up late and leaving early). She is very unlike Boxer, whose motto is, ""I will work harder."" In other words, she shows no real change in attitude after the rebellion. Eventually, she disappears; the pigeons later report that she has been seen wearing a ribbon and eating lumps of sugar. This shows again that she has not changed since the rebellion. Mollie represents those in Russian society who did not want to change for the sake of the Socialist cause, who wanted to keep the luxury they knew before the Russian Revolution and went into exile. This corresponds to many people in the Russian aristocracy and bourgeosie. However, she does not join something like a white émigré organisation, something that would have made sense if Snowball had joined her later. The fact that she is seen pulling a cart can be interpreted in two ways: There is one important difference between Mollie and the Russian aristocracy: the aristocrats fled Russia mostly in order to survive, whereas Mollie left Animal Farm before Napoleon and his dogs start killing suspected dissenters."
"Meaning/significance of ""All the King's horses"" in the Humpty Dumpty nursery rhyme?","The phrase ""The King's Horse"" is still in use today and is well understood. It refers to the mounted royal bodyguard, the Guards Regiments.  There are a number of Guards Regiments, hence the plural, Kings Horses. Anyone watching the recent Coronation on TV will have heard the expression in the commentary."
"Meaning of ""d-n"" in ""'T is strange—the Hebrew noun which means 'I am,' the English always used to govern d—n""","This is a very subtle piece of wordplay, so it makes for an excellent question. The meaning, believe it or not, is God, and your answer ""damn"". This is analysed in An Ingenious Jest in Byron's ""Don Juan"", a paper by John I. Ades in Papers on Language and Literature 24(4) (1988), p. 446. The Hebrew sacred name for God is YHVH, usually vocalized as ""Yahweh"" or ""Yahveh."" In Byron's day (as in many scholarly circles yet) it was thought that ""Yahweh"" derives from a form of the Hebrew verb ""to be"" used in Exodus 3:14-15, where, in reply to Moses's request for God's name, God replies, ""I am"". Thus, mutatis mutandis, the ""I am"" that Byron wittily asserts the English use to ""govern d--n"" is, of course, ""God""; producing the mild oath, ""goddamn."" We see here the extraordinary lengths to which Byron would go to set up a jest. In stanza XIV Byron neatly accomplishes three objectives: he displays his etymological wit, he trivializes Donna Inez's (Lady Byron's) learning, and he fixes a satirical barb in the hide of the English gentry for habitually taking the Lord's name in vain. In short: ""the Hebrew noun which means 'I am'"" is God, which is also used by the English to ""govern damn"" in the phrase god-damn. (Presumably it's damn, not darn as you guessed, to rhyme with ""I am"" in the previous line.) The interpretation of YHVH as ""I am"" is supported by the English Standard Version of the Bible itself, as reproduced here: The word Lord, when spelled with capital letters, stands for the divine name, YHWH, which is here connected with the verb hayah, “to be” in verse 14."
How big an impact did Lewis Carroll have on the English language?,"I could only find 7 words from Lewis Carroll's works in my copy of the Oxford Dictionary: Burbled — to bubble or gurgle (or a combination!) And burbled as it came! Chortled — a muffled laugh/snort combination He chortled in his joy. Galumphing — galloping in a triumphant manner He went galumphing back. Gimble — to grimace Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: Tulgey — thick, dense, or dark Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,   Vorpal — sharp or deadly, not common in mainstream english but quite common in RPGs and the fantasy genre The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! All of these are from Jabberwocky, you can read the full text here. Portmanteau — multiple words fused into one You see it's like a portmanteau—there are two meanings packed up into one word. Humpty Dumpty in Alice through the Looking Glass Curiouser — more curious “Curiouser and curiouser!” Cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English).” Alice in Alice through the Looking Glass I'm not sure this one counts, as it's regarded as a nonsense word by most dictionaries. Best to include it for the sake of completeness."
Is this a typo in my copy of The Hunchback of Notre Dame?,"Yes, it is an obvious typo, be for he. The original has: Cependant, tandis qu’il haranguait, la satisfaction, l’admiration unanimement excitées par son costume, se dissipaient à ses paroles; il haranguait translates to he was haranguing. Why every edition you've seen of the 1888 Isabel Florence Hapgood translation has this typo, I don't know. Presumably all of them derive from a typo in either one of the printed editions of this text, or (more likely) an uncorrected scanning error while digitizing the text. Digitized texts are often very poorly proofread. Other editions translate this sentence differently. From a couple of anonymous translations: While he was speaking, however, the universal satisfaction, nay, admiration, excited by his costume, was dispelled by his words. (Chapman and Hall edition, 1877) Unfortunately, the admiration and satisfaction so universally excited by his costume died out during his harangue. (Harvard Classics edition, 1917)"
"What is the deeper meaning of ""The Tyger""?","This answer is somewhat of a generalization of my self answer to Why did the stars throw down their spears? where I ended up analyzing most of the poem to explain the meaning of one particular, mystifying line. It's all based on my own reading and my meager knowledge of Blake's philosophy. Like the other poems from Songs of Experience, ""The Tyger"" has a paired partner from Songs of Innocence, ""The Lamb"". ""The Lamb"" talks about the creation of the gentle, innocent lamb with its soft, woolly coat and ""tender voice"", and at the end establishes a correspondence between the lamb and its creator: He is called by thy name,
  For he calls himself a Lamb:
  He is meek & he is mild,
  He became a little child:  The language used to describe the making of the lamb is simple and far more banal than the language used for the tiger: Little Lamb who made thee
           Dost thou know who made thee
  Gave thee life & bid thee feed.
  By the stream & o'er the mead;
  Gave thee clothing of delight,
  Softest clothing wooly bright;
  Gave thee such a tender voice,
  Making all the vales rejoice!   Essentially, ""Who gave you your life? Who told you to feed? Who gave you your wool and your voice?"" Even though ""The Tyger"" begins with a similar passage, enumerating the features of the tiger and asking who made them, there's a certain conceit to the language that has no parallel in ""The Lamb"", most obvious in the poem's fourth stanza: What the hammer? what the chain,
  In what furnace was thy brain?
  What the anvil? what dread grasp,
  Dare its deadly terrors clasp!   The tiger is described with military and industrial language. It was constructed in furnaces, on anvils, with hammers and chains and ropes (""And what shoulder, & what art, / Could twist the sinews of thy heart?""). Unlike the lamb, the tiger is a weapon of war, adapted for killing.  But even though we've just spent four stanzas wondering what immortal being could possibly have crafted a weapon of war as fearsome as the tiger, the fifth stanza suddenly admits the possibility that it was the same being who made the gentle and innocent lamb, ending with the line ""Did he who made the Lamb make thee?"" The last stanza repeats the first stanza, but this time instead of asking who ""Could frame thy fearful symmetry"", it asks who ""Dare frame thy fearful symmetry"". The narrator is implying that God, who made the Lamb, is perfectly capable of also creating the Tiger, but wonders that he dared to do it.  On a deeper level, the pair of ""The Lamb"" and ""The Tyger"" can represent a person attaining an adult, intellectual understanding of God and the nature of the world. God loves the little children, his little innocent lambs frolicking in their fields and knowing not how to do evil. To them ""He is meek & he is mild"". He is the God of love from the New Testament, who ""calls himself a Lamb"" and ""became a little child"". But the adult is closer to the tiger, capable of war, killing, and sin more broadly; and sometimes sinful adults meet the Old Testament God who smote Sodom and Gomorrah, the vengeful and destructive force who ""smiled his work to see"" when ""the stars threw down their spears / And water'd Heaven with their tears"".  The second stanza also offers some support for this reading: In what distant deeps or skies.
  Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
  On what wings dare he aspire?
  What the hand, dare seize the fire?   It sounds a lot like the myth of Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods to give to humans. Fire was the beginning of furnaces, hammers, anvils, chains, and the other industrial paraphernalia that are mentioned later, so attaining fire was the moment humans became able to create weapons of war to become like the tiger. But attaining fire in the Promethean story also has some resemblance to the fall of Adam and Eve in Christianity; it was a sudden event in which humans gained something originally reserved for gods, and became a little bit like gods themselves, ""growing up"" in a sense. It's a common trope in Christian thought that children live in an Edenic, sin-free state and don't fall and become sinful until they grow up, so growing up is linked via the fall of Adam and Eve to attaining fire.  In other words, God, in one of his moods as the vengeful God who punishes sinners, created the tiger, a fearsome creature of war. Humans, after the fall of Adam and Eve, gained the same capacity for vengeance and war, but doing so opened them to being smitten by the vengeful God in turn. The story of how the tiger was created represents this concretely with attaining fire as the fall of Adam and Eve and the industrial tools that fire enabled for creating weapons and wreaking destruction representing the sin that humans became capable of. By realizing that God created the fearsome tiger as well as the gentle lamb, a person can gain an adult, nuanced understanding of God by comprehending His dual nature."
What is a bootless oath?,"From the Merriam-Webster Dictionary: useless, unprofitable
a bootless attempt So we can replace the word bootless like this: The oath he swore was useless, but it made Dolon more keen on going. The oath didn't mean anything, but it made him more keen anyway. The way I'm understanding it, it's saying that it won't be kept. As Rand said, I'm not explaining why it won't be kept, because I'd need to actually have the book with me ;). But from what you quoted, it appears that the text - whoever the narrator is - is saying that the oath won't be kept. Perhaps it wasn't a strong enough oath; perhaps the person making it doesn't have the power to carry it out. But whoever the narrator is doesn't think that the oath will carry any weight. But, despite this, it makes whoever it was directed to more confident in what they are doing."
What is so satanic about Manchester?,"Often with a Pratchett joke, if I don't 'get it', it is worth asking myself what Pratchett knew that I didn't, and the text often gives me a clue where to start looking. And the same applies here, though I don't know which text is Pratchett and which Gaiman.  Fourteenth-century minds, the lot of them. Spending years picking away at one soul. Admittedly it was craftsmanship, but you had to think differently these days. P/G point us at a time period and associated quality and tell us that the mindset is out of date.
If craftsmanship is dated, what replaces it? Mass industrial production. And where was one of the cradles of the Industrial Revolution? Manchester.  Friedrich Engels was the son of a German manufacturer and worked as his agent in their factory in Manchester. Here he developed his strong social conscience from his real experience of the city. This resulted in his work The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844, in which he writes: Such is the Old Town of Manchester, and on re-reading my description, I am forced to admit that instead of being exaggerated, it is far from black enough to convey a true impression of the filth, ruin, and uninhabitableness, the defiance of all considerations of cleanliness, ventilation, and health which characterise the construction of this single district, containing at least twenty to thirty thousand inhabitants. And such a district exists in the heart of the second city of England, the first manufacturing city of the world. If any one wishes to see in how little space a human being can move, how little air - and such air! - he can breathe, how little of civilisation he may share and yet live, it is only necessary to travel hither. True, this is the Old Town, and the people of Manchester emphasise the fact whenever any one mentions to them the frightful condition of this Hell upon Earth; but what does that prove? Everything which here arouses horror and indignation is of recent origin, belongs to the industrial epoch. I think the fact of Manchester's history is enough to explain Crowley's satisfaction with it, but the highlighted quote underlines the connection that P/G may have been making. Pratchett's later works Dodger, Snuff and Raising Steam all have strong themes of social justice and reinforce the idea that he would be familiar with Engels' work.  A couple of potentially corroborative details: One of the worst areas was called 'Angel Meadow'; Engels translated to English is 'angels'; Crowley and Aziraphale are, of course, angels.  All of which leads me to conclude that this mordant reference isn't really a 'joke'."
What does a dog barking at a crow signify?,"It doesn't appear to be symbolic at all; a dog barking at a crow is merely an annoying sound that she would rather listen to. Crows are notorious for teasing other animals. I mean... look at this! In the above linked video, the crow is hanging around behind a dog, who's tied up, and repeatedly going and pecking the dog with it's beak and dashing away. It just keeps bothering the dog. Presumably the dog is barking at the crow, but the crow doesn't leave. Beatrice is taking an example of an annoying sound, and saying that she would rather listen to that then the man's declaration of love. She's giving a very clear message - I don't love you. Here's a video of a dog barking at a crow. The crow is just staying there, while the dog continues to bark."
Ogden Nash poem on hiccups,"My guess: ""Can I Get You a Glass of Water? or, Please Close the Glottis after You"" by Ogden Nash. which I found on pp. 34-35 of an old hardcover Ogden Nash collection titled You Can't Get There From Here. It's probably the wrong answer, because it's about coughing rather than hiccups and features the word glottis rather than epiglottis. I'm posting this answer anyway because it's the best match I've been able to find, and because identification requests sometimes have misremembered details. Here is the full text of the poem (emphasis added): One trouble with a cough,
It never quite comes off.
Just when you think you're through coughing
There's another cough in the offing.
Like the steps of a moving stair
There is always another cough there.
When you think you are through with the spasm
And will plunge into sleep like a chasm,
All of a sudden, quickly,
Your throat gets tickly.
What is this thing called a cough
That never quite comes off?
Well, the dictionary says it's an expulsion of air from the lungs with violent effort and noise produced by abrupt opening of the glottis,
To which I can only reply, Glottis — schmottis!
Not that I reject the glottis theory, indeed I pride myself on the artistry
Of my glottistry.
But there is a simple definition with which I freely present you:
A cough is something that you yourself can't help, but everybody else does on purpose just to torment you."
How can the inscription on AURYN be interpreted?,"The German version reads Do what you want (Tu Was Du Willst). The ambiguity could exist in German as well with Tu Was Du Wünscht, albeit that would be a less common phrase and kids probably had trouble understanding it. The quote that follows the inscription (chapter M, p.199 in my edition): [...] Wichtig war allein, dass die Worte die Erlaubnis, nein, geradezu die Aufforderung ausdrückten, alles zu tun, wozu er Lust hatte. Important was only that these words allowed, no, almost demanded him to do anything he felt like doing. Sadly, this takes away the ambiguity. However, as the translator has changed the translation (wish instead of want), he made the deliberate choice to include the second interpretation you are referring to, and I personally find that interpretation compelling storyline, it’s just a bummer that Ende didn’t include the ambiguity on a word level. But as the focus of the second half of the Never-Ending Story lies on the issue of becoming a world dominator being able to do whatever one wishes, I wouldn’t say that Ende neglected or refuted the interpretation. He simply overlooked the possibility [citation needed]. That’s my interpretation, though."
"Looking for an old O. Henry story about a wealthy young man trying to woo a ""genteel poor"" young lady in New York City","The story is called The Discounters of Money. It occurs in the collection of O. Henry stories called Roads of Destiny. It occupies pages 379 to 384 in this book. …and there you have young Howard Pilkins with 4,000,000; and a good fellow at that. He was an agreeable, modestly arrogant young man, who implicitly believed that money could buy anything that the world had to offer. […] One evening Pilkins went down to the red brick house in Gramercy Square, and made what he thought was a proposal to Alice v. d. R.  Alice, with her nose turned down, and thinking of his money, considered it a proposition, and refused it and him. Pilkins, summoning all his resources as any good general would have done, made an indiscreet references to the advantages that his money would provide. That settled it. The lady turned so cold that… […] “You’ve forgotten,” said Alice v. d. R., with a little smile. “It was a long time ago when our families were neighbours. You were seven, and I was trundling my doll on the sidewalk. You have me a little gray, hairy kitten, with shoe-buttony eyes. Its head came off and it was full of candy. You paid five cents for it—you told me so. I haven’t the candy to return to you—I hadn’t developed a conscience at three, so I ate it. But I have the kitten yet, and I will wrap it up neatly to-night and send it to you tomorrow.” And the event with the park bench and cold night etc. happen exactly as you described in the question. [In case you're curious: I found this by looking for ""The Complete Works of O. Henry"" on the Internet Archive, then downloading the plain text version, and searching through the entire text first for ""park"" (gave up after a few occurrences), then for ""bear"" and finally for ""candy"" which led to this.]"
What are the nets in Ender's Game? Are they based on anything in real life?,"'Nets' are basically the Internet as predicted/guessed by Orson Scott Card It is interesting to note that the World Wide Web, the modern form of the Internet, was not invented until 1990, 5 years after Ender's Game was published. Orson Scott Card accurately predicted how much influence the nets would have, years before they became a daily part of people's lives. Source While there’s plenty of time for Internet discussions to turn around, I suppose, I can’t help but think that Card wasn’t terribly prescient with this prediction. In Ender’s Game, “the nets” are democratic and participative — anyone can join them, as long as they have the intellect to keep up — but there’s no problem with too much noise, trolls, spammers, and plain old stupidity.

How old is Romeo?,"Shakespeare's main sources for Romeo and Juliet were There is no evidence that Shakespeare read any of the French or Italian sources for this story, such as Pierre Boaistuau or Matteo Bandello. In Brooke's narrative poem, Juliet is sixteen years old (""At sixteen years I first did choose my loving fere,"" she says), while in Shakespeare's play, her mother says, ""[s]he's not fourteen"" (Act I, scene 3). Brooke does not mention Romeus' age. Near the beginning of the poem, he introduces him as One Romeus, who was of race a Montague,
  Upon whose tender chin, as yet, no manlike beard there grew, so he's probably not much older than Juliet. According to Painter, who follows Boaistuau, he is of the age of .20 or .21 years Both Brooke's and Shakespeare's Romeo seem younger than this. Based on Romeo's and Juliet's relative maturity, I would argue that Shakespeare's Romeo is not much older than Juliet. In the introduction to the New Cambridge Shakespeare edition of Romeo and Juliet (second edition, 2003), G. Blakemore Evans writes, Critics have often pointed out that Juliet is a stronger personality than Romeo and that she wins through an almost frightening maturity more quickly. We sense this in her poised and playfully serious exchange with Romeo at their first meeting (1.5) and it is underscored in the famous window scene (2.2), where she shows herself more thoughtful, prudent and realistic than Romeo, though no less deeply engaged, in sensing the tragic threat involved in such 'sudden haste': (...) (He then goes on to quote Act II, scene 2, 116-220: ""Although I joy in thee, ..."")"
Was Wolf Hall originally written in the first person?,"In an interview with the New Yorker, she explained that she consistently called him ""he"" because that fit better with the way the book is written than using his name would. She said this made the text more ""intimate"". See the following quote (emphasis mine): And can you explain why Cromwell is often the only character who is referred to with the pronoun “he”? As Joan Acocella points out, you often violate grammar for Cromwell’s sake. I’m behind his eyes, so Cromwell is always “he.” Occasionally, there is an ambiguity, and the “he” could refer to somebody else, and I think that’s just the price you pay. To keep calling him Cromwell wouldn’t fit with the way the book is written. Although it’s written in the third person and not the first person, it’s actually more intimate than many third-person narratives. It’s as if the camera is on his shoulder. In another interview with the Guardian, Mantel described how she started writing the book. Regarding the present tense and the person's views (again, emphasis mine): I woke one morning with some words in my head: ""So now get up."" It took a while to work out that this was not an order to get the day under way. It was the first sentence of my novel. Wolf Hall attempts to duplicate not the historian's chronology but the way memory works: in leaps, loops, flashes. The basic decision about the book was taken seconds before I began writing. ""So now get up"": the person on the ground was Cromwell and the camera was behind his eyes. The events were happening now, in the present tense, unfolding as I watched, and what followed would be filtered through the main character's sensibility. And regarding why she said ""he"", she expanded slightly on what she meant by ""intimacy"" in the text: He [Cromwell] seemed to be occupying the same physical space as me, with a slight ghostly overlap. It didn't make sense to call him ""Cromwell"", as if he were somewhere across the room. I called him ""he"". This device, though hardly of Joycean complexity, was not universally popular. Most readers caught on quickly. Those who didn't, complained. After a quick search, I found the book contains the word 'he' over 5541 times, 'his' over 2906 times, 'him' over 1581 times and 'himself' over 329 times. But the book only says 'Cromwell' 374 times, and that includes chapter titles and so on. There is no doubt this is purposeful, after all the book contains 187,240 words. 'he/him/his/himself' makes up 5.5% of the words in the book ('he' alone just under 3%), while 'Cromwell' makes up less than 0.2%. Quick comparison: 'Harry' makes up 2% of all words in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. These facts can be found by opening up a pdf of the book online (note that the pdf itself is illegal, but reading it is not) and using 'Ctrl+F' to find words in the book. I used this pdf here. Note for words like 'he' you need to add spaces either side to define it as a word, otherwise words like 'the' will be included as it contains the letters 'he' in that order. This does means instances such as ""he,"" won't be included however, though I have now updated the above stats to try and include as many of such instances as possible. She wrote it in the third person, and always referred to Cromwell as ""he"" because that was what fit best with the way the story was being told - she felt that he was with her when writing the story."
Did Harper Lee intend Go set a Watchman to be published?,"If one would believe Joe Nocera, former op-ed columnist for The New York Times: No. In an article titled The Harper Lee ‘Go Set a Watchman’ Fraud (July 24, 2015 - the book was published on July 14, 2015), Nocera claims that this is a money grab from Lee's current protector, Tonja Carter. Harper Lee: The Sadness of a Sequel (February 3, 2015) in The Atlantic notes: Harper Lee, née and known to those close to her as Nelle, spent the
  majority of her life not wanting Go Set a Watchman to be published.
  Or, at least, she has spent the majority of her life telling the media
  that she didn't want Go Set a Watchman to be published. This isn't the first instance of controversy after Carter took the reigns. A biography of Lee by Marja Mills also ran into trouble. How Unauthorized Is the New Book About Harper Lee? from Gawker (July 18, 2014): Things formally went sour in 2011. It was a transition year for the
  aging sisters, for one thing. Alice Lee, who had practiced law past
  her 100th birthday, finally retired in December and went into a
  nursing home herself after a bout of pneumonia. It seems clear that
  over the course of the year she'd been handing off the reins of her
  law firm to a younger partner, Tonja Carter. Earlier that year, in April, Mills had finally sold her book. When the
  sale was announced, Penguin Press (an imprint at Penguin Random House)
  described the book as having been written with the participation of
  both Lee sisters. But shortly thereafter, that same month, a statement
  bearing Harper Lee's name reached the press: Contrary to recent news reports, I have not willingly participated in
    any book written or to be written by Marja Mills. Neither have I
    authorized such a book. Any claims otherwise are false. Mills seems to have been caught off guard by this. She already had in
  hand a statement from Alice Lee dated more than a month earlier, in
  which Alice confirmed both her participation in the project and her
  sister's. Alice Lee passed away about 8 months before Go Set a Watchman was published. All said and done, it looks very fishy."
"A girl, told that it's wonderful to live in Wales, goes off to live in a whale","After some searching around Google Books and the internet in general, I believe it's the above short children's story, first published in The Spider's Palace and Other Stories. The best synopsis I can find is from this blog post (emphasis mine): In the first story, “Living in W’ales,” “Once there was a man who said he didn’t like the sort of houses people lived in, so he built a model village. It was not really like a model village at all, because the houses were all big enough for real people to live in, and he went about telling people to come and Live in W’ales.” This man becomes a pied piper, leading everyone away to W’ales, including a little girl and a dog who get lost along the way and, seeing a whale, ask to be allowed to live in it. Here is a quote from the story itself (found through Google Books): So they went along till they came to the sea; and in the sea was a whale. The litde [sic] girl said, ""That was what he meant, I suppose, when he talked about living in Wales [sic]. [...]"" (Both instances of [sic] indicate potential OCR errors, as I haven't been able to read these sentences off the actual pages, but only from Google's transcribed search results.) From the little information I can find about the book it's not clear whether the story actually has anything to do with Wales, though. The story also appeared in Fun in Bed for Children: First Aid in Getting Well Cheerfully by Virginia Kirkus and Frank Scully, published in 1935, which is where I first found it, and again in The Wonder Dog: The Collected Children's Stories Of Richard Hughes, published in 1977."
"What did ""Moloch"" represent in Allen Ginsberg´s poem ""Howl""?","The first and second parts of Howl are, in a way, a question and an answer. One cannot read the terrible things that happened to real people and not think, ""Why were these brilliant thinkers driven to madness? What could make a man jump off a bridge, unloved and alone, before despairing of even the certainty of death? What could make someone drink themselves to death? What in the name of sanity could drive people to tear their clothes in protest in the streets?"" As Ginsberg himself asks later on, What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination? Moloch. Moloch is the answer to all of these questions, and the others which Ginsberg convinces us to ask as we read Howl, Part I. In its original incarnation, Moloch was a child-sacrifice-demanding god who would strike fear into worshippers' hearts. It is, then, no surprise that he was the choice to describe the social and industrial machine that Ginsberg believed was devouring his generation. Those intellectuals had done nothing wrong, yet vices and society were killing them. So what, specifically, is Moloch? I encourage anyone who desires to answer that question to read Part II, over and over. Every word, every sentence, every plea has the essence of the hell the author sees around him. Yet in the chaos, several repeated themes arise. Cold metal and steel crush humanity's individuality, as each worker is forced to sacrifice their own thoughts and minds for the sake of industrial efficiency. Anyone who has seen Fritz Lang's Metropolis may recall the shock the protagonist, Freder, feels when he witnesses the workers moving precisely in unison to ensure that the gigantic machine, Moloch, continues to run. The horrifying scene that follows explores the view of an outsider realizing for the first time what workers must sacrifice for the good of humans as a whole: Their own humanity. There are, of course, quite a few lines which support this symbolism: Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose skyscrapers stand in the long streets like endless Jehovahs! Moloch whose factories dream and croak in the fog! Moloch whose smoke-stacks and antennae crown the cities! Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! . . . Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Robot apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton treasuries! blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! Ginsberg views Moloch as the antithesis of his generation. Its ""mind is pure machinery"" while the artists and writers of the Beat generation are the exact opposite. Its ""love is endless oil and stone"", cold and deathly, while the love of a human is soft and gentle (see also the sex in Part I, to some extent). Its gods are skyscrapers and factories, quite unlike most modern-day religions. It's quite easy for members of my generation, young and collectively blind, to consider the Beat generation and the counterculture movement to be two aspects of the same underlying societal response. The onset of American involvement in the Vietnam War seems to be our image of the anti-war movement in the 1960s. Indeed, we do see some references to what may be the scorning of individuality and free thought in the military in several lines: Boys sobbing in armies! Moloch the vast stone of war! At the same time, there are general references to government and the enforcement of social norms. Part III of Howl is largely about the psychiatric confinement of Carl Solomon in mental institutions, but the same theme pops up in Part II. Some general anti-government, anti-authority phrases are Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch the stunned governments! spectral nations! invincible madhouses! It's clearly not evident from these lines alone what some of these phrases mean, but I'm a bit more convinced from Part III. The entire poem needs to be taken into account to understand any part of it. Ginsberg's work is an attempt to throw off the shackles of the societal Moloch, to shout against it, and thus defy and destroy it. However, he cannot. He decries ""Moloch whom I abandon!"", but he cannot abandon it, because the madness is inside him already. I'd like to point you do two consecutive lines: Moloch in whom I sit lonely! Moloch in whom I dream Angels! Crazy in Moloch! . . . Lacklove and manless in Moloch! Moloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body! Moloch who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy! Moloch whom I abandon! Wake up in Moloch! Light streaming out of the sky! It is one thing to be destroyed by society, and it is another thing entirely to destroy yourself. Think back to Tuli Kupferberg, who jumped off a bridge, or  Bill Cannastra, decapitated while drunkenly jumping out a subway window, or any other member of that generation who nearly reached death by their own hands. They drank and they lived wildly and they stuck their heads in ovens, and it is so easy to just blame Kupferberg and Cannastra and Carr and the others for what was, or was almost their ruin. But it wasn't their fault. The agony, the anger, the frustration, the madness was thrust upon them by their experiences with society, and even afterwards, it stuck with them. Emotional turmoil drove them to self-destruction, yet its seeds came from without, not within. Moloch was inside them all."
Does an answer to the Sugar Bowl mystery exist?,"In an interview on the Unfortunate Associates podcast, Handler maintains that a solution does exist, and that approximately one reader a year writes to him with the correct solution. Here's the transcript, beginning at 50:30 minutes into the audio (emphasis mine): Daniel Handler: You know, it's interesting to me because I keep -- and perhaps we'll see during this calendar year if it will be different -- but every year exactly one reader writes to me and says, I've figured out what is in the sugar bowl, because of this reference and this reference and this reference, and they've completely figured it out. And so I'm proud that I've made an obscure enough mystery that no-one seems to grasp it, but it's still graspable. At one per year. B (host): And they're right? The people who write in, they're right? You agree that there's a thing? Handler: Oh yeah. Many people have theories that are wrong. No, I mean, there's definitely an answer. There's some mysteries that don't have a clear answer in my head, but-- B: If I were to guess, would you say I was right? Handler: I'll ask you this. If you were to guess if I'd tell you if you were right or not...? The interview is from January 2017, soon after the first season of the Netflix TV adaptation was released. Of course, it's possible he's still just being perverse, and pretending a solution exists. But he seems perfectly candid, so it seems likely we can take his word for it."
"What did Dante mean by ""Papè Satan, papè Satan aleppe"" in the Inferno?","There are a nauseatingly numerous amount of theories on what that illustriously ambiguous line could mean. It very well might have merely been invented by Dante to represent a sort of invocation (and legibility is not usually the most overwhelming of necessities when clucking one's lips on an Invocation). The chant most likely refers to the Triumph of Satan. It is screeched forth by Plutus, Roman god of wealth, and the underground mines therein. To Dante, Plutus is characterized as a verminous watcher to the Fourth Circle of Inferno. The Fourth Circle being the punishment of overindulgence in wealth and gluttony in the acts of greed, hence the guardian of the circle is fittingly Plutus. 'Popoi Satan, popoi Satan! Alezorul!'
So Plutus—shrill voice clucking on—began.
(Canto 7, Inferno, Kirkpatrick translation) Now whether that opening line is cried out in content, misery, or anger: more likely anger as the lines following reads thus: Be silent, thou accursed wolf
Consume within thyself with thine own rage. That is beside the point of attempting to translate the line.—
Although our worshipful William Blake made Plutus look rather wretched in his fitful madness:
 Here is the line in original ""Italian"": ""Pape Satàn, pape Satàn aleppe!"",
cominciò Pluto con la voce chioccia; And here is the line cut from an early 1487 edition of La Divina Commedia (it was first published in 1472, so this is quite an early printing, and thus it may be assumed it is quite authentic to Dante's initial choice of words for the line):
 My only note on analyzing this early printing of the lines is the thought-provoking idea on why the ""s"" (a medial ""s"" in this printing) is not Capitalized. Why satan (ſatan) and not Satan? This at first might leave no interest-spurring idea to it, but once noticing that Pluto (the name ""Plutus"" was commonly used interchangeably with ""Pluto""--even in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar) is indeed capitalized-- why not then Satan? According to Wikipedia, breaking down the words to their earliest meanings could bring you to this understanding: (1.) The word ""papé"" (or ""pape"") might be a rendering of Latin papae, or from Greek παπαί (papaí). Both words are interjections of anger or surprise, attested in ancient authors (comparable to the English ""damn!"", or just ""oh!"").           (2.) The word ""aleppe"" could be an Italian version of the word for ""alef"", the Hebrew letter א (a) (compare Phoenician alep and Greek alpha) The consonant shift here is comparable to that in Giuseppe, the Italian version of the name Joseph. In Hebrew, alef also means ""number one"" or ""the origin that contains everything"". It may also be interpreted as a metaphor for the ""head"", ""the first and foremost"". This was an attribute for God in late medieval expressions, meaning ""the majesty"" (of God). ""Alef"" was also a medieval interjection (like ""Oh God!"").
(3.) The word ""Satan"" comes from the Hebrew word הַשָׂטָן (ha-Satan), which translated literally means ""the adversary"". The meaning of the words then becomes, ""Oh (papé), our foremost (aleppe) enemy of God/demon (ha-Satan), as aleppe is the first letter of the alphabet (aleppe)!"", which is ""Oh, Satan, o Satan, god, king!"". Thus, the sentence would be a mixture of Greek and Latin. But thereafter there is an exceptional amount of further theories coined by numerous scholars throughout the centuries of the Divine Comedy's fame. (See here under Possible Explanations.) My favorite of the explanations has always been the Hebrew Theory, as the contradiction to the words of The Christ and the blasphemy represented therein seems like something Satan would pleasure in quite luxuriously indeed: Some commentators claim that the sentence is phonetic Hebrew, ""Bab-e-sciatan, bab-e-sciatan, alep!"". This would be the opposite of the sentence that Jesus spoke in the Gospel according to St Matthew 16:18, ""...and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it"". The meaning of this utterance would be that Hell (Satan) has conquered. (Source: WIKIPEDIA) Another intriguing translation is by Domenico Guerri who put forth a more simple understanding: ""Satan Oh, oh God Satan."" Here is another short essay on the subject of the line's ambiguity written quite delightfully. It may be found in the blogpost Canto VII: Pape Satàn, pape Satàn aleppe!: And speaking of that opening line: no one knows what the hell it means. It’s not Italian. It’s the fourteenth century equivalent of Nell-speak. (And God bless the poor sap who had to transcribe Jodie Foster’s gibberish for the closed-captioning. [typing]Gai’ainja! Gai’ainja! Tai tai, spay fo nay![/typing] “Dude, I’m out. I’m going to do something easier than this, like naming Pokemon monsters or writing speeches for Michele Bachman.”) The gist of it is: Plutus, the moster guarding the entrance to the Fourth Circle, is yelling something to the effect of “Get out of here, poet!” and Virgil is having none of it, so he defeats Plutus by chanting at him. (Taci, maladetto lupo!/consuma dentro te con la tua rabbia; “Silence, accursed wolf! Let your fury feed itself inside you.” And then, a little later, we’re told tal cadde a terra la fiera crudele; “so fell that cruel beast to the ground.”) Lastly, here is a rather insightful footnote worth considering. Found in the Dante Lab at Dartmouth College: Plutus, the god of wealth in classical myth, wishes to prevent the passage of this living soul through Satan's kingdom. That, at least, is what we must surmise from Virgil's reaction, vv. 4-6, which assuages Dante's fear. (...)
Pape Satàn, Pape Satàn, aleppe. The third verse suggests that Virgil understands these words spoken by Plutus. If that is correct, he is perhaps the only one to have done so. Over the centuries a continuing debate addresses, rather confusedly, the precise nature of these five words: whether they are part of a recognizable language or not; whether they are totally meaningless or have some meaning; whether they are an invocation of the power of Satan against invading Dante or an oath giving expression to the monster's surprise at the presence of a living soul in hell. For a review of the question see Hollander (Dante and Paul's “five words with understanding,” Occasional Papers, No. 1, Center for Medieval and Early Renaissance Texts and Studies [Binghamton, NY: Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 1992]), who sees this and Nimrod's similarly nonsensical five words (Inf. XXXI.67) as parodic inversions of the five words of clear speech called for by St. Paul, concerned about the over-reliance of the faithful on speaking in tongues (I Corinthians 14:19). Plutus's oath may be garbled speech, but it does contain 'pseudo-words' that have meaning: Pape represents either a Latin interjection (papae) of admiration, as many ancient commentators think, or/and a debased form of the Italian and Latin for 'pope' (papa – see Inf. VII.47: papi); Satàn would fairly clearly seem to be a form of the Italian 'Satana' or of the Latin 'Sathanas' and thus 'Satan'; aleppe, as some of the first commentators noticed, is the Italian form of the Hebrew word for the first letter of the alphabet, 'aleph,' as in the Latin expression 'alpha ed omega' (the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, signifying 'the beginning and the end'), as God defines Himself in the Bible (Apoc. 1:8, repeated at Apoc. 21:6 and Apoc. 22:13). If one had to render these nonsense words in English one might say something like 'O Pope Satan, my god.' Fortunately, one does not have to. For the connection of these words in mixed language to those in the first verses of the seventh canto of Paradiso (there, naturally, totally positive in tone and meaning) – the parallelism is certainly striking – see Gian Roberto Sarolli, Prolegomena alla “Divina Commedia” (Florence: Olschki, 1971), pp. 289-90. Lorenzo Renzi (“Un aspetto del plurilinguismo medievale: dalla lingua dei re magi a 'Papé satan aleppe,'” in Omaggio a Gianfranco Folena, ed. Pier Vincenzo Mengaldo [Padua: Editoriale Programma, 1993]), pp. 61-73, presents evidence for a possible connection between instances of glossalalia in French medieval plays, some of which come from the mouths of pagan deities, and Dante's polyglot phrase here and in Inferno XXXI.67."

"Is the haiku in ""You Only Live Twice"" by Bashō?","Bashō never wrote that haiku. The haiku is not listed on PoemHunter or in his list of works on Wikipedia, which starts to seem suspicious, but then I found authoritative confirmation at MI6 HQ: The title of ""You Only Live Twice"" comes from a haiku (or poem) included in the Ian Fleming novel on which the film is based. It goes: ""You only live twice. Once when you are born. And once when you look death in the face."" In the novel, the poem is written by James Bond for his friend Tiger Tanaka. Due to a badly-worded attribution at the front of the novel, the poem is sometimes incorrectly believed to have been written by a Japanese poet called Matsuo Basho (See: Bashô Matsuo.) It is clarified in the novel that is should not be considered a haiku at all i.e. it is a poor attempt at writing poetry by Bond after being taught how to do so. The novel and it's epigraph explain that the haiku is ""after Basho"" i.e. written in the style of the famous 17th Century Japanese poet. Surprisingly, the haiku has been attributed to Bashō throughout the mainstream media, including The Telegraph and (as you stated in the question) Time, although the phrasing looks so similar that I could imagine one of the articles being 'inspired' by the other. I'd be interested to know if anyone has a copy of the attribution referenced on MI6 HQ's site to see whether it is ambiguous; unfortunately, I don't have a copy, but I can say with a reasonable amount of confidence that Fleming wrote the haiku and did not intend to attribute it to Bashō."
Was the clue to who Panama Oxridge really is ever found?,"I don't know whether any clues were hidden in the Thyme books themselves, but the website for the series contains an elaborate puzzle whose solution is the author's real name. As mentioned by @Shokhet in comments, you can see the start of the trail here: Start by running your cursor over the Thyme clan badge in the bottom left-hand corner of 47 web pages. Each one will reveal a different number and a letter of the alphabet. Simply write the letters in numerical order to discover your first clue. From here I started on a long journey through the website, collecting 47 different links with alphanumeric codes which finally led me to this page and the next level of the puzzle. At that point, I decided that this would get solved more quickly as a group effort, and so I posted the whole thing to the wonderful Puzzling SE, where @Sp3000 very competently finished off the solution. You can read through the answers on Puzzling for the full derivation of the solution, but it's easy to check by just going to this page and submitting paul and adshead into the two boxes, which takes you to a page where the first letter of each sentence spells out PAUL ADSHEAD."
What does the last sentence in chapter 2 of Crime and Punishment really mean?,"When Rodion says he could be wrong, he means his words for the previous sentence: Hurrah for Sonia! What a mine they've dug there! And they're making
  the most of it! Yes, they are making the most of it! They've wept over
  it and grown used to it. Man grows used to everything, the scoundrel! So he says that man must be a scoundrel to accept the fact that their own daughter works as a prostitute in order to support the family. And if that doesn't mean that man is the scoundrel, if that is acceptable in the world of man, then there is no morality at all, and all the notions of good and bad are just superstitions produced by fear. And there are no barriers. That's how I understand this passage."
How did Ursula Le Guin translate the Tao Te Ching / Dao De Jing?,"Le Guin collaborated with James P. Seaton, professor emeritus of Chinese at UNC-Chapel Hill, who has translated other classical Chinese works (e.g. The Wine of Endless Life: Taoist Drinking Songs from the Yuan Dynasty.) She worked on her version for forty years, starting with Paul Carus' 1898 edition which listed Chinese characters side by side with English words. She used that as a sort of Rosetta Stone to correlate with other editions and translations, working slowly over the years. But Le Guin was adamant about not calling this book a translation. She is very familiar with that art, holding an undergraduate degree in Renaissance French and Italian Literature (from Harvard/Radcliffe) and a masters in French (from Columbia). She translated numerous works, particularly from Spanish to English. Le Guin told interviewer Hélène Escudié in 2002: I don't really call it a translation because I don't know Chinese. It is a version built up from all the other English versions, and a couple of French ones, and the Chinese word for word translation, and a lot of help from my collaborator who does know Chinese, ancient Chinese."""
Why do Jem and Scout call their father Atticus?,"Lee does this to paint the whole Finch family as unconventional, reflecting upon the abnormal characters of Atticus, Jem, and Scout. In southern Alabama during the 1930's, society isn't very progressive, shown by the townspeople's negative attitudes towards African Americans. Similarly, in this setting, society expects children to address their parents with respect. It is within this society that the dynamic character of Atticus Finch is developed. In contrast to the other townspeople, Atticus is highly educated and progressive, defending the rights of the unrepresented. He wants his children to grow up with a forward-thinking mindset, just like him, questioning the world's opinions through rational thought and reason. Thus, one step towards doing this is to address their father as equal, showcasing Atticus's belief that all men are equal, regardless of age, gender, or race.

How much experience does Mark Haddon have with the autism spectrum?,"Mark Haddon has spoken about this on his website: unsurprisingly, i'm often asked to talk about asperger’s and autism or to become involved with organisations who work on behalf of people with asperger’s and autism, many of whom do wonderful work. but i always decline, for two reasons: 1) i know very little about the subject. i did no research for curious incident (other than photographing the interiors of swindon and paddington stations). i’d read oliver sacks’s essay about temple grandin and a handful of newspaper and magazine articles about, or by, people with asperger’s and autism. i deliberately didn’t add to this list. imagination always trumps research. i thought that if i could make Christopher real to me then he’d be real to readers. i gave him some rules to live by and some character traits and opinions, all of which i borrowed from people i know, none of whom would be labelled as having a disability. judging by the reaction, it seems to have worked. He's also said that he didn't consider the idea of autism specifically to be important to his story: 2) curious incident is not a book about asperger’s. it’s a novel whose central character describes himself as ‘a mathematician with some behavioural difficulties’. indeed he never uses the words ‘asperger’s’ or ‘autism’ (i slightly regret that fact that the word ‘asperger’s’ was used on the cover). if anything it’s a novel about difference, about being an outsider, about seeing the world in a surprising and revealing way. it’s as much a novel about us as it is about christopher. labels say nothing about a person. they say only how the rest of us categorise that person. good literature is always about peeling labels off. and treating real people with dignity is always about peeling the labels off. a diagnosis may lead to practical help. but genuinely understanding another human being involves talking and listening to them and finding out what makes them an individual, not what makes them part of a group. i passionately believe this and i’ve said it repeatedly in many different forms. to become a spokesperson for those with asperger’s or autism, or to present myself as some kind of expert in the field, would completely undermine this, and make me look like a fool into the bargain. i would much rather spend my time writing more novels, standing up for difference and trying to understand outsiders who see the world in surprising and revealing ways. (All emphasis is mine in the above quotes; the capitalisation is his.) The usual caveat that authors aren't always telling the truth about their work does apply here, but I believe this probably is true. Claiming that he hadn't done any research when in fact he had would be a very strange thing to do; I would expect the other way round to be much more likely.

Interestingly, I also found an article written by someone who actually had Asperger's Syndrome, which criticises Haddon's portrayal and says it's unrealistic: WARNING: THIS BOOK WILL NOT HELP YOU UNDERSTAND REAL AUTISTICS Mark Haddon did not use the word ""autism"" in his book, let alone claim to portray autism accurately. He even spoke publicly against using his book as an autism textbook. Certainly, he was not at fault. I have nothing against Mark Haddon or his work. In fact, I finally understood enough about non-autistic people to enjoy it in 2006. However, seeing that the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time has became very popular, I feel that I must explain why it should not to be taken seriously when many people (including teachers and autism professionals) recommend it as reading material on autism. Instead of a fictitious novel, I recommend reading real autism reference books by authors like Dr. Temple Grandin and Donna Williams. They have many accurate and useful first-hand insights on autism. While reading the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, I noted that Christopher is highly self-aware, and could articulate his thoughts so clearly. This was very different from my own experience. At his age, I was still mostly in a state of sleepwalking. I was unaware of my own emotions, body and situational awareness. I had Asperger's Syndrome and was very high functioning. I went through normal schooling without any help, medication or trouble with the school authorities. The lower-functioning people with autism probably have even less self-awareness than me. However, Mark Haddon could not have had a story if Christopher could not able to convey to us what is happening within him. Thus, his depictions of Christopher's inner state are used to advance his story and interest viewers. They are not meant to represent the autistic consciousness. This writer goes on at length about the differences between Asperger's Syndrome in reality and the way it's portrayed in The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, including by analysing several passages from the book. I'm not going to quote all of that here, but suffice it to say that it definitely supports Haddon's claim of having pretty much no real experience of the autism spectrum."
"Meaning of the ""quips"" from Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita","Here is the same paragraph in Russian: Произошло подсчитывание, пересыпаемое шуточками и прибаутками Коровьева, вроде «денежка счет любит», «свой глазок — смотрок» и прочего такого же."" [link] I initially presumed these were Russian sayings of some sort They are but, as you said - they are of the sort that is not expected to be found in ""A Collection of Russian Sayings"" type of books (for English speakers). Probably not considered important enough, so this is why you ""can't find any references to them as such"". I presume, in any language there are such ""quips"" that all the natives immediately recognise, use and understand but they can't be found in any dictionaries. For example, in English people say ""Better out than in"" (often used when someone accidentally burps or pukes). Well, Koroviev's utterances are of that sort. As to the meanings of those utterances - the translation is correct. Albeit, it does not convey the subtle nuances of the language as happens with most (if not all) translations.
The use of ""денежка"" instead of ""деньги"", ""глазок"" instead of ""глаз"": diminutive suffixes is a feature of Russian, not present in English. Well, the use of ""Johnny"" instead of ""John"", ""doggie"" for ""dog"", and the like is close, but in Russian this ""language tool"" is more flexible and more widely used to convey the subtleties. Those suffixes give a Russian native reader an additional sense of ""non-seriousness"" of Koroviev: he acts and talks in a deliberately jocular way, even overplays (again - deliberately), because his ultimate goal is to con Nikanor Ivanovich into making a deal with him, the deal that smells 'dodgy'. Judging from this excerpt, the translator did a fairly good job: «свой глазок — смотрок» rhymes in Russian and the translator put it as ‘Your own eye won’t lie’, which also rhymes. Not bad at all. and what are they supposed to imply in the context of this scene Not easy to explain because, being a native Russian, I just ""know"" but never actually needed to explain this to an English native. I'll give it a try, though. So, these ‘Cash loves counting’, ‘Your own eye won’t lie’ are being said during the process of ""counting-up"" the cash that Koroviev just handed to Nikanor Ivanovich and, in this context and situation, the expressions have an implication, which I can only put as ""You'd better count the money carefully. Never trust anyone when it comes to money, right? And you, Nikanor Ivanovich, know this only too well - you cheated people at every opportunity yourself when it came to money"", etc.
In other words, Koroviev uses the expressions that Nikanor Ivanovich himself has been using as his sacred principles all his life. (For those not familiar with the book - Koroviev is not a human, he accompanies Satan (Woland), so he can ""read"" humans inside out.) A few more details came to mind, maybe this is what the OP wanted in the first place: ""денежка счет любит"" (""cash loves counting"") - in various forms this expression is still widely used in modern Russian. The refined meaning is ""Money is something you have to be accurate with, you need to count it to make sure everything is in order"". Actually, having read it again - ""cash loves counting"" I would change to ""cash loves being counted"", so maybe not such a good translation after all. «свой глазок — смотрок» (""Your own eye won’t lie"") - although easily understandable by natives, the expression is hardly ever used these days. Very colloquial, lots of similar (in style) expressions can be found in Russian traditional fairy tales and proverbs. ""Смотрок"" is a made up word, you won't find it in a dictionary, derived from the verb ""смотреть"" (""to look, to watch"") in a form rhyming with ""глазок"" (diminutive form of ""an eye""). The meaning is something like ""You can only trust what you can see with your own eye(s)"". There might have been a second part of this expression (typical for Russian sayings), which is omitted in this text and I'm not aware of it. Apparently, the proverb in its full form can be found in ""В.И. Даль. Пословицы русского народа"" (Vladimir Dahl ""Proverbs of the Russian people""): ""Свой глазок - смотрок. Не верою, а видением."", as well as in the ""Большой русско-английский фразеологический словарь"" (""The large Russian-English Phraseology Dictionary""), where one can also find the same quote from Bulgakov in a slightly different translation: ""...[Коровьев] выложил председателю пять новеньких банковских пачек.
Произошло подсчитывание, пересыпаемое шуточками и прибаутками
Коровьева, вроде ""денежка счёт любит"", ""свой глазок - смотрок"" и
прочего такого же (Булгаков 9) Не [Koroviev] stacked five bundles of
new bank notes before the chairman. There was a careful count,
interspersed with Koroviev's little quips and pleasantries, such as
""money loves to be counted,"" ""your own eye is the best spy,"" and so on
in the same vein (9a)."" The second part of the proverb (""Не верою, а видением."") means ""Seeing is believing""."
What does Dostoyevsky mean by 'propaganda' in Crime and Punishment?,"The word ""propaganda"" at that time was not understood the way we tend to understand it today.
It is more or less safe to understand it based on its etymology, i.e. based on the verb ""propagate"" - propaganda: ""A concerted set of messages aimed at influencing the opinions or behaviour of large numbers of people."" - just remove the ""large number of people"" from this modern definition. Dostoyevsky, or, rather, Svidrigailov uses this fancy word to express the idea that the girl tried all the ways she could think of (""even tears!"") to get what she wanted. PS. Unfortunately, all the links that I have to support my claim are in Russian. I'm not sure it makes much sense to provide them here. I'm adding this one (PDF file) just in case. Updated An excerpt from the original goes like this: Раз, после обеда, Авдотья Романовна нарочно отыскала меня одного в аллее в
саду и с сверкающими глазами потребовала от меня, чтоб я оставил
бедную Парашу в покое. Это был чуть ли не первый разговор наш вдвоем.
Я, разумеется, почел за честь удовлетворить ее желанию, постарался
прикинуться пораженным, смущенным, ну, одним словом, сыграл роль
недурно. Начались сношения, таинственные разговоры, нравоучения,
поучения, упрашивания, умаливания, даже слезы, — верите ли, даже
слезы! Вот до какой силы доходит у иных девушек страсть к пропаганде! And the second occurrence is: Тут я опять сглупил.
Пустился грубейшим образом издеваться насчет всех этих пропаганд и
обращений; Параша опять выступила на сцену, да и не она одна, — одним
словом, начался содом. I think I should add here that the word ""пропаганда"" (propaganda) here feels slightly odd even for a native Russian speaker. I can't really judge how this was perceived at the time the book was written. I suspect that it still did sound weird even then - so it might be a detail of the Svidrigailov's character. He uses some ""fancy words"", the meaning of which he might not be actually sure of."
What's the significance of Faust's meeting being on Easter Day?,"While Easter sure comes with a significant religious meaning, it seems to be distinctly its more earthly and mundane aspects that are emphasised in Faust. Though, the connections to resurrection aren't there for nothing either and surely intertwined with its less religious importance. If we take a look at the situation when we're introduced to Easter, through the Easter bells ringing right when Faust is about to end his life, we see that Faust himself doesn't care too much about the religious aspects either, they only remind him of the experiences that are beyond his reach: Rather than that, it makes him recall the memories of his youth, where he was still striving full of energy and free from the hopeless realization of scholarly impotence that he's facing now: This relates back to his earlier mournings of reaching a dead end in his studies and in what we are able to learn and know. We see this also in his earlier conversation with his student Wagner, a ""bookworm"" par excellence, where he looks down cynically onto Wanger's optimism towards gaining knowledge from reading the thoughts of past researchers who came to the same hopeless realization that Faust is facing. He basically has lost his will to strive and experience (and ultimately to live) for there is nothing to gain anymore, and the Easter bells are calling back that youthfull naiveté and optimism to some degree. And you'll notice how he says that it's ""spring's idle holiday"". It is the mundane qualities of Easter as a social holiday and the beginning of spring that calls him back to life, not the sublime religiosity that only proclaims spheres he can't and won't reach anyway. This is strengthened by the following scene at the city gates, where we first see all kinds of merry folk going about their holiday business, as well as in the ""Osterspaziergang"", one of Faust's most famous monologues while he walks the streets with Wagner. It sets off by classic natural descriptions of spring's awakening and winter's retreat, while then juxtaposing that with the social awakening of civilization from winter's drabness: The same how spring reinvigorates nature as well as humanity, the same it reinvigorates some of Faust's life spirits, be it only the more mundane spirits realizing that there is more in life than just knowledge. This can be seen as well in relation to his ealier struggles that contrast the gaining of knowledge and ascension into higher spheres with his clinging to the enjoyment and experience of earthly life: So to sum up, to me Easter here, by marking the return of spring as well as in its significance as a joyful holiday, serves as both a reinvigoration of Faust's spirits and his nature to strive as well as a reminder of the mundane qualities of life and the merits of experience and enjoyment contrasted to  studying and book-based knowledge which Faust feels to have wasted his life on. And this in turn might just bring him into the proper mindset for a fruitful temptation by Mephisto. I won't claim the above explanations to be the end of the story, though. I'm far from an expert on the topic and all that is based on a reread inspired by the question. I'm sure this has been studied time and time again and there might be more to Easter's significance under the hood. And even when seeing this angle of spring and revitalization, the connection to Christian resurrection isn't too hard to draw, in fact the very words of the work already do that (neither would the celebration of Jesus's resurrection at the very beginning of nature's be entirely coincidental in the first place). The English translation presented here was taken from the website Poetry in Translation."
"Why does Meursault kill ""the Arab"" in The Stranger?","Initially, there isn't much. The final words of Part I read this: I wanted to hear the murmur of its water again, to escape from the sum and the effort and the women's tears, and to relax in the shade again. But when I got nearer, I saw that Raymond's Arab had come back. He was alone. He was lying on his back, with his hands behind his head ... As far as I was concerned, it was all settled and I'd gone there without even thinking about it. As soon as he saw me, he sat up lightly and put his hand in his pocket. pg. 58-59 There was a bit of a defensive mood at this point in the story. You have to remember that Meursault had simply gone with his friends for a day on the beach. Two Arabs were seemingly following them. Prior to these paragraphs, these Arabs had already engaged in a bit of a fight with Meursault and his friends, with one of them having slashed his friend with a knife. Moving on... (emphasis mine) I took a few steps towards the spring. The Arab didn't move. Even now, he was still some distance away... I waited. The sun was beginning to burn on my cheeks, and I felt drops of sweat gathering in my eyebrows. It was the same sun as on the day of my mother's funeral, and again it was my forehead that was hurting me most and all the veins were throbbing at once beneath the skin... I took a step, just one step forward. And this time, without sitting up, the Arab drew his knife and held it out towards me in the sun... All I could feel were the cymbals the sun was clashing against my forehead and, indistinctly, the dazzling spear still leaping up off the knife in front of me. It was like a red-hot blade gnawing at my eyelashes and gouging out my stinging eyes. pg. 59-60 This passage is also interesting. Meursault was undoubtedly under the sun, and it was affecting him. The parallel between the sun and his mother's funeral is also somewhat significant. At his mother's funeral, he was largely alone and almost kept to himself. He also defied many societal standards related to his mother's funeral. The passages in these pages offer that parallel. Meursault wants to keep the peace within him, and he doesn't want anyone around him. The presence of the Arab disturbed him. When the Arab drew his knife, it disturbed this peace, bringing about provoking actions: ... That was when everything shook... The sky seemed to be splitting from end to end and raining down sheets of flame. My whole being went tense and I tightened my grip on the gun. The trigger gave, I felt the underside of the polished butt and it was there, in that sharp but deafening noise, that it all started. I realized that I'd destroyed the balance of the day and the perfect silence of this beach where I'd been happy. And I fired four more times at a lifeless body and the bullets sank without leaving a mark. And it was like giving four sharp knocks at the door of unhappiness. pg. 60 These passages provide a direct narrative for what directly instigated the act. Meursault may not have been completely conscious of his act.  But what I find interesting is the last sentence. You see, this novel is largely about existentialism. Albert Camus, the author, was an existentialist. The murder came as a shock - here we are looking at the life of an absurd man. He doesn't necessarily follow social norms, he's not married... etc. Earlier in the chapter, he said: When Raymond handed me his gun, the sun glinted off it... I realized at that point that you could either shoot or not shoot. pg. 57 You can shoot or not shoot. It doesn't matter. If someone is murdered or not, the world doesn't care. The theme of existence is largely at play. Whatever happens, it doesn't matter. No matter how you look at it, there is not a reasonable explanation for Meursault's actions. It conveys the theme of existentialism, as well as the title of the book overall - Mersualt is an outsider in the way that he defies the laws of society. You see this most notably in his trial, where he shows remorse, and is ultimately convicted not because he committed the murder, but because he doesn't live up to what society wishes."
"What does ""The Edge of Doom"" mean?","Your reading of the poem makes sense. It might help to know that the dark trees are symbolizing the future in this poem. The second line tells us that these trees rarely show a breeze. This means that we cannot predict the future.  In the fourth line, Frost expresses his wish that those dark trees in the first line were stretched away to the edge of doom. This means that he hoped that the future is stretched far away. So, the edge of doom means here far away (in time). This seems consistent with your view, since it is also used in that way in the sentence you quoted, ""Our marriage will last unto the edge of doom"".  Based on: Analysis of ""Into My Own"". "
Is Winston Smith in Orwell's 1984 an unreliable narrator?,"Winston is the only character whose point of view we have access to in the novel, a necessary precursor for the potential of an unreliable narrator. After all, without an external perspective, we can never be sure what he's not telling us, nor whether the context in which he presents the information is accurate. Take, for example, the way he blames himself for his mother's fate. He tells Julia: Do you know, that until this moment I believed I had murdered my mother? Until this point, his mother has only appeared in hazy recollections and in bizarre dreams in which she (and his sister) are trapped in a pit while he is at the top. Later in the story, it is implied that she was taken by the party because she refused to conform to their ideals. However, the lack of detail makes it difficult to be certain. It seems plausible that Winston may be hiding something, perhaps downplaying or omitting his own role in the eventual fate of his family. You can apply a similar thought process to other characters. Syme, for example, seems to exhibit a level of intelligence that Winston enjoys but which he clearly perceives as a potential threat to the party. Syme later disappears, and we are given no further detail. Has Syme been taken by the party apparatus, or has Winston reported him? Did he, in fact, even exist, or is he an invention of Winston's terrified mind? Without external validation, we cannot be certain. Likewise, we are asked to take at face value Winston's feeling that he is rare, perhaps even unique, in his free thinking. He regularly judges those around him as brainwashed partisans, unthinking victims of the party's propaganda. It never seems to occur to him that just as he is terrified of revealing his opinions and secrets, everyone else might be in the same position. One could make a similar argument, perhaps, about any novel which is narrated by a single character and which contains any loose ends. Winston, however, has potential motivations to be unreliable. His conditioning under the totalitarian state will have primed him to keep secrets. The stress of his existence in such an awful world may have driven him mad. The biggest reason we might suspect Winston's reliability, though, is made clear at the conclusion of the novel. - spoiler ... Winston is brainwashed by the party and learns to love Big Brother ... meaning we can no longer be certain of the accuracy of anything he has said, in the entire novel."
Why does Anne Frank have so many admirers at school?,"The biography by Melissa Muller (Bloomsbury, 1999), based on information from relatives and friends, states that Anne was always popular and assertive at school, and not good at concentrating (which may have meant she was more aware of what the boys were up to). In 1942 there were 12 girls and 18 boys in her class, so the relatively small number of girls could have meant that they all attracted more attention?"
Are keteks based on some form of real-life poetry?,"Palindrome poems have been around for a while. They're sometimes called ""mirror poetry"".  A similar form is the reverse poem, where the poem takes on an opposite meaning when read backwards. Those are usually on a line-by-line rather than word-by-word basis, which means you don't have to play as many games about ""verb forms"". The specification of ""five distinct smaller sections, each of which makes a complete thought"" is not specifically familiar, though it's not really well exemplified here. The five sections in the example are pretty incomplete as thoughts. Structurally, it sounds similar to a bookshelf poem: Make this poem entirely out of book titles. You can use more than one
  in a line if you want, and add or take away punctuation to make it
  flow, but you can’t chop them up or miss out words! The title can be
  anything you want. That link dates from 2012; and the novels you mention date to 2010. I believe that bookshelf poetry dates back further than that, and it doesn't appear to be original to that contest, but I don't have evidence of older instances.   I do know of an older example with chapter titles. Isaac Asimov's 1972 The Gods Themselves is divided into three parts: Against Stupidity
The Gods Themselves
Contend in Vain   Together, they are a line from Friederich Schiller's verse poem, Die Jungfrau von Orleans. "
"Is there any deeper significance to the Borges story ""The End""?","It turns out Recabarren was a political figure in Chile who was imprisoned for 8 months. As you will recall, the setting of the story is in Latin America. The loss of voice could be a reference to being silenced politically, and connected to the black guitarist as a symbol of the oppressed classes, where ""Iron War"" might be taken as the brutality of industry in suppressing workers, which sometimes backfires and leads to leftist rule. It turns out that Martin Fierro is itself a political and social allegory in the form of an epic poem. There is a great quote in the John Sayles film ""Matewan"" where Chris Cooper, as a labor organizer, says ""All I see is workers fighting workers"" in response to a management tactic to divide workers by inciting racial strife, and referencing WWI. This may shed light on the cyclic nature of the struggle as presented in this story, where it ends with the one man as victor, but prefigures his own, eventual overthrow."
"Why did the author of The Dictionary of the Khazars publish a ""male"" and ""female"" edition, and what's the significance of the textual differences?","Short of publicity stunts, there's not really anything clear-cut as to the differences.  However, it's likely a publicity stunt due to this: This is the MALE EDITION of the Dictionary. The FEMALE edition is almost identical. But NOT quite. Be warned that ONE paragraph is crucially different. The choice is yours. This is the little paragraph on my copy of this book.  I only have the male edition. But according to google, the female edition is the same with swapped gender words. This is probably a gimmick, though you can definitely read something into it. Sorry to just quote something, but this page has the best summary of it I could find. I wrote this answer, looked up what other people said, and then decided to include this quote: Gender stereotypes are at work here, the aggression expressed in the male edition countered by the more emotionally marked reaction in the female edition. The difference between the two attitudes is all the more remarkable since they emanate from the same person, Dr. Dorothea Schulz. The determining difference is Dr. Schulz’s decision to read the Xeroxed sheets in the male edition, and not to read them in the female. The former course leads to dismay, and the hopelessness of any redemption; the latter to serenity and an expectation of harmony.   TL;DR of this answer: There are definitely gender stereotypes here, of a more violent male passage vs a gentle female one. However, it's also a different resolution of the narrative. You can think of it as saying ""gentleness will lead to a better end"", but again it's unclear if this is what the author intended.   It's also highly likely it was just a publicity stunt. Heck, if you even asked this question it sorta worked.  Who knows, maybe the author intended people to read stuff into it that he didn't write."
"In Brave New World, If Lenina is a beta, why does she wear green?","There are a couple of possibilities, some of which are also touched on in the answers to In Brave New World, what caste is Lenina Crowne? I'm listing them in what I think is decreasing order of probability. The colour associated with the Beta caste is only stated once in the whole story, in a throwaway line in Chapter IV (emphasis mine): Like aphides and ants, the leaf-green Gamma girls, the black Semi-Morons swarmed round the entrances, or stood in queues to take their places in the monorail tram-cars. Mulberry-coloured Beta-Minuses came and went among the crowd. The roof of the main building was alive with the alighting and departure of helicopters. 'My word,' said Lenina, 'I'm glad I'm not a Gamma.' Perhaps either this use of the word ""mulberry"" was a mistake, or the author forgot it when describing Lenina's green outfit (although the latter is mentioned more than once). Perhaps the higher castes are not so strictly required to wear only the appropriate colour for their caste. As a Beta, perhaps Lenina has a little more latitude in clothing colour - presumably so long as it's not the same colour as one associated with another caste, so a different type of green from the Gammas' ""leaf-green"" might be acceptable. It's never mentioned explicitly which caste Lenina belongs to, although it can be more or less deduced that she is Beta. But whether that's Beta-Plus or Beta-Minus is another question, and it's just possible that the two may have different associated colours. The ""mulberry"" quote only refers to Beta-Minuses, after all. Possible but perhaps unlikely, since only one colour is mentioned for each of the other castes. ""Mulberry"" referring to a green colour? Two answerers on Quora seem to think ""mulberry"" means green, one of them saying ""Lenina wears bottle green shorts, which is close to the mulberry green colour. Thus, the readers know she is Beta."" and the other asserting that ""While mulberry today indicates a deep red, there is a colour called “mulberry green"" that's very close to old dark green bottles."" However, I couldn't find any evidence that this is actually true: I could only find mulberry green as a brand of the company Mulberry, which definitely postdates Huxley. And there are other mistakes made by the answerers on that Quora page, so definitely take this with a pinch of salt."
Why did Montresor want to kill Fortunato?,"The cask of Amontillado is the description of a murder by the murder himself, Montresor. As you have noticed, information about the motive for the crime is very scarce in this short story. There is no such thing as a third party in the story, who could express some kind of neutral point of view. Or more specifically, there is no external view except the reader's one. Some hypotheses can be made Montresor: ""The Montresors,"" I replied, ""were a great and numerous family.""
  Fortunato: ""I forget your arms.""
  M: ""A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent
   rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.""
  F: ""And the motto?""
  M: ""Nemo me impune lacessit."" ¹ And as Montresor feels that he has been harmed by Fortunato...  The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could ... he then tries to take revenge. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack All of Montresor's accusations against Fortunato are fuzzy, so he may also be mad. Finally, an original theory was emitted by Cecil L. Moffitt. She noticed that Fortunato, despite being presented as a connoisseur of fine wine, claims some incorrect things about wine: F: ""Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry."" while Amontillado is actually a type of Sherry. An oenophile (or more likely an insane oenophile) like Montresor might have some evil plans after that. ¹ ""No one attacks me with impunity"""
Do all old stars get their own private island and a magical buffet table?,"When a star is old enough and has lost enough power, it can go to one of the islands on the Eastern Ocean.  While there, it recovers its strength and becomes young again by eating ""fire-berries"". ""When I set for the last time, decrepit and old beyond all that you can reckon, I was carried to this island. I am not so old now as I was then. Every morning a bird brings me a fire-berry from the valleys in the Sun, and each fire-berry takes away a little of my age. And when I have become as young as the child that was born yesterday, then I shall take my rising again (for we are at earth's eastern rim) and once more tread the great dance."" Voyage of the Dawn Treader, Chapter XIV: The Beginning of the End of the World So when he's recovered, he'll go back to being in the sky. It's kind of like a sabbatical for stars. Also, stars can come down for other reasons and still be fully able to fly in the sky. ""Even in your world, my son, that is not what a star is but only what it is made of. And in this world you have already met a star: for I think you have been with Coriakin."" ""Is he a retired star, too?"" said Lucy. ""Well, not quite the same,"" said Ramandu. ""It was not quite as a rest that he was set to govern the Duffers. You might call it a punishment. He might have shone for thousands of years more in the southern winter sky if all had gone well."" So it's not really a retirement, it's more of a temporary break. And the last quote implies that stars prefer to be in the sky versus on the ground, because Coriakin was punished with coming down. For those who don't remember, the duffers were the (for a time) invisible and one-legged creatures.  Coriakin was supposed to be guiding them. Finally, it's also unknown what punishment merits a star coming down. ""What did he do, Sir?"" asked Caspian. ""My son,"" said Ramandu, ""it is not for you, a son of Adam, to know what faults a star can commit. But come, we waste time in such talk. Are you yet resolved? Will you sail farther east and come again, leaving one to return no more, and so break the enchantment? Or will you sail westward?"""
"Is the fight between Mercutio and Tybalt a joke, or is it serious?","I suspect Zeffirelli was commenting on the transition between boyhood and adulthood in the context of consequences, and how easily a simple mistake can have severe implications. (Compare to teens drunk driving--it's all fun and games until someone dies.)  Zeffirelli's scene is played as teenage boy, full of bluster, having fun in the traditional male pastime busting on their rivals.  The fatal blow is sudden and unexpected.  Reality and adulthood comes crashing down, just like it will for Romeo and Juliet. Despite the extravagant staging of the Luhrmann, the reality of the teens he presents is much more serious.  John Leguizamo's portrayal of Tybalt, as I recall, is much more straightforward, focusing on his rage and viciousness.  It's possible Luhrmann was commenting on gang culture of the time, but more likely that his choice for the scene is in service of a very straightforward adaptation focused on the raw passion of youth.   Part of what makes dramatic literature so resilient is the range of interpretation that can be applied by actors, directors and dramaturges across every generation and production.  Thus, no one interpretation is ever definitive or absolute.  Both scenes work within the context of the films they are a part of. "
"Is calling Queequeg a ""cannibal"" meant to imply he literally consumed human flesh?","Queequeg was indeed a consumer of human flesh. The relevant passage comes from Chapter 17, which describes Queequeg's religious fasting. I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o’clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening. “No more, Queequeg,” said I, shuddering; “that will do;” for I knew the inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were sent round with the victor’s compliments to all his friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys. Moby Dick, Ch. 17. ""The Ramadan"" Whether or not it was common  in 19th century to indiscriminately refer to all foreign tribespeople as ""cannibals"", Melville explicitly characterizes Queequeg as a genuine cannibal."
"How much ""self-editing"" did Nabokov do when his Russian novels were translated into English?","Nabokov sometimes used translations into English as an opportunity to touch up his work, but sometimes he didn't. Below are a few case studies. Maybe the best example of Nabokov making changes is Laughter in the Dark, the author's rewrite of Winifred Roy's 1935 translation of the Russian Kamera Obskura. Colapinto has a piece in the New Yorker called How Nabokov Retranslated ""Laughter in the Dark"" (2014) which describes the changes Nabokov made to Roy's translation. It turns out that Nabokov worked directly from Roy's translation in composing Laughter. Here are just some of the changes that Nabokov made: He changed all the character names. He added the early film scene which foreshadows the book's end. He changed the age of the heroine from Roy's ""seventeen or eighteen"" to sixteen. He substantially re-worked the opening to increase its speed. (This includes adding the memorable passage about the animated Bruegel painting and changing the mechanism by which Axel Rex is introduced). He made minor changes to imagery (such as adding the imagery of the ""frozen wave"" of carpet to the final scene). He changed the mechanism by which Albinus discovers Margot's infidelity (which involves replacing the character of Segelkranz with Udo Conrad). It's clear from Laughter that at least sometimes Nabokov used translations as an occasion to substantially touch up his work. That said, in the 1970 foreword to his translation of Mary (with Michael Glenny), Nabokov explicitly declares that he did not make any substantial changes to the work. He writes: I realized as soon as my collaboration with Mr. Glenny started that our translation should be as faithful to the text as I would have insisted on its being had that text not been mine. Revampments of the lighthearted and highhanded order that I used for the English version of, say, King, Queen, Knave could not be envisaged here. The only adjustments I deemed necessary are limited to brief utilitarian phrases in three or four passages alluding to routine Russian matters (obvious to fellow-émigrés but incomprehensible to foreign readers) and to the switch of seasonal dates in Ganin’s Julian Calendar to those of the Gregorian style in general use (e.g., his end of July is our second week of August, etc.). Nabokov may have left Mary alone, but he does admit in the above passage that he made ""revampments of the lighthearted and highhanded order"" to King, Queen, Knave. In fact, he admits as much also in the foreword to that book, where he writes: By the end of 1966, my son had prepared a literal translation of the book in English, and this I placed on my lectern beside a copy of the Russian edition. I foresaw having to make a number of revisions affecting the actual text of a forty-year-old novel which I had not reread ever since its proofs had been corrected by an author twice younger than the reviser. Very soon I asserted that the original sagged considerably more than I had expected. I do not wish to spoil the pleasure of future collators by discussing the little changes I made. Let me only remark that my main purpose in making them was not to beautify a corpse but rather to permit a still breathing body to enjoy certain innate capacities which inexperience and eagerness, the haste of thought and the sloth of word had denied it formerly. Within the texture of the creature, those possibilities were practically crying to be developed or teased out. I accomplished the operation not without relish. The “coarseness” and “lewdness” of the book that alarmed my kindest critics in émigré periodicals have of course been preserved, but I confess to have mercilessly struck out and rewritten many lame odds and ends, such as for instance a crucial transition in the last chapter where in order to get rid temporarily of Franz, who was not supposed to butt in while certain important scenes in the Gravitz resort engaged the attention of the author, the latter used the despicable expedient of having Dreyer send Franz away to Berlin with a scallop-shaped cigarette case that had to be returned to a businessman who had mislaid it with the author’s connivance (a similar object also figures, I see, in my Speak, Memory, 1966, and quite properly, too, for its shape is that of the famous In Search of Lost Time cake). I cannot say I feel I have been losing time over a dated novel. Its revised text may soften and entertain even such readers as are opposed, for religious reasons no doubt, to an author’s thriftily and imperturbably resurrecting all his old works one after the other while working on a new novel that has now obsessed him for five years. But I do think that even a godless author owes too much to his juvenilia not to take advantage of a situation hardly ever twinned in the history of Russian literature and save from administrative oblivion the books banned with a shudder in his sad and remote country. Lastly, I should like to mention an apt quote from the foreword to Invitation to a Beheading, where Nabokov explicitly describes his urge to emend his previous work.  He writes: If some day I make a dictionary of definitions wanting single words to head them, a cherished entry will be “To abridge, expand, or otherwise alter or cause to be altered, for the sake of belated improvement, one’s own writings in translation.” Generally speaking the urge to do this grows in proportion to the length of time separating the model from the mimic; but when my son gave me to check the translation of this book and when I, after many years, had to reread the Russian original, I found with relief that there was no devil of creative emendation for me to fight. My Russian idiom, in 1935, had embodied a certain vision in the precise terms that fitted it, and the only corrections which its transformation into English could profit by were routine ones, for the sake of that clarity which in English seems to require less elaborate electric fixtures than in Russian. My son proved to be a marvelously congenial translator, and it was settled between us that fidelity to one’s author comes first, no matter how bizarre the result. In this passage Nabokov confesses his desire to emend his earlier writing, while also observing that he found no need to change Invitation. In conclusion, sometimes Nabokov used translation as an occasion to make drastic changes (as in Laughter in the Dark and King, Queen, Knave), but sometimes he didn't (as in Mary and Invitation to a Beheading)."
How does Room 101 reset for each person who enters?,"Seems it was indeed a false recollection, my mistake.  The cold-faced young officer stepped into the cell. With a brief movement of the hand he indicated Ampleforth. ""Room 101,"" he said...What seemed like a long time passed. Two pages later, Parsons used the lavatory, loudly and abundantly. It then turned out that the plug was defective, and the cell stank abominably for hours afterwards. Parsons was removed. More prisoners came and went mysteriously. One, a woman, was consigned ""Room 101,"" and, Winston noticed, seemed to shrivel and turn a different color when she heard the words. And finally, two pages after that,  With a small gesture the officer indicated the skull-faced man. ""Room 101,"" he said. This all seems to imply that at the very least a 5-6 hours, which I'd assume is enough to reset and remodel the room, passed between each of these prisoners being sent to Room 101. "
"Why ""Moon Child""?","The simplest explanation, in-universe so to speak, would be that you need a new unique name to see the Childlike Empress, and ""Mondenkind"" isn't really a word that existed before in the German language (certainly not in common parlance). Even the more correct compound noun ""Mondkind"" would be unusual. ""Monden"" ist dative plural, so ""Mondenkind"" would be ""child belonging to the moons"" or something, but is more likely to be a stylised form. In German, shoving extra syllables into a word is sometimes used to make words sound more ""antique"" and courtly. And (speculative) the Childlike Empress does not shine her own light, she projects back the phantasies of children. The less mundane out of universe answer is that, according to some sources, it is a reference to the novel ""Moonchild"" by British occultist Aleister Crowley. This is borne out by the fact that among Michael Ende's possessions was, according to the newspaper ""Mittelbayerische"", an ""Äquinox"" (now on display in the Ende museum), the seal of Crowley's occult society ""Thelemic Golden Dawn"", which bears the inscription ""Tu was du willst, soll sein das ganze Gesetz"", or in the original English, ""Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law"", which is also the inscription on the Auryin medallion in the Neverending Story. Like many left wing would be revolutionaries from the 1968 student protest who went into political ""inner emigration"", Michael Ende believed in any number of strange things (some of them even true, such as climate change), so a reference to occultism isn't perhaps that unusual. However, at least as far as I can recall, the connection was not widely known or discussed at the time of publication (but then I was eight when it was published, so I wouldn't really have been interested in that kind of discussion)."
Why did Morris and Clay preemptively dissolve the Red-Headed League?,"I took a look in Leslie S. Klinger's The new annotated Sherlock Holmes. This does indeed appear to be a problem that has puzzled commentators. Three suggestions are mentioned: These are, of course, Watsonian explanations. A Doylist explanation is that the story would not be as effective if the payments stopped at any other point."
Was Stevenson's Treasure Island influenced by Poe?,"Stevenson's admission of the earlier stories and authors he'd plagiarised borrowed ideas from comes in My First Book - his little-known preface to Treasure Island, first published in McClure's Magazine in September 1894. First Stevenson acknowledges very readily some minor ideas and motifs taken from other writers: It is not to be wondered at, for stolen waters are proverbially sweet. I am now upon a painful chapter. No doubt the parrot once belonged to Robinson Crusoe. No doubt the skeleton is conveyed from Poe. ... but goes on to say that these small acts of 'plagiarism' are unimportant and that his greatest debt is to Washington Irving, from whom he took almost wholesale the character of Billy Bones. (I won't go into this in too much detail since it's not the main subject of the question here; if you're interested in more evidence for the Irving connection, you can read My First Book in full here and also see very similar descriptive passages from Treasure Island and Irving's Tales of a Traveller reproduced together in Appendix C of this edition of Treasure Island.) Later on, he returns to Poe by saying: The map was the chief part of my plot. For instance, I had called an islet
  Skeleton Island, not knowing what I meant, seeking only for the immediate picturesque; and it was to justify this name that I broke into the gallery of Mr Poe and stole Flint's pointer. Both of these nods to Poe must refer specifically to ""The Gold-Bug"", in which the famous real-world pirate Captain Kidd left signposts to his fictional treasure which included a skull and two skeletons, presumably belonging to some of his former crewmen.  How I found this: after some failures at looking for answers on the internet using various different search terms, I finally discovered here a direct quote from Stevenson, which I could then paste into Google to find its source."
Had Keats read any of Homer's works before reading Chapman's translation of them?,"He was probably familiar with Alexander Pope's version, which was the prestigious version at the time.1 It's likely that Keats wasn't enamored with this version. He was famously critical of 18th century poets, thinking their poetry too rule-bound and stifled. He expresses some of these criticisms in the poem Sleep and Poetry:1 Could all this be forgotten? Yes, a sc[h]ism
  Nurtured by foppery and barbarism,
  Made great Apollo blush for this his land.
  Men were thought wise who could not understand
  His glories: with a puling infant’s force
  They sway’d about upon a rocking horse,
  And thought it Pegasus. (Sleep and Poetry, 181-187) In this passage, Keats compares 18th century poets to infants riding upon a wooden horse, thinking it to be Pegasus. That's a pretty biting metaphor. This criticism made Byron quite angry with him. But ye were dead
  To things ye knew not of,—were closely wed
  To musty laws lined out with wretched rule
  And compass vile: so that ye taught a school
  Of dolts to smooth, inlay, and clip, and fit,
  Till, like the certain wands of Jacob’s wit,
  Their verses tallied. Easy was the task:
  A thousand handicraftsmen wore the mask
  Of Poesy. Ill-fated, impious race!
  That blasphemed the bright Lyrist to his face,
  And did not know it,—no, they went about,
  Holding a poor, decrepid standard out
  Mark’d with most flimsy mottos, and in large
  The name of one Boileau! (Sleep and Poetry, 193-206) In the above, the same criticism is repeated in the lines ""were closely wed / To musty laws lined out with wretched rule / And compass vile"". Keats attributes the deterioration of English poetry partly to Boileau, a French poet and critic of late 17th century. Boileau published a famous book, L'Art poétique, which influenced English literature. It might be useful to compare Pope's version with that of Chapman's.1 The below passages correspond to the same account in the Iliad, a description of Diomedes' armor and ferocity. You can see how Chapman's line had more syllables (fourteen). His line is also a lot freer, not always punctuated at the end as we find in Pope. High on his helm celestial lightnings play,
  His beamy shield emits a living ray;
  Th’ unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies,
  Like the red star that fires th’ autumnal skies,
  When fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight,
  And bathed in Ocean shoots a keener light.
  Such glories Pallas on the Chief bestow’d,
  Such, from his arms, the fierce effulgence flow’d:
  Onward she drives him, furious to engage,
  Where the fight burns, and where the thickest rage. (Pope's Iliad) From his bright helm and shield did burn a most unwearied fire,
  Like rich Autumnus’ golden lamp, whose brightness men admire
  Past all the other host of stars, when, with his cheerful face
  Fresh wash’d in lofty Ocean waves, he doth the skies enchase.
  To let whose glory lose no sight, still Pallas made him turn
  Where tumult most express’d his pow’r, and where the fight did burn. (Chapman's Homer)  In summary, I think that Keats was well aware of Pope's translation before reading Chapman. But I'm inclined to think that Keats was not enamored with Pope's translation, as, by his own admission, it wasn't until reading Chapman that he gained an appreciation for Homer.  1 Longman Anthology of British Literature, Volume 2A"
What is the theology of Little Women?,"The only thing that stands out to me with regard to the concept of the Trinity is from Little Men: When it ceased at last, and Mrs. Bhaer went to take away the lamp, Demi was gone and Nat fast asleep, lying with his face toward the picture, as if he had already learned to love the Good Man who loved little children, and was a faithful friend to the poor.' This in reference to Christ seems to imply a rejection of coequality. In general, the books rarely touch on specific aspects of Protestant beliefs. Major moments I can think of that deal with religious themes are Amy's flirtation with Catholicism in Little Women (which doesn't really touch on Protestant denominations at all), Jo's experience with atheists in the second part of the book, and the Pilgrim's Progress interweaving. Notably, while Mr. March and Meg's son John/Demi are presented as good and wise through their piety and Meg even wants Demi to become a minister, there aren't really theological discussions. I think there are maybe inferences to be made about how the Marches are portrayed to practise and think about religion, though, whether it's the relative de-emphasis of reading the Bible compared to other texts (although it is frequently quoted), absence of formal church worship (despite Mr. March's profession)--Dan does go to chapel in Jo's Boys, but it's in prison, and solitary or within-family worship is a fixture of the series--or passages like this: Simple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety. It shows itself in acts rather than in words, and has more influence than homilies or protestations. Beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life, and cheerfully wait for death. Like a confiding child, she asked no questions, but left everything to God and nature, Father and Mother of us all, feeling sure that they, and they only, could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come. She did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only loved her better for her passionate affection, and clung more closely to the dear human love, from which our Father never means us to be weaned, but through which He draws us closer to Himself. (Little Women pt. 2) While this seems distinctly Transcendentalist in various ways and implies a supremacy of the Lord as the Father alongside the Mother (nature), it's not explicitly Unitarian. This is generally the pattern, where Louisa May Alcott's Transcendentalist beliefs seem to influence her mentions of God, Heaven, or the ability/need for people to strive towards Heaven. However, all the books contain references to the Father in these contexts, and I can't find a single reference to the Son, Christ, etc. except when Amy becomes interested in the Madonna and the Child (which is presented in the Catholic context). Of course, this could also be a function of the political and religious ambiguity of a lot of the text; Alcott would probably be mindful of this in relation to theology. Returning to 'Father and Mother of us all', this is interesting to me because of the ideas of Christian Science founder Mary Baker Eddy, who corresponded with Alcott's father and (as far as I can tell) Alcott herself. Neither of them were Christian Scientists, but I can imagine the concept of God encompassing maternal traits appealing to Alcott. It's probable however that Alcott is alluding to Mother Nature."
Did George Orwell ever feel that Spain would be better off under Franco?,"Having read George Orwell's 1942 essay Looking Back on the Spanish War (tip of the hat to @Randal'Thor), it's quite difficult to imagine that Orwell ever came to the conclusion that Spain would be better off under Franco. This is because: Orwell in his essay specifically calls out the evil of Fascism numerous times, e.g., There is little question that what one may roughly call the ‘whites’ commit far more and worse atrocities than the ‘reds’. The Reds and Whites of course refer to the left (Communists) and the right (Fascists), respectively. Orwell goes on to describe those who support Fascism (emphasis added throughout): When one thinks of all the people who support or have supported Fascism... they are all people with something to lose, or people who long for a hierarchical society and dread the prospect of a world of free and equal human beings. He reiterates this in his description of what was at stake and who stood to benefit: The hatred which the Spanish Republic excited in millionaires, dukes, cardinals, play-boys, Blimps, and what-not would in itself be enough to show one how the land lay. In essence it was a class war. If it had been won, the cause of the common people everywhere would have been strengthened. It was lost, and the dividend-drawers all over the world rubbed their hands. That was the real issue; all else was froth on its surface. Orwell's disdain for the Fascists here is clear. In a number of passages, Orwell speaks highly of the Socialist cause: What are the workers struggling for? Simply for the decent life which they are more and more aware is now technically possible.  And in reference to his encounter with a rural Italian soldier fighting for the left: When I remember — oh, how vividly! — his shabby uniform and fierce, pathetic, innocent face, the complex side-issues of the war seem to fade away and I see clearly that there was at any rate no doubt as to who was in the right. In spite of power politics and journalistic lying, the central issue of the war was the attempt of people like this to win the decent life which they knew to be their birthright. In each passage, Orwell's clear support of Socialism is stated in the context of how its purpose is to provide the masses with a decent standard of living. Though Orwell supports Socialism in principle, he does not spare criticism for the confounding behavior of Russia, which worked to suppress a revolution in Spain while also doing little to support those fighting the Fascists. As to the Russians, their motives in the Spanish war are completely inscrutable... their actions are most easily explained if one assumes that they were acting on several contradictory motives. I believe that in the future we shall come to feel that Stalin's foreign policy, instead of being so diabolically clever as it is claimed to be, has been merely opportunistic and stupid. With that in mind, Orwell's disdain for the left applies to its political strategies and not its desired ends. Orwell states that evil must be fought and cannot be relied upon to collapse on its own. Nourished for hundreds of years on a literature in which Right invariably triumphs in the last chapter, we believe half-instinctively that evil always defeats itself in the long run. Pacifism, for instance, is founded largely on this belief. Don't resist evil, and it will somehow destroy itself. But why should it? What evidence is there that it does? And what instance is there of a modern industrialized state collapsing unless conquered from the outside by military force? Note also that Orwell refers to Fascism simply as the noun evil. It's hard to imagine him acquiescing to evil, even if the cost is death.  Finally, he makes the clearest recapitulation of his support for the leftist fight in Spain: Whether it was right, as all left-wingers in other countries undoubtedly did, to encourage the Spaniards to go on fighting when they could not win is a question hard to answer. I myself think it was right, because I believe that it is better even from the point of view of survival to fight and be conquered than to surrender without fighting. There is substantial evidence to think that by 1942 -- five years after escaping Spain -- Orwell had sufficient time to reflect on whether the leftist fight against Fascism was worth it. He knew that Fascism was evil, he felt that Socialism was not, and he knew that evil had to be confronted. He must have decided that the Spanish civil war was worth the fight for the left."
