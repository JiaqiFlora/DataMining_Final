Points are given in tennis 15-30-40. Why 40?,"The answer to this is a little convoluted and the answer is just what is ""believed"" to have been the reason behind the scoring numbers, but since tennis is a game that dates back to the 19th century, it's tough to know for sure. Anyway, here goes... Think of a clock face that is divided up into quadrants - which would give you the 15, 30, 45, and 60 intervals. The problem with using that to score tennis games though, is that to win a game, you have to win by 2 points if the score reaches deuce (40-40 or ""40 all""). So it is believed that the first 3 points would advance the hand to 15, 30 and 40 - and then the next 2 points would advance the hand by 10 minutes - first to 50, then to 60 - still keeping the game finished at the 60 mark. If the (serving) player failed to win 2 points in a row after deuce, the hand would move back to 40 and the score would be at deuce again. See here for some additional theories behind the scoring nomenclature."
Why is FIFA against adding instant replay to the game?,"There are a few fundamental considerations: In 2008, FiFA President Sepp Blatter said: ""Let it be as it is and let's leave [football] with errors. The television companies will have the right to say [the referee] was right or wrong, but still the referee makes the decision – a man, not a machine."" Blatter and others at FIFA have repeatedly argued against using instant replay. But lately, FIFA has begun to come around on the idea. At FIFA's Congress in São Paulo prior to the 2014 World Cup, Blatter proposed allowing managers 2 challenges per game, much like the NFL handles challenges today. Although it's not quite ""instant replay,"" in 2012 FIFA approved two different goal-line technologies to improve referee accuracy: ""Hawk-Eye"" -- which uses visual triangulation to determine ball location -- and ""GoalRef"" -- which uses a microchip in the ball and magnetic sensors within goalposts. (Many say FIFA approved the technologies in response to Frank Lampard's snubbed ""goal"" against Germany in the 2010 World Cup.) In 2013, FIFA announced it would use GoalControl, a German competitor to Hawk-Eye, at the Confederations Cup, basically a rehearsal for the World Cup. After a successful run at that tournament, FIFA announced it would implement GoalControl at the 2014 World Cup. The Guardian provides a pretty helpful FAQ on the technology. FIFA may choose to implement further changes to approved goal-line technology and referee rules when it meets again after the World Cup."
Is it legal to throw an alley-oop to yourself in a real game?,"For the NCAA, it is scored as follows (from page 10 of the 2011 Official Basketball
Statisticians’ Manual): A.R.15. Adams throws a pass to himself or herself off the backboard, and then shoots and makes the basket. Ruling: Credit Adams with a FGA and FGM, but no assist 
  or rebound. For the NBA, according to this Q&A (from 2009) with Bernie Fryer (Vice President of Referee Operations and Director of Officials in the NBA), it is also allowed: Are you allowed to throw the ball off the backboard, grab your own rebound and dunk it without landing?
  -- Blaise
  Bernie's answer: Yes. Under the traveling rule, a player who attempts a shot or pass may not be the first to touch the ball unless it touches the backboard, rim or another player. Therefore, a player can intentionally pass the ball to himself off the backboard or rim. Actually, a week or so ago Kobe Bryant was double teamed near the 3-point line, had no one to pass to and had already picked up his dribble. He was about to fall down, which would have been traveling, instead he alertly threw the ball off the backboard, caught it and dribbled back to the top of the key. This wasn't an alley-oop but was similar. Michael Jordan was famous for doing the same thing on occasion."
Why are professional athletes allowed to compete in the Olympic games?,"The IOC officially began allowing professional athletes to compete in the Olypmic Games in 1988, basically leaving it up to the individual sporting federations to decide if they would permit it. The only sports which continue to claim they are ""amateur only"" are boxing and wrestling, but even that's a bit of a misnomer: certain national boxing or wrestling Olympics committees pay out cash rewards, but since the fighters are not paid to fight, they are not considered professional. This topic is actually the subject of an article by Simon Eassem, published for the Second International Symposium for Olympic Research. The entire publication is called Critical reflections on Olympic ideology though it seems to be pretty hard to find. But the basic factors behind the IOC's decision were: Ultimately, the IOC just decided that excluding pro athletes made the games less interesting, less competitive, and less fair. It also helped that the Olympics were big business by that point, with television rights fees, sponsorship money and similar sources of income. Having huge, marquee-level celebrity athletes brought in lots more money."
Are there any sports for which the world's best player is female?,"Equestrian Sports comes to my mind as the only Olympic Sports where men and women face each other in competitions. Dressage, in particular, is dominated by women. Isabell Werth and Anky van Grunsven are possibly the most prominent, having dominated the world class for the last 20 years. I just came across this ESPN article which argues that in shooting, women are consistently doing better than men."
How is offside determined in football?,"Wikipedia article on ""offside"" is very comprehensive and largely based on the official IFAB Laws of the Game. From the article, what it is:  Offside is a law in football which states that if a player is in an offside position when the ball is touched or played by a teammate, he may not become actively involved in the play. A player is in an offside position if he is closer to the opponent's goal line than both the ball and the second-to-last defender (which is usually the last outfield player), but only if the player is on his opponent's half of the pitch.  How it is officiated: In enforcing this rule, the referee depends greatly on an assistant referee, who generally keeps in line with the second-to-last defender, the ball, or the halfway line, whichever is closer to the goal line of his relevant end. An assistant referee signals that an offside offence has occurred by first raising his or her flag upright without movement and then, when acknowledged by the referee, by raising his or her flag in a manner that signifies the location of the offence So in my own simple words, you determine an offside by: If you see that the line going through an offending player who is about to receive the ball is closer to the goal than the line going through the last defender, and that line is in the defending half, then it is an offside. Refer to the Laws of the Game for more info.  Notice that there are a few exceptions when someone can be or not be offside. "
Why was the marathon World Record not 2:03:02 in 2011?,"The course for the Boston Marathon does not meet two of the criteria necessary for ratification of world or American records: The Boston course has an endpoint about 24.3 miles (39 km) from the start point, and the endpoint is also 459 feet (139 m) lower than the start point. source: wikipedia"
"In cricket, how is it decided from which end to start the match?",The fielding captain decides from which end he wants to start the match and informs the batsmen who then decides who will face the first ball. Usually this is decided by the preference of the bowler who is going to bowl the first over.
Why do some swimmers wear two caps?,"Actually, most swimmers at this level of competition wear two caps. Dana Vollmer, who won gold with a new world-record time in the 100m butterfly, actually lost her outer cap in the pool on the return leg of that event. Thus, the first reason; redundancy. These caps are latex rubber, which doesn't mix well with chlorine and will eventually degrade, and as Dana's swim shows, even a brand-new cap can slip right off. If the swimmer, especially a female swimmer, had only one cap, losing it and releasing their hair would drastically increase the drag they have to swim against in the water. Second, as Rory states, a common (though not universal) way to put all your headgear on is to put one swim cap on, then put your goggles on, then cover the goggle strap with another swim cap. Not only does it reduce drag on the goggle strap (which is minor), it helps keep your goggles in one place (MUCH more important). I was on a swim team when I was much younger, and I lost count of how many times the shock of entering the water ripped my goggles right off my eyes. You still have to swim if it happens, but it becomes a HUGE distraction that can take you right out of the race. At your average junior swim meet, losing a race to your goggles is embarassing but not devastating. At the Olympics, it would be a heartbreaker."
"Can a football team force its defeat, e.g. via own goals?","Sports governing bodies come down very, very heavily on teams deliberately losing - a very similar example to the England/Belgium World Cup situation is from badminton at the 2012 Olympics, when the teams which deliberately lost were disqualified. FIFA would almost certainly deal with any blatant deliberate losing in the same kind of way; see also a cricket match where a team deliberately lost which again resulted in their disqualification from the tournament. There is nothing explicit within the main body of the Laws of the Game which requires teams attempt to win, although players can of course be cautioned for ""unsporting behaviour"". Is attempting to lose ""unsporting""? I don't think there's a clear consensus on that one, but given the extensive media speculation on this one I'd hope that FIFA has given guidance to both the match officials and the teams involved."
"What factors give a ""Home Advantage"" and how big is it?","I'm not posting this as an answer to rival the others as I feel they are excellent answers. However, this is pertinent to the question, it's interesting and it is going to be longer than a comment. Why it's better to be the home team I've read a number of articles over the years about how playing an away game can be a considerable disadvantage above the obvious difference in supporter numbers.  Here are some that I recall. Finally, a couple of interesting articles: The Guardian The Independent And here's a BBC Magazine article on ""The Science of Home Advantage""."
Is it legal in racket sports to pass the racket from one hand to the other?,"Yes, it is LEGAL to switch racket ""handed-ness"" during play. From the USTA web site: Q. I am a left-handed tennis player. During play, I have found that I
  can hit the tennis ball almost as well with my right hand as I do with
  my left. Do USTA rules forbid players to switch hands during play? A. No. You can play with either hand. In fact, three-time USTA
  national champion Marty Devlin of Trenton, NJ has employed this “two
  forehands” style since he started playing tennis. The old joke when
  people were preparing to play Marty was to hit to his backhand. But,
  alas, he has no backhand. Also, I have cousins in the Miami area who have played tennis with Jai alai players who will switch handed-ness frequently even during the same point / rally."

Why would you ever allow an opponent to score?,"In that particular situation, the Patriots were allowing the Giants to score because of 2 important reasons. The Giants were already in scoring position - well within field goal range and The Patriots only had a slim lead (2 points) - so a field goal from the Giants would mean they would be trailing and need to get the ball back and score again. So they allowed the Giants to score in order to get possession of the ball back ASAP to try and re-gain the lead."
"""53 has the Mic"" means what in American Football?","In most cases he is actually saying ""53 is the Mike"". There are four types of linebackers that are used in typical 3-4 and 4-3 defenses, respectively: While the Mike Linebacker typically carries a microphone, the quarterback is not referring to the microphone that he is wearing, instead he is talking to his blockers and informing them who should block the ""Mike"". The term Mike linebacker has been used since well before any electronic communication was worn in the helmets. The Mike is considered the ""quarterback of the defense"" and is typically one of the biggest and most athletic players on the field and deserves much of the blockers' and running backs' attention. So, when a quarterback says ""53 has the Mike"" he is not saying ""53 is in possession of the microphone"" but instead he means ""53 is very important and deserves your attention"". Now, it is important to note that when the quarterback calls out the Mike, it is not necessarily what the defense considers the Mike, nor is it necessarily even the middle linebacker.  In running plays, the offensive tackles and guards are typically responsible for blocking the defensive linemen, which leaves the center and fullback left looking for someone leftover to block. When the quarterback calls out the ""Mike"", it is typical that the guy who is being singled out will get a lot of attention on that play (maybe they will run right at him, or right away from him). If a fullback's defensive assignment is to ""block the Mike"" but not necessarily a particular player, the quarterback is basically saying ""[for this particular play, and for your blocking assignment purposes] 53 is the Mike [so block him!]"" In passing plays, the Mike is called out similarly for pass blocking reasons. Often when a team is in a ""max-protect"" scheme (where running backs stay in the backfield to help block for the the quarterback), the Mike is called out to the running backs to let them know that they need to block him if he blitzes. The reason that this is important is that if the Mike Linebacker does not blitz, then the running back is often free to running a short passing route into the flat in support of the quarterback."
Why do I get out of breath so quickly when swimming?,"How much are you kicking?  Try holding a flutterboard/kickboard/buoy between your legs and continuing the arm motion of front crawl. This does two things. The main trick in efficient swimming is to learn to swim downhill.  You want to 'Press the Buoy' which is push your chest (full of air) down, and use it as leverage to get your legs higher.  You sort of eventually end up swimming downhill a bit. Another trick is to tuck your chin into your chest, imagining you are pulling your neck and spine far enough to tug your legs up.  (Its just a trick to teach you to lean forward and press the buoy, but the image works).  If you try to feel yourself pulling your legs up by your chin it can be effective. Basically these are approaches to being more efficient."
Why do players enter with children on the ground?,"The children are mascots.

Why is the word Love used as a score for Tennis?,"There seems to be some debate on where the term started.  One common explanation is that it was adapted from the French word l'oeuf (pronounced ""luff""), which means egg or zero. In American sports, we often use a similar term of goose egg to refer to a score of zero. The Oxford Dictionary also believes that the term ""Love"" could have been adapted from the phrase ""to play for love [of the game]"". Meaning that, if you have no score then you must be playing for the love of the game because you are obviously not very good."
Why are substitutions commonly made right at the end of the game?,"I always thought those substitutions are just used to buy time. The clock doesn't stop during a sub, the player that is substituted never hurries, so it buys some time for the team. The referee has to add the time to overtime, but it will not be the same amount.

Can referees change their decision?,"FIFA's Law 5 from the Laws of the Game 2011-12 notes: Decisions of the referee The decisions of the referee regarding facts connected with play,

Do they ever pull the goalkeeper in football?,"It would certainly be allowed, but it would likely be a failed strategy in soccer.  So subbing in a field player for a keeper is probably a loser as it's a poor use of resources and leaves you in a bind if you succeed. However, most keepers are capable players and can play the field in a pinch. Thus it's not hugely uncommon for you to see the keeper pushed way up in a situation where his team must score. However, there are some good reasons to not do this in normal play: Most soccer league regular season games aren't hugely meaningful, but it can be a lot better to lose 1-0 than it would be to lose 2-0. Which means risking a greater loss to try to tie the game is not beneficial. Keepers aren't usually good field players. While they may be capable, and they usually have a solid kick, they aren't strikers, and at best, a keeper playing high frees up a mid or back to go up and play a striking role. It's a long run from the defending third to the attacking one. Most of the time it doesn't make much of a difference to have an extra player on the attack (see how often a team of 10 can play even with a team of 11), so it doesn't make a lot of sense for the keeper to come forward and play a role he's relatively unfamiliar with. Overall, this strategy can pay, especially on very late set piece opportunities, but in general, it just doesn't seem worth it."
"In the history of Formula 1, when has the fastest qualifier not started the race on pole?","I was so interested in this myself that I wasn't going to stop at anything to get a good answer.  Sadly, small research didn't get me the answers I was after so eventually I spent 14 hours reviewing the reports of every Grand Prix since 1950.  To the date of this answer there have been 864 of them, which is why it took so long. 1955 Indianapolis GP - May 30, 1955 Jack McGrath set the fastest qualifying speed but actually started in grid position 3, on the outside of the track. Jerry Hoyt started in pole as he was one of only two drivers to complete a qualifying event on ""Pole Day"" due to strong winds and the threat of heavy rain. Hoyt was actually only the eighth fastest in the field and his speed (140.045mph) is the record slowest ranked pole speed. 1994 Monaco GP - May 15, 1994 This was the first GP to follow the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the season's previous Grand Prix at San Marino. Whilst Michael Schumacher did start at pole position and is officially documented as such, grid places 1 and 2 were left unoccupied and painted with the flags of Senna and Ratzenberger's respective nations as a mark of respect. 1996 French GP - June 30, 1996 Michael Schumacher qualified with the fastest lap, earning him pole position for this race.  However, Schumacher's engine failed during the formation lap at Magny Cours and did not take his place on the grid. 1998 Japanese GP - November 1, 1998 Schumacher was involved again here, this time stalling from his hard-earned (one tenth of a second faster) pole position. As a result of this he was sent to the back of the grid. The race started successfully on this, the third, attempt after Jarno Trulli had stalled his car on the first attempt. 2001 Monaco GP - May 27, 2001 David Coulthard was sitting happily in pole position but his McLaren failed to pull away for the formation lap.  His team managed to get him moving eventually but by this time he was resigned to starting from the back of the grid. 2005 US GP - June 19, 2005 This is the one they called ""IndyGate"".  Jarno Trulli was fastest qualifier and therefore in pole position.  However, due to safety concerns regarding the Michelin tyres, all drivers of vehicles with these tyres retired to the pits during the formation lap. Only six cars started the race with drivers in grid places 5, 7, 17, 19, 18 & 20.  2005 Italian GP - September 4, 2005 Kimi Räikkönen qualified with the fastest time but was given a 10-place grid penalty for changing his engine. Juan Pablo Montoya took up pole position as a result. 2007 Hungarian GP - September 4, 2005 Fernando Alonso recorded the fastest time in qualifying but a stewards' inquiry before the race adjudged Alonso to have impeded Lewis Hamilton during Q3.  Alonso was subsequently relegated 5 places on the starting grid, moving Hamilton up to pole. 2012 Spanish GP - May 13, 2012 In this event, Lewis Hamilton was excluded from the qualifying results due to having insufficient fuel to return to the pits.  As a result, Hamilton had to start the race from the very back of the grid. 2012 Monaco GP - May 27, 2012 The fastest qualifier at Monaco was Michael Schumacher.  However, Schumacher was carrying a 5-grid penalty from the previous race in Spain for causing an avoidable collision with Bruno Senna, thus moving him back in the grid. It nearly happened in 1990 Japanese GP Ayrton Senna had secured pole position but was unhappy that pole was situated on the side of the track which was not on the racing line.  Senna requested that he be moved and the stewards agreed, only for the FISA president to overrule the decision, meaning Senna started in pole at the original location. And to close, you ask: There is a reason for the question as the Fantasy F1 game I run gives the pole-sitter bonus points but I am not sure what to do in this kind of situation! You'll have to decide!  Perhaps give the bonus for fastest qualifier instead of pole position? You can see my spreadsheet with all the pole positions since 1950 here."
How to recognize baseball pitches when watching television games?,"You're not alone; sometimes even the commentators, who have the same ""over-the-shoulder"" long-lens view that the folks at home do, will simply refer to a pitch as a ""breaking ball"" if it drops sharply or curves outside, even though a number of specific pitches can do that. The fundamental theory of pitching is that the batter gains an advantage over the pitcher proportional to his ability to predict the pitcher's next move, and conversely, the pitcher gains an advantage over the batter inversely proportional to the batter's ability to predict the next pitch. Your better pitchers have a number of weapons to accomplish this, but key to all of them is control over three elements of the pitch; speed (and thus timing), vertical axis (drop), and horizontal axis (slide). From the very good diagram Dor linked to, here's a basic breakdown of the most common RHP's pitches as seen by a RHB: Fast Pitches (usually 85mph+ in the major leagues): Off-speed pitches (between 70-85mph) The variation of speed and breaking action produces a host of possibilities, which a good battery can use to keep the batter guessing. A pitcher can also aim pitches differently to make them look like other pitches; a pitcher can throw a fastball high and fool the batter into thinking it was going to be a sinker or splitter, or can throw a two-seam wide and the batter may think it's an errant four-seam until it breaks back over the plate.  Batters like a variety of different pitches; exactly what the batter likes should be known by the pitcher and/or catcher, and a combination of what the batter flat doesn't like, and pitches that look like what he does like but then change, are generally the order of the day. From time to time a pitcher may give a batter exactly what he wants, hopefully when he's least expecting it; this is often necessary to avoid showing the batter the same pitch too many times, and a missed opportunity can also put the batter ""on the tilt"", throwing off their concentration as they mentally kick themselves."
How are the number of laps in an F1 race determined?,"The number of laps are decided by taking a distance of 305 km and dividing it by the length of a lap (rounded up), which varies from racetrack to racetrack. (1) quoting the official regulations (from 2011): 5.3
  The distance of all races, from the start signal referred to in Article 38.9 to the chequered flag, shall be 
  equal to the least number of complete laps which exceed a distance of 305 km (Monaco 260km). However, 
  should two hours elapse before the scheduled race distance is completed, the leader will be shown the 
  chequered flag when he crosses the control line (the Line) at the end of the lap during which the two hour 
  period ended. However, should the race be suspended (see Article 41) the length of the suspension will be 
  added to this period."
Why is the referee treated so different in soccer and rugby,"I think it has to do with the traditions. I believe originally rugby was played by the higher class, with a certain upbringing. I have a colleague who works as a part time rugby ref and he's puzzled as to why the ref doesn't send off half of the players in a football game. I, on the other hand, am often puzzled as to how the refs command so much respect in rugby.  Another point of view could be that football's expansion to take over the world is based on the fact that one really doesn't need much to play football. Compared to some other sports (e.g. ice-hockey), it's cheaper and easier to play football, all you need is a ball (or something that you can use as a ball) and a good imagination (to define the field and goals). ""What does that have to do with anything?"", you might ask.. Well, if anyone and everyone can play football, however they like, you might argue that people take their local manners and traditions and incorporate it into the game. I play football on amateur level, and the ""quality"" of the game especially with regards to manners and temperament has been very closely related to which nationalities were present on the field.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, football has become such a huge money-maker so that football associations do not dare/want to impose serious penalties for inappropriate behavior. I mean there isn't a single person in the football world that could imagine giving a 10 match ban to Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, for diving. Or a seasonal ban to whatever player for shouting at the ref's face. I believe the situation has gotten this bad because bad behavior has been tolerated for just way too long. "
Why are there different stars on table tennis balls?,"I've played with 1, 2 and 3 star balls. I'm not sure 4 or 5 star exist. Some companies have brands that they say are 4-star but they aren't actually rated above 3-star because a 3 star rating means the highest quality ball possible. The factors that go into the rating are durability, visibility of the seam on the ball, balance of the ball and elasticity. The legal colors to play with are white and orange, though you can find all kinds of different colors in most sporting goods stores. Typically 1 or 2 star balls are bought in bulk (packs of 100 or 200) and used for rallying or practice - and the 3 star balls are saved for real competition (matches). You'll notice that after ping pong balls see some action, they slowly lose some of the smooth matte finish when they are new out of the package."

Also, when a game is being decided by penalties, then all players must have taken one penalty each, before a player can take a second penalty.
So, a goal keeper would have to take a penalty, before any other player gets a second chance."
What is the on-field role of the captain?,"The FIFA Rules of the Game published for the 2011-2012 season make the following rules applicable for the captain; However, outside of the laws, it is often expected the captain has the responsibility of... Off the field their most important role is that they are one of the most recognised people of the team; the manager, then the captain. They are the leaders of the team, and (rightly or wrongly) the teams public image can be strongly affected based on the image and actions of these people. The other players in the squad inevitably fall behind these two people. Of course, all members of the squad are public facing, and should act as such, but this is even more so for the captain. Being specific to the John Terry incident, the worst scenario the FA could have is the captain of the England Football team being criminally charged with racism. Sure, a squad member being criminally charged hurts, but eventually it gets brushed under the carpet... there's 22 other squad members to think about. It is not that easy to forget about the single captain and single manager, however."
Screening in volleyball,"The official rules (as you cite in your question) prohibit screening. Unfortunately the rules themselves do not give an exact definition that you could use. In referee trainings, however, you will get more info on how to judge screening. Everything that helps the serving team to prepare for defense is allowed. So each player of that team can take any position on the field (within the constraints of the rotation rule) which ""makes sense"". Therefore the front players are allowed to group near the attacker(s) and raise their arms as preparation for blocking. Also the back row players are allowed to take reasonable positions. What is definitely not allowed is to move during your own player serves in order to block the sight. (It is not allowed to leave a line of sight between reception player and serving player and then ""closing"" it shorty before the service is hit.) It is also not allowed to take ""unreasonable"" positions in the field. I.e. a back row player is not allowed to stand directly in front of the serving player, if he normally would take another position. In practice, I have never seen a referee penalizing a screening fault without the receiving team claiming it first. So, as a best-practice, take ""reasonable"" positions to block the sight between service and reception player. As soon as the opponent team claims a screening, take care that you are not overdoing it"
What's the justification for this rarely-invoked NFL fumble rule?,"To answer your question(s), the rule is to discourage intentional fumbling.  It was added following the 1978 season in which the famous ""Holy Roller"" play occurred: The rule was put in the rule book after the Raiders beat the Chargers on an intentional forward fumble in 1978.  Once the season was over, the rule as you have quoted was put into effect. Losing 20 to 14 with a few seconds remaining in the game, the Raiders QB Ken Stabler fumbled the ball forward from the 24 yard line.  From there two of his teammates batted the ball towards and into the end zone.  The Raider's Dave Casper fell on the ball in the end zone and the following extra point won the game, 21-20. After the game, Stabler admitted to fumbling on purpose. Wiki on Holy Roller Video of the play"
"Are all oval-track races done counter-clockwise? If so, why?","Not all tracks are counter clockwise, The exceptions being the Australian version of NASCAR (AUSCAR) and horse racing is often run clockwise outside the US such as England(St Leger - wikipedia.), Continental Europe, Australia, and Hong Kong. also some of F1 races are clockwise like . The decision to run horses counterclockwise in the US dates to the American Revolution era. In 1780, the first circular US race track was established by William Whitley near his home in Lincoln County, Kentucky. A staunch supporter of the Revolution, Whitley insisted that horses race counterclockwise, as opposed to clockwise as was the custom at the time in England.

Why do tennis players keep an extra ball in their pocket?,"A tennis player is allowed to serve two times. If your first attempt (serve) results in a fault, the player is allowed a second attempt. When you commit a fault, in many, if not all competitions, you are discouraged to go and retrieve the ball that resulted in your fault. This would cluster the job of the the ball-boys on the court who's job is to collect dead balls. Also according to Rule 20 (Second Service) in the ITF Rules of Tennis it states; If the first service is a fault, the server shall serve again without
delay from behind  the same half of the court from which that fault
was served, unless the service was  from the wrong half. I would think that if a player would take time to go and retrieve the ball, this would most likely cause a minor delay. So a player has two options. The first option is to request another ball from a ball-boy who is located on the side of the court. Very few players do this because it results in loss of concentration and with some players it changes their rhythm. The most common option is for a player to request two or three balls before he/she serves. If the player requests two balls, he/she uses one to serve and uses the other in the case of a fault. If the player requests three or more balls, this is when you will see the player examine all three and then toss one or more of the balls back to a ball-girl/boy. What the player is doing in this situation is getting rid of the worst ball out of the three, keeping the best ball for the first serve and the extra ball in the case of a fault."
What is this three-against-one game with red and blue balls?,"This sounds like a variant of Boccia, or at least a game being played using Boccia equipment on a Boccia field-of-play. Boccia Rules (link) Simple Boccia Rules (link)"
Why does a foul ball not count as a third strike?,"This is mostly to encourage more at bats to end with a ball in play. Baseball is most exciting when a batter can put a ball in play. It also gives the batter a slight advantage in that he can continue to foul pitches that he cannot achieve solid contact with and ""keep himself alive."" This balances the pitcher's competitive advantage of knowing where the ball is going, how fast its traveling and what kind of pitch is being thrown. In 0 and 1 strike counts the strike on a foul rule exists to advance the count and to speed up the game. Advancing the count in this case serves to add drama and keeps the batter from engaging in a long series of foul offs with no consequence. There are however 3 situations in which a foul ball can result in an out. Basically the rule exists to foster more and better competition in the sport."
What baseball rules or calls have become customary despite them not being in the rule book?,"There is an interesting unwritten rule that actually gets contradicted in the official MLB rules.  The ""tie goes to the runner"" claim is one that most baseball fans have heard. Rule 6.05j states that ""a batter is out when after a third strike or
  after he hits a fair ball, he or first base is tagged before he
  touches first base."" So in this case the rules claim the ball must arrive first.  Giving the tie to the runner. However...  Rule 7.08e states that ""any runner is out when he fails to reach the
  next base before a fielder tags him or the base"" In this case it is the runner that must reach the base before the ball, giving the tie to the defensive team. So the tie goes to the runner, you know, sometimes or something."
How does a sport become an Olympic Sport?,"From the official site: To make it onto the Olympic programme, a sport first has to be recognised: it must be administered by an International Federation which ensures that the sport's activities follow the Olympic Charter. If it is widely practised around the world and meets a number of criteria established by the IOC session, a recognised sport may be added to the Olympic programme on the recommendation of the IOC's Olympic Programme Commission. According to Chapter 5, Section III of the Olympic charter [pdf], every edition of the Olympics must include all ""core"" sports. These core sports are chosen by the Session upon proposal by the IOC Executive Board. In the summer, they must include at least 25 of the sports governed by the following 28 federations: 
- International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF)
- International Rowing Federation (FISA)
- Badminton World Federation (BWF)
- International Baseball Federation (IBAF)
- International Basketball Federation (FIBA)
- International Boxing Association (AIBA)
- International Canoe Federation (ICF)
- International Cycling Union (UCI)
- International Equestrian Federation (FEI)
- International Fencing Federation (FIE)
- International Association Football Federation (FIFA)
- International Gymnastic Federation (FIG)
- International Weightlifting Federation (IWF)
- International Handball Federation (IHF)
- International Hockey Federation (FIH)
- International Judo Federation (IJF)
- International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA)
- International Swimming Federation (FINA)

- International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF)
- International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF)
- World Archery Federation (WA)
- International Triathlon Union (ITU)
- International Sailing Federation (ISAF)
- International Volleyball Federation (FIVB)
 All of these except baseball and softball are currently part of the core. In winter, the core includes only the sports governed by the following seven federations: 
- International Biathlon Union (IBU)
- International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation (FIBT)
- World Curling Federation (WCF)
- International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF)
- International Luge Federation (FIL)
- International Skating Union (ISU)
- International Ski Federation (FIS)
 The Olympic Committee also recognizes a number of other sports; the committee session at which the host city is selected can also specify that some of these sports are to be included in that edition of the games, but only up to a maximum of 28 sports (which gives quite a bit of leeway in the winter games). For a sport's governing body to be recognized and hence be eligible for inclusion in the games, it must be in compliance with the World Anti-Doping Code; but the final decision rests solely with the committee as determined by a vote. Baseball and softball have been removed from the games as of the 2012 edition; this opens up two slots. Those slots will be filled by golf and rugby sevens in the 2016 games, bringing the total back to the maximum 28. Golf and rugby are not, however, part of the core, so they could be dropped as early as the 2020 games. From: http://registration.olympic.org/en/faq/detail/id/150 ""Softball, baseball, karate, squash, roller sports, wushu, wakeboard
  and sports climbing: one of these sports could be included on the
  sports programme of the 2020 Games. The decision will be made at the

Does the batsman get runs on No ball when the team requires only 1 run to win?,"I found it! When the batting team requires only 1 run to win and batsman scores run(s) on No ball it does not count towards batsman's runs. So in the given case the batsman will remain on 98 and batting side will win the match. Real Case: In the 3rd match between Sri Lanka and India in Sri Lanka Triangular Series, 2010 (between Sri Lanka, India and New Zealand), India required 1 run to win and Virender Sehwag was on strike with 99 runs. Suraj Randiv was the bowler. He bowled a No ball and Sehwag smashed a Six but still Sehwag remained on 99 runs because India won the match before he score runs. Have a look at commentary on Cricinfo (see from 35th over)."
How is 'distance covered' tracked in football (soccer) at the World Cup and during other official competitions?,"Several types of tracking technology exist, and the type used depends upon the the circumstances of the competition. In training, some teams are now tracking with systems like RedFIR, a German technology comprised of tiny (15 gram) radio transmitters that can be placed in uniforms, footwear or balls, and a network of receivers set up around the field. The system detects events like passes, crosses and goals, plus provides real-time info on player step count, speed, and distance covered. Fraunhofer IIS, the company that makes RedFIR, says that its radio-based system provides a major benefit over other tracking solutions: ""its tracking capability is not diminished by obstacles obscuring the line of sight."" But so far FIFA hasn't adopted the technology. This may be because rules changes would be required to implant the transmitters into balls. Also, players haven't been to receptive towards adding microchips to their shoes or shin guards during competition. FIFA relies on a visual tracking technology called ""Matrics"" made by the Italian company deltatre to provide data that make up the heat maps, passes completed and distance covered stats made available at the World Cup official site. From deltatre's webpage: deltatre can very proudly say to have successfully delivered 3 FIFA World Cups™ since 2002 (South Korea and Japan 2002, Germany 2006 and South Africa 2010) and a total of 1.191 matches including other FIFA Competitions: result of continuous investments in software, hardware, training and people. Motherboard provides a fascinating look at how ""Matrics"" is being used at the 2014 World Cup."
Why is drafting allowed on the bike in an Olympic triathlon and not otherwise?,"Because the swim is so short, it's unavoidable that people will be bunched up in the start of the bike. And then the bike is not long enough to spread out the packs.  In recreational races, the race organizers generally prefer to forbid drafting as a safety measure. In fact, their insurers probably mandate it.  It's just dang dangerous to have a bunch of newbies trying to draft in an olympic distance race. For the pros, this is not so much of a concern."
Why is American football called football?,"American football is called football because of its origin.  Its like soccer, can be traced back to rugby football where you use your feet to kick a ball at a goal or successfully carry a ball over a goal line.  Over time, some rules were changed such as the concept of line of scrimmage and of four downs and a certain distance required to get more downs and, of course, the forward pass. In earlier times, football had virtually no rules. If you wish, you can trace its ancestry back to the 1600's. I hope the following link will give pretty descriptive answer for your question."
What is the biggest comeback recorded in competitive international soccer matches?,"If we stick to a single game, VfL Bochum - Bayern München in 1976 (11 goals). Bochum were 3-0 up by the half-time whistle and 4-0 in 53th minute. In the next 20 minutes, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Gerd Muller took Bayern to an unbelievable 5-4 lead. 
Kaczor put Bochum level on 5-5 in the 80th minute and that seemed to be it, but with a minute to go Uli Höness scored his second and Bayern's sixth for their most amazing win ever. Over two legs, and I'm only including it because of how amazing it sounds, Bayer Uerdingen - Dynamo Dresden in 1986. A team of numerous East German stars built a 2-0 lead in the first leg at home and then ran away with a solid 3-1 lead at half time, seemingly clinching the tie in the return game at Krefeld. Dynamo were 5-1 ahead on aggregate, and the 1-3 scoreline stood until the 57 minute. The Icelander Gudmundsson won that dubious penalty kick, which Wolfgang Funkel converted. Six minutes later Gudmundsson himself made it 3-3. Then the unlucky forward Minge deflected a shot into his own net, and the Easterners found themselves utterly disoriented amidst roars from the partisan crowd. Bayer attacked in waves and the reserve Klinger brought the temperature to boiling point with the fifth goal 12 minutes from time.  5-5 on aggregate, but Dynamo were still ahead on the away-goals rule. Schäfer was knocked down in the area and Wolfgang Funkel again scored from the spot, making it 6-3 only 23 minutes after the scoreboard had shown the humiliating 1-3. Before the final whistle, in the total confusion, Schäfer picked up the seventh goal, ending up on the shoulders of his mates and the fans who invaded the pitch.

What are the team sports with more than two teams?,"I think you need to distinguish two separate attributes here: First, there are team sports, meaning multiple individuals work together, vs. individual sports.  And second, there are sports where the participants react to each others' actions vs. sports where the participants' performances are each measured on some objective scale and the best performer wins. As you pointed out, there are many team sports, in my sense, involving more than one team: track relays, swim relays, ski relays, team golf, team gymnastics, etc.  You can basically take any individual sport and make a team sport like this out of it.  But those are all sports where each performance is measured separately. But what your question was really aiming at, I think, is that there are apparently very few ""mutually reactive"" sports involving more than two parties.  This applies to both team sports and individual sports.  For example, individual sports such as tennis are normally played between two parties as well. There are some activities where you have multiple individuals all playing against each other, especially if you are willing to stretch the definition of ""sport"" a bit: For some card, board, and computer games, you can also have more than two teams playing against each other, but here you're getting quite far away from sports. I would also add and similar sports (e.g., cross-country skiing) because the importance of drag and/or pacemaking (rabbits) causes the participants to react to each others' moves, as opposed to just individually running as fast as they can, as in short distance running.  Each of these can be done in teams, not only as relays (more common in running, skiing), but also with all participants going at the same time (as is typical in cycling). Bicycle racing is a bit of a special case, because only one individual wins.  But they have teams, and the team's goal is to have one of their guys win, so it's almost the same thing.  Biathlon used to have team races where all four individuals from a team went at the same time, but the teams did not all start at the same time but were timed separately.  Speed skating has a team race, but the teams are at the opposite ends of the track, so they do not interact.  Short-track speed skating has relays, so the team does not cooperate within itself.  There might not be a crystal-clear example of what you are looking for.  But you could plausibly organize one, like a street race (marathon, say) for teams. Looking at those lists and thinking about it, I think the reasons why there aren't many clear examples of sports involving more than two teams playing against each other are mainly practical.  First, there are reasons of geometry.  Normally, opposing players and teams will face each other.  If you have more than two parties, you are very limited in what you can do.  Second, there are reasons of safety.  Most sports in this category involve balls, because that's how players play off each other, and if you have balls flying at high speeds in all directions, it could become dangerous.  Also, player contact will be dangerous if it is likely that more than one player can touch, tackle, or hit you. The best way to do this, then, is with sports that are slow, turn-based, and work well with a flexible or circular player arrangement.  The racing examples fit this as well, because the movement of the participants relative to each other is usually slow, safe, and flexible.  Or you escape from geometry and safety constraints by using computers."
Why don't any USA professional leagues use promotion/relegation?,"Lots of reasons. First, and primarily, there are a lot of sports, and sports teams, competing for spectators' attention in the U.S., and the subsequent ad dollars for TV airtime, stadium naming rights, on-field logos, etc. I realize there are other sports besides soccer in Europe, but the gap in overall popularity between association football and basketball or handball in Europe is much wider than the one between the big three team sports in the U.S. 
There are also more teams in each top-tier sports league in the U.S. than in the English Premiere League (or anywhere else in UEFA), with 32 NFL teams, and 30 teams each in the NBA, NHL and MLB. More teams means more games means more airtime needed. Second, and just as important, is risk/reward for the players. Gridiron football is a violent, dangerous sport, and to be picked in the NFL Draft says as much about your ability to avoid injury as it does for your skill. Despite this, ejections are relatively uncommon in gridiron football, so it's an exceptional case when a player is called to answer for causing injury to an opponent. The result is that, by the time a football player is drafted into the NFL, they may already be at the halfway point of their career in terms of the wear and tear on their bodies, which will stay with them the rest of their lives. There simply isn't enough reward inherent in playing the game at anything less then the premiere professional level to justify the risks the game presents. Association football, in contrast, is technically a non-contact sport; aggressive actions made towards opposing players are penalized. As a result, injuries in soccer, though they do happen, tend to be more minor, and players who deliberately injure opponents are held to account for those actions more frequently. That allows soccer players to have careers spanning decades, rather than the average of about 10 years that you see for NFL players other than QBs and kickers. Now, this emphasis on injury being against the spirit of the game is seen in other U.S. sports, even hockey in more recent times, and you do see longer careers in those leagues, with basketball and baseball players continuing to dress for games into their 40s. However, the mentality of ""move up or move aside"" is still prevalent as players grow up through the school leagues; if you don't end up playing for the pros, there's not much money or opportunity continuing to play past your college years. Which leads to the next reason; in the U.S., the player, not the team, is regarded as being mobile. The sports that do have notable minor leagues in the U.S., being baseball and hockey, typically have teams in various tiers that are either owned outright by one franchise or have partnership agreements. That's in addition to the prevalence of college sports teams in the U.S. (and by the by, if you want to see a loyal sports fan on the level of European soccer fans, don't look at the pros; look at college grads cheering their alma mater). The net result is that the player ""grows up"" through a series of teams, hopefully developing into a player that can compete in the premiere leagues, and the job of all the lower leagues is to help the player with that development, then let him go. In Europe, it's not just the player but the team that is mobile in the overall structure of the league. They player still grows, still develops, but the team that helped him do that is much more willing to try to hang on to him if they can, because this star striker or forward midfielder could be the ticket to a league championship and promotion. We still haven't gotten exactly to why the U.S. hasn't bought into that same mentality, though, and the next reason is the one I think is most important; geographical coverage. The U.S, without Alaska (no professional sports teams in that state to speak of), is about the same size as all of non-Nordic Europe combined. That means that maintaining a national fan base for a sports league in the U.S. requires paying very careful attention to the geographic dispersal of your teams. In England, you'll notice the EPL teams are concentrated in the London metro and the Manchester/Merseyside area, with Birmingham growing up as a third center for English football. That's mainly happened through promotion and relegation; teams in urban centers have more spectators, get more ticket and ad revenues, can afford to hire better players, and become better teams, moving up into the premiere league and forcing out the teams from outlying areas. Now, that's OK in a country with a total land size about the same as that of the U.S. Eastern Seaboard; if you want to cheer on a premiere-league team, there's one within a couple hours of pretty much any town in England. Or, as the commenter states, you can keep cheering for your hometown team even if they're not in the premiere league. In the U.S., however, that kind of league management would result in a disproportionate number of teams being crammed into the East Coast cities, much as the EPL's teams have gravitated to London and Manchester/Merseyside. That would place a lot of large ""heartland"" cities, each with populations in the millions, at least a day or more away from the nearest professional team by car. With no minor leagues to speak of due to the risk-reward problems of many of these sports, support for the sport in any form in areas without a major team would simply die out, robbing the leagues of valuable TV time. That would be compounded by the concentration of teams in the most populous areas, which force teams to fight each other for the biggest slice of the revenue pie. As a result, teams are carefully managed by franchise owners and league leadership to ensure that the teams are spread as evenly as can be supported around the populous areas of the U.S., giving each team a built-in home crowd. That, in turn, requires the teams to be kept on roughly equal footing; it's in the league's best interest to keep all of the teams it has financially healthy and competitive, and the two go hand in hand. So, instead of punishing franchises that can't buy a good team, we give the worst teams the first picks of new incoming talent. Instead of letting the richest teams self-perpetuate by spending more money on talent than anyone else can, we put salary caps in place to ensure no team can spend more than any other on their players. The current scheduling system even gives each team a game against a team from another conference they normally wouldn't play, with the same division ranking as their own, meaning the better teams have overall tougher opponents. This egalitarian approach lets dynasties rise and fall over a period of a few years each instead of a few decades (as is seen in baseball and in collegiate sports, where the school's reputation as a sports powerhouse is self-perpetuating over long timespans), and gives every franchise and every fan the best chance for their team's success."
What is the maximum number of red cards that a referee can give in a football match?,"There is no limit to the number of red cards that a referee can give, though the game would be stopped as soon as there are less than 7 players of a team remaining legally on the pitch. As of Law 3 in the FIFA Law Book, there cannot be less than 7 players of a team, on the field during play. In effect, a maximum of 4 on-field players of the same team can be dismissed. Once 5 on-field players (substitutes do not count) of the same team are red carded, the match ends.
If the referee has red-carded 4 players and all 7 substitutes of each team (22 players in total), the game can still continue, provided there are no further red cards to players of either side.  The law (for continuation of the game) however, states only the on-field players. There is no limit to the number of red cards that can be shown to the substitutes on the bench, the manager and the coaching staff. Also, red cards can be handed to the on-field players/substitutes/coaching staff after the game has ended based on the referee reports and video analysis (wherever applicable). The record for the most red-cards handed out in a single match is during a fifth tier Argentinian league game between Claypole and Victoriano Arenas, where 36 red cards were shown."
"Why is Ivory Coast being referred to as ""Côte d'Ivoire"" in the 2014 World Cup?","The answer is actually quite simple here. Côte d'Ivoire prefers to be referred to this way. Here's Wikipedia: Therefore, in April 1986, the government declared Côte d'Ivoire (or, more fully, République de Côte d'Ivoire) to be its formal name for the purposes of diplomatic protocol, and officially refuses to recognize or accept any translation from French to another language in its international dealings. In other words, they're Côte d'Ivoire, not Ivory Coast, because they say so."

Why isn't spiking the football intentional grounding?,"This is actually a special rule case.  Section 2 Intentional Grounding Item 3: Stopping Clock A player under center is permitted to stop the game clock legally to save time if,
  immediately upon receiving the snap, he begins a continuous throwing motion and throws the ball
  directly into the ground. So you may spike the ball to stop the clock if you do so immediately after receiving the ball. However: Item 4: Delayed Spike A passer, after delaying his passing action for strategic purposes, is prohibited
  from throwing the ball to the ground in front of him, even though he is under no pressure from
  defensive rusher(s). Thus waiting to do so is considered intentional grounding."
Really Fat Hockey Goalies,"Sports science actually ""tested"" this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP8ZVWiZUMA. They grabbed a professional sumo wrestler and dressed him up in goalie gear (even managing to put his leg pads on the wrong legs). They had NHL player George Parros shoot on him; they note in the video that Parros is not really known for scoring. This is true, and any average NHL scorer would demolish the goalie even more than Parros did. The fact of the matter comes down to how accurate NHL players truly are with their shots. The puck is incredibly small and can find even the smallest holes when on the stick of a sharpshooter. Goalies need to be agile and mobile, and even when they had two large people in net at the end of the video, Parros was able to snipe the ""5 hole"" of a mega-goalie."
What is the reason Men play 5 sets & Women play 3 sets in a Grand Slam in Tennis?,"In addition to diggers3's answer, I would add: Grand Slam (major) events are not ATP or WTA events - they are ITF
events and are not subject to the ATP's or WTA's rules. All non-major tournaments for both men and women are now best of 3 sets matches. Generally in tennis, when more is on the line (think $$) then best of 5 sets are played instead of best of 3. It is a more comprehensive test and ensures that one player (or doubles team) can outperform the other and not that one player was just ""hot"" or ""cold"" for a set or two. Other men's tournaments used to play best of 5 sets also - Masters
Series tournaments and the season-end Masters Cup (now World Tour
Finals) used to play the best of 5 sets format also but changed to
best of 3 in recent years. Tennis, as sports go, tends to be very entrenched in tradition and
doing something like changing men's grand slam matches from best of 5
sets to best of 3 would take a lot of convincing of those in
authority to make that change. In recent years, many tennis
journalists and media figures have suggested that the grand slam
events have the men play best of 3 sets up until the second week (or
QuarterFinals) - then switch to best of 5 beyond that. As far as having the women play best of 5 sets like the men - I do
not think that would be a good idea and would only contribute further
to player injury and fatigue. I think you would end up seeing more
retirements and walkover results than you do now. If anything, I

Would a catch that rebounded off a flying bird be a fair catch in Cricket?,"This is one of the reason why what we commonly think of as 'rules' of a sport are usually actually called 'laws'.  See the Laws of Cricket They are called Laws because you cannot possibly define to the very last possible detail every single possibility that might happen - such as the example here.  In cricket the laws are applied by the Umpires and their ruling is final (except in some cases where technological challenges are allowed in certain circumstances). So in the case here, the Umpire would apply Law 32 (Caught) - which states that one condition for a fair catch is that: (ii) the ball is at no time in contact with any object grounded beyond the boundary. A bird in the air, is not grounded beyond the boundary In addition it later states: a catch shall be considered fair if .... (f) the ball is caught off an obstruction within the boundary that has not been designated a boundary by the umpires before the toss. The umpires are not going to designate a temporary phenomenan such as a bird to be a boundary so this would clearly be a fair catch, and the batsman would be out."
What actions are taken by FIFA/UEFA against what's known as filming or diving,"Referees and FIFA are now trying to prevent diving with more frequent
  punishments as part of their ongoing target to stop all kinds of
  simulation in football. The game's rules now state that: ""Any
  simulating action anywhere on the field, which is intended to deceive
  the referee, must be sanctioned as unsporting behaviour"" which is
  misconduct punishable by a yellow card. The rule changes are in
  response to an increasing trend of diving and simulation.   FIFA , in order to improve detection, Increased the number of
  officials on the field – near the goals, where most dives occur – what
  make it easier to detect diving. Second, in order to increase the costs associated with diving.
  Progressive football leagues like the Australian A-League and the
  American MLS are using post-match video analysis to assign
  retrospective punishment to cheating players. In these countries, there’s strong competition from more physical
  footballing codes (such as rugby, or American football) for the
  sporting public’s attention, and there’s little patience for
  play-acting. MLS in the United States, for the 2011 season, began implementing
  fines and suspensions for simulation in football through its
  Disciplinary Committee, which has the right to review plays after the
  match.   On June 24, 2011, MLS penalized D.C. United forward Charlie
  Davies with a US$1,000 fine as the Disciplinary Committee ruled he:
  ""intentionally deceived the officials and gained an unfair advantage
  which directly impacted the match"" in a simulation that occurred in
  the 83rd minute of the match against Real Salt Lake on June 18, 2011. On July 29, 2011, the Disciplinary Committee suspended Real Salt Lake
  forward Álvaro Saborío one game and fined him US$1,000 for a
  simulation in a game against the San Jose Earthquakes on July 23,
  2011. Officials noted the simulation resulted in Earthquakes defender Bobby Burling being sent off on the simulation, and the warning from
  MLS that fines and suspensions will increase for simulation being
  detected by the Disciplinary Committee. Another unique scenario was with Juventus winger Milos Krasic who has been banned for two games by the Italian football league for diving.
Krasic won a controversial penalty in goalless draw at Bologna after falling inside the area.
Video replays, however, showed Bologna defender Daniele Portanova did not touch the player.
A statement from the league read:  ""The TV replay showed that there was no contact between the two
  players and that the player's dive was the cause for the referee to
  make a mistake."" But until these methods are adopted universally, you’ll just have to keep shouting at the television. Sources:

Why Great Britain or England/Scotland/Wales/Ireland in different sport?,"There's often a bit of confusion about this. First of all, this might help:
One of the main reasons for confusion is because there's muddling between political names (names of countries) and geographical terms (names of places). Here political names are in blue and geographical terms are in red
 Note: the term ""Republic of Ireland"" is often used but the correct name for Ireland the nation-state is simply Ireland. Secondly, the UK has a unique situation where both the constituent countries of the UK and the UK itself have the full status as a country. Politically they chose to be represented by the UK as a whole but it could be otherwise if the chose.
This being the case, the countries of the UK have in some cases chosen to be represented as the UK\GB and in others to represent themselves as they see fit. Ireland is a separate country and represents itself politically and in sports. In Ireland in many sports such as rugby, cricket and GAA, national federations had already been formed and these organisations continued to just keep doing as they were doing with the sports people from Northern Ireland and Ireland choosing to still be represented by these bodies. In other sports like football, there were differing opinions and people from Ireland chose to start a new governing body. The Football Association of Ireland was formed to govern football in Ireland (country) and the Irish Football Association, which had governed the whole country (when it was only one country), became the body for Northern Ireland only. The reasons why some sports went one way and some went the other is probably down to the demographics of the sport, but that's just opinion. In the Olympics: Since the first Olympics, the UK has chosen to be represented by one team. Now normally called ""Team GB"", the correct name would be ""Team Great Britain and Northern Ireland"", originally ""Team Great Britain and Ireland"". This is just for the Olympics and often countries represent themselves for competitions within individual sports. Since gaining independence in 1922(but dominion status until 1937), Ireland has competed individually in the Olympics. Since the Good Friday Agreement, citizens of Northern Ireland are entitled to citizenship of the UK, Ireland or both. They are thus entitled to represent either Team Ireland or Team GB in the Olympics. It would have been common before then though. With the unusually complicated nationality statuses, agreements with international governing bodies have had to be sought although in the case of older sports it was effectively continuing the existing arrangement. I'm sure I've left some holes, but there you go."
What is the sports bra looking thing soccer players wear?,"They are performance trackers. They track a player's vital statistics (heart rate, etc) as well as their movement, their average speed, their distance covered, etc. As for the ""bra-like"" design, it would appear to just be the result of needing a small and unencumbered design that allows for minimal interruption, maximum body contact, and full range of motion. Link to the manufacturer of Zlatan's bra"
"In swimming, is there a competitive advantage to being in one lane or another?","The reason the fastest swimmer is placed in the center lanes is because it's believed to be the ""coveted"" lane.  This is due to the fact that from lanes 4-5, you have the greatest visibility of swimmers in the other lanes.  This is an advantage because in competitive races, athletes are known to perform better when they realize a competitor is close.   Also, if a swimmer breathes to the right or left, he will always be able to see half of the field, whereas swimmers in the edge lanes don't have this advantage."
How does one get 5 points in a football game?,"You can also get 2 points for a safety, when the offensive team commits an infraction or is tackled in their own end zone. In addition to scoring 2 points, the defending team also receives the ball via a free kick. They are rare, but there have already been a few this season.  So these are the possible ways to score: In the game you are referencing, there was a safety and then a field goal, resulting in a 5 point score for Seattle. *A Two Point Conversion or a Point After Touchdown can only be attempted immediately following a scored touchdown. The team must choose to attempt one or the other."
Which offences result in indirect free kicks?,"The penalty kick is a kind of penalty used if and only if a team commits an offense warranting a direct free kick inside its own penalty area, in which case, a penalty kick is used instead of the direct free kick. As this does not apply to indirect free kicks, nothing is special there. The only special case here is that there are specific offenses warranting an indirect free kick which apply only inside your own penalty area; those are specific for the goalkeeper. (Not that those offenses would be handled specially inside the penalty area, just that they cannot occur anywhere else by definition/plain logic.) Therefore, an indirect free kick inside the penalty area is awarded to the attacking team if either I believe indirect free kicks for the “generic” offenses are quite rare in penalty area; the offense would usually be either ignored completely, or a “similar” offense warranting a direct free kick and therefore a penalty kick would be ruled instead, etc. However, these do happen. A quick example video found with Google: during the 36th minute of Real Madrid CF vs Sevilla on April 29, 2012, Fazio played with a high foot on Ronaldo inside the penalty area, and an indirect free kick against Sevilla for playing in a dangerous manner was awarded. See this YouTube video: Free kick inside the penalty box ? Real Madrid v Sevilla 29. (Please disregard the confused/mistaken title and some comments). And note that there is one specialty regarding the procedure for an indirect free kick awarded to the attacking team: If the indirect free kick was awarded inside the goal area, the kick must be taken on the goal area line parallel to the goal line at the point nearest to where the infringement occurred."
Is it possible to shoot from a corner so that the ball directly goes into the goal without being hit by other players?,"Yes, it is possible to score a goal directly from a corner. It has happened many times in professional leagues across the world as well as in international games. This type of goal also has a specific name, being an Olympic Goal."
Why is a foul bunt on strike three an out?,It is much easier to make contact with a pitch on a bunt than with a regular swing. The foul out on a bunt rule basically exists to speed up play and prevent gamesmanship on the part of the batter.  If the batter could always bunt on strike two then batters like the pitcher and other poor hitters would walk significantly more often because it is easier for them to make even a little contact with a decent pitch than it is for the pitcher to continue to throw strikes.
What is best for hydration during a run?,"Being a runner myself I used to take a bottle of water with me which was great for interval training. I could drink when I was walking to recover. Nowadays I'm starting to run without stops and leave the bottle at home and drink before and after my run. Here is a link with some more information: If you're looking for a general rule of thumb for fluid consumption during your runs: You should take in 4 to 6 ounces of fluid every 20 minutes during your runs. Runners running faster than 8-minute miles should drink 6 to 8 ounces every 20 minutes. During longer workouts (90 minutes or more), some of your fluid intake should include a sports drink (like Gatorade) to replace lost sodium and other minerals (electrolytes). The carbohydrates and electrolytes in the sports drink also help you absorb the fluids faster. As for carrying I used to hold the water bottle in my hand because I also found that the carrying belt looks uncomfortable. edit: I bought a water bottle belt which holds 2 small bottles. No big discomfort while running. Actually in my opinion ( after using a belt ) its better to use a belt to then holding it in your hand."
Red and black side of table tennis raquet,"According to the official rules (referenced here): Rule 2.04.06  The surface of the covering material on a side of the blade, or of a
  side of the blade if it is left uncovered, shall be matt, bright red
  on one side and black on the other. The reasons for this rule are described here: The Two Colour Rule Since 1 July 1986 the rules of table tennis state that one side of the
  racket shall be bright red and the other side black. This rule was introduced because of the increased use of ""combination""
  rackets in the late 70s and early 80s. Players were using the same colour rubber on each side of their racket
  - but each side was a different type of rubber - and this made it very difficult for the opponent to know what type of spin was being
  imparted onto the ball. So if you're planning on taking part in authorised table tennis
  events, make sure that you buy the correct colours. Another article suggests that: In table tennis the two color rule is used to ensure that the opponent
  has a fair chance of telling which side of the bat has been used to
  hit the ball. Before the two color rule was introduced, any color
  could be used for table tennis rubbers, and players were using
  combination bats with the same color on both sides and twiddling the
  bat, making it very difficult to tell which side was hitting the ball. This was considered to produce table tennis which was not spectator
  friendly, since it was difficult for uninformed spectators to
  understand why players were making seemingly simple mistakes. It seems that the rule was made to make competition more fair - it would give opponents a chance to determine the type of spin that was being imparted and also to make the game more fun to watch."
What is the stuff referees spray on the ground in Football matches?,"It's called ""Vanishing foam"". It is used by the referees to indicate the minimum distance the players must maintain from ball, in the event of a free kick, as well as the spot from where it is taken. Some technical details:
The can contains water (~80%), butane gas (~17%), surfactant (~1%), and other ingredients including vegetable oil (~2%). The foam is now authorised for use in top flight football for the Bundesliga in Germany, however Germany's consumer protection agency has banned it due to greenhouse gas concerns, Serie A in Italy, Ligue 1 in France, La Liga in Spain, the Premier League in England, the Synot liga in Czech Republic, the A-League in Australia and Thai Premier League in Thailand.

"In football, what rules handle a player changing their position with the goalkeeper?","According to Law 3 of FIFA Laws of the game. Any of the other players may change places with the goalkeeper, provided that:  I could not find mention of the changing of the jersey, but as per custom, usually the goalie in indicated by wearing a different color. "
Can the second-to-last defender cause an offside by leaving the field of play?,"You count all the players on the field. It doesn't matter if they are lying on the field, looking anywhere else or what are they doing.  If the defender goes outside of the field because of a situation of the game (e.g. can't stop his run), he is still counted.  If the defender is outside of the field receiving medical attention, he is not counted (he was out of the field before the ball was in play). If the defender steps out of the field on purpose, then he is not only counted, he should be cautioned (shown a yellow card) for unsporting behaviour."
Why do Olympic soccer teams need to be U-23?,"Indeed Olympic football rules are different for men and women tournament and preliminary (qualifying) and final (Olympics) competitions: Men’s Tournament Women’s Tournament Please note that the men over 23 can only play at the Olympic finals, not the preliminary or qualifying rounds. Source: Regulations of the Olympic Football Tournaments A little bit of history: For the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the IOC decided to admit professional
players.   FIFA still did not want the Olympics to rival the World
Cup, so a compromise was struck that allowed teams from Africa, Asia,
Oceania, and CONCACAF to field their strongest professional sides,
while restricting UEFA and CONMEBOL teams to players who had not
played in a World Cup.
Many countries fielded young teams, including
France, who won the 1984 Olympic title. Since 1992 male competitors must be under 23 years old, with three over-23 players  allowed per squad. The new format allows teams from around the world to compete
equally, and African countries have taken particular advantage of
this, with Nigeria and Cameroon winning in 1996 and 2000 respectively. The first women's tournament was at the 1996 Atlanta Games. Source"
How can I graduate from single to multiple pitch climbs?,"So, as no-one has answered, I thought I'd pop up some of the info I found in my research. It doesn't seem to matter much whether the leader continues or whether you swap leads, however leading for a couple of pitches and then swapping may get your hand in with placing anchors on that climb. Weigh this up against fatigue. The key piece for all multi-pitch climbs is rope handling at each belay point - this is where some additional techniques and practices come into play: From Petzl's guidance: Everyone should be directly or indirectly clipped to 2 separate
  anchors (using locking carabiners). Attaching the climbing rope with a
  clove-hitch to the anchor allows for simple adjustments so there's no
  slack in the system. Never rely on a single carabiner at the belay
  station! A sling between the two belay points with a central carabiner allows for equal weight distribution and safety.  Two aspects I had not considered at all - where to prepare the rope for the next climb (if you let it hang it will catch, so you need to coil somehow, but on a narrow ledge your options are limited - go for hooking through a carabiner or over your fixed rope) and where to place your first clip on the next climb (this is important, as your 2 belay point anchors will not be set to withstand a fall from above) Another quick comment from outdoorsmagic.com advises thinking about where you stand at belay points depending on whether you are left or right handed to make rope handling as easy as possible on the climb."
Father and son who were active players at the same time in NFL/NBA/NHL/MLB? [closed],"Absolutely.  Ken Griffey Jr. and Ken Griffey Sr. played together in 1990 for the Seattle Mariners.  They once hit back to back home runs in a game. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G2AnNdjBu4 http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CAL/CAL199009140.shtml They played about a month together (8/31 to the end of the season). In Hockey, Gordie Howe played with his sons Mark and Marty in 1979-80 for the Hartford Whalers.  Wikipedia has a nice page with a list of familial relations in the NHL (they seem to have more than most leagues, probably because the sport is less popular so more likely for familial relations to be successful).  The direct link to the Howes' is at Legends of Hockey. In the NFL, it doesn't look like anyone really did in the modern era due to the very short career length compared to other sports (except for kickers); in the 1920s, Ted and Charles Nesser played together, Ted as player-coach, and I don't doubt a few more similar occurrences would be found if you looked through the 10s and 20s.   George Wilson coached his son (also George) for the 1966 Miami Dolphins, the only example of that I found.  Ed and Brad Budde were the closest to playing with each other from the list I saw, Ed playing 1963-1976 for the Chiefs and Brad joining the Chiefs in 1980-1986.  This is from a list of father-son relationships from the Pro Football HOF. From the comments, Leatherwing noted that Wikipedia also has a good NBA Father/Son page; Kobe Bryant nearly overlapped with Bean, his father (1992/1996)."
Is running uphill harder or easier than running downhill?,"Running uphill is harder...if you know how to run downhill effectively.  Running downhill requires rapid feet, and shorter than normal strides - specifically so you DON'T catch yourself. Think of a 500 pound stone falling towards your head.  You wouldn't try to catch it, instead you should just try to flick it to the side (and slide your body the other way). When running downhill, this is exactly what's happening. A huge stone (the Earth) is coming at you quickly, and you can't stop it. So instead, with a quick foot movement you flick it behind you, and slide your body forward.  This takes practice, guts, and more practice!  But, it's faster, and MUCH easier than over striding, slamming your heels down, and constantly trying to stop gravity from pulling you down the hill. Don't try this for the first time in a race, especially not a trail race, as you need to learn the footwork to be safe, and to control the inevitable adrenaline rush as you realize you're one misstep away from eating it!!"
What happens if a suspended player is used in match and the referee didn't notice,"Different competitions have different suspension rules. However, in most major competitions, it is not the job of the referee to check for eligibility of the players in a team's lineup. That job is given to an official provided by the competition organizers. This official shall check that every player mentioned in the team list (including substitutes) is eligible as per the competition rules.  If even this official does not spot that a suspended player has been selected, the match can either be handed to the opposing team by forfeit, or be replayed, again depending on competition rules or decision made by the organizers of the competition. For example, in the third qualifying round for the 2014/15 UEFA Champions League, Scottish club Celtic should have lost 6-1 on aggregate to Polish club Legia Warsaw. After losing the away game 4-1, Celtic then lost 2-0 at home. However, it transpired that Legia had used a suspended player as a substitute towards the end of the second leg. Celtic were consequently awarded a 3-0 victory and went through on away goals after the aggregate score was tied at 4-4."
Why does safety car start at the end of the racing grid?,"The car that is behind the grid at the start is not the safety car but the medical car.  The actual cars look similar, but there are two separate cars.  The safety car pull into the pits before the race cars line up for the start. The reason the medical car waits there is that there is thought to be a higher chance of crashes immediately at the start.  This doesn't seem to happen so much anymore, fortunately, so it's perhaps a bit of a relic, but it doesn't bother anyone, so why change it."
Why does every American sport except Football seem to have a farm league?,"There are a few differences between American Football and other sports that lead to this: particularly, the length of playing careers (shortest by far), and the cost of running a team (largest by far).   NFL teams are very large, with 53 players active of whom 46 play on any given Sunday, and every single one is typically utilized except perhaps a backup QB - compared to a baseball team (25, of which 12 or so play most days), hockey team (25), or basketball team (15, of which many teams use single digits in most games).  Assuming a true minor league existed - where the game was played the same as it is at the pro level, which is fairly important for the minor league to have value - you'd need similar roster sizes, certainly at least 40 per squad; that would cost a lot of salary. Football also is the most dangerous of sports, which means it would have substantially higher expenses for doctors and health insurance; it also probably would need to pay players significantly more (minor league baseball players make very little, so a minor league team is pretty cheap - lots of players who have no shot at the majors, just filling spots, at $30k a year).  If it were a true minor league, with nearly NFL size players (so 280-300 lb offensive and defensive linemen, etc.) you'd need to pay people appropriately.  Semipro football is a thing and people certainly enjoy playing it for very little or no money, but they're not playing at the intensity and with players of the size of NFL players.  You wouldn't be able to get away paying people peanuts.   The current Arena Football League, which is not really a minor league - the size isn't comparable - pays about $15k in salaries per player; but the talent level isn't nearly the NFL level that it would need to be.  The earlier Arena league, which did have close enough to NFL talent that it had some elements of a minor league system (ie, it wasn't uncommon for good Arena players to go to the NFL), paid much more - 31k minimum, 80k average.  They also went bankrupt quickly.  The current one is doing better, but even now isn't entirely financially sound - and that's with a lower quality of player at the lower salary level.  The CFL pays about 80,000 a year, which is probably the only league that can truly claim to be sufficient quality that it could fill in as a minor league system directly. The NFL does have the practice squad, which serves some of the purposes of a minor league team (ie, some talent that they work with regularly to learn the systems, and can call up to the main team when someone gets hurt).  I imagine the size of that squad (8 players) is well defined by the actual needs of teams - if everyone needed more, they'd increase that size. All of this is notwithstanding the fact that there have been multiple attempts to sell smaller leagues as NFL minor leagues.  The USFL tried in 2012, now the FXFL is giving it a shot... who knows what will happen, but I suspect the same as in the past: a few years of failure followed by league closure.  College football and NFL football just are too successful right now at chasing viewers to lose out to a new minor league.  The major attraction of minor league baseball is watching professional baseball in your home town - and colleges provide that for football."
What is a good way to run during the winter? [closed],"How funny, I just got back from a run through 0c/32f weather.  I quite dislike treadmills as well.  First, I think you should definitely invest in a nice set of colder-weather running apparel.  Long pants, gloves, a hat or headband, and at least a long-sleeve technical shirt.  A technical shirt will keep your body dry, important for keeping warm in the cold.  A running jacket would be nice too, but I find I don't need one until about 20f/-7c, above that it makes me sweat too much and (as I mentioned above) that's not good for winter running.  If it's not snowing hard or particularly icy, you should be fine in your regular shoes.   You can also mix up your regimen a bit.  Unless you're an elite runner who needs to keep improving, just concentrate on getting enough exercise to maintain your fitness.
Shift more towards cross-training, in particular things you can do inside, like a stationary bike or swimming. Find an indoor track, if you can, and do intervals or other speed work.  Lift two, maybe three times a week (you should be at least once a week anyway; and remember, you're toning, not bodybuilding).  I'd say you should get four runs in each week,  which can include one speed day. If there happens to be inclement weather on a day you were going to do a run outside, you can either swap with an indoor day (once, you shouldn't go three days in a row without running), or suck it up and use a treadmill.   The bit about getting sick in the cold is an old wive's tale. Cold weather doesn't put viruses or bacteria in your lungs. In fact, running (as long as you don't chronically overexert yourself) generally improves your immune system.  "
Has there ever been a situation where the outfielder has intentionally dropped a foul ball to prevent a run from scoring from third?,Absolutely. I can remember at least a couple of games I've watched where the game was tied and a deep fly ball was hit into foul territory with a runner on 3rd - the outfielder just let it drop so that they didn't have to try and make the throw to home plate to try and get the runner out that would have been tagging up. 
What percent of corner kicks turn into goals?,"The percent of goals from corners is changing from league to league, for one competition to another and for one year to another.
For example on 2010 World Cup 1 goal scored for every 70 corners taken,  but generally the ratio of corners to goals is almost zero. Take a look at Ratio of Corners to Goal in the EPL
 You can see that Fulham who has the best ratio has 0.07 goals for corner. The most extensive articles I came across it was:

What's the reasoning behind the Uncaught Third Strike Rule?,"The exception about first base being unoccupied is to prevent a catcher from intentionally dropping a third strike and then getting a double-play.  If there are two outs, that prevention isn't necessary. As for the reasoning behind the rule itself, I can't find a definitive resource, but speculation is that an out needs a successful defensive player and an unsuccessful offensive player to occur."
Does the defense have to defend the extra point?,"From the NFL rulebook, Rule 5, Section 1, Article 1: The game is played by two teams of 11 players each. If a snap, free kick, or fair-catch kick is made while a team has fewer than 11 players on the field of play or the end zone, the ball is in play, and there is no penalty. So from a technical standpoint, the Packers did not have to field any players, as they would not have received a penalty for not having 11 players on the field. They may have been hit with an Unsportsmanlike Conduct penalty, although since the game was over, it wouldn't have meant much. Rule 5, Section 2, Article 11 (emphasis mine): Using entering substitutions, legally returning players, substitutions on sidelines, or withdrawn players to confuse opponents, or lingering players leaving the field when being replaced by a substitute, is unsportsmanlike conduct. However, I doubt that fielding no players because of frustration would qualify as confusing opponents. Bringing the team back to defend the extra point was about Mike McCarthy's integrity. He wanted to stay professional despite miscommunications at the end of the game. McCarthy later stated: We're in tune with staying true to the integrity of the Green Bay Packers. How we conduct ourselves, being professional during a tough time, during a challenge, a different challenge, but I'm excited about overcoming it. I look at this as an opportunity to put another feather in our cap."
Why does a marathon start need to be near its finish for a record to count,"Several other traditional marathon courses - notably the Polytechnic Marathon (Windsor to Chiswick) which hosted a few WRs in its time - are also not record-valid under this rule, which is relatively recent. Ken Young of the Association of Road Race Statisticians has done a lot of work on the effects of wind direction on race times, and has published an overview of his work on the topic. Some 20 years ago, I worked out a simple model that demonstrated runners could receive a significant tail wind benefit on a course whose start and finish lay more than 30% of the race distance apart. Young asserts, and I believe he's right, that his work is the basis of the USA's current 30% separation rule. The IAAF rule of 50% separation is more lax, and Young believes still allows for what he considers ""unacceptable"" benefit. (Young also believes records set by women in races which include men should not be accepted either, but that's another story entirely.)"
Who keeps the record of each international cricket match?,"The local governing body will determine what status particular games are - First Class, List A, Test, ODI, T20 International and whatever.  As a consequence internationals of whatever form are ratified by the board - or boards - involved. The scorers for a game, normally appointed by the teams (law 4), will have to submit their (agreed) cards to that governing body.  The national boards will keep their own record, but there's no 'official' body for results and statistics.  The ICC lay down a lot of rules and guidelines for many aspects of the games, but I can't find anything mandating that particular feeds should be available to third parties. The ICC haven't yet tried to copyright the scores (as some American sports leagues have tried to).  For example, Wisden is explicitly (#20) unofficial!"
Can a batsman be given out if a ball deflected by a helmet or pad is caught?,"When this question was asked in 2012, the batsman will not be given out if the ball hits the bat and then the helmet of the wicket keeper or any other fielder before the catch is taken. But pads are similar to gloves for a keeper; hence if the ball hits the bat and then hits the pad and then is caught by a fielder, the batsman is out. However, the 2017 update to the Laws meant that catches can be taken after the ball hits a fielder's helmet; quoting from the MCC's summary of the changes: A change has been made so that the ball can be caught after it strikes a helmet which is being worn by a fielder or the wicket-keeper"
Technology behind the 'rev counter' for spin bowlers?,"As there is no official wording from Sky Sports on technology behind Rev Counter there were two possible theories, one would be high-speed camera coupled to a computer running an image recognition/analysis program as mentioned in the Physics StackExchange Question. Which would be challenging in that given time frame.Other one is 3D Doppler Tracking that is used in products developed by company FlightScope to measure Golf Ball data, which can be used to measure variables like ball speed, spin rate, spin axis, and many more.    As they have mentioned in this Company link about the use of their technology in Cricket Ball Tracking.

"Why was offside introduced, and are there reasons for keeping it?","Being a football player since very young (I'm from Argentina :) ) I just could explain my point of view.  When you have a casual game without offside, ball movement in the field is very weird: there is not much strategy filling spaces in the middle, and it is very common to just put the ball as far as you can in the opponent field. This makes the game more appealing, meaning matches have a lot of goals (like in 5 vs 5 games in a reduced field), but also make it more boring, as defenders being so close to their goalkeeperm make it harder to score. So the game loses a lot of balance in a big field. There where some attemps to change the rule. I can remember a younger continental championship when the rule was enforced but only inside the goal area. That was the only test, but I remember defenders standing on that line, and not attacking because there were a lot of field to cover. IMHO this rule enforces the game to be played in a smaller part of the pitch, and allow defenders to try to attack without leaving an empty space for an attacker. (although there are situations where the attackers just go alone, and counter attacks are common, but that only resides in the ability of the defending team in clearing the ball fast enough). According to FIFA's History of the Laws of the Game, the rule was always there, but was changed in time. At first, it looked a lot like rugby, because the law enforced all players not to be ahead of the ball. Then it changed into a 3 players rule (you need 3 players in front of you to not be offside). Some time later (but we are talking about a game that is over 200 years old), the rule was enforced using 2 players. Then the line was moved form behind the second player into the same line. The last thing I heard was that a board will propose a change to the rule, but as far as I know, there are not any words about it. (and please correct me if i'm wrong)."
How can I get started in golf?,"To play golf, the first thing you need is a set of clubs. I will echo iandotkelly; used clubs are the beginner's best friend. People get rid of clubs all the time, either because they bought new ones or because they've had enough and are giving up the game. Look for local garage sales, check bulletin boards at local public courses, take a look at the 'List or the 'Bay, and check the ""pre-owned"" racks at local golf stores (Golfsmith deals heavily in used clubs from trade-ins at local stores). Judging by what I've seen, you should be able to put together a good set of clubs with bag for about $300 if you buy used clubs from a retailer. If you luck out at a garage sale or Craigslist listing, you could walk away with a full set of nice clubs for $25-$50 if the guy just wants to be rid of them. Contrasting that, buying a full set in a bag from a reputable brand like Adams or Macgregor will start at $500, and buying new components separately (driver, woods, iron set, wedges and putter) can easily run you over a grand. Don't do that until you know what you want in a set of clubs to fit your game (and are rich/interested enough to justify it). When assembling your clubs, the minimum you will want is a driver, 3-wood, a numbered iron set (typically from 3 or 4 through pitching wedge), a sand wedge and a putter. That's 11 to 12 clubs and will allow you to play from pretty much any lie. Once you identify the types of clubs you use best, or situations in which you don't have a good club for the job, you can add two or three clubs and look at replacing clubs in order to play to your strengths or fill in the gaps. Common additions are a 5-wood, for fairway shots where you'd normally use a hard-to-hit long iron; hybrids to replace long irons; and additional wedges to dial in the right distance in your short game. Things to look for in your first set of clubs: Cavity-back irons. These irons will remove material from the middle of the clubhead, and instead place most of it low and rearward, and the rest around the perimeter of the clubhead. This design is favored by the casual player because it is more forgiving of slight mis-hits (it can be said to have a larger ""sweet spot""). Ten to fifteen years ago, these designs were brand new and the used market was full of the older, less forgiving ""muscle-back"" designs as golfers traded up. Now, these cavity designs are plentiful in the secondhand market, and honestly, this was the last real quantum leap in clubhead design, so you won't lose much technology-wise going used. Regular flex on graphite shafts. The used market is littered with clubs bought by people who thought the club made the golfer, and so went for stiff-shaft, 9.5*-loft drivers because that's the club their favorite tour pro uses, then got rid of it because they could only hit 200-yard worm-burners. The majority of golfers will get the best performance out of a 10.5*, regular-flex driver configuration, and regular flexes on any other graphite shafts in their club set (virtually all woods have graphite shafts; they're also common on hybrids. Graphite vs steel on the long irons is a personal preference, but virtually all short irons and wedges are steel-shafted for consistency). These configurations, because they do work well for the average golfer, are rarer than the outliers on used racks, but you can usually find a few good candidates. A slight draw bias on the driver. Again, a lot of players want the best and so they buy a driver labelled ""tour"" because they think they're getting the best quality. What they don't realize is that a Tour driver has either no bias, or a slight fade bias to correct for clubhead torquing with their stronger swing. In the hands of a casual golfer, a driver like this will probably push-slice uncontrollably. Most golfers, again, benefit from using a ""game improvement"" driver (typically marketed as just a regular driver), which has a slight 1-2* bias toward closing the face of the club, to compensate for the natural tendency to open the clubface when you just ""grip it and rip it"". However, avoid ""max game improvement"" or ""draw"" drivers; these have an extreme draw bias, up to 5* towards closed, and are intended for people who just can't stop slicing their driver and are unable or unwilling to change their swing. Learn how to swing a ""regular"" driver straight, and you'll minimize bad habits. A good putter. If there's one club that you should buy new for your first set, it's your putter. The pros drive for show, but putt for dough; putting is a high-precision, high-finesse aspect of golf, and it's where you make or break pars and birdies. So, you'll want a putter that feels good in your hands, that you can swing with the proper tempo and in line. Good, late-model used putters don't tend to hit the racks as often as other clubs (players will take their time looking for the right putter, and will stick with it for a very long time), and when they do they're snapped up quickly, but keep an eye out. There are dozens of designs of putter, all varying subtly in weight distribution, hosel/shaft positioning, visual cues, etc which can make one putter better than another for you. Learning to putt well is frustrating as it is; the last thing you want to do is have to compensate for a putter that feels ""wrong"", or is out of alignment. Any inaccuracy in putting should be all you, so you know what to fix. You will likely also want a glove for your ""leading hand""; whichever hand is closer to the butt end of the grip (for a right-hander this will be your left hand). This glove will allow you to get a better grip on the club and will avoid blisters. Lastly, you'll want comfortable clothing that doesn't restrict movement. Golf attire is traditionally unfashionable, and even modern stuff can sometimes be a little out there, but there's good stuff too; while you can buy specialized clothing, all you really need is a polo shirt and a pair of casual-wear khaki shorts or slacks (not dress slacks) that fit you well and allow free range of motion. A lot of brands are touting ""moisture-wicking synthetics"" for athletic wear that breathe well and keep you dry, but I know plenty of players that swear by a good ol' 100% cotton polo. Your choice; down here in Texas, hot is hot, and color is more important than fabric. Once you have the equipment, you'll probably want a lesson. Check your local driving ranges for a ""group lesson"", or if you have some money to spend, get a private lesson. If you have absolutely zero money, or just want to try learning yourself, there are many online resources from Youtube vids to blog posts about everything having to do with the golf swing. As much as the pros say it's an easy, natural movement, the golf swing is a very complex motion, and as golf is a precision sport, small changes can have big impacts. Having a coach look at your own individual swing and correct the things you're doing wrong will help you, but you may just want to go out and hit a bucket before calling in the coach, so you can get a feel for your new clubs. Before you hit the links, you should be able to hit every club in your bag straight enough that people on the path won't be cowering behind their carts, and consistently enough that you can predict where it will fly and compensate for any inherent push, pull, draw or fade in the flight path of your ball. You should also be making good contact with the ball with every swing (no whiffs, tops, thin or fat shots). This will allow you to put the ball where you want it on the course and avoid the 20-yard walk of shame from the tee box after topping your drive.  And don't forget your putter; remember that par is based on 2 putts, for good reason, and so for a typical par-72 course, fully half of those strokes will be putts if you know what you're doing. Lots of driving ranges and courses have chipping and putting greens, but you may have to pay more to use them. A game or three of miniature golf can help with getting a good putting line, but it can also hurt; miniature golf uses artificial turf and artificial terrain slopes, which generally make for ""fast"" putts and relatively easy-to-read shots; a real putting green will have less even grass, a ""grain"" inherent in the way the grass grows, and a slope (and natural variations thereof) to its surface which will make putts break, and a good short-game player must learn to read these elements and adjust their putting line. If you watch the pros play, you'll notice their secret; putt with exactly the strength needed to get to the hole, so that if you don't put it in the hole it's right there for the tap-in instead of a ""knee-knocker"" (close enough that you're expected to hole it, but far enough to miss). Practice doing this; putt towards the hole from varying distances, and work on getting the ball within a foot of the cup (if it goes in from 10 feet, great; if it doesn't you have an easy second putt). There are many techniques for getting the proper putting power; the two most common are a pendulum swing (vary the backswing by the amount of power you need, and then simply relax and let the putter fall through the arc) and a ""power putt"" (take a short backswing, then add the proper power from your trailing hand into and through the ball). These both take a lot of practice. You will also want the following for a round of 18 holes of real golf:"

Your core muscles includes all the main muscle groups in you torso and increasing the strength of these will not only help with your running but also with all sorts of back problems if you have a desk job like me. See about.com for a pretty good introduction to core training. Very few core exercises requires any equipment.
What is the difference between balls in Test and ODI Cricket?,"Differences between red and white balls can vary based on the manufacturers.  Kookaburra maintains that their red and white balls are manufactured using the same process apart from the dye used for colouring. They claim that the swing properties of both the balls are similar - as everything, apart from the colour, are the same. This, however, is disputed by the players and researchers who claim that the white ball swings more. Dukes has a different manufacturing process for each of the balls. They claim and tests have proven that the white ball infact swings more than their traditional red balls. This is due to a polyurethane coating on top of the white-dyed leather to ensure that the ball does not get dirty quickly. This coating makes the ball smoother and changes its aerodynamics thereby assisting swing. Going by players feedback and researchers findings, to generalize You can read more about this here, here and in better detail here."
"In volleyball when is it considered ""Reaching over the net""?","There are only two (different) actions when you are permitted to reach beyond (over) the net: blocking and attack hit. In your case, you are allowed “to kill” their pass if: So, for the most common case: No, you are not allowed to touch the ball beyond the net to stop an oponents’ pass which is going parallel to the net. Sources:
FIVB Official Volleyball Rules 2013–2016: 11.1 REACHING BEYOND THE NET (11.1.1) In blocking, a player may touch the ball beyond the net, provided that
  he/she does not interfere with the opponent’s play before or during the
  latter's attack hit. (11.1.2) After an attack hit, a player is permitted to pass his/her hand beyond
  the net, provided that the contact has been made within his/her own
  playing space. […] (14.1.1) Blocking is the action of players close to the net to intercept the ball
  coming from the opponent […] […] 14.3 BLOCKING WITHIN THE OPPONENT’S SPACE In blocking, the player may place his/her hands and arms beyond the
  net, provided that this action does not interfere with the opponent’s
  play. Thus, it is not permitted to touch the ball beyond the net until an
  opponent has executed an attack hit. And, FIVB Rules of the Game Casebook – 2013 Edition: 3.32 On a second hit, a player passed the ball near the net towards the opponent’s court. The ball did not penetrate the vertical plane of the net. In the 1st referee's opinion, no player of ‘A’ could possibly reach the ball. The blocker of ‘B’ reached across the plane of the net and blocked the ball. What is the correct decision of the 1st referee? Ruling Even though it was only the second team hit, if the ball is moving in the direction to the opponent's court, it is an attack hit. Because, in the referee's opinion, no player of ‘A’ could possibly have reached the ball, the block of ‘B’ was legal. (Rules 13.1.1, 14.3) 3.36 A player reached over the net to block the second hit of the opponent’s setter. The 1st referee did not blow his whistle. Is it legal for the blocker to reach over the net to block an opponent's “setting” action? Ruling It is absolutely necessary for the 1st referee to determine the action of the setter. He/She must know whether the set was made parallel to the net or was going towards the net, thus making it an attack hit.  In the first case, the blocker would be at fault because the ball was not ""coming from the opponent"".  In the second case, the set was ""coming from the opponent"" and should therefore be considered to be an attack hit which may be blocked. According to Rule 14.3, it is not a fault to block an attack hit beyond the net. It is important for the referee to be able to differentiate between a ""set"" and an attack using an overhand pass. (Rules 14.1.1, 14.3) 3.40 A player passed the received ball so, that it would have crossed the net if not touched by another player of the same team. The setter was in position to make a legal play on the ball. The opponent’s blocker reached across the vertical plane of the net and blocked the ball before the setter could play it. The 1st referee called a fault on the block.  Is this a correct decision of 1st referee? Ruling The 1st referee’s decision was correct, and the block was illegal. Blockers may not contact the ball across the net until the attack hit is executed, except when in the judgment of the 1st referee, no possibility exists for further play of the ball by the attacking team. (Rule 14.3)"
What are the main safety risks of fencing?,"I am an assistant fencing coach for a collegiate club. Several injury risks I've encountered: Poked in the eye/face/chest/""below the belt""/etc: This is most common. Being accidentally poked in some places are less severe than others, but it is still a common risk. In addition, the tip at the end of your fencing weapon may be loose or missing. A weapon without a tip is more painful than with one. Twisted ankles (ligament tears are less common, but possible): In some fencing positions, one is susceptible to twisted ankles/ligament tears simply by shifting your weight the wrong way. An example: After a lunge, you can twist your ankle causing the rest of that side of your lower body to collapse. A member actually suffered ligament tears in her knee when I was a student, and was in a full leg brace for about a year. To prevent these risks: Safety first. Use common sense. Don't put yourself or others at risk. Take time to learn the fundamentals. Many people are interested in fencing because it ""looks cool,"" but these same people lose interest because they are not willing to put forth effort to learn the fundamentals. In my club, if you think you're going to use a weapon during your first month of drills, think again. It is not a toy. When fencing, wear appropriate fencing gear. This includes: My club only requires socks, sneakers, and appropriate attire (t-shirt, gym     shorts) for warm-ups, conditioning, and drills. When a weapon is involved, we require most of the gear listed above. We are lenient about the underarm protector, knickers, and knee-length socks (as long as the body is covered, sweats for example as an alternative to knickers and knee-high socks)...but we are stringent about the rest, especially a mask. NOTE: Even if you're fencing lightly (or horsing around), wear gear. Accidents are most common when we are not at an appropriate awareness level. That, compounded with not wearing gear, can result in a costly accident that could have been easily prevented. Scan your equipment before use. Make sure the equipment you are using is in good, maintained condition. As I state above, a weapon without a tip is more painful than with one. This can be easily prevented if you take a careful look over your equipment before you use it. If something doesn't look right, let someone (who knows what they are doing) know. Hope this helps, and hope I didn't scare you and your friend away ;)"
What is the difference between a strong safety and a free safety?,"The strong safety lines up on the strong side - whichever side of the center has the most lineman on it (typically the tight end is the extra guy). If both sides have an equal amount of lineman (maybe a tight end on both sides of the line) the strong safety will typically line up across from whichever tight end they want to shut down in the passing game or whichever side they believe the run is going to go to. Strong safety refers to the fact that the safety in that position is playing on the strong side of the field.  Just like a strongside linebacker, the strong side of the field in man coverage is the side of the field where there are more lineman and where a play is designed to be run.  A typical indicator is where the tight end lines up.  In man coverage, the strong safety has the obligation of covering the tight end down the field AND coming up to provide run support.  In a man formation, he will typically line up closer to the line of scrimmage so he can pick up the tight end quicker as the tight end runs by the strongside linebacker, who is the first line of defense on the strong side.  Like the strongside linebacker, the strong safety is normally a bigger safety who is fast enough to make up ground in the pass game, but who can take on tight ends and fullbacks to make a tackle on the running back in the running game.  The strong safety has to be a big hitter, has to be tough, and has to be good at shedding blockers and taking the correct angle to get to the runner the quickest.  He's often the safety that will blitz the quarterback on a third down as an overload on either side of the formation. The free safety position is much different than the strong safety position.  With strong safety, you really need a particular style of player who is rugged and rough.  Free safety the player normally needs to be great at coverage and understanding the angles to get to the ball.  It helps if he's taller and leaner and is a great jumper as well.  He can't be afraid to make a big hit, but also must time his hit the right way to jar the ball loose and not get a penalty.  He is the guy that makes the wide receivers scared to go over the middle.   He's also the guy tasked with locating the ball and meeting it at the point of attack, whether that point is an interception, deflection, or that big hit. 
He's tasked with ""playing the field"" and assisting the cornerbacks and he often plays zone when others around him are playing man.  When he does play man defense, it's often because there may be a blitz package or a run style defense (like a 4-4) they are in.  At that point, he has the duties of a corner in coming up more to pick up a wideout.  The weakside linebacker will normally act as the strongside linebacker does with the tight end and drop with the WR for a few yards until the free safety picks him up."
What gives a left-handed pitcher an advantage over a left-handed batter?,"There are several things, including a major one that you mentioned before which is the break of the curveball/slider.   Generally speaking, hitters can handle pitches on the inside portion of the plate better than the outside.  Also, hitters can track and see a ball that is moving towards them better than away.  So for a lefty on lefty (or righty on righty) a 4 seam fastball tends to move slightly away (advantage pitcher) and both curveballs and sliders will break much further away (advantage pitcher).   You'll notice that many of today's best left handed pitchers have developed excellent Change Ups (Johan Santana, Cole Hamels, and popularized by Tom Glavine).  Since there are far more right handed batters than left, they needed a pitch that would break away instead of towards the right handed hitters.   For pitchers who use primarily a fastball change-up it still makes a difference but it is not as exaggerated.  The 4 seem fastball should still be a tougher pitch for the left on left matchup.   The last thing is: everyone, both left and right handed hitters, see far fewer left handed pitchers throughout their careers.  Just being unfamiliar and unique is an advantage to the lefty pitcher."
Do high tops prevent sprained ankles?,"Yes, high tops appear to help with ankle injuries. A study was done by the National Center for Biotechnology Information to determine if there was a difference in ankle rotation when wearing high tops compared to wearing low tops. In the study the participants stood on a platform on one foot and the platform would be released at a random time which would turn the base of the foot by 35°. The degree and rate of ankle inversion was measured to determine the amount of stress that was being exerted on the participant's ankle. The following is the conclusion of the study: High-top shoes reduced the amount of inversion by 4.5°, the
  maximum rate of inversion by 100.1°/s, and the average rate of
  inversion by 73.00°/s when compared with low-top shoes.
  Depending upon the loading conditions, subjects wearing
  high-top shoes may reduce their risk of ankle sprains. Now, as to why some players prefer to play in low top shoes, this article from ESPN explains that Kobe Bryant was originally inspired by soccer players who exert similar strain on their ankles in low top shoes. According to the article, low top shoes weigh 20% less which provides the player with more energy and greater ability to change direction. Also, most professional players have their ankles taped and wrapped before each game whether they wear high tops or not which also helps with preventing ankle injury. Kobe Bryant is quoted in the article: I've been playing basketball all my life and I've worn high-tops for a lot of those games, and I've rolled my ankle plenty wearing high-tops. If you come down on somebody's foot, you're going to roll your ankle and there's not a lot you can do about it. But to have a low, I feel like it gives your foot more freedom to change direction."
"What is the practical difference between traditional and ""toe"" snowboard bindings?","From what I understand, there are 2 benefits to toe strap bindings: I have Burton Citizen bindings and my sister has a Burton Stilleto.  I can tell you point 2 is definitely true.   Our indoor snow area use T-Bars and what I found is that in my normal board, by the time I get to the top, the pinky toe on my left foot (I ride regular) goes numb because of the added pressure by pushing the board forward going uphill.  At first I thought it was because I ride 18 degrees forward, but I changed it to 15, and I still get the same issue.  However when I try out her board, I never get the numbness.  This is only in T-Bar situations though. I would also assume that toe straps are quicker response wise when you go back edge as the first thing to react would be your toes, though I'm no pro, so it's just speculation on my end :) Hope this helps."
"FIFA World Cup 2014 Tie Breaker Rules: ""Between the teams concerned""?","This rule concerns how the teams are ranked after the Group Stage (Round of 32) is done, determining which teams move on to the Round of 16. In each group, there are four teams.  During the Group Stage, each team plays the other three teams in their group.  For these three matches, each team is awarded 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss.  After the Group Stage is over, the four teams in each group are ranked according to how many points they accumulated over the three matches.  (This is criteria A in the rule you cited.)   If there is a tie after this ranking, criteria B and C are used, using the statistics from ALL three group matches that each team played in determining the rank order. If there is still a tie after criteria C is applied, criteria D, E, and F are used.  The difference between these three criteria and criteria A, B, and C is that with D, E, and F, the only match(es) you look at is the match between the teams that are still tied. After the ranking in each group is figured out, the top two teams in each group move on to the Round of 16."
Why would you use oil on your table tennis raquets?,"The oil is used to increase the grip or ""tackiness"" of the rubber surface of the racquet. You can actually just use ordinary oils (like sunflower oil) but the oils vendors sell are manufactured for the specific purpose of applying to table tennis rubber. Anyway, you want to use a medium width brush (like something you'd use to paint model airplanes or something like that) to apply a coat of the oil evenly on to the rubber, then let it soak into the rubber (can take anywhere from 20 minutes to a few hours depending on the rubber). Then repeat this process (applying the oil and letting it soak in) 2-3 times. Advanced players need very tacky rubber to impart the type of spin on the ball that they want as well as to deal with the spins put on the ball by their opponents shots. Really tacky rubber on a racquet should allow you to pick a ball up off the table using just the rubber surface."
"How to decide the ""Par"" for each hole","The par for a hole is primarily based on the length of the hole, but other factors can also affect its value; most noticeably the type of terrain and any potential obstacles (water, hills, buildings etc). Wikipedia article for Par The USGA lays out the following guidelines for par computation;  To quote their advice on par computation; Yardages for guidance in computing par are given below. The effective playing length of a hole for the scratch golfer determines par. (See Section 13-3b.) These yardages may not be applied arbitrarily; the configuration of the ground and the severity of the obstacles should be taken into consideration. Authorized golf associations are empowered to adjudicate questions of hole par. (See Decision 16/1.)"
Are referees biased toward the home team?,"I came across many articles with summaries of studies that indicate that referee bias does in fact exist across many sports. In ""Basketball: Bias Refs (full article),"" the blurb states: The study found that the probability of a foul call being against a
  visiting team was seven percent higher than calls against the home
  team. They also noted when the home team is ahead in the game, the
  likelihood of a foul being called against them is 6.3 percentage
  points higher than when they were behind. Finally, economists observed
  the larger the foul difference between the two teams, the more likely
  it is the next call will be made against the team with fewer fouls. Gail Imber notes in his article ""Referee Bias: Quantifying the Homer Effect and Officiating Home-Field Advantage"": Specifically, Boyko postulates that ""While subconscious referee bias
  does not necessarily make home advantage unfair, our finding of
  significant variation in home advantage by referee is hard to accept
  as fair."" and All verifiable studies decidedly concluded the ""homey effect"" is due
  to subconscious variations in play calling—not due to a conscious
  attempt to manipulate or ""throw"" the game. There are links to several studies and articles in Imber's article. Some interesting excerpts: In the blog post titled ""More evidence for referee bias in soccer,"" Phil Birnbaum points to two studies related to European football - in the Spanish and German leagues. He notes: Looking at games in the Primera Division in Spain over two specific
  seasons (1994-95 and 1998-99), they found that, in games where the
  score difference was exactly one goal, referees awarded almost twice
  as much extra time when the home team was trailing as when it was
  leading. More time, of course, benefits whichever team is behind, as
  it gives them a better chance to tie the game. and Also, the authors note that a German magazine, ""Kicker Sportmagazin,""
  reviews all games and posts an opinion on which penalty calls were
  correct and which were incorrect (both actual and missed calls). It
  turns out that for penalties called in favor of the home team, 5 out
  of 55 were illegitimate. But for visiting teams, it was only 1 out of
  21. So referees favored the home team by about twice as many false positives. False negatives also favored the home team. There were 12 cases where
  home team should have been awarded a penalty, but wasn't; there were
  19 such cases for the visiting team. In an article about NBA referees, James Downie notes: They found ""evidence of three biases: favoritism of home teams, teams
  losing during games, and teams that are behind in a multi-game playoff
  series. All three biases are plausibly profit-enhancing for the
  league."" The authors calculate that, during the regular season, the
  turnover biases ""equates to win probability changing by approximately
  2.2% when a team switches from away to home status,"" and a further 2.5% if fouls are included. In the playoffs, the biases do not appear to affect fouls, but the effect on turnovers becomes nearly doubles,
  keeping the probability change close to 5%. Maybe beating that 5% is
  why coaches ask players to give 110%... So in summary, it appears that referees across all sports do show some subconscious favoritism towards the home team, even while striving to remain impartial. EDIT: Added some excerpts mentioned in one of my comments below."
Why do umpires indicate whether a caught fly ball is fair or foul?,"Lets say there are no outs and a runner on 3rd, and a ball is hit to the right fielder who dives for it near the foul line. The ball is still in fair territory when the player dives for the ball, but as he lands, the ball falls out of his glove in foul territory. The umpire should have made his decision first as to whether the ball was fair/foul (so lets say his call was fair). Then after that the catch/no catch call should be made. So now say the umpire rules it as no catch. Although the ball has been dropped into foul territory, it has already been ruled fair so it is a live ball and the runner at third would have gotten the fair signal allowing him to tag up. The fair/foul call should be made FIRST proceeded by catch/no catch as to avoid any confusion. So basically the reason is just for assurance purposes (like if the fielder drops the ball) Hope this helps."

If a play ends with two runners at the same base who is safe?,"Technically the play cannot end with two runners on the same base.  If two runners are occupying the same base, then the trailing runner is considered ""In Jeopardy"", or able to be tagged out, and must either retreat to the previous base or, if it is occupied, the leading runner must advance a base. However, if the trailing runner was forced to the base then the leading runner is considered ""In Jeopardy"" and must advance or be tagged out."
Why did the Netherlands put in their backup keeper for the PKs?,"We cannot say for sure what the exact reason was, unless Van Gaal goes out and specifies why he's put in Krul instead of the starting GK Cillessen. Here are some relevant facts tho: Cillessen is 1.88 m whereas Tim Krul is 1.93 (as recorded on Wiki page for respective players). So there is a 5 cm difference in their height. How that difference reflects to their overall reach distance is hard to estimate however. Cillessen is 25 years old with 71 and 13 appearances in his senior careers for club and national team respectively. Tim Krul is 26 years old but has 153 appearances at club football and over 50 appearances for the Dutch national team, at different age groups. So one would argue that Tim Krul is significantly more experienced as a first team goalkeeper, even though they are about as old. Cillessen has reportedly never saved a penalty in his senior career, which obviously is not very convincing when your team is playing world cup quarter final and the game goes to penalties. Van Gaal only made the audacious move to replace Ajax keeper Cillessen – who has never saved a penalty in his senior career – in the dying seconds of extra-time, throwing on Krul after instructing the understudy to perform a length warm-up. The same article cites some comments from van Gaal where he says that he had left Cillessen in the dark about his decision of changing keepers if the game looks like it's going to the penalties. Such a decision is risky, might look really stupid if it doesnt pan out as planned and unfortunately might leave players jaded even if it does pan out as planned."
How do tennis players get into tournaments?,"'Direct Entry' means that their current ranking qualified them for a spot in the main draw of the tournament. Their name will sometimes appear in the draw prefixed with their ranking (and/or seed) number. Typically, the ranking taken into consideration is what the player was ranked 2 to 3 weeks before the tournament begins (when entries are finalized), so their ranking going into the tournament might be slightly different than their current ranking depending on if they played in a tournament between when entries were finalized and the tournament began. 'Wildcard' entry means that their ranking did not qualify them for a main draw position, and they were awarded one of the spots in the main draw reserved for a wild card. Their name will usually be prefixed with ""WC"" in this case. Wildcards are awarded by the tournament director typically and it is up to their discretion who to award them to. Also, the player would need to request a wildcard in order for it to be awarded to them. For a typical draw, the number of wildcards is not that great - usually between 2 to 4. For a major (128 player draw) - there are 8 wildcard spots. 'Qualifying' entry means that the player played 1 or more matches/rounds in a qualifying tournament and earned a spot in the main draw that was reserved as a qualifying spot. Their name will usually be prefixed with a ""Q"" in the draw in this case. The number of qualifying spots in the main draw usually depends on the size of the main draw - for a major, which has a main draw of 128 players, typically 16 spots will be reserved for qualifiers. Typically, players get chosen for qualifying rounds based on their current ranking - so those ranked high enough (but just outside the range for direct entry) get put into qualifying tournaments. Some tournaments also hold pre-qualifying rounds that are open to absolutely anyone eligible to play by virtue of being a pro and paying the entry fee. This is how the very beginning professionals (or maybe those coming back from an injury) work their way into tournaments. The one other way a player can get into a main draw is by being what is called a ""lucky loser"" - which means the player that beat them to earn a spot in the main draw as a qualifier had to withdraw from the tournament before the 1st round began for some reason - so they were put into the main draw in place of that player.

Rules around shepherding in football,"Yes, there is a rule against this. It is a part of Rule 12 ""Fouls and misconduct"" and it's called ""Impeding the progress of an opponent"" per page 116 of the FIFA rules.  But it goes on to say that a player can ""shield"" the ball if it's within playing distance of the shielding player (and if the shielding player doesn't use their hands or body to contain the other player).

Does icing a fieldgoal kicker actually work?,"According to NFL.com's Freakonomics series, no. In their book Scorecasting, Tobias J. Moskowitz and L. Jon Wertheim marshal the most compelling evidence to date on the subject, analyzing ""pressure"" kicks from 2001 through 2009 while controlling for distance of the field-goal attempt. They found that icing the kicker certainly doesn't produce the desired effect, and in some cases might even backfire.  Icing seems to give a slim advantage when there are less than 2 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, but not less than 15 seconds.  Here's their data: (Percentage of kicks made)
Situation                                       All kicks  Iced   Not iced
Less than 2 min. left in fourth quarter or OT   76.2%      74.2%  77.6%
Less than 1 min. left in fourth quarter or OT   75.5%      74.3%  76.4%
Less than 30 sec. left in fourth quarter or OT  76.5%      76.0%  76.9%
Less than 15 sec. left in fourth quarter or OT  76.4%      77.5%  75.4% A recent Grantland article suggests that the only reason coaches still try icing is that from their standpoint, it's low-risk and high-reward. Everybody ""knows"" icing the kicker is what to do, so if they try and fail, it's no big deal, while if they try and succeed, they're ""geniuses"" – even though the data points more towards luck. The NFL has banned calling two or more consecutive timeouts; I don't know if that would be more effective or not, but it would certainly be annoying to fans."
Any other sport with draws like cricket?,"After five years without a definitive answer, I'm going to go out on a not very big limb here and say that there isn't another major sport which has the same ""draw"" type characteristics as (first class) cricket."
Why does the catcher decide what sort pitch the pitcher has to throw?,"Most Major League starting pitchers have between three and four different kinds of pitches that they can throw throughout the game. Examples are  The break and speed of these pitches vary quite dramatically so it's important for the catcher to know what's coming. The reason that a pitcher has so many pitches is so that he can vary the speed, rotation, location and break to the batter. If the batter knows what pitch is coming they can largely negate the advantage that the pitcher creates by being able to mix their pitches. Generally you want signs to be simple between a pitcher and a catcher. This is due to the fact that miscommunication with signals can lead to passed balls, wild pitches and even injury to the catcher.  This means that most of the time it makes sense for the catcher and pitcher to communicate via a simple system. The catcher shows the sign between his legs and the pitcher either nods to accept the sign or shakes his head to tell the catcher to change pitches. Then the catcher places his glove in the intended location and that becomes the target location for the pitch. However, this is not the whole story. The catcher is generally not just calling pitches. Generally pitch selection is either the result of prior planning and discussion with the pitcher (they will generally meet before a game to work on how to get specific hitters out). Or the pitches are relayed by the manager or pitching coach from the dugout to the catcher and then to the pitcher.  Some specific situations where this system changes: This mostly applies to starting pitchers. When a reliever enters the game usually they throw fewer pitches (some great ones only have a single pitch, see Mariano Rivera with the cut fastball), and they will likely not have as well developed of a gameplan with their catcher. This is where having a veteran catcher who knows a pitcher very well is really important. He potentially knows the hitters better than the pitcher does and is the guide for the reliever to get outs."
Is the sweeper role obsolete with modern formations?,"To me, there is still a difference between a Defensive Midfielder, and a Sweeper.  Mainly in that a DM (has also been called a Stopper in some instances) is supposed to ""stop"" the fast flow of an attack before it totally breaches the back line.  Where as the Sweeper will/can roam the back line and pick up the loose ends of the (hopefully) thwarted attack.  For example, if a through-ball is issued, the Sweeper should be on top of that every time -- yes that's in a perfect world, but that is the idea. I guess, yes, they can perform the same conceptual roles but it's done at different points on the pitch.  The DM prevents the offense from gaining too much momentum through the midfield, and the Sweeper acts as the last line of defense in the back.  I wouldn't say the Sweeper position is obsolete though -- but it does all depend on your formation -- as the Sweeper has the ability to run more free throughout the back, where as the back line is either man-marking or is responsible for a specific zone on the pitch.  Obviously you don't see the Sweeper played in top-flight leagues much anymore because of the offside trap, but you definitely see it a lot in youth leagues because they haven't completely figured out the chemistry needed for the trap :)  The place where I've seen Sweeper being used the most are in recreational leagues where they only have 1 referee, and the offside trap is almost impossible to rely on."
What do baseball umpires say when a strike/ball is thrown?,"I took an umpiring class this past Spring (2012), so I can offer what we were taught. Regardless of whether a pitch is a strike or a ball, we were taught to wait a ""tick"" to be sure of what we've seen.  If nothing else, this mindset helps one watch the pitch all the way into the glove. If the call is a strike, one should rise from the slightly crouched stance, raise the right hand into a fist and pump it forward with authority and confidence while calling out 'HIKE'. Why 'HIKE' and not 'STRIKE'?  Simple, it's easier to call (especially for 7, 8, 9, or more innings), and it sounds close to the same. The main point is to both call and signal the strike with authority.  Oh, and swinging strikes are signaled, but not called out. In addition, we're taught to make all strike calls, including strike three, where we're allowed a little bit of showmanship, while facing forward – not looking to the right. Why?  Well, home plate umpires in MLB, and I believe umpires in AAA along with umpires working certain special games, are the few who have the luxury of having another umpire on each of the bases.  In the lower minor leagues, I believe there are typically only two base umpires, and in much, if not all, of amateur baseball, there are typically only two umpires total, one home plate ump, and one base ump who moves around the diamond depending on the number and position of runners on base.  (Unfortunately, sometimes one umpire is unlucky enough to have his partner not show up, and he's force to make all the calls.) If the call is a ball, one should not rise and not signal in any way – calling ""ball"" with authority, but usually not as much volume.  At the amateur level, the call should be loud enough for the pitcher to hear it.  Obviously, that goal becomes more difficult the larger the crowd is. As a final note, remember that this is what we're taught.  Once out of the classroom, personal style will naturally change some things.  However, if one tries to be too much of a showman, it could degrade one's performance in the eyes of the coaches who submit the umpire game reports, which results in one being a showboat umpire in Little League (no offense meant to Little League umps – I've been one – I'm just saying that a poorly graded/ranked umpire won't even earn a chance to work Varsity HS games, much less move on to college games and beyond). While this may not have answered the original question, I hope the insight is useful and/or enlightening."
Is it legal to dribble above shoulder height?,"I searched the NBA Rules and the FIBA Rules, but couldn't find anything that explicitly states you cannot dribble above your shoulder. My personal opinion is that it's not an infraction.  When you see infractions called because someone dribbles high it's mainly because they ""carry"" the ball (putting your hand on the bottom hemisphere of the ball while dribbling), or somehow stop the motion of the ball during the normal dribbling process."
Why is Hawk-Eye not used on clay courts,"You are right that the French Open is the only Grand Slam tournament without Hawkeye, The reason is that Clay, unlike grass and hardcourts, leaves a mark that players and umpires can check and verify if the ball was in or out. You can argue that some mistakes can be made but that's quite rare, A hawkeye system is very expensive and the cost/benefit ratio doesn't pays. Gilbert Ysern, the director general of the French Open and a former umpire, address to this: “I don't think we need it,” he said in an interview in his office. “There are ball marks on clay,” Ysern said with a genial smile, “and
  our chair umpires are used to checking the marks when needed, and, so
  why would we need Hawk-Eye?” And the disputes? “It happens very, very rarely that the officials
  can't find the mark,” he said. Source"
Can a player receive two yellow cards if advantage is played?,"Yes. If both the offences deserve a yellow card each, the referee is obligated to show the player two yellows (and hence a red card). The referee must indicate that the first yellow is for the first offence and the subsequent yellow for the second offence.  After the second offence, the referee must stop play immediately unless there is a clear goal scoring opportunity. Advantage may not be played on sending-off offences unless a clear goal scoring opportunity is present. See FIFA Laws of the Game 2015/16 page 73"
What does the 'B' (or bonus) mean on a basketball scoreboard?,That's a bonus marker. A team who commits 7 fouls gives the other team a bonus - which gives a free throw with every foul from that point on. The second B on the second image indicate that a team has reached 10 fouls (in HS and college this is the double bonus and means that you shoot 2 foul shots from there forward instead of 1 and 1)
Are there any sports that started as a women's sport?,"Synchronised swimming was exclusively a women's sport from its first appearance at the World Aquatics Championships in 1973 until 2015 when mixed duet categories were introducted. The earlier (pre-1954) history of synchronised swimming does include male participation, but for many years it was a female only activity."
Why did Greece go through over Russia in Euro 2012?,"The rules in Euro 2012 (see 8.07) state that if 2 teams are equal on points, the first criteria applied to seperate the teams is the winner of the game of the respective teams. If the teams had drawn and were still equal points, only then would it be decided by goal difference. If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the
  following criteria are applied, in the order given; to determine the rankings: An exception to this is 8.08, which handles cases where two teams are tied, and they play each other in their last group match; If two teams which have the same number of points, the same number of goals
  scored and conceded play their last group match against each other and are still
  equal at the end of that match, the ranking of the two teams in question is
  determined by kicks from the penalty mark (Article 16), provided no other teams
  within the group have the same number of points on completion of all group
  matches. Should more than two teams have the same number of points, the criteria
  listed under paragraph 8.07 apply."
Are you allowed to play zone defense in the NBA?,"Zone defense is not explicitly prohibited, but there is a defensive three-second penalty occurring when a defender is inside the lane without guarding an offensive player. From the NBA Rules: a. The count starts when the offensive team is in control of the ball in the front-court.
  b. Any defensive player, who is positioned in the 16-foot lane or the area extending 4 feet past the lane endline, must be actively guarding an opponent within three seconds. Actively guarding means being within arms length of an offensive player and in a guarding position.
  c. Any defensive player may play any offensive player. The defenders may double-team any player.
  d. The defensive three-second count is suspended when: (1) there is a field goal attempt, (2) there is a loss of team control, (3) the defender is actively guarding an opponent or (4) the defender completely clears the 16-foot lane.
  e. If the defender is guarding the player with the ball, he may be located in the 16-foot lane. This defender is not required to be in an actively guarding/arms dis-tance position. If another defender actively guards the player with the ball, the original defender must actively guard an opponent or exit the 16-foot lane. Once the offensive player passes the ball, the defender must actively guard an opponent or exit the 16-foot lane.
  PENALTY: A technical foul shall be assessed. The offensive team retains possession at the free throw line extended. The shot clock shall remain the same as when play was interrupted or reset to 14 seconds, whichever is greater. This means that a college-style zone is not possible, but a more limited zone can be done. Usually this is only a change of pace and not a base defense."
What is the purpose of the eligible reciever rules?,"According to my research, the rule changes below were in response to rule reform when deaths and injuries were high and to ""open up the game."" When restrictive rules were lifted, the forward pass became effective and more strategy was employed. The eligible receiver rule is evidence of the evolution and modernization of the passing game. Relevant Rule Changes In 1906, the forward pass was legalized. In 1910, a new rule was legalized, ""seven men on the line of scrimmage, no pushing or pulling, no interlocking interference (arms linked or hands on belts and uniforms)."" This rule was introduced to prevent collision injuries. In 1912, ""restrictive"" rules were lifted (a forward pass may travel more than 20 yards, for example).(1) In 1918, eligible receivers were allowed to catch passes anywhere on the field. Previously, passes were only allowed to certain areas of the field.(2) The NFL began to develop their own rules by discontinuing the use of the collegiate playbook on February 25, 1933.(3) One rule change was that a forward pass can take place anywhere behind the line of scrimmage (before, a forward pass was only legal if thrown at least five yards behind the line of scrimmage).(4) In 1951, a new rule was legalized, ""no tackle, guard, or center would be eligible to catch a forward pass.""(4) Original Response American football would become downright sloppy without this rule. If anyone could catch the ball, who would block? Why would the offense and defense come up with multiple plays/schemes if it's a free for all? It would take away from the strategy of the game. "
"Statistically, who is the worst NFL team in history?","Wikipedia has a list of NFL win-loss records for each of the current 32 NFL teams.  The tables on the page include all games that each team has played in, including regular season and playoffs.  Sorted by win percentage, combining the regular season and post-season tables, through Super Bowl LV (2020-21), the best team is the Green Bay Packers, with a win percentage of .571, and the worst team is the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, with a record of .397. Of course, some teams are much older than others.  The Packers have played 1,445 games from 1921-2020, and the Buccaneers have only played 728 games since 1976. These stats only include teams that are currently in the NFL. However, in the early years of the NFL, there were lots of teams that no longer exist, many of whom ended their NFL franchise with a lower percentage than the Buccaneers currently hold."
What if a field goal is missed and it's not 4th down?,"The attempt counts as a down. However, the kicking team will not have further attempts on making it as possession changes, given that the field-goal attempt is missed as outlined in Rule 11, Section 4, Article 2.  If the field goal is blocked on third down, the 2012 NFL Case Book (page 62) suggests the following scenarios: A.R. 11.43 MISSED FIELD GOAL—BEHIND THE LINE Third-and-2 on B10. Team A field-goal attempt from the B17 is blocked and:  a) goes out of bounds at the B18; Ruling: B’s ball, first-and-10 on B18. b) is recovered by A2 at the B15 who runs for a touchdown; Ruling: Touchdown Team A. Kickoff A35. c) is recovered simultaneously by A3 and B3 at the B21; Ruling: B’s ball, first-and-10 on B21. d) is recovered by A4 at the B19; Ruling: A’s ball fourth-and-11 on B19. e) is recovered and downed by B2 at the B15; Ruling: B’s ball, first-and-10 on B15. f) goes beyond the line and then returns behind the line, untouched by  Team B beyond the line in the field of play, and goes out of
  bounds at the B16 or is recovered by A2 at the B16. Ruling: B’s
  ball, first-and-10 on B20. Rule 11, Section 4, Article 2 (page 58) in the 2012 NFL Rule Book states: Missed Field Goals.  If there is a missed field-goal attempt, and the ball has not been
  touched by the receivers beyond the line in the field of play, the
  following shall apply:  (a) If the spot of the kick was inside the receivers’ 20-yard line,
  it is the receivers’ ball at the 20-yard line or  (b) If the spot of the kick was from the receivers’ 20-yard line or
  beyond the receivers’ 20-yard line, it is the receivers’ ball at the
  spot of the kick. Note: These options apply only if the ball has been beyond the line."
Why is a chargedown not regarded as a knock on in Rugby Union?,"Law 11 of the Laws of Rugby Union specifically exclude a charge-down that happens immediately following a kick as being called a knock-on or throw forward. I think this has been a law in Rugby for a long time and is not a recent innovation. Before 1958 it was even possible to rush the the kicker and charge down a penalty kick from immediately the time the ball was placed on the ground. To avoid this, under these older laws another person used to place the ball as the kicker ran up - a bit like how someone places the ball for the kicker taking a field-goal or a point-after in American Football. So the charge down has been with the game for a long time, but why?  I think as Harley Holcombe's answer says, that this is to allow pressure to be put on the kicker. It allows someone rushing the kicker to have an opportunity to gain regain possession. They cannot tackle the kicker (because they don't have the ball), and picking up the ball in the process of being kicked is more difficult and sounds kind of dangerous.  So a chargedown law adds excitement and unpredictability in taking tactical kicks - re-balancing the risk and reward for taking a tactical kick. Mostly it fails as kickers are wary of the tactic, but it is still worth it for the attacking side because it can force a mistake or the kicker taking a less ambitious kick."
How much faster/more useful is swimming under water?,"To be fair, David Berkoff didn’t quite invent the underwater swimming dilemma, but he had a large part in making it an enough of an issue that FINA had to institute the 15m rule. Pre-dating Berkoff was a swimmer named Jesse Vassallo, who in 1976 was lined up against future Olympian John Naber. At a considerable height advantage, Vassallo figured he could do a bunch of dolphin kicks off the start to avoid the wash of the 6’5” Naber.  Berkoff brought it to a broader audience, that is for sure, but very few swimmers and coaches understood the best way to teach the underwater fly kick. For a long time it was considered a fringe aspect to swimming, something for outliers, something you had or didn’t.  Phelps, Australian Ian Thorpe, and most notably Neil Walker showed that the UDK would eventually need to be a part of every swimmer’s arsenal.  They showed that you could swim faster underwater than you could ever hope to swimming on the top of the water. Because it hasn’t become an accepted and understood part of elite swimming until recently, it is only in the past couple years that we have seen the UDK being coached at an early age.  Where in past years swimmers with a powerful UDK was the exception, in the future we will see swimmers—across all disciplines—making use of it as it has become a part of the coaching curriculum.

"If the ball hits your opponent, do you get a point?","Actually, yes, it would be your point if it hits your opponent before touching the ground - but only if the ball has not passed the end of the table already. Rule 2.10.01.03: if, after he or she has made a service or a return, the ball touches
  anything other than the net assembly before being struck by an
  opponent; and Rule 2.10.01.04: if the ball passes over his or her court or beyond his or her end line
  without touching his or her court, after being struck by an opponent; This means after the ball passes beyond the end line (end of the table) - the point is over and whoever hit the ball beyond the end line loses the point. Obviously if it were legal to win a point just by hitting your opponent with the ball, some crazy strategies would come into play - for the worse of the game."
Why there is no number 13 in Formula 1?,"Number 13 isn't in use just from superstition. The FIA Formula 1 World Championship entry list does not have a number
  13. The number is generally considered to be an unlucky number. It was used in the early years of the sport but in the 1920s it was dropped
  after the Delage factory team suffered two fatal accidents with the
  number in the course of just a few months. The first was Paul Torchy,
  who crashed into a tree during the San Sebastian Grand Prix in
  September 1925 (below). Source"
Are Hookers the only players allowed to take lineout throws?,"There is no law stipulating who has to take the line-out throws. To see why it is the Hooker's job, we can consider a process of elimination of the other positions.  First, it should not be any of the backs, since they will be needed to execute backline plays (or defend against them) once the ball is cleared from the lineout. Consider then the forwards. The two props are the heaviest and strongest players on the team. Their strength is best utilised for lifting the lineout jumpers, so they shouldn't take the throws. The back rowers, flankers and number 8 are more nimble smaller players, suited to cleaning up loose balls that are not caught cleanly or quickly moving to support a player who has successfully caught the lineout throw. Someone has to be the jumper and obviously being tall helps. Since the back rowers need to be nimble, they are generally not overly tall. Therefore the second rowers (also called locks) are usually tall players able to be good lineout jumpers. Note that the Hooker needs to be shorter than the props in order to hang off them in the scrums, so they can't be tall and therefore not suited to being jumpers. So, by process of elimination we see that the most logical player left over to actually take the throw is the hooker. They are not needed in the backline and would be the least useful forward to participate in the lineout itself, so they instead learn the skill of taking the lineout throw."
Who serves in the first game after a tiebreaker?,"According to the Tennis for Dummies cheatsheet: When tennis players win six games each, they generally play a

Has the Olympic host nation ever been changed after it was announced,"The 1976 Olympics are probably the closest example available. According to Wikipedia, Denver was originally scheduled to host the 1976 Winter Olympics: The games were originally awarded to Denver in May 12, 1970, but a 300
percent rise in costs and worries about environmental impact led to
Colorado voters' rejection on November 7, 1972, by a 3 to 2 margin, of
a $5 million bond issue to finance the games with public funds.1 Denver officially withdrew on November 15, and the IOC then offered
the games to Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, but they too declined
owing to a change of government following elections. Whistler would go
on to be associated with neighbouring Vancouver's successful bid for
the 2010 games. Salt Lake City, Utah, which would eventually host in 2002, offered
itself as a potential host after the withdrawal of Denver. The IOC,
still reeling from the Denver rejection, declined and selected
Innsbruck, which had hosted the 1964 Winter Olympics games twelve
years earlier, on February 5, 1973. Notably, per Wikipedia (Summer and Winter, the host sites for the 1940 Games were also to be replaced, had the Olympics not been canceled due to the onset of World War II: The anticipated 1940 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of
the XII Olympiad and originally scheduled to be held from September 21
to October 6, 1940, in Tokyo, Japan, were cancelled due to the
outbreak of World War II. Tokyo was stripped of its host status for
the Games by the IOC after the renunciation by the Japanese of the
IOC's Cairo Conference of 1938, due to the outbreak of the Second
Sino-Japanese War. The government of Japan had abandoned its support
for the 1940 Games in July 1938. The IOC then awarded the Games to
Helsinki, Finland, the runner-up in the original bidding process. The
Games were then scheduled to be staged from July 20 to August 4, 1940.
The Olympic Games were suspended indefinitely following the outbreak
of World War II and did not resume until the London Games of 1948. and The games were cancelled due to the onset of World War II. Sapporo was
selected to be the host of the fifth edition Winter Olympics scheduled
February 3-12, 1940, but Japan gave the Games back to the IOC in July
1938, after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937.
Sapporo subsequently hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics. The IOC then
decided to give the Winter Olympics to St Moritz, Switzerland, which
had hosted in 1928. Due to controversies between the Swiss organizing
team and the IOC, the Games were withdrawn again. In the spring of
1939, the IOC gave the 1940 Winter Olympics, now scheduled for
February 2-11, to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, where the previous
1936 games had been held. Three months later Germany invaded Poland on
September 1 to ignite World War II, and the Winter Games were
cancelled in November. Likewise, the 1944 games, awarded in 1939 to
Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, were cancelled in 1941. The IOC would select an alternate host site, probably at a site that had hosted recently to ensure that the requisite facilities would be in place. Innsbruck had hosted the 1964 Games, and were thus chosen as the alternate host."
Is it permissible to wear hand gloves while fielding in cricket?,"The rules are very clear, the wicket keeper is the only player allowed to wear gloves. All other players would incur a 5 run penalty every time they touched the ball while wearing gloves. This includes for instance taking off your hat in order to use it to catch the ball (I have seen this done in a park cricket match!). See Law 41 in the rules of cricket Law 41 (The fielder) No member of the fielding side other than the wicket-keeper shall be permitted to wear gloves or external leg guards. In addition, protection for the hand or fingers may be worn only with the consent of the umpires. A fielder may field the ball with any part of his person but if, while the ball is in play he wilfully fields it otherwise,
  (a) the ball shall become dead and 5 penalty runs shall be awarded to the batting side. See Law 42.17 (Penalty runs). The ball shall not count as one of the over. Note that the point about protection for the hand or fingers has been the source of some minor controversy over the years. Cricketers frequently injure their fingers while fielding and will often be seen with fingers taped up or two fingers taped together to protect a damaged finger. Usually this is permitted without any comment as it can actually make fielding harder. However, some players have at times gone a bit over the top and used sports tape to such an extent that they may as well be wearing a glove. As the law above suggests, it is up to the Umpires to judge if the tape being used is only what is required for a specific injury or is being used to gain an advantage. The other convention that does not appear explicitly in the rules but is always adhered to is that spin bowlers may not use any tape or covering on their bowling hand. This is because tape would allow a much better grip on the ball allowing the bowler to impart much more spin than otherwise. It is also a matter of conditioning since spin bowling a lot of overs leads to blistering and even bleeding at the point of contact between the fingers and the ball. It is part of the art of spin bowling to build up the toughness of the hand to cope with this, rather than covering it with tape."
Has 4-6-0 ever worked in high level football?,"I think your question should refer to non-striker tactics and that's what I will refer to in my answer. First of all Barcelona are playing, like Spain, without a real striker but they have Messi (Villa who isn't a typical #9 was injured), and as you can see they are very successful. You have to read the following amazing and interesting article:  http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/jun/08/euro2008 It talks about Roma and Manchester United as an example of top world class clubs who played without a striker.
Then it discuss about the beginning of this non-forward tactic: That in itself is nothing new. The Austrian 'Wunderteam' of the early
  1930s had great success with Mathias Sindelar, a centre-forward who
  constantly dropped deep, and Vsevolod Bobrov did similarly for the
  Dynamo Moscow tourists who so delighted British crowds in 1945. It was
  then Nandor Hidegkuti's role as a deep-lying centre-forward that so
  perplexed England when Hungary won 6-3 at Wembley in 1953. 'The
  tragedy to me,' said England's centre-half Harry Johnston, 'was the
  utter helplessness... not being able to do anything about it.' If
  Johnston followed Hidegkuti, he left a hole in the centre of England's
  rearguard; if he stayed put, Hidegkuti roamed free. It is the best article I've read about this topic!"
"What is ""Strength of Victory""?","According to this article from Boston.com, strength of victory is the composite record of the teams that the team in question has defeated: Using strength of schedule (the composite record of all opponents) and
strength of victory (the composite record of teams defeated), New England was in the middle of the pack among the 12 teams that made the
playoffs in the NFL. About.com has a similar definition: Definition: A part of the NFL's tiebreaking proceedure, strength of
victory is figured by calculating the combined winning percentage of
the opponents a team has beaten. Examples: If two teams end with
identical records, combine the records of the opponents in each of the
team's wins and calculate the total winning percentage. The team whose
opponents have the higher winning percentage wins the tiebreaker. For example, if team A has two victories (one with a 8-8 record and another with a 0-16 record), its strength of victory is 0.250. If team B has also two wins (over opponents that are 8-8 and 12-4), then its strength of victory is 0.625."
Are all of the lines on a tennis court the same width?,"It is not an optical illusion - some courts have a thicker baseline painted because it is supposed to  1) make it a little easier for the people calling the lines to see whether the ball was in or out. Not all courts have a thicker baseline, but it is more common among courts used for professional matches. Thus, your standard public park / recreational courts are not likely to have a thicker baseline.  2) It typically helps the players see the baseline opposite them a little easier - since it is the line farthest from the players viewing position. Also - it is mentioned in the specifications for building a tennis court. See Page 9 here: 2.5.1 Court Lines. The centre service line and centre mark line must be 50mm wide. All other lines except the base line may be 25mm-50mm wide. The base line may be 25mm-100mm wide. Personally I have played on courts with both a standard thickness base line and a 100mm thick baseline and it has not made much difference to me as far as visibility is concerned. Here is an additional page that is a good reference on court dimensions and line widths."
Why do these players rub their hands on the table near the net?,"In professional play - there are rules about how many points (6) must be played in between towel breaks (to wipe off sweat and what not). The ""hand rub"" is one tactic or ritual used to wipe a sweaty hand off on the table - usually up near the net on a part of the table the ball is not likely to come in contact with. It doesn't necessarily mean their hand is sweaty though. Some players do it to keep themselves in a rhythm, and do it just as a mental tick or something to keep them focused. Sometimes you'll also see them do it near the baseline of the table if some of the rubber nubs from their paddle have fallen onto the table during play. It is definitely not something ""required"" by any means, rather just something that some players do out of habit."
Achieving the optimal strike in squash: Is the wrist involved at all?,"I'm a lifelong squash player and what I'd say is don't worry so much about the wrist. You're going to use the wrist naturally as you make a full swing. You can add a bit of wrist at the point of impact to impart a little extra power, especially if you've taken a short backswing or you want to surprise your opponent by flicking the ball cross-court at the last second. But by and large, the wrist is a small percentage of your power. The real power comes from your LEGS. Step into each shot, move your arms through as you hit, and sure, use a bit of wrist, and you'll have yourself a powerful squash stroke. Keep up the playing, glad to see squash players out there!"
How can I calculate the best sail size for the current wind?,"I came across a windsurfing blog post with a link to an Excel spreadsheet (titled ""Ultimate Windsurfing Equipment Size Calculator""), developed by James Douglass. His spreadsheet runs some calculations using several factors: The spreadsheet has several reports/graphs: Boards: Sails: This spreadsheet might offer the type of info you're looking for. Mr. Douglass also provides an online version of his spreadsheet. He also provides the following advice to beginners in this ""Top 16 Windsurfing Questions Answered"" FAQ: Question #6- I’m a beginner windsurfer looking for my first sail. What kind of sail should I get, and in what size? Answer You should get a sail between 2 and 7 meters squared, depending on your size and the wind speed you are likely to sail in
  most often. Check the windsurfing equipment calculator to see what’s
  right for you (pink line on chart). As you get better, you can start
  using sails closer in size to those recommended for experienced
  sailors (blue line on chart). Your first sail should have a minimum of
  3 and a maximum of 6 battens, and should have no camber inducers or
  “cams” on any of the battens. Also, avoid sails and masts made before
  the year 2000 and sails advertised for racing. Another site had some pointers regarding sail size: For an amateur windsurfer, sails ranging from 5 to 6.5 square meters in size are recommended as they work well for light winds up to winds of 4-5 knots.  This article offers a quick overview of sails, with this final recommendation: We suggest you start off by choosing light-wind sails to get the knack
  of windsurfing. Eventually, you can experiment with various sizes of
  the sails, and finally find the one that appeals to you the most. Enjoy! EDIT: Added info from James Douglass' FAQ and a link to an online version of his calculator."
Overhand reception in indoor volleyball,"On the 2012 FIVB Congress, new rules valid from 2013 (but see update below) were approved; probably the most visible change is going to be the change regarding the reception of service. Currently, at the first hit of the team including the service, double contact is not called (provided that the contacts occur during one action, see rule 9.2.3.2), which means a great share of receptions is nowadays done using overhand, even though these hits are not clean. However, it also means todays men’s volleyball is generally: hard jumped serve which is very often a fault or an ace, or it is received nicely and properly set to a spike which ends the extremely short rally lasting just a few seconds, with such sideouting play being very predictable and boring. So, “To destabilize the reception and prevent a series of 4 second side out points, and thus make the game less predictable, reception of service overhand with fingers will be judged more strictly.” If the service will be received using overhand finger action, the hit must be clean – no double contact and no catch. This change affects only the service reception (further defensive actions during the rally will be unaffected and subject to the “first team hit” exception) and only the overhand reception. The exact wording of the newly created rule 9.2.4 will be as follows: It is a fault, during the reception of service, to make a double contact or catch using an overhand finger action. Note the rule does not forbid overhand reception of a service per se, it just requires it to be completely clean. But, presumably, unless the hit is very clean, it is going to get whistled automatically. This change also brings indoor volleyball rules a bit closer to beach volleyball, where overhand service reception is also not explicitly prohibited, but everybody receives using forearm bump, as an overhand reception would be whistled ±automatically as a double contact. Sources: Update: The changes has been incorporated into the new official ruleset: See Rules of the Game 2013-2016 Update: The application of the new overhand reception rule has been postponed following the Board of Administration decision of April 5, 2013, and is therefore not used currently."
What constitutes a legal block in volleyball in regard to it not counting as the first hit?,"You are carefully describing the position of the ball in the moment of your attack hit and in the moment of the defensive contact. However, it is not important. The decisive criterion in this case is not the point of contact with the ball, but the position of the blocker’s body. If any part of the blocker’s body (usually but not necessarily hands) is higher than the top of the net, it is considered a block. See Rule 14.1.1 Blocking (emphasis mine): Blocking is the action of players close to the net to intercept the ball coming from the opponent by reaching higher than the top of the net, regardless of the height of the ball contact. Only front-row players are permitted to complete a block, but at the moment of the contact with the ball, a part of the body must be higher than the top of the net. See also a similar case (3.46) in the FIVB Casebook: After an attack the ball touched the head of a blocker, who reached with his hands over the net. The contact with the ball was lower than the top of the net. After this hit, the team played three more times and at the third hit, the referee whistled and called “four hits”.
  Has this decision been correct? Ruling
  The decision was not correct. Even if the contact of the blocker with the ball was lower than the top of the net, the action was a block because a part of his body was higher than the top of the net. Rules 9.1, 14.1.1, 14.4.1"

"Has there ever been a football player who held the title of ""most goals in one season in history"" in two different countries?","I can't find any players who strictly meet this criteria, but Cristiano Ronaldo certainly has a case for it. He jointly holds the record for goals scored in a 38-game Premier League season (31 goals in 2007–08), as well as having held the record for the most goals scored in La Liga, with 40 in 2010–11 (albeit only for a solitary year, as Lionel Messi scored 50 the very next season). I specify a ""38-game Premier League season"" because in the early to mid 1990s, two players (Andy Cole and Alan Shearer) scored 34 goals in a single season, but they had 42 games to do this in. The Premier League officially acknowledges both of these totals as records, which means that if you found a stats book from 2011 listing the record number of goals scored in any individual season for every top-flight league, Cristiano Ronaldo's name will probably appear twice."

Did Adolf Hitler really snub Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin?,"Jesse Owens was snubbed by who? Everyone knows that at the 1936 Olympics Hitler snubbed Jesse Owens. As the story goes, after Owens won one gold medal, Hitler, incensed, stormed out of Olympic Stadium so he wouldn't have to congratulate Owens on his victory.  The facts are simple. Hitler did not congratulate Owens, but that day he didn't congratulate anybody else either, not even the German winners. As a matter of fact, Hitler didn't congratulate anyone after the first day of the competition. That first day he had shaken hands with all the German victors, but that had gotten him in trouble with the members of the Olympic Committee. They told him that to maintain Olympic neutrality, he would have to congratulate everyone or no one. Hitler chose to honor no one.  Hitler did snub a black American athlete, but it was Cornelius Johnson, not Jesse Owens. It happened the first day of the meet. Just before Johnson was to be decorated, Hitler left the stadium. A Nazi spokesman explained that Hitler's exit had been pre-scheduled, but no one believes that. - Adolf Hitler, Jesse Owens and the Olympics Myth of 1936. Hitler seems to have snubbed both men, but Cornelius Johnson was snubbed first. Upon his return to the USA, Jesse Owens had this to say: ""When I came back to my native country, after all the stories about Hitler, I couldn't ride in the front of the bus,"" Owens told ESPN. ""I had to go to the back door. I couldn't live where I wanted. I wasn't invited to shake hands with Hitler, but I wasn't invited to the White House to shake hands with the president, either."" - Did Hitler Really Snub Jesse Owens at 1936 Berlin Olympics?

Qualification decision in group stages when everything is equal,"As you say “a tournament”, be aware that different competitions use different rules for tie breaking. When you mention FIFA, the tournaments organized directly by FIFA use the rules described by Dor Cohen; e.g. the official FIFA World Cup 2014 Regulations state in rule 49, paragraph 5: The ranking of each team in each group shall be determined as follows: If two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings shall be determined as follows: However, UEFA (the European football association) uses a different system in its competitions, where results from the matches between the teams concerned are given more importance than the results from the rest of the group matches (plus, there are more auxiliary criteria when everything else fails). See e.g. the official Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2012 which state in the rule 8.07: If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the
  following criteria are applied, in the order given; to determine the rankings: And, there is an additional interesting rule 8.08 (which is a recent addition): If two teams which have the same number of points, the same number of goals
  scored and conceded play their last group match against each other and are still
  equal at the end of that match, the ranking of the two teams in question is
  determined by kicks from the penalty mark (Article 16), provided no other teams

How dangerous is indoor rock climbing with an inexperienced belay partner?,"Depending on the gym you're climbing at, even inexperienced climbers can enjoy a relatively high amount of safety. The most important hardware question to ask of the climbing gym is if they use ATC's or Grigri's for belaying.  ATC's require more attention from the belayer.  Grigri's are an assisted braking device. While a Grigri does help the belayer to catch the climbing in the event of a fall, using a GriGri does not replace good belaying technique. Independent from the hardware used at the gym, any gym worth going to will offer a short (30 minute) introduction course which highlights proper safety practices and good technique.

Can a fielder deliberately kick the ball over the boundary rope to keep a batsman on strike?,"Law 19.7 in the MCC Laws of Cricket states that, If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder the runs scored shall be (i) any runs for penalties awarded to either side AND (ii) the allowance for the boundary AND (iii) the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act.
Law 18.12(b) (Batsman returning to wicket he has left) shall apply as from the instant of the throw or act. In our case, this would mean that the single that the batsman took is awarded as well as the boundary, thereby adding 5 runs to the batting team.

"What are the criteria for wins, losses, and saves in MLB?","The verbiage is a little thick on these rules, so maybe some examples will help: Example #1:  The Cardinals are playing The Cubs in STL.  The Cards bat in the bottom of each inning.  The score is 0-0 until the bottom of the 7th inning in which the Cardinals score a run.  The game ends with the score 1-0.  The Cardinals pitcher that pitched the top half of the 7th inning would be the winning pitcher of record. Example #1a:  The Cardinals are playing the Cubs in STL.  At the end of 4 innings, the Cardinals are winning 9-8 in a slugfest.  The Cardinals swap out their starting pitcher with a long reliever and end up winning 9-8.  The Long Reliever would be the winning pitcher of record. Example #1b:  The Cardinals are playing the Cubs in STL.  At the end of 6 innings, the score is 0-0.  In the top half of the 7th, with 2 outs, the Cardinals insert a reliever, he throws one pitch to get the final out.  In the bottom half, the Cardinals score a run.  In the top half of the 8th, the Cardinals insert a new reliever who pitches all of the 8th inning.  The Cardinals win 1-0.  The Official Scorer could decide that the reliever who pitched the 8th inning is the winning pitcher of record.   Example #2: The Cardinals are playing the Cubs in STL.  In the bottom of the 6th inning, with the score 1-1, the Cardinals hit a home run.  They win the game with the score of 2-1.  The Cubs pitcher who gave up the Home Run is the Losing Pitcher of record. Example #2a: The Cardinals are playing the Cubs in STL.  In the bottom of the 6th inning, with the score 1-1, the Cubs pitcher gives up a Double.  The Cubs replace that pitcher.  The new pitcher gives up a Single and the running on 2nd scores.  The game ends with the score 2-1.  The Cubs pitcher that gave up the Double would be the Losing Pitcher of record. Example #2b:  The Cardinals are playing the Cubs in STL.  The Cards score 7 runs in the first inning and the Cubs starter is lifted after only getting 1 out.  The Cards eventually win 7-2.  The Cubs starting pitcher is the Losing Pitcher of record. Example #3:  The Cardinals are playing the Cubs in STL.  The Cards have the lead in the top of the ninth by a score of 1-0.  The Cards bring in a relief pitcher and he strikes out the side.  That reliever would be awarded the save. Example #3a:  The Cardinals are playing the Cubs in STL. The Cards have the lead in the top of the ninth by a score of 5-0.  The Cards bring in a relief pitcher and he strikes out the side.  No save is awarded."
Cheating in the Olympics,"The individual Federations, in this case FINA, make all decisions of this nature, not the IOC. Only FINA could strip someone of a medal, following whatever rules they have for the particular situation. As noted, the appeal period has passed so this result will stand according to the rules that all FINA sanctioned events are run under. As part of the requirements to be considered an Olympic sport, all Federations must adhere to the rules around doping as stipulated by WADA. These are pretty tough, including the retrospective stripping of medals that goes far beyond most other forms of cheating or dubious actions. For the record, in this situation the rules, or the enforcement of them, are to blame and not the athlete(s). van der Burgh is guilty only of excess honesty (and this is coming from an Australian). This is on par with say basketball players bending the rules on travelling but getting away with it due to a relaxed interpretation from the umpires. Is that cheating?

Calculation of points for a single match is calculated in the following formula: P = M x I x T x C When the following factors taking into consideration: T - Opponent strength, calculated by the following formula - , when the minimum multiplier is 0.5 for team ranking 150th and under. The ranking position is taken from the the most recently published FIFA World Ranking. C - Confederation strength, In addition to the opponent strength, it also considers the relative strength of entire confederations, UEFA/CONMEBOL = 1.00, CONCACAF = 0.88, AFC/CAF = 0.86 and OFC = 0.85. When calculating matches between teams from different confederations the mean value of the confederations is considers into account.   each match point is also multiple by the match date:
Match average from past 12 months is multiply by 1,
Match average from previous year is multiply by 0.5,
Match average from year 3 is multiply by 0.3,
Match average from year 4 is multiply by 0.2,
Matches older than 4 years is multiply by 0 and deleted. All national team points are summed up to the magic number which is the national team ranking another source is Wikipedia"
Are consecutive let (net services) allowed in Table tennis?,"A let in table tennis is any rally that does not end in a score. The ""net service"" that you described, where the ball on the service touches the net as it goes over, is one type of let. (All of the circumstances that result in a let are listed in the ITTF Handbook, section 2.09.) By definition, a let does not result in a point scored. Additionally, the service does not change until a certain number of points are scored. As a result, you can serve multiple ""net serves"" in a row, and each will be a let. "

Are Masters 1000 tournaments mandatory for top ranked players?,"Any player that is in the Top 30 in the ATP Rankings from the previous year is considered a Commitment Player for the current year. From the 2013 ATP Official Rulebook, I. ATP Circuit Regulations, 1.07 C: Commitment Player
A 2013 ATP commitment player is any player
positioned in the Top 30 in the ATP 2012  Rankings (singles) as of
November 5, 2012. The commitment for a commitment player is described in section D.  Essentially, the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals is required, if accepted; 8 of the 9 ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournaments are required (all except Monte Carlo), and 4 of the ATP World Tour 500 tournaments are required. 1.07 D: Commitment
The commitment for the commitment player is, the singles
event of all ATP World Tour  Masters 1000 tournaments for which he is
accepted, the Barclays ATP World Tour  Finals (if qualified as a
direct acceptance or designated as the alternate) and four (4)  ATP
World Tour 500 tournaments, one (1) of which must be held following
the US  Open. For commitment and ranking purposes, the Monte Carlo
Masters 1000 will be  included in the minimum requirements for the 500
category. 2013 Davis Cup points  may be counted as one (1) of the best
of six (6) in the Emirates ATP Rankings, how-ever, it shall not count
towards the commitment requirement of a commitment player.  See page
184 “Ranking Penalty.” A player can get the number of ATP World Tour Masters 1000 commitment tournaments reduced by meeting certain milestones, based on longevity in the league. 1.08: 1.08 Reduction of ATP World Tour Masters 1000 Commitment
A. A player’s number of ATP World Tour Masters 1000 commitment tournaments shall  be
reduced by one (1) tournament for reaching each of the following
milestones:
1) 600 matches (as of 1 January of the commitment year);
2) 12 years of service;
3) 31 years of age (as of 1 January of the
commitment year).
If all three (3) conditions are met then the player
has a complete exemption from the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 player
commitment. B. A player who is eligible for a reduction of his ATP World Tour
Masters 1000 commitment tournaments must be in good standing with the
ATP in order to receive a reduction of required ATP World Tour
Masters 1000 commitment tournaments. If a player skips the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals without a valid excuse, they are no longer considered in good standing. 1.09 A: 1.09 Unsatisfied Player Commitment Penalties
A. Failure To Participate in the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals
1)If a player qualified for the
Barclays ATP World Tour Finals as a direct acceptance or designated
as the alternate, fails or refuses to participate in this event,
except  for bona fide injury or other reason which constitutes good
cause, the player shall  not be in good standing. This section of the rule book does not specify a penalty for skipping other commitment tournaments.  The Rankings section of the rulebook reveals the penalty.  If the other commitment tournaments are skipped, they are counted against the player for ranking purposes. IX. Emirates ATP Rankings, 9.03 Emirates ATP Rankings: A. Commitment Players.
The year-end Emirates ATP Rankings is based on
calculating, for each player, his total points from the four (4) Grand
Slams, the eight (8)  mandatory ATP World Tour Masters 1000
tournaments and the Barclays ATP World  Tour Finals of the ranking
period, and his best six (6) results from all ATP World Tour  500, ATP
World Tour 250, ATP Challenger Tour and Futures tournaments. For every
Grand Slam or mandatory ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournament for
which a  player is not in the main draw, and was not (and, in the case
of a Grand Slam, would  not have been, had he and all other players
entered) a main draw direct acceptance  on the original acceptance
list, and never became a main draw direct acceptance,  the number of
his results from all other eligible tournaments in the ranking period,
that  count for his ranking, is increased by one (1). In weeks where
there are not four (4)  Grand Slams and eight (8) ATP World Tour
Masters 1000 tournaments in the ranking  period, the number of a
player’s best results from all eligible tournaments in the ranking
period will be adjusted accordingly. Once a player is accepted in the
main draw  of one of these twelve (12) tournaments, as a direct
acceptance, a qualifier, a special  exempt or a lucky loser, or having
accepted a wild card, his result in this tournament  shall count for
his ranking, whether or not he participates."
Do players get yellow cards when they remove their jersey during celebrations?,"Yes, it happen numerous of times. It's like every other yellow card,
look at this from FIFA laws of the games: While it is permissible for a player to demonstrate his joy when a goal has been 
  scored, the celebration must not be excessive.
  Reasonable celebrations are allowed, but the practice of choreographed 
  celebrations is not to be encouraged when it results in excessive time-wasting 
  and referees are instructed to intervene in such cases. A player must be cautioned if: Leaving the ﬁeld of play to celebrate a goal is not a cautionable offence in itself 
  but it is essential that players return to the field of play as soon as possible.
  Referees are expected to act in a preventative manner and to exercise common 
  sense in dealing with the celebration of a goal. Two examples from the FA Premier League:
- Arjen Robben of Chelsea
- Ross Wallace of Sunderland"
Is hiding the ball allowed in football?,"Yes, it would be illegal under ""Law 12 - Fouls and Misconduct"". An indirect free kick is also awarded to the opposing team if, in the opinion of the referee, a player:
  [...]
  impedes the progress of an opponent In addition to that, you would be likely to receive a yellow card for ""unsporting behaviour"". It's a novel strategy but it goes against the spirit of the game and you would then be in danger of having all 11 players on yellow cards."
What was the motivation behind the removal of wrestling from the Olympics?,"According to a statement by an IOC spokesperson in this article, this is a move to renovate the offering of core sports in the Olympics and offer ""the best program for the Olympic Games in 2020."" It was noted that wrestling ranked low in popularity, TV audience, hits on the Internet, and press coverage. An executive board reviewed sports in the Summer Olympics with the intent to remove one to add another later this year...none may be added however. The board voted after reviewing a report by the IOC program commission
  that analyzed 39 criteria, including TV ratings, ticket sales,
  anti-doping policy and global participation and popularity. With no
  official rankings or recommendations contained in the report, the
  final decision by the 15-member board was also subject to political,
  emotional and sentimental factors."
Why are forfeits in baseball scored as 9-0?,"Wikipedia says, ""In the event of forfeiture, the score is recorded as ""9 to 0"", as per rule 2.00 of the Major League Baseball Rules Book."" The major league rules (page 16) state, ""A FORFEITED GAME is a game declared ended by the umpire-in-chief in favor of the offended team by the score of 9 to 0, for violation of the rules."" As for the number 9 - it seems to relate to the number of scheduled innings played out in a professional standard 9 inning game. For softball and little league, for example, the score would be 7-0 since those games schedule only 7 innings of play. I also found something that said that in the event that the forfeiting team is trailing in the score, the score will remain as-is. So, if the team that had to forfeit was behind, say 5-1 - the final score would be recorded as 5-1. I believe the ""9-0"" score is the rule for games that are forfeited and never begin playing out or where the score is tied."
Why 110-hurdles for men and 100-hurdles for women?,"TL;DR: 110 m was set for historical reasons and women had the distance set to 100 m to both use metric units and keep consistency with the number of hurdles run by men (10). 110 metres hurdles in Wikipedia explains that the distance of 110 metres comes from a 120 yards standard defined in the mid-1800s: The first standards were attempted in 1864 in Oxford and Cambridge: The length of the course was set to 120 yards (109.7 m) and over its course, runners were required to clear ten 3 foot 6 inch (1.07 m) high hurdles. The height and spacing of the hurdles have been related to Imperial units ever since. After the length of the course was rounded up to 110 metres in France in 1888, the standards were pretty much complete (except for Germany where 1 metre high hurdles were used until 1907). My interpretation is that technique and spacing became so standard that changing the distance would have made it a completely new competition, hence it was kept. Time passed and women's 100 metres hurdles appeared: The Olympic Games had included the 80 m hurdles in the program from 1932 to 1968. Starting with the 1972 Summer Olympics the women's race was lengthened to 100 m hurdles. The hurdles sprint race has been run by women since the beginning of women's athletics, just after the end of World War I. The distances and hurdle heights varied widely in the beginning. While the men had zeroed in on the 110 m hurdles, the International Women's Sport Federation had registered records for eight different disciplines by 1926 (60 yards/75 cm height, 60 yards/61 cm, 65 yards/75 cm, 83 yards/75 cm, 100 yards/75 cm, 100 yards/61 cm, 120 yards/75 cm, 110 metres/75 cm). At the first Women's World Games in 1922 a 100 m hurdles race was run. The article follows with some interesting insight and follows with: During the 1960s some experimental races were run over a distance of 100 metres using hurdles with a height of 76.2 cm. During the 1968 Summer Olympics a decision was made to introduce the 100 m hurdles using hurdles with a height of 84 cm and the first international event in the 100 m hurdles occurred at the European Athletics Championships, which were won by Karin Balzer, GDR. The modern 100 m race has an extra 2 hurdles compared to the 80 m race, which are higher and spaced slightly further apart. The home stretch is shorter by 1.5 m. My interpretation is that they wanted to increase the number of hurdles to 10 but also keep the spacing. To do so they could just increase to 100 metres. This reasoning is also followed in the debate 80 meter hurdles?: I don't know why, but if, as you speculate, the aim was to harmonize with the men's hurdles, I think it has been achieved in the most practical manner. With the change, the women now face ten obstacles, just as the men do. Furthermore, by increasing the overall distance only twenty meters, the women can still three-step the hurdles, just as the men do. The key parameter is distance between hurdles. I took the official spacing for hurdles and did some calculations to see what other combinations could have been used. The total distance comes from: so it is like this: If we were to have a 110m (W) with the same amount of hurdles, 10, it should be like: The problem is that the bigger distance between hurdles makes it hard to combine with the typical 4-step and may make them need an extra, smaller step that would break speed. If we were to have a 110m (W) with similar spacing, it should be like: so this is completely doable and would make the distance equivalent to men's. However, it may be way harder since the amount of hurdles to skip is bigger."
"Why do all ""combat"" sports always award championship belts (vs. other physical objects)?","After some research, I believe that Wrestling and MMA copied boxing's practice of a championship belt.  Let's start with MMA. When UFC began it followed the accepted practice of awarding championship belts, as WWE and WBO do. UFC simply followed along with it's contemporaries. The first belt awarded to a fighter was a boxer given in 1810, according to this (found on Wikipiedia), found in a book called ""Boxing's Most Wanted™: The Top 10 Book of Champs, Chumps, and Punch-Drunk Palookas."" At this time, boxing had few rules, and did not resemble today's sport. Eye-gouging, choking, and hits with forearms, elbows and legs were common, biting and grabbing are allowed, according to this image, from a book written by a prizefighter. Throughout the next hundred years, boxing became more regulated, similar to what we see today. Around this time (early 20th century), wrestling emerged, as a alternative to the more regulated boxing. Presumably, just as UFC did when it began, wrestling copied boxing's practice of awarding championship belts. So, it looks like King George III started it and it caught on to everyone else!  "
How does FIA enforce the Formula 1 testing ban?,"Monitoring of test tracks is actually quite well policed, and is quite easy, as it isn't a simple logistical exercise to get an F1 car track tested.  What is harder to check for is testing of particular components, or windtunnel testing, by 3rd parties as these may not be obvious to the monitors.  So instead what they rely on is that F1 teams will be punished if they push the rules too far. It is understood that F1 teams will try to exploit any loophole or push any rule to its limit in order to gain an advantage, but the penalties for actually breaking a rule are quite high so they have to weigh up the potential cost to themselves, versus the potential gains. Many agree it appears to work, but there are a fair few cynics who suggest that the biggest names may have ways and means that the smaller teams don't, including relationships with fluid dynamics teams, manufacturers, test suites etc."
How are individual turnovers determined on errant passes?,"It all comes down to who had the last full possession of the ball. If player A on team 1 passed the ball, and player B on team 1 tipped it, and player A on team 2 caught it, the turnover would be player A1's fault. Note: As it was not specified, these are Middle/High School rules. I can not vouch that this is also an NBA or College rule UPDATE: I FOUND THIS BLOG IN WHICH IT STATES THAT, IN THE NBA, THE LAST PERSON TO TOUCH THE BALL IS GIVEN THE TURNOVER."
How is the length of the six measured instantly?,"Radar gun is used to calculate the bowling speed in cricket.A simple example showing the use on http://www.bigbro.in/blog/how-is-the-bowling-speed-and-lengthdistance-of-the-sixes-hit-in-cricket-measured/ How it works? Radar gun is the current or present technology to calculate the speed of bowl. Radar gun has both radio transmitter and the receiver. This device works on the principle of ""Doppler effect."" It sends the radio waves to the receiver. They emit a radio signal in a narrow beam and receive the same signal after it bounces from the target particle. Another method, Hawk eye method
It uses six specially placed cameras around the ground to track the path of the ball, from when it was released from the bowler's hand right up until when it's dead. with the combined effect of these six camera's a 3-D image is formed and is used to measure the speed of the ball bowled. This same technology is used to calculate the distance of the six hit by the batsman."
Any historical sports with instant-win moves?,"Boxing has a win in 10 seconds via knockout, or instantly if the referee calls it."
Why did Manuel Neuer leave the goal post and come to the midfield position in group qualifiers?,"When Neuer left the German's penalty area, Germany were already losing 1-0 and going out of the World Cup. By effectively becoming an extra outfield player, he increased the chance of Germany scoring the goal they needed to draw the match and stay in the World Cup. It didn't work, but that doesn't mean it wasn't the right thing to try. A famous similar situation in which this tactic did work was at the end of the 1998-1999 Football League season: Carlisle United needed to win their last match to avoid being relegated from the Football League, but were drawing 1-1 in injury team. Their goalkeeper, Jimmy Glass, made his way into the opposition penalty area and scored the goal which kept Carlisle in the league. Crossing sports slightly, ""pulling the goaltender"" is a common tactic when a team is losing by one or even two goals late in an ice hockey match. The maths works out slightly differently there as ""goal difference"" is of just about zero importance in ice hockey but can be significant in football, which is why goalkeepers generally won't go running around out of their area in most football matches."
How do defenders score goals when part of a formation,"In modern soccer, the formation is not a rigid structure, and the player positions are more flexible. Especially the wingbacks (defenders at the far left and right) combine the functions of a classical full back with a (midfield) winger – when they get to the ball, they quickly move forward along the side to prepare an attack, often even participating in its final phases (and, therefore, they can sometimes even score a goal). It is obviously important other players know their tasks in such a situation. This is a useful part of modern soccer tactics, and is prescribed by managers (well, not always, obviously), not discouraged."
Why is NFL season significantly shorter compared to most other sports?,"The physicality of the NFL is much greater than those of the NBA and MLB for example. Football is one of the most strenuous sports, and is much more of a full contact sport. When you are coming into physical contact as much as NFL players do, then you are more likely to fatigue and be at a higher risk of injury.  Players need a break to rehab from injuries, get ready for the off-season, training camp, and the preseason. The human body can only take so much, especially and when you practice several days a week, and play full contact once a week. In the NBA for example, players do not have to worry about being tackled by a 300+ pound lineman from play to play. It is illegal to tackle an opponent in the NBA....that's not to say there's no physical contact. However, compared to the NFL and the sport of football, the NBA and the sport of basketball have much less physical contact. Within the sport of football, a kicker has a longer lifespan than a runningback. "
How does having a pacesetter help set a record?,"At the highest level, a pace setter helps ensure they meet their game plan for the race exactly.  The pace setter is told to run a very specific pace (or pace pattern).  This allows the top level runner to just follow along and worry less about pacing, and focus on his/her own race. There is a question Pace Strategy for Marathon that asks about strategy for pacing.   Like most things in long distance running, the answer for a world class pro is different for an age grouper, and different still for a person just out there to complete or even do a personal race. The top level racer will have a plan for how he/she desires to hit their goal.  Perhaps a bit faster in the first half, or slower.  Whatever they and their coach decide.  A pace setting lets them stay accurate to that plan."
"As a defensive lineman, can I intentionally encroach to stop the clock?","No.  Section 7.1 Actions to Conserve Time - Illegal Acts (from the bold section below marked Penalty): If  the action  is by  the defense,  the play clock will be  reset  to 40 seconds, and  the game clock will 
  start on the ready signal, unless the offense chooses to have the clock start on the snap. If the 
  defense has  timeouts  remaining,  it will have  the option of using a  timeout  in  lieu of  the game 
  clock being started.   The end result of this will be far worse than the play being started. By preventing the snap you could cause an additional 40 seconds to run off the game clock (because the offense may choose to have the clock start at the ready signal).  Additionally, the same document states (7.3): Article 3 - In the last 40 seconds of either half, if there is a defensive foul prior to the snap while time is in, the
  half will end, unless the defense has timeouts remaining, or the offense chooses to have the Game Clock
  start on the snap. Overall this is an unworkable strategy. Your best bet at this point of the game is to force a turnover or hope there is enough time left for a turnover on downs."
Roles of Captains in Ice-Hockey,"The captain and (during his absence on ice) alternate captains (not “assistant”) are players designated to be the point of contact between the referee and the team. Only these players are allowed to discuss with the Referee any questions relating to the interpretation of rules. This privilege applies only to the respective captain/alternate captain who is currently on ice – any player, not invited by the referee, who comes off the bench to make a protest with the officials, shall receive a minor penalty. Also, this discussions relating to the interpretation of the rules cannot concern a penalty – no player, not even the captain, is allowed to make complaints regarding a penalty. When he makes such a complaint, he shall receive a minor penalty (a misconduct penalty under IIHF rules). The referee can (and often does) explain a penalty to the captains, but they are not allowed to complain. Note that the referee crease serves quite a different purpose: It is an area where officials can safely discuss among themselves – no player (not even captain) is allowed to enter the crease when the referee is reporting to or consulting with the other officials. Should he do so, he shall receive a misconduct penalty. But it is also the place where referees will usually discuss with the captains. Normally, there is one captain (marked with “C”) and two alternate captains (marked with “A”), one such player in each line. The NHL rules also allow to have no captain, but three alternate captains (this must be chosen prior to the game, and in this case, the Captain cannot be present in uniform). This is not possible in the international (IIHF) rules, where one captain and no more than two alternate captains must be appointed. As in almost all team sports, the captain and the alternate captains also have important non-official duties. They are usually the senior/experienced players, having respect of other players, officials, and spectators. They also often serve as a point of contact between the players and the manager and the rest of team management. Sources:"
How does the effectively-free pitstop work during the safety car?,"The ""free"" pit-stop doesn't exist any more, especially since the rules were changed last year that meant drivers had to stick to a certain speed when the safety car was on track, I will explain that in more detail later on. The basic premise of the ""free"" pit-stop is that under normal circumstances you lose more time relative to the cars not stopping than you would do under the safety car.  For example, let's assume a track where the average speed is 100 (doesn't matter if it's kmh or mph) for the lap and the average lap time 100 seconds.  If you stopped in the pits let's assume it adds another 25 seconds to your lap time, this means you've taken 25% more time compared to the other cars. However, if the safety car is out, the laptimes double to 200 seconds, your pit-stop now only adds 12.5% to the average lap as it is the same duration, so the penalty for stopping is much less, but there is still a penalty. Another example is once everyone is behind the SC and you pit, let's say from 1st place, assuming the SC stays out you would rejoin at the back of the pack.  If the pack isn't too large then that's only a lost of around 10 seconds on the track. With regards to the recent rule changes - in the past the drivers were told they had to acknowledge the fact that the safety car was on track and drive accordingly.  In reality they were still driving at pretty close to 100% until they actually caught the safety car up, so laptimes could be close to normal racing speeds at least for the lap or so after the SC was deployed, they would still be catching the SC and it wasn't until they actually caught it that speeds would be seriously affected. The new rules mean driver MUST obey a speed limit while the SC is on track, this works by forcing them to drive each sector within a certain amount of time, this is checked by telemetry and any driver not obeying this will be penalised. The drivers can see the time on their steering wheel display - so the advantage of pitting under the SC isn't as great as it used to be and vice versa the advantage isn't so big either. What happened in the last race was simply that Vettel made up around 25 seconds over Hamilton due to his pit-stop and Hamilton couldn't make that time back up when Vettel pitted as he was limited by the new SC rules as to how fast he could go when trying to catch the SC.  He did catch up Vettel once they both caught the SC but the damage was done as you can't overtake under SC conditions.  "
Are players allowed to pass a penalty kick?,"According to the Law 14 in the IFAB laws of the game: Assuming Cruyff's teammate didn't enter the penalty area until after the ball was kicked and moving forward, the move is legal. Although I should point out that the link below (and my points above) are for the current Laws of the Game. The linked video is from 1982, so it's possible things were different then, though I don't think the rules for a penalty kick have changed that much in the past 30 years. Rules for a penalty shoot-out (at the end of a tied match where you need a winner) are quite different."
Why are NFL hash marks closer than NCAA hash marks?,"In 1972 the NFL moved the hash marks closer together, ""looking for a way to produce more action and more touchdowns, now that defenses have become so effective"". The article goes on to add, Putting the ball in play farther from each sideline supposedly gives the offense more room to exercise its options. But it also becomes more seductive to try a field goal, since the kicker has less of an angle for his attempt."
"What is the role of a ""false 9""?","Let's start from the end. The best player who plays ""false 9"" today is, without any doubt, Lionel Messi. There isn't one definition of a ""false 9"", but I will try to explain it from my understanding.   ""False 9"" is generally a player who isn't a pure striker as defined in the past. This player will drop deep into the field to be a part of or start the attack. When doing that, opponents / defenders will follow him and leave more space to players from the 2nd line to threaten the goal.   The ""false 9"" usually has great finishing, a very high level of vision on the pitch, and good dribbling and passing. Zonal Marking defines it as: A unconventional lone striker, who drops deep into midfield. Francesco
  Totti perhaps invented it for Roma in 2006/7, Lionel Messi played here
  when he swapped positions with Samuel Eto’o for Barcelona in 2008/09,
  and Robin van Persie played the role for Arsenal at the start of the
  2009/10 season. Teams who play with a ""false 9"" generally play in 4-6-0 formation with the ""false 9"" turning into a striker when needed. I answered a similar question about this formation here: Has 4-6-0 ever worked in high level football? Another great explanation of the ""false 9"" according to Barcelona and Josep Guardiola's dream about a team with a goalkeeper and 10 midfielders can be found at the following post.  "
Forefoot landing at certain pace,"I'd definitely agree with @solomongaby on landing below your COG. To answer your question directly, a forefoot strike can and should be effective at any pace. Bear in mind that the biomechanics (and resulting efficiency) of your strike has everything to do with your carriage. To that effect here are a few things to keep in mind: Also, another visualization that has helped me tremendously is to imagine you have dowel rods extending from the inside of each ankle. Naturally, you'll need to step over each rod in order to keep from tripping.  Since this is a lot to swallow I'd also suggest picking one aspect of your form to concentrate on at a time or per training session until you get it down. For a more in-depth look into techniques, exercises and the science behind proper form and subsequent forefoot striking, the Chi-Running (Video Overview of Chi-Running) and POSE methodologies (Comparison of Heel vs Forefoot strike and Form) of running are great to learn and study. Both have videos and written literature available. I don't recommend any one over the other as the both generally teach the same style of running but with different terminology. Lastly, try 20 - 30 minutes of barefoot running on soft grass. When you remove the barriers of thick soled shoes, it's easier to ""feel"" proper form and foot strike. "
NFL division with all teams having a losing or winning record,"Yes, the NFC West had all teams finish with a losing record in 2010.  Wikipedia mentions this: In 2010, the NFC West became the first division in NFL history to have a champion with a losing record, after the 2010 Seattle Seahawks won the division title with a record of 7-9. I also found this heavy.com article that says the following regarding the current 2014 season: At the unofficial midpoint of the 2014 NFL season, the AFC North Division has all four teams sporting winning records: Cincinnati (5-2-1), Pittsburgh (6-3), Cleveland (5-3) and Baltimore (5-4). If all four remain above .500 at the end of the season, it would be the first time in NFL history that all of the teams from one division finished with a winning record. That means no NFL division has ever had all of its teams finish with a winning record. In 2014, the NFC South had all of its teams finish with a losing record.  The Carolina Panthers won the division with a 7-8-1 record, as mentioned in this article: Carolina (7-8-1) won its fourth in a row to join the 2010 Seattle Seahawks (7-9) as the only teams to capture a division title with a losing record. In 2020, the NFC East had all of its teams finish with a losing record: Washington (7-9), New York (6-10), Dallas (6-10), Philadelphia (4-11-1)."
Why are left arm spinners called differently?,"Why are left arm spinners called differently? To appropriately describe how the ball is bowled (right-handed or left-handed). For right-arm bowlers, off spinners spin from off to leg and leg spinners spin from leg to off in right-handed batsmen.  For left-arm bowlers, ""off spinners"" spin from off to leg and ""leg spinners"" spin from leg to off only for left-handed batsmen, which is opposite of what is stated above. The left-arm orthodox is a type of finger leg-spin but is referred to as an off spin to a left-handed batsman as it turns the ball into him while the left-arm chinaman is a type of wrist off spin but is referred to as a leg spin as it turns away from a left-handed batsman.   Left-arm off spinners are known as ""left-arm orthodox."" It spins from off to leg to a left-handed batsman, is bowled left-armed, and uses a finger leg spin spin technique. (1)  A leg spinner also spins from leg to off, but is bowled right-armed and uses a wrist leg spin technique. (1) As you can see, calling a spinner by how it spins only describes such. It does not describe how it was bowled (the bowler's handedness)."
Does a run count if it's made on the same play as the 3rd out?,"If the 3rd out is the result of a force-out (example: bases loaded, batter hits to the third baseman, third baseman steps on third base before runner reaches), then the run from third base will not count. If the 3rd out is the result of gunning for extra bases (example: bases loaded, batter hits past third baseman, batter reaches first and goes for second, left fielder throws to second baseman who tags out the batter before he reaches 2nd base), then any run scored (given the runner has reached home before the batter was tagged out) will count as the batter reached first base. If the 3rd out is the result of tagging up (example: runner on 1st and 3rd, batter hits sacrifice fly, outfielder catches the ball for the out, runner on 3rd reaches home, runner on 1st goes for 2nd but gets tagged out), then the run from 3rd base will count because the out at 2nd was not a force-out only if the runner from 3rd base touches home plate before the out at 2nd is made. Rule 4.09 of MLB's Official Baseball Rules of 2012 states: 4.09 HOW A TEAM SCORES. (a) One run shall be scored each time a runner legally advances to and touches first, second, third and home base
before three men are put out to end the inning. EXCEPTION: A run is not scored if the runner advances to home base during a play in which the third out is made. (1) by the batter-runner before he touches first base; (2) by any runner being forced out; or (3) by a preceding runner who is declared out because he failed to touch one of the bases."
Why do swimmers peak at such a young age?,"My hypothesis: Swimmers peak at a younger age than track and field runners because of metrics such as explosive and dynamic strength, reaction time, and speed of limb movement. Ages of winners in strength and speed events have historically peaked earlier than endurance events (see below).   The first table shows what psychomotor and physical factors are utilized during a given sport/event. Swimming and short distance events utilize explosive and dynamic strength, reaction time, and speed of limb movement, unlike medium and long distance running events. In comparison (the second table shows the mean ages of gold medal winners in given sports/events between 1896-1980), the mean age of gold medal winners in medium and long distance running events have generally and consistently been higher than gold medal winners in swimming and short distance events. Keep in mind, water is 773 times denser and 55 times more viscous than air(1). One could argue that more energy is spent in swimming than running due to resistance. An article states the following:  ""What makes swimming different? Simply put, running is a natural
  activity, while swimming is a 'natural struggle.'"" To put the two sports in perspective, in world record time, a 1500m freestyle swimming event (men: ~ 14:30 min.) takes 10+ minutes more to complete than a 1500m run (men: ~ 3:30 min). Characteristics of strength and speed events include reaction time, speed of limb movement, flexibility, explosive strength, and gross body coordination.  Characteristics of endurance events include control precision, rate control, arm-hand steadiness, aiming, and stamina.   Human strength peaks at age 25(2). Human reaction time also peaks in the 20s(3). From a neural standpoint: As we age, humans lose brain connections(4), which contribute to slower reaction times. I used this study to answer your question. For the purposes of this question, I did not include outliers or exceptions to said research."
In NCAA Basketball what does it mean to be 1 and 1?,"1 and 1 means you're going to shoot a free throw and, if you make it, you're going to shoot another free throw. In terms of being ""in 1 and 1"" that means that if you get a non shooting foul, instead of the other team just getting the ball, they get to shoot a 1 and 1. If you get enough fouls you move out of 1 and 1 and they just start shooting 2 free throws every time. The idea is that you get a couple 'gimme' fouls to start with, up to 6. For your 7th the other team shoots 1 and 1s. This is called ""bonus"". For your 10th, they shoot 2 free throws every time. This is called ""double bonus"". In the NBA, where you're expected to play more within the rules (except for travelling, which doesn't seem to exist anymore, but that's another rant) there is no ""bonus"". It goes directly into double bonus starting with the 5th foul or the second foul in the last two minutes of the period, if the team wasn't already in the bonus. source This can play a big role in the end of the period. If you're down, it's much more dangerous to foul, as it's going to put your opponent further ahead. Or, if you're up, it's going to give your opponent a chance to catch up. Unfortunately, short of a time out, fouls are pretty much the only mechanism to stop the clock. So if the ball gets stolen and the other team is going to run it down the court for a layup, your only option might be to 'accidentally' foul him, say with a reach or a light bodily contact. This at least removes the guarantee of a layup and saves precious seconds off the clock, but puts you further into bonus or into double bonus so actual accidental fouls are penalized harder."
Does the penalty shoot out goal count as the person goal for a player?,"No, it does not get counted.
For instance, if we look at the goals scored by Messi during FIFA 2014 World cup:
He has a total of 4 goals till now. 1 vs Bosnia and Herzegovina (group stage) 1 vs Iran (group stage) 2 vs Nigeria (group stage) The statistics from FIFA summarize it the best."
How are IPL players paid?,"Each player has to sign a contract with BCCI.  The IPL has two type of contracts – under first, called the firm agreement, the player will get a fixed sum from BCCI and the difference between the bid amount and the fixed fee will be earned by BCCI,  On the other hand the second, called the basic agreement, gives a player freedom to take home the amount he has been bid for. The average amount of money each player will take home is whopping Rs 80 lakhs.  IPL also makes it mandatory for a franchise to spend at least $3.3 million annually for player fees and give $100 as per day per player daily allowance.  International players will be immediately released to attend their international matches if they clash with IPL whereas for domestic boards, which rely heavily on the players, will have to give way to IPL as players need to decide where they want to play, and a player who gets Rs 80 lakhs for 45 days will not leave IPL anyhow. Hence, it will be a loss to domestic boards but a great opportunity for youngsters who don’t get chance to perform in national and international leagues."
Squeezing the ball between two feet and hopping across the field,"This is completely legal, provided it is done in a manner in which it is still possible to safely challenge for the ball or there are no opponents nearby. FIFA Laws of the Game, 2013/14, p. 121: Playing in a dangerous manner is defined as any action that, while
  trying to play the ball, threatens injury to someone (including the player
  himself). It is committed with an opponent nearby and prevents the opponent
  from playing the ball for fear of injury. If the referee decides that the action by the player makes it dangerous for opponents to challenge for the ball, an indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team. If this goes further, and playing the ball moves from being unsafe to an impossibility (for an unreasonable amount of time), a player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour. Note that there is no requirement here for opponents to be nearby. This is no longer contained in the present text of the Laws, but was last seen in the 2006 FIFA Q&A to the Laws of The Game, p.30: A player intentionally lies on the ball for an unreasonable length of
  time. What action does the referee take? He stops play, cautions the player for unsporting behaviour and restarts
  play with an indirect free kick. In the current (2013/14) laws, this roughly corresponds to the following on p. 123: There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for
  unsporting behaviour, e.g. if a player: ... ... The restart is once again an indirect free kick. Thanks to posdef, here is a clip of Cuauhtémoc Blanco using this technique."
How to boost vertical speed / jump height,"I played volleyball, we used to train in the gym (leg press, etc). I always had knee problems, until I started to train on a trampoline (small one). I wasn't able to fix my problem completely, but it improved a lot. There are all kinds of stability training exercises available on a trampoline: You can also do these exercises with a ball. I found a nice link http://www.gymmomentum.com/2012/02/01/strength-and-stability-to-help-with-tumbling/"
Sinking opponent's ball,"Assuming that you have not committed a standard foul otherwise, sinking the opponent's ball is not a foul in itself, so my interpretation of it is that you can continue with the game as you would have normally. The following is an excerpt from World Pool-Billiards Association rulebook for 8-ball: 3.9 Standard Fouls  If the shooter commits a foul, play passes to his opponent. The cue ball is in hand, and the incoming player may place
it anywhere on the playing surface. (See 1.5 Cue Ball in Hand.) The following are standard fouls at eight ball: 6.1 Cue Ball Scratch or off the Table 6.2 Wrong Ball First The first ball contacted by the cue ball on each shot must belong to the shooter’s group, except when the table is
open. (See 3.4 Open Table / Choosing Groups). 6.3 No Rail after Contact 6.4 No Foot on Floor 6.5 Ball Driven off the Table (See 3.7 Spotting Balls.) 6.6 Touched Ball 6.7 Double Hit / Frozen Balls 6.8 Push Shot 6.9 Balls Still Moving 6.10 Bad Cue Ball Placement 6.11 Bad Play from Behind the Head String 6.12 Cue Stick on the Table 6.13 Playing out of Turn 6.14 Three Consecutive Fouls 6.15 Slow Play 6.16 Ball Rack Template Foul"
What language do Belgian football players use to communicate between themselves?,"German isn't really a significant language in Belgium. All players will speak either French or Dutch. English is increasingly becoming an unifying language in the country as the Dutch of Wallonians is virtually non existent and despite some knowledge of French being widespread in Flanders it tends to be weaker than their English ability. I somehow doubt Anderlecht fans make much use of English on the terraces as they would be predominantly French speaking, although some chants may be in English for the benefit of the visiting supporters who are mainly Flemish as the vast majority of Belgian league teams hail from the Dutch speaking Flemmish region."
Rule on Being fouled shooting at the wrong basket,"A shooting foul can only occur when trying to shoot at the basket which will increase your own team's score. Therefore, if you were somehow shooting at your own basket and got fouled, it would be the same as a normal non-shooting foul. You would not get free throws unless you were in the ""bonus"". If you actually made the basket, I think it would be waved off because it is a foul on the team who the score would go to. So just as a basket does not count when an offensive player commits a charge (or other offensive foul), a ""wrong-way"" basket would not count when the defending team has committed a foul. In fact, this is the most likely way that your scenario would occur. Player goes up for a rebound, is fouled and makes the ball accidentally go into the basket. Foul would be called with ""no basket"". Here is the official definition of a ""Field Goal Attempt"" from the NBA (http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_4.html?nav=ArticleList): A field goal attempt is a player's attempt to shoot the ball into his
  basket for a field goal. Attempt to shoot the ball into ""his basket"" means the basket which would give his team points. Trying to shoot the ball into the other team's basket does not qualify under this definition and therefore does not count as a ""field goal attempt"".  Free throws are granted for fouls during a field goal attempt, so since ""shooting at the wrong basket"" is NOT a field goal attempt, no free throw would be given. In another section of the same rules (http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_12.html?nav=ArticleList) it says: A personal foul assessed against an offensive player which is neither an elbow, punching or flagrant foul shall be penalized in the following manner:
  (1) No points can be scored by the offensive team  Which I take to mean that NO TEAM can score points on a play where they also commit a foul."
Who gets Super Bowl rings?,"To sum up, the ownership pays for all the rings and decides who receives them. The list above shows the norm."
How are the kids who walk with players into a football match selected?,"The mascots who walk out with the football players are usually from local schools or football teams, selected from letters written in by themselves, winners of competitions run by the club or children with disabilities. Also when youth leagues become ""partners"" of the team by buying a team package etc., one of the perks is to have some of your players as an escort for a match, as well as serve as ball kids."
When/how did US professional wrestling transition from being competitive to being worked?,"Basically professional wrestling as we know it was pioneered by wrestler Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis and promoters Toots Mondt and Billy Sandow in the 1920s. They were the ones who essentially invented the ""job"" - Lewis was a legit shoot wrestler who could win the title at will, and Mondt and Sandow realized that having Lewis keep the belt for long periods of time would bore the fans and thus lead to smaller gates. So they had Lewis drop the belt whenever he wanted to generate interest and revenue, and he could legitimately win the title back from an opponent if he decided that would ""go into business for himself"" and decide to fight Lewis for real. Plus Mondt was also a legitimate wrestler who could rough up wrestlers if they didn't stick to the script. Mondt also deserves the credit for coming up with what he called ""Slam Bang Western style wrestling"" which moved away from on-the-mat Greco-Roman style of wrestling to the more familiar body slams, clotheslines, suplexes and fisticuffs that we see in professional wrestling. Mondt thought that this would be a better draw than the hour-long mat wrestling matches that Gotch and Hackenschmidt were delivering twenty years before.  "
Are there currently any clubs that have more European titles than domestic titles (excluding minor domestic titles)?,"After doing a research which includes Champions league, UEFA cup & super cup  winners I found that there are no teams that fits the criteria of more european titles than domestic titles. But I found that Bayer 04 Leverkusen has a 1:1 tally winning 1 German cup (1992–93) and 1 UEFA Cup (1987–88). Ipswich Town is also a team to mention holding a 2:1 tally winning 2 domestic titles (Champion - 1961–62, cup - 1977–78) and 1 UEFA Cup (1980-81). also as mentioned in the comments Sevilla FC has a 7:6 tally.

Color of the sprint jersey in Tour de Suisse?,"I can answer your first question. Your second question would be more difficult to track down. In the Tour de Suisse (and in fact, many other stage races as well), the jerseys' colors simply change from year to year. Even the rules change quite often. In 2012, for instance, there was no intermediate sprints jersey. Instead, there was a red jersey for the best Swiss rider in the general classification. Often, these color changes are caused by changes in sponsors. This is quite prominent in the Tour of Spain, for instance: even the general classification's leader jersey (which would typically be seen as a very traditional prize) has changed numerous times throughout the years. 2008 was not the only year when the sprints jersey was white. The same color was used in 2007. After that, the blue color has been used fairly consistently, but it may be up for change again next year."
What is a record for a football player in converting consecutive penalties in official matches?,"Rickie Lambert converted all of his 34 penalties for Southampton FC. (Although he missed some penalty kicks in some of his previous clubs. And after transfer from Southampton to Liverpool he did not convert his first penalty in a friendly against AC Milan.)  Based on his statistics on soccerway, he scored penalty goals for Southampton in the following competitions: It is worth mentioning that only the last 6 penalties in this series were in Premier League, previously he played in lower competitions. This only adds up to 33 penalties. I am not sure where the discrepancy from the sources saying that he scored 34 penalties comes from."
Rules for Orange and Purple Caps in IPL,"In case of a tie, the Orange cap would be given to the one who has faced lesser balls to achieve this tied score. The Purple cap, in case of a tie at the top, is given to the one who has taken the wickets in the least amount of balls. This can be seen on the official IPL site Purple Cap standings 2013 (the link gets updated at the end of each game. Refer to the screenshot below for the standings as of 14th April where there is a tie) where Vinay Kumar (Royal Challengers Bangalore) and Kevon Cooper (Rajasthan Royals) have the same number of wickets but the purple cap is with Cooper as he has bowled 5 overs fewer than Kumar to get those 8 wickets.  Yes, the Orange cap owner who is fielding will be allowed to wear the orange cap till the end of the innings even if an opposition batsman has overtaken his runs. At the end of the innings, the batsman who has overtaken the said fielder's score will be presented with the orange cap and he can wear that when he comes out to field, assuming he still is the highest scorer. A scenario where a batsman wins the orange cap in the second innings of the game may not have the orange cap when this team runs out to field the next game. Wiki says that the orange and purple caps are to worn only during fielding. There is no hard and fast rule about these caps while batting. Anyways, there are very few batsmen who bat with caps these days as they almost always come out with helmets, even to spinners. So, if the orange cap holder comes out to bat with a cap, I would assume it is his prerogative to either come out wearing his team cap or the orange/purple cap."
How can I avoid slicing with my driver?,"The number one cause of slicing, irrespective of the exact aspect of the swing that is lacking, is a ""grip it and rip it"" mentality to your swing. This generally causes a number of timing and posture issues that open the clubface, bring the swing out of line, etc etc. So, the number one thing to do is slow it down. You can send the ball MUCH farther than you think with a very easy swing, and an extreme windup (the kind where you end up able to see the clubhead out in front of you in your peripheral vision) will cause more problems with accuracy than it solves with distance. From a technical standpoint, slices happen when the club induces a clockwise (for a rightie) sidespin on the ball. This induces a force called Magnus lift, where the leading edge of the rotation on the left side of the ball brings the turbulent air from the back of the ball around to the front along that side as part of the ball's ""boundary layer"", and so causes the boundary layer on that side to be thicker. That thicker, relatively higher-pressure boundary layer pushes the ball in the opposite direction (to the right). Sidespin is induced whenever the clubhead moves in a direction other than the direction the clubhead faces. The direction of the face determines the line the ball will launch along; the difference between that line and the line of movement of the clubhead determines sidespin. For a slice, the clubhead is moving to the left of the direction it faces. Most commonly, this is because the clubhead faces right of the intended line. Here's how to diagnose and fix the most common slices, for a right-hand golfer. At the driving range bay, determine the desired line of travel, and draw a line or place a club along that line. Put your toes right up to that line (a ""square stance""), address the ball as you normally do, take your normal swing (ensuring you make solid contact), and find the symptom that best describes the ball's flight: Push Slice: Push: Fade/Straight Slice: Pull Slice: Solutions:  All around, you're probably ""overswinging"" the club. This causes breakdowns in key areas of posture and mechanics, and can cause the clubhead to torque causing changes in face angle.  To solve mishits: To solve an open clubface at impact:  To solve swing path problems:  As a short-term solution to most of this, rotate the club counterclockwise to close the face until the shot flies straight, and then correct your aim left or right to compensate for the swing path. While this will produce a straight flight, the misalignment can still cause distance problems, inconsistencies, etc and so you should spend some time at the range adjusting your mechanics."
What is the record for the most family members competing in the same Olympic Games?,"The record for the most siblings in the same Olympic Games is 4.  This happened when the four brothers Luis Adrián, Jorge, José and Roberto Tamés from Mexico competed as two 2-man  bobsleigh teams at the 1988 Calgary Winter Games. See 1 (1a), 2, 3. Three siblings competing in one Olympic Games has happened several times:"
Why do basketball players wipe their hands on their shoes?,"From being a player myself, I know that there are usually two main reasons why basketball players wipe their shoes. Most of the time, the players are trying to wipe the dust off their shoes and to put some of the moisture from their hands onto them, resulting in the shoes having a better grip (which usually results in quicker movements). When players are sweating heavily, they want to get some of the dust from their shoes onto their hands so that the ball doesn't slip as easily from their fingers. “Some of them (the players) like to get a little grit on their fingers if their hands are sweaty,” Bob Sheffield of Notre Dame says. Or, as Sean Taylor of Quincy High School frankly puts it: “This has been happening as long as I can remember,” Taylor said. “I think (wiping the bottom of your shoes) also turns into a habit.”"
Why do footballers (and coaches) cover their mouth when speaking to each other?,"The general belief around this is that they do not want to give away important tactical information to their rivals on the pitch, or watching on TV. Another common belief is that actually they are hiding their mouths so that their words cannot be interpreted via lip reading from footage. But it's not only in football: this happens in many team sports. During the 2014 FIFA World Cup some media outlets used lip reading experts to reveal insight, thoughts and strategy. From this bbc.com article: Luiz Felipe Scolari's squad have taken to covering their mouths on the pitch to stop intrusive Brazilian television stations from gaining an unwelcome insight into their thoughts and strategy. One programme, TV Globo's Fantastico, revealed some of Scolari's advice to his players during the World Cup opener between Brazil and Croatia... [Brazilian coach Scolari told a press conference regarding lip reading:] ""We are not free to work on the pitch anymore."" Taking a line from this quora answer: To avoid cameras, so that the media does not conjure a syllable out of thin air. From that same BBC article, Brazil's reserve goalkeeper Jefferson stated: ""Sometimes there are tough, ugly words and this is normal. But some TV shows make a big fuss about it."" One another reason for this might be to amplify the voice - from an article in thesun.co.uk: Renowned PR consultant Phil Hall, who has worked with some of the biggest clubs and names in the Premier League, says no-one is being advised to cover up to protect vital team plans. Hall said: ""A player once told me one of the main reasons they do it is, sometimes you are doing it when you are close to somebody, it amplifies your voice so they can hear you. Hall again states: ""In NFL there is a whole pattern of tactics and play calls that can be read by a lip reader, but in football the game is just not that structured where it could potentially make a difference."" The articles I am referencing mention that players are not actually briefed to talk like this. References:"
What are the key differences to my game with different racquet sizes?,"All other things being equal: Smaller frames are known for control oriented play, ie serve and volley.  With advancements in racket technology, many players are able to use larger frames without having to sacrifice control. You should demo a few rackets, and discover what you like.  If you a happen to prefer an oversize frame, then you should not be reluctant about the purchase, simply because it's an oversize frame."
Is the runner on first forced to run?,"I think that rule 7.08e is the key here: (e) He fails to reach the next base before a fielder tags him or the
  base, after he has been forced to advance by reason of the batter
  becoming a runner. However, if a following runner is put out on a
  force play, the force is removed and the runner must be tagged to be
  put out. The force is removed as soon as the runner touches the base
  to which he is forced to advance, and if he overslides or overruns the
  base, the runner must be tagged to be put out. However, if the forced
  runner, after touching the next base, retreats for any reason towards
  the base he had last occupied, the force play is reinstated, and he
  can again be put out if the defense tags the base to which he is
  forced; I interpret that is saying the force to second base is removed as soon as the preceding/following runner is tagged out.  Therefore the lead runner is no longer in a force situation and may return to (or stay on, in this case) their previously occupied base."
Fifa World Cup 2018 Group F Qualification Scenarios,"You can find list of tiebreakers in Wikipedia article on 2018 FIFA World Cup (link to the current revision). They are specified in Section 32.5 of 2018 FIFA World Cup Regulations (link to Internet Archive) and on FIFA World Cup site (Internet Archive). I have also copied them below.  If I understood them correctly, this is what happens in the situation described in your question. As you rightly point out, in this scenario the first three tie-breakers (i.e., points, goal difference, goals scored) will not decide anything, since the three teams have exactly the same score.  The next criteria are points, goal difference, goals scored in the matches between the tied teams. So we look only at these matches, which are: GER-MEX 0:1, GER-SWE 2:1, SWE-MEX 1:0. Now if we make table just from these matches we get We see that Germany and Sweden are tied, Mexico is eliminated. So Germany and Sweden advance further, but the group winner is still not decided. The next tie-breaker are fair-play points which take into account yellow and red cards. After two matches Sweden is ahead of Germany. (Which is not surprising, considering that the Boateng's red card from the match against Sweden is at the moment the only red card in this group.) But this can change after the remaining matches. If they are tied even on fair-play points, then the team who advances further is decided by drawing lots. I will add that there already are a few related questions (and answers) on this site. For example: The only difference between 2014 and 2018 World Cup tie-breakers is the addition of fair-play points. Remark. The question whether after eliminating Mexico we should apply the same criteria again to the remaining teams - Germany and Sweden - keeps popping up in the comments. It is true that this is often done in groups stage of various competitions. However, it seems that in such cases it is explicitly mentioned in the regulations. (For example, 2017-18 UEFA Champions League's tiebreaker rules explicitly say that: ""If more than two teams are tied, and after applying all head-to-head criteria above, a subset of teams are still tied, all head-to-head criteria above are reapplied exclusively to this subset of teams."") Since here the regulation do not say so, I followed explicitly what is written there and did not apply d), e), f) again to the match between Sweden and Germany. I have no problem to admit that the rules are a bit ambiguous. It is not surprising that many other sources discuss the situation and possible scenario. And some of them put Germany ahead on Sweden based on their match. For example: Germany World Cup scenarios, tiebreakers: How the defending champs, rest of Group F can advance (CBS Sports) or If Sweden beats Mexico 1-0 and Germany beats South Korea 1-0 ... (Reddit), World Cup group permutations: Who can qualify for the Round of 16? (ESPN). I will also add a link to this page: http://webhome.csc.uvic.ca/~haron/FIFA/index.html and also http://webhome.csc.uvic.ca/~haron/FIFA/scenarios.html - which also points out some ambiguity in the rules. It seems that the author of the website in fact contacted FIFA in connection with this. (It was during 2010 World Cup, but the rules were similar.) Here is a quote from that page: Which one of these two interpretations is correct? When reached via email, the FIFA Media Department replied that There's a three-way tie to break. You do it as a one operation and not in different stages. The teams concerned are always all the teams involved in the tie-break. In other words, the FIFA Media Department interpreted the teams concerned to be all three teams. However, when Canadian Soccer Association's Director of Referees Joe Guest was presented with this scenario by the Times-Colonist, he interpreted the teams concerned to be USA and England. Thus, the two parites differed on whether USA or England would advance.  EDIT: I have mentioned this in comment, but probably it's better to add it to answer so that it is visible a bit better. As pointed out by Labba's answer, this is now clarified on the 2018 FIFA World Cup website and it explicitly says that in the hypothetical scenario here, the fair-play points would decide between Germany and Sweden. As far as I can tell, this information was not given there at the time when I posted this answer. (Compare the snapshots from June 24 and from June 25.) Here is the copy of the relevant section from the 2018 FIFA World Cup Regulations: The ranking of each team in each group shall be determined as follows:
  a) greatest number of points obtained in all group matches;
  b) goal difference in all group matches;
  c) greatest number of goals scored in all group matches.
  If two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings shall be determined as follows:
  d) greatest number of points obtained in the group matches between the teams concerned;
  e) goal difference resulting from the group matches between the teams concerned;
  f) greater number of goals scored in all group matches between the teams concerned;
  g) greater number of points obtained in the fair play conduct of the teams based on yellow and red cards received in all group matches as follows:
   – yellow card: minus 1 point
   – indirect red card: minus 3 points (as a result of a second yellow card)
   – direct red card: minus 4 points
   – yellow card and direct red card: minus 5 points
  Only one of the above deductions shall be applied to a player in a single match;
  h) drawing of lots by FIFA."
"What is ""strong side"" vs. ""weak side"" on defense in American football?","In the ""old days (up to about 50 years ago), teams had two ""ends"" at either end of the line (i.e., 'tight' to the line and therefore 'tight end(s)') to receive passes. Other pass receivers included two ""halfbacks"" and one ""fullback"" situated behind the quarterback. Then teams decided that they only needed one halfback behind the quarterback, and moved the other halfback onto the line of scrimmage as a second, ""wide"" receiver, who was ""split"" several yards away from the end. This way, there would be three receivers running from the line of scrimmage instead of two. The side with the third receiver was called the strong side, and the other side was the weak side. Defenses would compensate by moving an extra defender to the ""strong"" side. Here is a related question about defensive measures."
FIFA World Cup 2014 overtime,"There is no sudden death in football, overtime (OT), or extra time  (not to be confused with stoppage/additional time) as it's called in soccer context,  is played in two halves 2 x 15 mins.  FIFA tried the sudden death concept several years back, it was called Golden Goal. The idea was that the first goal in the OT would be the tiebreaker. It got quite a bit negative critique and this was replaced with Silver Goal (see the same link above), which was a thought to be a decent compromise between a sudden death and regular OT.

Is table tennis based on tennis?,"Most sources, including the history presented on the website of the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), agree that the game was developed in the 1880's as a variant to the already-popular lawn tennis, which in turn derives from so-called ""real tennis"", an earlier game, hailing back to medieval times, whose name is derived from French ""Tenez!"",
meaning ""Hold!"", ""Receive!"" or ""Take!"". The popularity of real tennis had declined during the 18th and early 19th centuries, but lawn tennis, the game we play today, was on the rise. The Wimbledon tournament was started in 1877, several years before table tennis' purported origins, showing that the sport was enjoying high popularity at the time. However, it was not the only racket-and-ball game played; also popular like stické, rackets and squash, which could certainly have inspired table tennis as much as lawn tennis did. However, a good indicator that lawn tennis was the real source of inspiration lies in the name itself. Table tennis was known under many names, again according to the ITTF's website. These included ""ping pong"", ""gossima"", ""whiff-whaff"", ""pim pam"" and ""pom-pom"", most of which are onomatopoeic, but also ""table tennis"", ""indoor tennis"", ""parlour tennis"" and ""tennis de salon"", the large variety of names involving ""tennis"", combined with the lack of names like ""table squash"" or ""parlour rackets"", are a strong indicator that tennis, the then-popular lawn tennis rather than the antiquated real tennis, was the strong driving force behind the invention of the game.

"In European Football, what exactly is a release clause?","The release clause (RC) fee is the minimum amount of money that a club has to accept for a particular player. So to answer your question, if Player A has a RC fee of €40M, bidding €39,9M could be rejected if the club doesn't want to sell the player, but they cannot reject €40M, and thus have to give permission for the bidding team to offer a contract to the player in question. A recent example of this is transfer of German talent Mario Götze from B. Dortmund to Bayern FC for €37M. The really interesting bit of it all was the timing of announcement of this transfer as well as the clash between these two rival teams in the Champions League final 2013 on which the Götze did not play due to a hamstring injury. The main motivation behind having release fee for a player is to give the player some flexibility in case the player is interested in joining another club but the his club is not willing to sell. Having a release clause fee avoids some sort of modern ""slavery"" and gives players a way out of a unfavourable situation.  From another point of view, it's also a way for the clubs to show roughly how much they value a player. So imagine Lionel Messi and Barcelona; the release fee is around £215M. That's of course an absurd amount of money for a single player, but what that essentially means is that Barcelona FC values Lionel Messi A LOT, he's practically invaluable.  Obviously minimum release fee has some benefits for the player, and to an extent to the club to protect their rights with investment on a player. However more often than not, a club would not be willing to have a minimum release clause on a contract, since not every player is as loyal as Messi, i.e. a player might get frustrated if a club had the minimum release fee to an absurd amount. Some leagues, e.g. La Liga, mandate for all player contracts to have a minimum release fee clause. In other leagues it happens to varying degree."
How many distinct ways are there to get out in cricket?,Most of these explanations are oversimplifications - see the relevant Laws for the precise details.
0:0 score in basketball,"When we are talking about professional basketball this result isn't realistic. NBA:
On November 22, 1950, the Fort Wayne Pistons defeated the Minneapolis Lakers 19-18 in the lowest scoring game in NBA history. This was prior to shot clock being added in 1954/55. The lowest scoring NBA game since adding the shot-clock was in 1955, when Boston won Milwaukee 62:57 (119 points together).  The lowest score by one team was in 1999 Chicago vs. Miami when Chicago scored only 49 points."
Are there any restrictions for the height and width of the blade and handle of a cricket bat?,"According to Law 6 of the Laws of Cricket, the length of the bat may be no more than 38 in (965 mm) and the width no more than 4.25 in (108 mm). If you wish to cover the blade with tape etc., the covering permitted for standard bats have to be of thickness not exceeding 0.012 in (0.3 mm) before treatment. When it comes to the handle, it should not exceed 52% of the overall length of the bat."
Is taking a step before dribbling the ball a travel?,"You would think they wouldn't include a blatant violation, but they did.  From the NBA Rules Section XIV: f. In starting a dribble after (1) receiving the ball while standing still, or (2) coming to a legal stop, the ball must be out of the player's hand before the pivot foot is raised off the floor.  From listening to my friends who I would consider avid NBA fans, travelling and carrying seem to be the most common complaints where modern referees often ignore the written rules."
Are you allowed to fake a field goal or punt?,"A punt has no special bearing and follows the rules of football.  Meaning you must have 7 men on the line of scrimmage, the end players are eligible, the backs are eligible, you are allowed a forward pass and so on.  You can punt on 1st down if you want.    For punting anyone can do it behind the line of scrimmage.   There are several rules around what happens during a punt but more or less any player can punt, they can punt on any down, and the opposing team can return the ball or take it where it is downed. For field goals it is the same thing.  You can do it on any down and the play follows the rules of football.  Really the only difference on field goals is the place holder is allowed to stand up and become an active player in the play even though they are kneeling on the ground when they catch the ball.  This is the one allowance offered for fake field goals.   Notes:"
Can you hit a football when the goalkeeper is touching it?,"IFAB's Law on indirect free kick offences says that [a] goalkeeper is considered to be in control of the ball when: the ball is between the hands or between the hand and any surface (e.g. ground, own body) or by touching it with any part of the hands or arms except if the ball rebounds accidentally from the goalkeeper or the goalkeeper has made a save ... In the situation described in the question, the goalkeeper is deemed to be in control of the ball. The attacker would be committing a foul, since according to the same Law, [a] goalkeeper cannot be challenged by an opponent when in control of the ball with the hands."
What factors could be accounted for Liverpool FCs lack of success in EPL in the recent years?,"I know that my answer is rather late and I like Orangecrush's answer as well. However, I don't think all of the factors of their descent in power has been in their control. To complete the suggestions of Orangecrush's answer, one has to go back a couple of years: Rafa Benitez took over control of LFC at the end of the 03-04 season. He is a tactical mind and has a systematic reign over any club that he chooses to train. I am quite fond of his tactics, especially when it comes to creating deep squads and having a player circulation with the extensive football fixtures out there. After taking control of LFC, he had the infamous AC Milan victory in Istanbul, finished third in the Premier League, became runners-up for the Champions League in 2007 and then followed this all with a 2nd place finish in 08-09. The last year of Rafa's tenure was the following season, when LFC failed and finished 7th in the EPL (source). While Rafa Benitez was in control of the football team, Gillet and Hicks became owners of the club to the somewhat dissatisfaction of the loyal Liverpool KOP (Gillet family also own the majority of the Canadiens here in Montreal and that team has not seen any success in decades, either). Only a single season when Rafa Benitez was not successful was enough for the American owners to part ways with him, whereas Rafa's approach (as Arsene Wenger's and Sir Alex Ferguson's) has always been systematic and required patience and stability. In 10-11 LFC was very close to bankruptcy and in dire need of cash. The club has already lost key players like Xabi Alonso to the likes of Real Madrid, a key opponent in the European competition. More and more players have parted ways with LFC, while the club struggled to keep hold of even their infamous captain, Steven Gerard. Finally, the club let go of the indispensable Fernando Torres and in a yet undefined, stupid move purchased mediocre players like Andy Carroll. Last but not least, Manchester City and Chelsea, both regular mid-table performers have been purchased by oil-rich owners and had their bank accounts flooded with money. The teams purchased top talent into the EPL that the likes of which could only competed with Manchester United. With all the money and the following success, it has been very, very difficult for LFC to bring in top talent into the situation. All the instability caused by the number of departures (especially post-Rafa Benitez era) and the change of power in the EPL have signalled the difficult days ahead for LFC. Arsenal have faced the same situation as well, and are struggling with adapting to the situation. The bringing of Brendan Rogers to lead the team has been a brilliant move, especially after his success at Swansea City. Yet, his challenges are huge; just take a look at the situation created by King Kenny Dalglish and the star forward Luis Suárez."
Can we use a leg to play the ball in volleyball?,"According to one LiveStrong.com page discussing legal and illegal volleyball hits: Recently Updated Rules Contacting the ball with any part of the body below the waist used to be illegal. When the ball hits any part of your body, including the
leg or the foot, it constitutes a legal hit. Another USA Volleyball
rule update for the 2010 season slightly changed the rule regarding
physical support for a teammate. Previously you couldn't get a
teammate's help to reach a ball. Now you can't get a teammate's help
to hit the ball, although it is still legal for a teammate to stop you
or hold you back from touching the net or crossing the center line. According to another site, volleyball rules state: The volleyball may touch any part of the body. Finally, from the official USA Volleyball site, the 2009-11 US domestic indoor rules state: 9.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HIT 9.2.1  The ball may touch any part of the body. Similarly, the 2011-12 FIVB international rules state: 9.2.1  The ball may touch any part of the body So for all major indoor court competitions, rule 9.2.1 permits hits by any part of the body. For beach volleyball, FIVB has a similar rule in the 2009-12 rules: 13.4.1 The ball may touch any part of the body. So by the currently available rules, players can legally hit the ball with any part of the body."
Ice Hockey Skates for People With Flat Feet,Have you tried using a professionally made orthotic (not the one you buy in the store)? These are custom made for your foot and should give you the proper support so that you don't hurt while skating. Note that it takes your body a while to adjust to orthotics. Your doctor should give you a schedule for breaking them in. Also a wide boot helps. I've always found that Bauer skates have much wider models available.
Stomping after a table tennis serve or follow through?,Some players stomp during the serve to hide the sound of the racquet hitting the ball. The sound of the contact can often clue a receiver into the pace and spin of a serve. Other players merely stomp as a natural motion as they try to impart spin onto the ball.
Stars on football players' shirts,"In the equipment regulations for FIFA competitions, section 18.2 states: Those Member Associations that have won the FIFA World Cup may put a symbol on the playing shirt representing this accomplishment and the number of times won. The form of symbol is not specified, although the accompanying illustrative example depicts a gold star. For national team jerseys, each star displayed over the badge represents a men’s World Cup won by the country. Brazil added three stars above their badge after winning their third World Cup in 1970. Italy did likewise in 1982. All world champions have since followed suit. Uruguay display four stars, regarding their triumphs in the 1924 and 1928 Olympics as equivalent to their later World Cup wins, as there was no World Cup at the time. In 2004, Denmark wore a star on their shirts specially for Euro 2004, to commemorate their victory in the competition in 1992.  For further reading look at Wikipedia article Star (football badge)"
Usage of unusual characters in sports shirts,"The FIFA equipment regulations mandate: 7.6 The letters used for the Player’s name must be (...) Latin characters. Phonological diaeresis, such as accents or umlauts, are permitted. So the answer to both of your questions is: Because the FIFA laws say so.  I can only speculate as to why these laws are there. Most likely, referees and spectators will prefer to have any spelling they can pronounce. For instance, I have no idea how to start pronouncing 郑智, 武磊 or 郜林. Although the spellings Zheng Zhi, Wu Lei, and Gao Lin probably don't match the correct pronunciation, they are sufficiently recognizable and allow any European to approximate the player's name. Even worse than not being  able to pronounce these names, it may also be hard to distinguish them during a fast-paced match. In effect, names written in unknown character sets do not fulfill the primary function of a name; identifying a person by name would be hard. I'm not aware of any ruling that forbids writing out the full player's names in press materials such as club websites. My guess would be that it's more important for the name to be consistent than right; if every English fan mispronounces the name the same way, they can still talk about the players. Incorrect renderings may also result in a better pronunciation. Asking a German how Sigþórsson would be pronounced, the result would be likely be Siɡpʰɔʁsɔn, whereas Sigthorsson's German pronunciation of Siɡtʰɔʁsɔn is much closer to the correct one (in addition to creating an excellent pun). The players have to follow FIFA laws. Just as some players would like to play with a cool cap, or have sponsor names on their shirts, they have to bow to the laws. Also, some players may themselves prefer their names' pronunciation to be consistent but wrong - or sometimes, as in the case of Sigþórsson, rendered incorrectly but pronounced (more) correctly, because a recognizable/spellable name increases prominence, and increased prominence translates to increased income."
"Walkoff homer, decisive run scores but following runner leaves base path","This has happened before, most notably the Grand Slam Single of the 1999 NLCS. The Braves and Mets were tied 3-3 in the bottom of the ninth. The Mets loaded the bases, and Robin Ventura crushed a grand slam. He was mobbed at first base, and never touched second. Only Cedeno, the runner on third, actually touched home. Ventura was awarded a single, and the Mets won, 4-3. Joe left a comment: Once Ishikawa doesn't hit a home run (because of him failing to touch home), only the leading run scores (as with anything other than a home run or a ground rule double, no runs may score beyond the winning run in the bottom of any inning at or after the ninth)."
How can a 3rd college quarterback be found if two are injured?,"Currently, the NCAA limits teams to 85 scholarships. The teams may recruit any number of scholarship quarterbacks. In addition, teams can also invite players to walk-on, so there are likely to be more than 3 quarterbacks on each team's roster. There is a cap of 105 players on a roster for Division 1 FBS teams: Limit on Number of Participants—Bowl Subdivision. [FBS] In bowl
  subdivision football, there shall be a limit of 105 student-athletes
  who may engage in practice activities prior to the institution’s first
  day of classes or the institution’s first contest, whichever occurs
  earlier. Exception—National Service Academies. However, teams are limited in the number of players that can be suited up for each game - these rules are set up by conferences: Many Conferences such as the Big 10, ACC and others have set
  conference travel limits to 72 players While the WAC limits its travel
  squads to 64.  The NCAA Football Playing Rules do not address this
  issue as it is an NCAA administrative regulation not a playing rule. 
  The NCAA By-laws have changed over the years. At one time it was 48
  squad members as the limit for the traveling team.  it has changed
  over the years from unlimited to 100 to 80 and down to 60.  I did not
  find the limit in the 2011 by-laws. I suspect the travel limit is 60
  players with up to 72 to a conference championship.  The Conferences
  each have their own rules for travel limits. In practice, if multiple quarterbacks go down, the teams will still need to field eleven players on offense. The replacement quarterbacks can be existing quarterbacks on the roster (either scholarship or walk-on players) or other position players."
Why does the NFL use Roman numerals for Super Bowl numbering?,"An article in the Christian Science Monitor indicates that it was Lamar Hunt's idea initially: ""It was [Hunt’s] brainchild,"" said Moore of the numbering system in an interview with Yahoo. ""I think people felt from the start that it had something to it, even if they couldn’t quite put their finger on exactly what it was. Before long it was just part of it. Now it wouldn’t be the same without it."" The article states that it specifically is not related to the Olympics, at least not directly: ""The NFL didn't model after the Olympics,"" Dan Masonson, director of the league's corporate communication, told the AP.  They then go on to explain that the reason for using numbers of any sort is due to what the NFL media guide explains (i.e., they want to avoid confusion if you said ""2014 Superbowl"" what that refers to), and that Roman Numerals were selected to make it seem more prestigious. The Roman numerals were used to make the game seem more prestigious, back when the Super Bowl was not yet the most watched television event of the year. “It’s much more magisterial,” Moore told the AP. Now, it's perfectly reasonable to guess that both the Olympics and the NFL have the same root reason - Roman Numerals seem fancier, of course."
"What tie-breaker is used in the ATP ranking, when two players have the same number of points?","The 2014 ATP Official Rulebook, 9.03 (Emirates ATP Rankings), Section E lists three different tie breakers in the event that players have the same total number of points. E. Ties. When two or more players have the same total number of points, ties shall be 
  broken as follows: 1) the most total points from the Grand Slams, ATP World Tour Masters 1000 mandatory tournaments and Barclays ATP World Tour Finals main draws, and if still

  Masters 1000 tournaments and Barclays ATP World Tour Finals they could have 
  played (as described under A. above) as if played, and if still tied, then, 3) the highest number of points from one single tournament, then, if needed, the 
  second highest, and so on. For example, let's look at the players currently ranked #78 and #79.  Both Somdev Devvarman and Alejandro Falla have 662 total points.  So the first tie breaker is the total points from Grand Slams, ATP World Tour Masters 1000 and the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals.  This information is available on the ATP site: Somdev Devvarman ratings breakdown:
 Alejandro Falla ratings breakdown:
 In the tie breaker, Devvarman has 195 points, and Falla has 155 points, so Devvarman is currently ranked ahead of Falla."
What happens if the ball is bounced into the basket?,"Yes, a bounce that goes into the basket would count as a successful goal.  Anytime (except on a throw-in) a live ball goes through the basket, it is a goal, and it doesn't matter who, if anyone, threw the ball. From the NCAA Men's Basketball 2013-14 and 2014-15 Rules, Rule 5 (Scoring and Timing Regulations), Section 1, Article 2: Art. 2. A goal is made when: a.  A live ball that is not a throw-in enters the basket from above and remains 
  in or passes through the basket; or b.  A free throw enters the basket from above and remains in or  passes 
  through the basket. After a player bounces the ball, the ball is still live, meaning that any player could theoretically grab the ball and continue playing.  So if the ball goes in the basket, the goal would count. Kicking the ball in, even if it is easier for you, is not allowed (NCAA Rule 9, Section 7; NBA Rule 10, Section 4)."
"Why do football players say ""Oskie"" after an interception?","When a interception takes place, the player who intercepted the ball screams ""oskie"" to make his teammates aware that an interception has taken place. As a result, the team turns around and blocks for the player who intercepted the ball. ""The Seven Game Maxims"" originated during the 1930s and ""pick"" may have not been a common term. ""Interception"" doesn't roll off the tongue as well as ""oksie.""  As Neyland was a general in the Army, the term ""oskie"" may have also originated from his time in active duty that he carried into coaching football. Beginning in the 1930s, General Robert Neyland had his team, the Tennessee Volunteers, recite what is known today as ""the Seven Maxims of Football."" or ""the Seven Game Maxims."""
Why are pitcher's mounds higher than the rest of the baseball field?,"Pitcher mound is a result of trial and error in order to find the perfect distance and height that will be some kind of point of equality so the pitcher and the batter won't be advantage on each other and ensuring the attraction of the game.
It is because we don't want a game when a pitcher is always striking out players and on the other hand we don't want the batter to do a home run in every bat. First a little bit of history.. How the pitcher's mound was born? In the early days of baseball , pitchers were required to stay within
a pitcher's box that had its front edge 45 feet away from home plate.
But pitchers were dominating batters, so in 1881, the front edge of
the box was moved back five feet. But this was still not enough, so in 1887, a new rule required a
pitcher to keep his back foot on a line that was 55 and one-half feet
from the plate. Finally in 1893, the pitcher's box was removed, but
the pitcher's plate, or rubber, was introduced and moved back an
additional five feet. That gave us today's 60 feet 6 inches. With an official diameter of 18 feet, and rising to 10 inches above
the level field, the pitcher's mound, or hill, has been a part of
baseball since around the turn of the 20th century. The elevation on pitcher's mound was made in order to return some advantages to pitchers that was lost due to extending the pitcher position. By elevating their delivery point, pitchers can gain momentum as they
stride down towards the plate. This forward motion adds speed and a
downward angle to the ball, making it more difficult to hit. off course there are another speculations like this one: That the mounds evolved as a matter of
grounds-keeping practice, for better drainage and water absorption.
After overhand pitching was legislated in 1884, pitchers undoubtedly
found the mounds to be an advantage: the downward weight-shift and
momentum enable them to generate greater velocity on their pitches. as you stated in the question The pitcher’s plate shall be 10 inches above the level of home plate. But this was not always true: During different periods in baseball history, the mound has been much
taller.  The mound in Philadelphia's Shibe park was rumored to be 20""
high at one time, and the mound throughout baseball in the late 60s
was as high as 16"".  It wasn't until 1969 that it was lowered to
today's standard. According to baseball historian Bill Deane: the idea for a mound was claimed by an 1880s pitcher, John Montgomery
Ward. From 1903 to 1968, baseball rules limited the height of the
mound to 15 inches, although several groundskeepers were rumored to
have added an inch or two depending on the state of their team's
pitching. Over the years, as pitchers grew bigger and stronger, hitting
declined. Major League Baseball knew that most fans would rather see
home runs than shutouts, so the mound was lowered to ten inches in
1969. The adjustment worked – team batting averages jumped up about 15 points. Sources: 1 2"
Is it possible to do indoor rock climbing barefoot?,"You definitely can do it, and it is fine where you have clean, dry climbing surfaces. I have had no problems doing it on occasion in the summer when I have not had my rock boots, but I wouldn't want to do it. I don't know how practical it is to train this way though, as if you decide to climb outdoors it will not be as useful as having learnt the skills with proper rock boots. Rock boots require a slightly different technique, but are much grippier and you remove the risk of catching a toe on something!"
Does a direct red card cancel a previous yellow card?,"This depends entirely on the competition rules, but for FIFA sanctioned competitions (such as the World Cup), the following from page 17 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code applies: If a player is guilty of serious unsporting behaviour as defined in Law 12 of
  the Laws of the Game and is sent off (direct red card), any other caution he has previously received in the same match is upheld. Most football associations will follow FIFA's lead and adopt this regulation."
Are overhead (tennis-like) serves allowed in squash?,"Answer: YES The serve, in squash is called an Hard Serve or Power Serve. But not many experienced players do it for the sole purpose that you are leaving yourself in a bad position for the return.  If you look at the picture above, You will see that you (obviously) need to bring your racket up in the air and then follow through with your swing, pushing your racket down. This does create a fast serve which makes it difficult for a novice player to return. But if you're playing an experienced player who knows how to return a fast paced ball, that player will most likely return the ball before you can recover from your ""overhand"" swing follow through. This is why most people serve underhand so that their racket will be in position when the opponent returns the ball. To sum up pros and cons... PROS CONS"
Learning ski jumping,"Some excerpts from this Yahoo article: You must be comfortable skiing fast and in-control.  Some downhill skiers enjoy going down the hill at a leisurely pace and balk at the
thought of going fast. If you're not comfortable speeding down a hill
while maintaining your control, ski jumping might not be for you.
Speed isn't much of an issue when you're first starting out, but when
you progress to the higher ramps (40-meter and up), you will need to
feel comfortable skiing at a fast pace-sometimes up to 30 miles per
hour-to work up enough momentum. Ski jump lessons are for all ages.  Most ski jump areas give lessons for ages 5 and
up. In my adult-only class, there were about
six other beginning ski jumpers, including a 62 year old lady who was
taking ski jump classes with her 19 year old grandson! You will start out on a tiny ramp.   Beginning ski jumpers don't climb to the
top of that big, scary ramp and hurl themselves down, catapulting
themselves into midair-they work their way up to it. I started out on
a 10-meter jump, which is very common ramp height for first-time ski
jumpers. Don't let the height scare you away! The 10-meter measurement
refers to the distance a skier can get from the jump, not its height.
The 10-meter jump is only a few inches high-you're barely off the
ground. As your skill level improves, the instructor will move you to
steeper and higher ramps. The instructor will never move you to a hill
that's too dangerous for your ability. A 2002 article shares some information about how Mitch Kaplan learned to ski jump at Olympic Park in Park City, Utah: They call the program Public Ski Jumping, and anyone who can downhill
ski at an intermediate level or better is invited to join. You use
your own skis and boots; the Park rents helmets. ""In two hours, we
have beginners jumping off the 18-meter jump."" The author notes that his group starts off practicing on small snow bumps, before graduating to a 10-meter ramp and ending at an 18-meter ramp. You will need to be comfortable with downhill skiing (in a straight line at high speeds) in order to have enough momentum for good jumps. If you're starting out on the smaller beginner's ramps, multiple jumps per day shouldn't be too tough on the body (depending on your physical condition)."
Why so many boxing organizations and their differences?,"This article states it simply: Why do we have to have all these boxing organizations? The WBA, WBC,
  IBF, WBO, IBO, XYZ, etc? How do we know who is the real world
  champion. The reason we have all these unnecessary titles is because
  of two things. Money and control. The sanctioning fees and fighting
  for a title is not cheap for a fighter. So if they can control the
  fighter, the organization can dictate on who you fight next. Boxing politics and the agendas of the big boxing promoters are also major factors. The leaders of each boxing organization has a vested interest in keeping control of its titles (and associated money flows), and will work with boxing promoters to keep control of each title. In essence, each of the boxing organizations keeps rankings for different weight classes. Boxers may choose to compete for one of more titles of the same weight class across multiple organizations. The article also notes: So who is really at fault here? Is it the politics of boxing? Is it
  the greedy and sleazy promoters? How about the many boxing
  organizations with meaningless titles? Or is it the fighters who
  refuse to fight the best? The answer is all the above."

What is the oldest documented sport?,"As long as there have been people, there has been wrestling. Nearly every culture has some form of it used for contests internal and external to the group. Wrestling is one of the most basic sports, and is probably the oldest. In Egypt, the fifteenth tomb of Beni Hassan has a large wall depicting wrestling techniques. At this point we're talking about roughly the 19th to 20th century BCE.  We have similar evidence of wrestling in older tombs such as Petah Hotep (aka Ptahhotep). It is specifically an ancestor of Kirkpinar, Turkish oil wrestling: The oldest known proof of the existence of oil-wrestling in Ancient Egypt is found in limestone from the tomb of Ptahhoteb near Saqqara from the fifth dynasty (about 2650 BC) from the same period as the Chafadji-bronze. In China specifically, there is some evidence that something related to (but probably very different from) modern shuai jiao wrestling called jǐao dǐ (角抵, horn butting) was used in 2697 BCE. Wrestling is a really old sport."
What is the highest number of picks a team has had in the draft?,"Update (2020 Draft): In 2020, the Minnesota Vikings had 15 picks, giving them the record for most picks since the draft was limited to 7 rounds. This also gave them the most picks since the 2002 realignment and the most picks since the draft became a 3-day event. Update (2016 Draft): In 2016, the Cleveland Browns had 14 picks, tying the 1997 Miami Dolphins for most picks since the draft was limited to 7 rounds. This also gave them the most picks since the 2002 realignment and the most picks since the draft became a 3-day event. I went and looked at all of the draft picks broken down by team here. It looks like the 7-round format started in 1994, although I've been having some serious problems trying to confirm this. I looked through the number of picks each team had and found the following: I also took this opportunity to see which teams had the fewest number of picks. The 1999 New Orleans Saints had one draft pick. Apparently, they traded all six of their draft picks to the Redskins in order to get RB Ricky Williams with the fifth overall pick."

The advantage isn't just in the traction, it's as much in the weight. I haven't found any serious studies on it, but the rule of thumb seems to be about 1-2 seconds/mile for each ounce of shoe - 10-15+ seconds/mile, 30-45+ seconds off a 5k. Now, is there absolute proof for this? As I said, not that I can find, but take a 5-ounce shoe in one hand and a 15-ounce shoe in the other and lift them both up and down a few thousand times and tell me which hand gets tired first."
How many balls are used in a typical World Cup game?,"This article from The Guardian says that: In total 3,240 balls were used throughout the tournament (2014 FIFA
  World Cup Brazil), 20 for each match Generally, FIFA Laws of the Game Law 02 - The Ball: 3. Additional balls only states that: Additional balls which meet the requirements of Law 2 (technical requirements) may be placed
  around the field of play and their use is under the referee’s control. Side note: The accepted answer incorrectly references to Law 02 - The Ball: 2. Replacement of a defective ball. The ball may not be changed during the match without the referee’s
  permission. The following statement applies only to defective balls, as it is written under ""Replacement of a defective ball section"", and it doesn't apply to any balls. E.g. if suddenly a player realizes that the ball he was playing with is defect, he has to notify the referee first and then change the ball, but if he changes a normal ball during throw-in, there's no need to notify the referee."
Squash - what is wrong with my grip?,Have you tried wrapping something over the base grip of your racket? Some people use gauze and can also buy overgrips which are meant to absorb moisture and provide a tacky feel. If you tend to play with loose hands overgrips can really help. These things I am describing (gauze and overgrips) are generally very thin and don't increase the overall size of the grip that drastically.
What is the percentage of game won in alternating penalties format for team going first?,"As you mention, the starting team wins about 60% percent of the time. This paper in the American Economic Review, freely available from the London School of Economics repository here, analyses every penalty shootout in a major tournament (world cup, continent cup, English/German/Spanish cup, uefa league and champions league) for which data was available, which roughly amounts to every shootout in a final ever, and in every round from around the year 2000. The data ends at 2008 as this is not a very recent paper. The authors conclude that indeed there is a psychological advantage in going first, as the increased odds persist even when controlling for other variables, such as team strength and possible home advantage. Although the authors of the paper feel confident rejecting the null hypothesis of going first giving no advantage, it is still possible that the true probability for the first team to win is some other value >50%, and the 60% found is simply an expression of variance."
Who pays for the travel for Heisman trophy nominees?,"The only thing that can be said for certain is NOT the Heisman Trophy Trust, the organization presenting the award. They are considered a non-profit charitable organization and tax-exempt therefor can only give money to other tax-exempt organizations. Other than that all parties involved are going to be making money... lots of money. Source for below examples. The school may for the trip as the athlete is part their organization and I'm sure they can justify those expenses as ""football related"".  Baylor Univ. estimates that Robert Griffin III's Heisman Trophy win last year was worth $250M in ""extra donations, increased ticket sales, licensing fees, sponsorship deals [and] an expanded deal with Fox Sports Southwest,"" according to Michele Steele of ESPN.com. 3 The athlete may pay their own way as they will likely be receiving a windfall by becoming a marketable commodity; Pro Stars Ink President Ben Litvin estimates a Heisman winner ""can pull down about $50,000 a year from three to four autograph sittings a year, three to four corporate appearances a year, two to three paid golf appearances per year, and three speeches"" 3 Or it could be sports agents looking to do the athlete a ""favor"" in return for being selected to represent the player during their professional career.  The governing agency of college athletics said he [2005 Heisman winner Reggie Bush] and his family accepted huge amounts of money and perks from sports agents--including a limousine ride to the Heisman ceremony. 2"

Why is the FIFA overtime period divided into two halves?,"This is required so that teams are able to change sides of the field for the same technical reasons why they change sides at half-time, e.g, equal field/weather conditions, wind direction, fan seating, etc. Note that now rules (Law 7 - The Duration of the Match - 2. Half-time interval) explicitly state that: Players are entitled to an interval at half-time, not exceeding 15
  minutes; a short drinks break (which should not exceed one minute) is
  permitted at the interval of half-time in extra time. Note: the bold text has been added to the rules in 2016"
How to make running intervals more challenging as I improve?,"Not a scientific answer, but one from a lot of experience...
Don't run faster during your jog periods.  If you don't recover during these times, you won't perform optimally during your intervals.
Addressing the safety part: only change one aspect each workout.  So in your next run you might try running at a faster pace, but keep the durations constant.  Then next week, keep your pace at its new, faster rate, and bump up the durations a bit.  But running faster for a longer time is an invitation to injury."
"In the game of basketball, does the net have any part of points scored?","Rule 5, Section I-a of the NBA Official Rule Book states that, A legal field goal or free throw attempt shall be scored when a live ball from the playing area enters the basket from above and remains in or passes through the net.  The ball just has to pass the hoop and not necessaily through the net. If the ball gets stuck in the net or breaks off the side of the net after the ball has passed the hoop from above, it still is considered a basket. The net is in place to slow down the ball after a basket has been made, so that there is no need to chase after it. Also it helps in making sure that a basket has been made as the ball slows down, thereby eliminating doubts when seen from certain angles."
Has a team ever lost on purpose to get better draft picks?,"The lottery system makes it very difficult to effectively tank your season in the NBA. Basically no matter how bad you are, there is always a chance that you will not get one of the top 3 picks (in fact, the worst team in the league has rarely been awarded the top draft pick).  Here are the odds that the worst team in the NBA gets a pick at or better than the current pick, starting with pick 1. (assuming 2 teams do not tie for the worst record) Now, the fourth pick is still a pretty good player, and there is a pretty good chance that you are going to get the second or third pick. However, depending on the draft it may not be the kind of no-brainer that the top pick often is. Therefore tanking in the NBA is only a good strategy if you believe the draft is good enough that the top 3-4 players in the draft are potential franchise defining players.  The question of ""has any team ever purposely tanked"" is an incredibly difficult one. Plenty of teams give up and trade major pieces at the trade deadline in both basketball and baseball. However, no player would admit to playing less than 100%, and coaches are often fired if their team performs poorly, regardless of the players they have on the team, so it's not in their best interest. So while management can, and will put teams in positions to fail, the players and coaches usually try to do everything they can to not be that last place team.  A great example of this is interviews with Indianapolis Colts players this past year, they knew they were bad, and would be assured a new franchise QB if they had the worst record, but they also knew their jobs were at stake if they didn't at least try their hardest. And at the end of the year when they were the worst team in the league. Despite the fact that they were in position to draft a brand new franchise quarter back, they fired their GM. The players, coaches and management reiterated time and again that ""there is no suck for Luck going on. The other thing that goes into the equation of whether or not to tank is the question of what do you owe the folks that pay the bills. Namely your fans and your television and radio contracts. If you trade away your best players, is the product that you put out on the floor for the last 30-40 games of the season worth the (often obscene) ticket cost your fans are paying? If they stop showing up because you are awful this year, will they re-up their season tickets next year? Even if you only get the 4th pick of the draft? Will your TV and Radio partners give you a poorer contract when it comes time to re-up if they know that you have a tendency to throw a season away for potential draft picks? In summary, it's an incredibly hard decision for management and ownership when it comes to the trade deadline about whether or not to trade away your best players and play for picks. But (at least on the public face) it's always a clear choice for players and coaches, play as hard as you can and try to win the games that you can. Unless as a coach you have a clear direction from management to sit your best players in the final couple of games, you will be trying to win what games you can so that you might actually get to keep your job at the end of the year. And as a player you're interest is in making sure that you put yourself in the best position to continue playing your sport, which means playing as well as you possible can."
What is the actual waiver wire?,"It appears that Peyton Manning was not actually ""waived"" but ""released"".  According to the NFL CBA, once a player has completed his fourth year in the league, he is no longer eligible to be placed on waivers and is instead released as an unrestricted free-agent and can be signed by any club at any time. Whenever a player who has finished the season in which his fourth year of credited service has been earned under the Bert Bell/Pete Rozelle Plan is placed on waivers between February 1 and the trading deadline, his contract will be considered terminated and the player will be  completely free at any time thereafter to negotiate and sign a Player Contract with any Club[...] As far as what it takes to make a ""waive"" or ""release"" official:  Section 4. Notice of Termination: The Notice of Termination form attached hereto as Appendix H will be used by all Clubs. If possible, the Notice of Termination will be 
  personally delivered to the player prior to his departure from the team. If the Notice of 
  Termination has not been personally delivered to the player prior to his departure from 
  the team, the Notice  of Termination will be sent to him by certified mail at his last address on file with the Club. The NFL shall inform the NFLPA of player personnel transactions communicated in the Personnel Notice between the NFL and its member Clubs concerning the termination or trading of players including awards on waivers, termination through waivers, confirmation of trades  or any change in the status of players (e.g., placed on Reselve Injured, etc.). The NFL will make best efforts to communicate the information referred to in this Article to the NFLPA on the same day, but in no event later than noon on the next day. It is my assumption that the ""waiver wire"" that is referred to by Adam Schefter and other NFL writers is just their term for the communication that happens between NFL and the NFLPA, et al. Which is to say, the communication from the NFL that the player has been cut. So, if the Indianapolis Colts have already filed the appropriate paperwork with Peyton Manning and the appropriate league offices, the latest that he should be available to be contacted by other teams would be tomorrow at noon."
Is pitch tampering legal?,"This is unsporting behaviour and should be cautioned. Quoting from the 2015-2016 Laws of the Game: If a player makes unauthorised marks on the field of play with his foot, he
  must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour."
How can a journalist know so much information on athletes?,"This is going to depend a lot on the sport. In general, a reporter does have access to several resources, many of which are accessible to a dedicated fan, but when putting together commentary on the spot it helps a lot to have deep personal knowledge of the sport to consider what facts to research. (This kind of knowledge can be developed by a fan regularly reading publications like Track and Field News, Athletics Weekly, and/or the IAAF website.) I've covered athletics (track and field) at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and six IAAF World Championships starting in 1999, as well as many lesser meets. This is a rough overview of the compiled resources available to an athletics writer: All of these resources are available to a dedicated fan, many for free and the rest for a relatively low price. The bound annuals are probably the most expensive due to printing costs, and as more and more publication moves to the web the books are increasingly available as PDFs. Membership in professional organizations like the ATFS (Association of Track and Field Statisticians) or TAFWA/FAST (Track And Field Writers of America/Federation of American Statisticians of Track) in the USA often provides access to additional resources; I get PDF or bound copies of the world and USA annuals either through TAFWA or through the national and international federations. At the bigger meets, an additional resource which isn't available to the fans is what's known as a CIS or Commentator Information Service. This is a terminal in the press section which gives access to live results, entry lists, splits, and some historical data. Increasingly the same information is appearing on event websites - the IAAF website has almost the same data online as in the CIS - but as a dedicated on-site system the CIS isn't subject to the same kind of network latency a website usually shows.  Being on-site also allows the press access to information which programmers would call ""asynchronous,"" that is, not happening within view of the camera. This includes things like post-event disqualifications and protests. I assume similar resources are available to stadium sports like swimming and tennis. Outside-stadium events like marathons, race walks, and (I assume) road cycling or skiing have additional challenges in that spectators and reporters alike have severely limited information about the progress of an ongoing event. As an example, both the Boston and New York City marathons have elaborate systems of spotters on bicycles reporting information back to the press room to help television commentators understand how fast the leaders are going, and even who's in the pack. Every event faces different challenges in collecting this kind of detailed information and communicating it in a useful way; journalists are usually the first to get access to the data. ETA summer 2016: With the US Olympic Trials for athletics approaching, I was reminded of another source of information: dedicated insiders who are self-publishing. The specific example I had in mind is the decathlon association which has published a ""media guide"" for the decathlon and heptathlon at the Trials; this is packed with lists of previous winners, all-time best performances in each event, at an Olympic Trials, at a national championships (the Trials doubles as the USA national championships), or at Hayward Field where the Trials are being held. The majority of this is the work of Dr. Frank Zarnowski. The multi-events even have ""prediction sites"" where curious fans can plug in various scenarios of athletes' performances in each event and see how the overall event would play out; an example (which used to live at the ergorej.net domain) is the Beijing World Championship decathlon in 2015 where Ashton Eaton set the world record. ETA 2: The IAAF statistical handbook for the 2016 Rio Olympic Games has been published now (that link is to a PDF download)."
Advantage played on offside,"From page 72 of FIFA's 2013-2014 Laws of The Game: The referee may play advantage whenever an infringement or offence occurs. This would include offside, which in Law 11, is considered as an ""offence"". Traditionally (up until a few years ago), referees could only play advantage from fouls and misconduct (Law 12 offences) and infringements that occurred during the taking of penalty kicks (Law 14 infringements). This was not written in the laws, but was considered common knowledge."
"If you can't change an injured goalkeeper, what can you do?","According to IFAB Laws of the Game, Law 3 - The Players, 1. Number of players: A match is played by two teams, each with a maximum of eleven players;

Changing the goalkeeper: Any of the players may change places with the goalkeeper if: Therefore, if a goalkeeper is sent off with a red card or can't continue to play because of injury after all substitutions are made, one of the outfield players must take over his position. The total number of players will be reduced to 10 from 11."
The 100 mph barrier,"There was a rumor that Jeff Thomson of Australia was the first bowler to break the 100 mph while bowling in international cricket. Later Shoaib Akhtar of Pakistan clocked more than 100 mph in a world cup match against England.  Once Mohammad Sami had also clocked the same but later it was found that the speed gun might be wrong in that case. Brett Lee, Shaun Tait and Shane Bond are some of the bowlers who clocked near 100 mph but there are not enough evidence to support whether they have actually crossed this barrier(Most of the cases it was found that speed gun had problems and hence it showed wrong reading at times)."
What kind of snowboard would you recommend for a first board?,"This article lists several criteria to consider when choosing a first snowboard: The article has one suggestion: Also, factor in the stiffness of the board. As a beginner, you will

Number of gap techniques in American Football,"The gap refers to the empty space between offensive linemen on the opposing team at the line of scrimmage. If you have a 1 or 2 gap defensive linemen, it means that he is responsible for keeping the offensive team from advancing through either one or two gaps, or responsible for  advancing himself between the gap and tackling the ball carrier behind the line of scrimmage. See the below example for an illustration.  In this example the defensive linemen (the four shaded triangles) are all playing a one gap technique as they are only responsible for a single gap in the offensive line of scrimmage. The offensive team often uses the terms ""A-Gap"" or ""B-Gap"" to refer to the gaps on the offensive line. The A-Gap's are the gaps on either side of the center. The B-Gap's are the gaps between the guards and the tackles. The C-Gaps are the gaps between the tackles and the tight-ends. So a running play that was meant to run to the ""Strong-side B-Gap"" would run to the offensive right (strong-side is determined by the side that the tight-end is lined up on) between the Right Guard (RG) and the Right Tackle (RT)."
"What team has the shortest ""longest losing streak"" within a season in MLB history?","Since 1920, the start of the live-ball era, the shortest losing streak among MLB teams with 100+ wins in one season appears to be 3.  The following teams achieved this (including a couple of teams that didn't get to 100 wins): The following teams have also achieved this, but with a 4-game (or more) non-winning streak (ie, a tie occurred among the losses): I used Baseball Reference's streak analyzer for my findings. In theory, a .500 team can have a losing streak of only 1. Moreover, it is possible that a under 100-win team can have a shorter losing streak than 3. However, with respect to conjecture, these scenarios are unlikely...but will yield to any season that happens to have a shorter losing streak than 3."
"Is it a goal if, during kicks from the penalty mark, the ball goes outside the penalty area and then into the goal?","On page 55 of the 2014/15 FIFA Laws of the Game, in the Kicks from the Penalty Mark procedure, it says  Unless otherwise stated, the relevant Laws of the Game and International F.A. Board Decisions apply when kicks from the penalty mark are being taken.  This means that, since no other description is given, Law 14 (governing Penalty Kicks during the game) applies to this situation, with the exception of the placement of extra players. On page 45, Law 14 (The Penalty Kick) says, in regard to a goal being scored: A goal is awarded if, before passing between the goalposts and under the crossbar the ball touches either or both of the goalposts and/or the crossbar and/or the goalkeeper. ... The referee decides when a penalty kick has been completed. So, in the situation you describe the ball hits the goalpost/crossbar, hits the ground and then goes back into the goal. This would be a goal unless the referee had decided that the kick was completed. If the ball had landed all the way outside the penalty area (very unlikely), it's possible the referee would have blown the ball dead since it was so far from the goal. But if he hadn't, it's a goal."
Origin of this generic hockey photo,"I'm almost positive that this team (in red) are the Spokane Chiefs from the WHL. The jerseys match exactly along with the pants. I looked through the leagues of CHL, WHL, QMJHL and AHL and these were the only jerseys that match. As you can see by the first picture below, the stripes on the jersey match up exactly. If you look in the original photo (with the goalie) you can see a faint blue and white logo on the front of the the other players jersey, this matches the colors of the Cheifs logo.  
(source: sportslogos.net)  As you can see from the 2nd photo, the 2 white and 1 red stripe down the leg matches the goalie as well.  As for who the player is? That is hard to figure out. The WHL only keeps roster records back to 1996. After going though all these rosters and looking at goalies who wore the number ""1"", I came up with this list.  No Picture No Picture After further digging, I'm also almost positive that Spokane Chiefs were playing the Portland Winterhawks. I came to this conclusion by looking at the arenas that the teams in the WHL play in. On this certain game, the Chiefs were playing AWAY but wearing their HOME jerseys. Sometimes this happens in hockey (another question to be asked in the future). The first reason why I came to this conclusion is the look of the arena. If you compare the given picture with the picture below of the Memorial Coliseum, the arena that the Portland Winterhawks play in, you will see many similarities.  You see the red outline that borders the main screen on the jumbotron. You also see the rectangular piece that wraps around the bottom on the jumbotron. Both of these features match the given picture above (although the top of the jumbotron in the given picture is cut off. You also see the red and white banners that are hanging from the ceiling on the side of the rink. These match the banners in the given picture. The next similarity that most people would miss is that both arenas have a unique ""gap"" in their roofs. A gap that extends up that shows exposed scaffolding.  Another similarity that most people would miss is a speaker that is hanging from the roof. If you look in the picture below, the speaker is located between the 3rd and 4th banner to the left of the jumbotron. This speaker is also visible in the picture provided on the left side of the picture in between banners.   Last but not least, the Portland Winterhawks AWAY uniforms are made up of an almost all white jersey and solid black pants, as you can see from the picture below. If you compare this jersey with the one you see of the opposing players in the picture provided, these jerseys match. "
History of NFL scoring format,"Based on The Anatomy of a Game. The current scoring rules weren't decided on all at once. They evolved over the years. At the outset, football was played according to whatever rules the two teams agreed to. The first rules meeting was in 1876. Before this, there was no standard ruleset for the sport of football. Initially, it was the students at Rutgers, Princeton, Yale, and Harvard who created rules that varied from a strictly kicking game to a game that allowed running the ball. The first ruleset, created in Princeton in 1871, included these rules related to scoring: Harvard drafted their own ruleset in 1872, based off of the Princeton/Rutgers rules. Theirs was closer to rugby, due to their Canadian connection with McGill University. Theirs allowed running and throwing: Yale created a ruleset very similar to Princeton's, prohibiting picking up, throwing, or carrying the ball. In 1873, Princeton, Rutgers, and Yale met to organize a standard ruleset. The outcome was a set of 12 rules. Out of those, these related to scoring: In 1876, Princeton, Yale, Columbia, and Harvard met to further unify the rulesets (Harvard had not attended the previous meeting due to their commitment to a running/Rugby style of game). The outcome was 61 rules. Here is how they related to scoring: In 1881, the safety was officially included in the rules, and counted against the team, but only in a tie-break situation: In 1882, safeties became part of the scoring, and the tie-break advantage switched from kicks to touchdowns: This was all part of an overall strategy to increase the pace of the game and eliminate stalling that occurred under the previous rules. Downs were also added at this time. In early 1883, scores were first attached to the various ways of scoring: Later in 1883, scores were further amended: In 1887, scores became: In 1904 and 1909, the goal from the field was reduced to 4, and then 3 points. In 1912, touchdowns became worth 6 points. That is the history. It was never a decision involving the current scoring system versus something dramatically different. They were all incremental changes, being made to encourage certain types of play."
What makes a formation illegal?,"From the rulebook: Section 5 Position of Players at the Snap Article 1: Offensive Team. The offensive team must be in compliance with the following at the snap: (a) It must have seven or more players on its line (3-18); and (b) All players who are not on the line, other than the receiver of the snap under center, must be at least
  one yard behind it. (c) No player may be out of bounds. An illegal formation for the offense would be one where there are not 7 men on the line. There are no restrictions on the defense's formation during normal play, however the defense can be penalized during special teams play: During a punt, a field-goal attempt, or a Try Kick, a defensive
  player, who is within one yard of the line of scrimmage at the snap,
  must have his entire body outside the snapper’s shoulder pads."
"How does the referee communicate with players in football(soccer) matches, when they are from different countries?","FIFA referees are expected to be able to speak English. So if the referee who doesn't speak the language of a team (many international referees speak multiple languages) he will be talking English to them. Also notice that players know key words in English (if already not the same in their own language) such as sorry, foul, offside, goal...       Next thing you need to notice is that the referee will not just casually start a conversation with players. He will instruct players after fouls or controversial calls. So when a player commits a foul, he already knows what the referee will be talking about. Or when the referee makes a call that could go either way, he has a pretty good idea why the team that he made the call against them will be talking to him. Another important fact is body language. The referees of FIFA, just like other governing bodies of international sports, use whistles and signals. So there is a distinct signal for each foul, just so everyone understands what's going on without having to translate all orders to different languages (think about the case when players of the same country speak different languages, then without use of signals, you would need multiple translators in all games). Even on top of that, referees try to use body language as much as possible to make everything clear for the players and coaches."
Tiebreakers to decide league position in football (soccer)?,"1) According to the Premier League Handbook, the two teams are tied if the positions are irrelevant (i.e. no relegation or cup qualification is affected): C.7: Subject to Rule C.17, if any two or more Clubs have scored the same number of points, have the same goal difference and have scored the same number of goals in League Matches in that Season; they shall be deemed to occupy the same position in the table. In listed tables for this case, the tied teams are typically listed in alphabetical order. If the positions are significant, the teams play off for the position: C.14: If at the end of the Season either the League Champions or the Clubs to be relegated or the question of qualification for other competitions cannot be determined because two or more Clubs are equal on points, goal difference and goals scored, the Clubs concerned shall play off one or more deciding League Matches on neutral grounds, the format, timing and venue of which shall be determined by the Board. 2) Another regularly-used system (e.g. in European cup competition) is results between the teams that are tied on points (as you mentioned in part 1). e.g. In a league with Team A, Team B Team C and Team D, if Teams A B and C have the same number of points, a hypothetical league involving only fixtures between the tied teams is used to establish the relative ranking of those teams."
How do top football league (e.g. EPL) teams retain reserve players?,"Every professional top division football team in Europe usually has a squad of around 30-35 players including reserves.  The quality of most of the reserve players are almost equal to that of the starting 11 and the substitutes.  The reserve players not only replace the starting 11 and substitutes when they are injured but also when they are out of form or when the manager needs to try out a different strategy and some of the reserve players fit well into it.  Some managers adopt a squad rotation policy as a strategic move and reduce the burden on the starting 11.  This way reserve players get oppurtunities. To give you more clarity on the Manchester United/Wolverhampton scenario which you have mentioned, a player may choose to be on the bench or reserve at MU, this way he gets to play with better players in his team. Or he may choose to play as a statting 11 at Wolves, this way he gets more match time.  The choice depends on the player. There are reserve grade matches and U-21 matches which do occur simultaneously along with the main competition and reserve players use these matched to stay fit. I know that this is the case in England, not sure about other leagues. I understand that you are comparing this with Australian Rugby League (which I know little about). In comparison, I believe that reserve players are used quite often in football and play a crucial role.  I can say that it is very rare to see a top flight team to field the same 11 for more than 3 games consecutively."

Which athletes were the first to break the color barriers in hockey?,"Here's a timeline of some of the notable milestones: 1948: Larry Kwong appears for the New York Rangers; he was the son of Chinese immigrants to Canada.  1958: Willie O'Ree, playing for the Boston Bruins, is the first black player to play in the NHL. He has been called the Jackie Robinson of the NHL.  1989: Robin Bawa, the first Indian player, joins the Washington Capitals.  1989: Bill Guerin becomes the first Hispanic player in the NHL. One of the top scorers ever in the league, he will likely be elected to the Hall of Fame as soon as he is eligible. He won two Stanley Cups in his 18-year career, during which he played for eight different teams.  1990: Jim Paek is the first Korean player, playing for the Pittsburgh Penguins and eventually winning two Stanley Cups with them.  1994: Paul Kariya is the first player of Japanese descent as he joins the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, and later becomes the first player of Asian descent to score 50 goals in a season.  2003: Jordin Tootoo is the first Inuit player in the league.

How can you beat the world record in shooting?,"In the event you mention (50m Rifle Prone), the 8 best qualifiers shoot in the final event.  In the final event, the scoring zones are divided into tenths, with 10.9 being the maximum score per shot (ten shots are taken).  The final total is the combination of the qualification and final score. The competition is won by the shooter who reaches the highest aggregate score (qualification + final, maximum 709.0). So, if you shoot in the final, you could hit a perfect 600 (in qualification) and then your final ten could be anything up to 109, meaning a maximum possible of 709. You note the 704.8 but actually, in the London 2012 games just now, Sergei Martynov won gold with 705.5. I'll add also that, once someone shoots 709, that will be the maximum world record (and it will be shared by anyone else shooting 709) unless the scoring changes. For clarity, this is how the shooting is scored: Qualification Final (Top 8 qualifying shooters) Final Score"
How do I get distance out of a fairway bunker?,"However, I can't seem to get any distance out of fairway bunkers.
  Currently, I'm adopting the same approach as when I play the greenside
  bunkers but with a longer iron. Oh no.....I'm cringing ;) You open your stance, the clubface of your long iron, and strike the sand an inch behind the ball to get out of fairway bunkers? The reason this is done in greenside bunkers is to get the ball out of the bunker while landing it softly enough to hold the green, let alone stopping the ball as close as you can to the hole (and if you can spin the ball, that's a huge plus!). The problem is that I don't get any distance. Playing a shot from a greenside bunker is not a distance shot. How to play a shot out of a fairway bunker: Above is a list I got from the following article. Throughout my normal swing, my left leg flexes. During my bunker shot, my left leg is (athletically - slightly bent) stiff until I make contact. I will admit, it takes an enormous amout of leg strength to keep your lower body as still as possible. Also, another thing that isn't listed above is to strike the ball first. Keep in mind how high the lip is before you choose your club. If the lip is high, I would take a higher club to move the ball forward and out of the bunker. Aside: Striking the ball first is also crucial for shots off pine straw. EDIT: (based on KeithS's comment) If the ball is buried, just get the ball out of the bunker and give yourself a better look for your next shot. It is not practical to strike the ball first in a buried lie or fried egg. If more than the bottom quarter of the equator of the ball is buried, I would just pitch out."
Tell-tale signs for dull skates,"There are a few things to look for on your skate blades to indicate it's time for sharpening. First would be visible nicks appearing anywhere along the length of the blade.   You also want to look out for 'rounded' edges.
 Lastly you will want to avoid pitting which is quite common if you leave your cloth skate guards on your skates between sessions.  Be sure to wipe down your steel after you get home to ensure your blades are dry. I would argue that there isn't a 'rule-of-thumb' with regard to sharpening frequency, Pro's get their blades sharpened every period, amateurs can likely go weeks without any consequence.  After you gain more experience you will be able to 'feel' when it's time to head to the pro-shop."
Why is the player in the middle of I-formation called the fullback?,"Here's an attempt to layout the history of the position, and the time periods in which it changed. All of this information can be found here, although it's buried with all of the history of every other position as well. This question requires a good understanding of nomenclature, and I would encourage you to read the entire article in the link, especially the sections labelled ""Age of Confusion"" and ""Making Sense of it All."" As the article states: The trend away from geometric naming of the offensive positions has led to considerable confusion So here are the bullet points that help identify the evolution of the fullback position. The origin of the fullback was in 19th century rugby. Originally these positions were named ""tends,"" but the evolution of the game created some new positions with new names. As the game became more sophisticated, backs positioned at different depths (i.e. distances behind the forwards) were further differentiated into half back, three quarters (the fraction 3/4) back, and full back... It was the Irish nomenclature of quarter back, half back, and full back that came to North America for use in what was to become the dominant native form of football. The terms became hyphenated and eventually unhyphenated single words, ""quarterback"" (QB), ""halfback"" (HB), and ""fullback"" (FB). In the early days of American football (around the beginning of the 20th century), the role of the fullback was altered. Instead of the position just indicating a position behind the line of scrimmage, it began to also identify the role and physical nature of the position. Over time, the typically fast back who played fullback, on offense and defense, was replaced by a heavier one who presented a greater threat to run with the ball more or less straight ahead, and to tackle his opponent trying to do the same. For this purpose, the player tended to be placed closer to the line than previously—often as far forward as the halfbacks (the offensive backs then forming a letter T, sometimes called a ""straight T"", later to distinguish it from slight variants wherein other backs did not form a line perpendicular to that from the quarterback) or even farther forward. But the position kept being called ""fullback"". In the 1960s, many non-professional teams lost the distinction between a halfback and fullback. The NFL maintained the nomenclature of halfback and fullback: ...the distinction between fullback and halfback was erased, each replaced by ""running back"" (RB). That term became popular during the 1960s as well, although even into the 1970s, some playing the pro set kept the HB-FB distinction... The distinction referred to the build of the players, the fullback being a stronger runner more or less straight ahead, and the halfback faster to attack the defense's flanks. However, on many teams there was no strong distinction between those backs, and since their major role was running with the ball, ""running back"" was most descriptive without maintaining a spurious geometric connotation that'd become outmoded by their lining up in different depth relationships.  This trend has continued on. The present day explanation of fullbacks: [T]o this day many teams maintain the offense's fullback-halfback distinction... [S]ome formations have placed the heavy back even more starkly forward, to function as a blocker for the running backs.  There are a number of current NFL teams that do not have a full-time fullback in their starting lineup. The three with no fullback listed: The four that have a hybrid fullback: In some instances, teams will line up a defensive lineman as a fullback: In selected plays, some teams will have a defensive lineman report as an eligible receiver to line up as a fullback. Examples of such players who have been frequently used as situational fullbacks include Haloti Ngata, Vince Wilfork, and Isaac Sopoaga."
Gel packs: to use or not to use? When?,"I'm not sure there are any definite knowledge on the use of gels on long runs. Which is reflected in the many different forms of energi products on the market - pastes, gels, gums, bars, etc. And the many discussions on the various running sites... When it comes to gels, have a look at When to eat Energy Gels in the Marathon - which is fine, if a little thin. The links at the end are pretty good. As you're from US, this comparison might be of interest as well. (We have other products in Europe, but I have never found a similar page for these...) Personally, I use a isometic gels from Maxim for every 7 km on longer runs. Which then means 2 gels for a HM (at 7 and 14 km) and 5 for a M (at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 km) assuming there is some sort of refreshment at the end of the race or training pass. This might be in the low end compared with what many others recommend - typically one gel per 20 minutes. Other links, that might be of interest:"
Are the gender differences in Olympic uniforms simply a style choice? Whose choice?,"The precise rules for clothing are published by the international sport federations (FIVB for Beach Volleyball, FIG for gymnastics, FINA for Swimming etc.). Typically, they consist of In Beach Volleyball, the default clothing is indeed strikingly different and far more revealing for women. Women may wear more modest clothing citing religious or cultural reasons, but have to request permission for these. Men are not allowed not wear more revealing (or more modest) clothing. In Gymnastics, the laws are really complicated, because there is a multitude of disciplines. Generally, women seem to have more options. In Swimming, men must wear more revealing clothing. Here are the generic rules of the game. Those are gender-independent (see §4.3). The competition regulations (which in FIVB's case also contain 2016 olympic regulations) are quite explicit though (§4.4):   Note that the Men's shorts must be at 20cm or longer, whereas the Women's shorts must be 7cm or shorter. However, women (though not men) may opt out due to religious or cultural beliefs, as seen in §4.4 of the same laws: There are also other clothing articles under these rules, for example covering neck and hair. If you prefer text to graphics, here is a quote from the same §4.4: The official FIVB beach volleyball men’s uniform for all FIVB beach volleyball events consists of: tank top and shorts AND eventual accessories
  The official FIVB beach volleyball women’s uniform for all FIVB beach volleyball events consists of: tops and bikini bottoms AND eventual accessories Finally, the additional Olympic regulations for Beach Volleyball seem to consist of a form where athletes have to register their colors in advance. In section 2 §9 of the general laws, you'll just see (see COP), which turns out to be discipline-specific regulations. In Aerobic Gymnastics' COP, you can see the wording in §2.3. The details are quite technical, but notably men have to choose from five options (basically all tanktops), whereas women are more free to choose.
Women are allowed to cover their entire arms up to the wrist and their legs. Men have to show at least 1/4 of their leg and most of their arms. Surprisingly, many other disciplines do not actually have a dress code in their discipline-specific rules. But fear not, there's trampoline with sub-disciplines: In basic trampoline (§6), female clothing must be skin-tight. There is no such restriction for the men. On the other hand, the men are not allowed to cover their arms, whereas the women are. In trampoline tumbling and double mini trampoline (§6 respectively), the rules are similar to basic trampoline, but in addition, men must wear gym shorts (presumably showing the knee), whereas women may wear long tights. Swimming is a rare sport where men must reveal more than women; see FINA By-Laws §8.3: (...) swimwear for men shall not extend above the navel nor
  below the knee, and for women, shall not cover the neck, extend past the shoulder, nor shall extend below knee. You asked a lot of individual questions, which I try to answer here. Are the gender differences in Olympic uniforms simply a style choice?
  Whose choice? Depends on the sport and discipline - sometimes the differences are enforced, sometimes it is in principle possible to opt for longer clothing, and sometimes it's up to the choice of the individual player. Are there uniform rules that state women must have bare stomachs? No, not in any of the sports I am aware of. Male swimmers, on the other hand, must have bare stomachs. Or that men may not? A lot of sports require any athlete to cover their stomach. Beach Volleyball only applies these regulations to men. That women's bottoms should look like panties instead of shorts? This is the default design in Beach Volleyball, but women may opt out. That men's bottoms should be loose? Not explicitly, but this can follow from gender-specific as well as gender-independent clothing regulations. Do the sport's governing bodies set these rules? Yes, but it is possible that the sport federation's olympic rules (determined in cooperation with the IOC) amend or modify this (for instance, prohibiting advertisements). Can a woman declare she would rather wear shorts, thanks? In some sports and disciplines, shorts are allowed. In gymnastic disciplines, they are allowed (even required) for men but not women. Can a man declare he'd rather wear something super tight and short? Depends on the sport and discipline (e.g. it's fine in swimming), but often not. In Beach Volleyball, men's pants must be at least 20cm long."
When and why did baseball players start exclusively running the bases counterclockwise?,"When? This evolved over time to what we know in modern baseball today. The first known time the players were instructed to run counterclockwise was in 1839 (page 40, Early Professional Baseball and the Sporting Press, R. Terry Furst, 2014). One mandate regarding running counterclockwise in the MLB was made after Herman Schaefer stole first from second(1). This is covered under Rule 5.09(b)(10) of the 2016 MLB Rule Book. Any runner is out when: Why? This article dives into factors that can be summarized by stating that the game of baseball developed into what it is today because the general population is predominately right-handed. This, as a result, influenced specializing skills such as switch hitting and left-handed batting rather than by default (ie, clockwise baserunning, a mirror image of what we know today). A few quotes from said article: Clockwise baserunning, therefore, would necessitate that most fielders
would have to turn before they threw the ball ...
Since a majority of the population would find it easier to throw
without first turning, and to swing the bat right-handed,
counterclockwise baserunning gradually prevailed. Now the environment of the game can influence skills that can be
learned. Professional baseball evolved with batters standing on either
side of the pitcher-catcher axis. ... The
left-handed batter stands closer to first base, and this provides his
team with an offensive advantage. He can both reach first more
quickly, and block the catcher's view of the runner on first. Baseball developed in a manner favoring the very specialized skill of
right-handed throwing, and the less-specialized technique of
left-handed hitting. Most ball-players at all positions throw
right-handed; many bat left-handed, however, and there have been very
few hitters indeed who bat right and throw left. Because of the
necessity for speed in throwing, there have been no regular, longtime
southpaws at C, 2B, SS, or 3B in this century."
"In ice hockey, how is plus/minus calculated?","You can calculate a player's plus/minus using the following rules. If a player is on the ice for a(n): Plus/Minus is not awarded for penalty shots and goals scored into an empty net do not change how plus/minus is calculated. Player plus/minus is calculated each game and then added to the net plus/minus from all previous games in the season. With a shortened season this year in the NHL, season total plus/minus will look very different than other (non-shortened) seasons since the statistic is additive over all games in the season. For example if a player averages a +1 rating over a season, a regular 82 game schedule will see that player have a +/- of +82. This year, with the shortened 48 game schedule, that same player will have a +/- rating of only +48 despite performing equally well in both seasons. The NHL publishes who was on the ice for each goal for every game as well as that players game +/- so you can check how the stat is calculated. Here's an example from a recent game.

What are the advantages/disadvantages of the triangle formation?,"Chelsea under Mourinho used a defensive triangle anchored by Claude Makelele, the advantages of which are described here by the coach himself. Look, if I have a triangle in midfield – Claude Makelele behind and two others just in front – I will always have an advantage against a pure 4-4-2 where the central midfielders are side by side. That’s because I will always have an extra man. It starts with Makelele, who is between the lines. If nobody comes to him he can see the whole pitch and has time. If he gets closed down it means one of the two other central midfielders is open. If they are closed down and the other team’s wingers come inside to help, it means there is space now for us on the flank, either for our own wingers or for our full-backs. There is nothing a pure 4-4-2 can do to stop things."
Which workouts will most help my ball handling skills?,"When I played basketball in high school, I found that what helped my ball handling skills the most was that feel you get from constant repetition and muscle memory. Knowing exactly how hard and at what angle to put the ball behind your back, between your legs, how much wrist to use while dribbling, etc. - they're all critical skills that help your ball handling. As most coaches will also tell you - being able to dribble the ball well with either hand is also important - as is being able to dribble with your head up, looking around the court. Here are some drills I used to do at practice to improve my ball handling skills:"
"In football, can a player sent off before the start of the game be substituted?","Provided that the referee has started their pre-match inspection, they have the power to take disciplinary action against players who commit sending-off offences. Law 12 - Fouls and Misconduct, Section 3 - Disciplinary Action: The referee has the authority to take disciplinary action from entering the field of play for the pre-match inspection until leaving the field of play after the match ends (including kicks from the penalty mark). If, before entering the field of play at the start of the match, a player commits a sending-off offence, the referee has the authority to prevent the player taking part in the match (see Law 3.6); the referee will report any other misconduct. The described scenario is explicitly mentioned in the Laws of the Game - Law 3: The Players - 6. Players and Substitutes Sent Off: A player who is sent off: A named substitute who is sent off before or after the kick-off may not be replaced. So, if a player in the starting 11 is sent off before the game starts, he can be substituted and the number of substitutions is not changed - although there will be one less substitute available in the technical area, as the substitute may not be replaced. If the team list has not yet been submitted to the referee, they may not be added to the list - either as a player or substitute, so the team will have a full complement of players and substitutes (they will replace a player with a substitute on the team list, and a substitute with a reserve - provided they have one available). Prior to 2016, the team list issue was a moot point, as the referee only had the power to sanction players after entering the field at the start of the game, which is after the team list is submitted."
Olympic medalist in both the Summer and Winter Olympics,"There are six people that have won medals in both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. Gillis Grafström of Sweden is the most successful figure skater in Olympic history, having won 3 gold medals and 1 silver medal in 1920-1932.  However, he is only on this list because in 1920, there was no Winter Olympics, and figure skating was an event in the Summer Games.  The first Winter Games was in 1924, where he got his second gold. Eddie Eagan was an American gold medalist in boxing in 1920.  He failed to medal in 1924, but in 1932 he was a member of the bobsleigh team which took gold, making him the first person to win a medal in Summer and Winter for different events. Jacob Tullin Thams of Norway won the first Olympic gold medal for ski jumping in 1924.  In 1936, he was on the sailing team that won silver in the 8-metre class. Christa Luding of Germany is a speed skater and cyclist.  She won medals in skating from 1984-1992, and in 1988 with her silver medal in track cycling became the only person to win a medal in the Winter and Summer Games in the same year. Clara Hughes of Canada is also a cyclist and speed skater.  She won two bronze medals for cycling in 1996, and won four medals for skating between 2002-2010.  She has the distinction of being the only person to have won multiple medals in both the Summer and Winter Games. Lauryn Williams of the USA won a silver medal at Athens 2004 and gold in London 2012 as a sprinter.  This year at Sochi 2014, she won silver in bobsleigh."
What are wild card standings in NHL?,"After the realignment, the league now consists of 2 conferences with 2 divisions in each conference. NHL playoffs consist of 16 teams fighting for the last two spots to compete in the Stanley Cup Final The way the new playoff structure works is as follows... The top three teams in each division will make-up the first 12 teams in the playoffs. The remaining 4 teams (Adding up to 16 teams) will be made up by the next two highest-placed finishers in each conference. Two teams per conference. This means that the the 2 wild card spots in the Eastern Conference can consist of one of the following: Two teams from the Atlantic Division Two teams from the Metropolitan Division One team from the Atlantic and one team from the Metropolitan.  The way the seeding now works is... The division winner with the most points in the conference will be matched against the wild-card team with the fewest points The division winner with the second-most points in the conference will play the wild-card team with the second fewest points. In the picture below showing the current standings of the Eastern Conference, you can see that the top 2 rows consist of 3 teams for each division. If the season ended today, these 6 teams (3 from the Atlantic Division and 3 from the Metropolitan Division) will make the playoffs. In the third row, you see a list of every other team in the conference. The top 2 teams in this list are ""Wild Card"" teams and will also make the playoffs. The playoff seedings would look like this: (Boston is the wild card team with the least amount of points and will face the team with the most points in the conference which is Toronto) (Tampa Bay is the wild card team with the most amount of points and will face the team with the 2nd most points in the conference)  Source"
Jersey numbers in NCAA basketball,"There is a rule about this. From Wikipedia: American basketball leagues at all levels traditionally use single and double digits between 0 and 5 (i.e. 0, 00, 1–5, 10–15, 20–25, 30–35, 40–45, and 50–55). The NCAA and most amateur competitions mandate that only these numbers be used. This eases non-verbal communication between referees, who use fingers to denote a player's number, and the official scorer. In college basketball, single-digit players' numbers are officially recorded as having a leading zero. Teams can have either a ""0"" or ""00"", but they cannot have both. Basically, it eases the communication between the refs and the scorers; since you only have five fingers per hand, refs can only denote numbers one through five non-verbally. After a foul, if you watch the ref you'll notice that they show the scorers which player it was by showing their jersey number with their hands. Edit: This can be found here at the bottom of the grid. In the NCAA pdf on basketball rules, Rule 3, Article 5.b.2 the useable numbers are shown (this is on page 41 in the link): The following numbers are legal: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 00, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
  15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55. Team rosters can include 0 or 00, but not
  both."
What is the history/reasoning behind the defensive indifference rule in MLB?,"According to this 2009 NY Times article about defensive indifference: Defensive indifference is exactly what it connotes: a situation when a
  team was unconcerned about preventing the runner from advancing. After
  official scorers consider the score and the inning, if the pitcher
  made pickoff attempts and if the first baseman was positioned behind
  the runner, they determine if the dash was a steal or defensive
  indifference. “It’s an old rule and a very good rule,” said Bill Shannon, who has
  been a scorer for 31 seasons. “I’m loath to give away statistical
  achievements.” But what about the runner who has successfully scooted the 90 feet?
  Some players contend they should be credited with a stolen base. If
  the team’s defensive strategy was to give away the base, should the
  runner be rewarded for taking what was available? and also Defensive indifference is a sleepy but established rule that has been
  in Major League Baseball for 89 years. Bob Waterman, a senior baseball
  staffer at Elias, said the addendum, “No stolen base shall be credited
  to a runner who is allowed to advance without an effort being made to
  stop him,” was placed in the 1920 rule book. The rule is typically
  enforced in the ninth inning of a lopsided game when the defense yawns
  as a runner grabs a meaningless base. The article also notes: Steve Hirdt, the executive vice president of Elias, noticed references
  to defensive indifference while researching play-by-play accounts of
  games from the 1920s. In an article about the imminent rule change in
  The Chicago Tribune on Jan. 30, 1920, there is a headline that reads,
  “Cut Out the Joke Steals.” Hirdt called it a good rule because it
  protects “the spirit of what a stolen base is.” It seems that baseball's rule makers had a very strict definition of what a stolen base was - they did not want meaningless stat padding. This rule helps to make an ""earned"" steal more valuable and keeps a lopsided game moving by discouraging teams from tacking on ""steals"" that won't impact the outcome of the game."
What kind of sea kayak is OK to use in rough waters?,"I like both answers by Dan Wolfgang and Ross Millikan so far, but they're not complete. I'd like to try: Length As you already stated and Dan elaborated on, length provides speed and better tracking (keeping direction). Better tracking also improves stability. If waves hit you from a 90 degree angle (sideways) you can very easily capsize. Hull shape A flat, round shape of the hull often used in agile kayaks for small rivers makes the kayak more manouverable, provides less tracking, and thus makes life harder. There're so called first and second points of stability. The second point determines at which angle the boat will capsize. V-shapes are optimal for both tracking and a good second point of stability. However, they are bad on the first point of stability. What this means is that the kayak will immediately feel ""tippy"" and beginners feel uncomfortable in them because of fearing to tip over. But, the actual point of tipping over is often much further out in V-shaped kayaks than with other shapes on the market. Look at topkayaker.net for a good visual description, and wikipedia explanation of this. Buoyancy This is Ross' main point: The ability to stay afloat. This serves two purposes: It helps to stay out of the water, and once you've capsized the kayak must not sink, so you have an island of safety hopefully with the option of getting in again. As Ross pointed out, for this to work properly sea-kayaks must have at least two sealed compartments. When buying a boat (new or used) always test the compartments: Put some paper towels into all compartments, close all hatches, wade into shallow water, and push the bow under water and hold for a minute or so. It helps to put some weight into the compartments. Ensure the hatch is ~30cm under water level to build up some water pressure. Then repeat with stern. Then tip over the kayak so that the place where you'd normally sit in fills up with water. Again push bow and then stern under water. Pull the boat to shore, carefully open the hatches without spilling water from their seals or lids into the compartments, and check the paper towels and look inside the compartments. A few drops here and there are okay. Soaken paper or half a liter of water inside are not. If you capsize in the ocean, you do this for a reason: conditions are rough. So you boat must be able to support you for an hour or longer. If it's full with water, all compartments broken, it might sink, and you're in even deeper trouble. Volume Important for multi-day tours. Always pack lightly. Still you do need water, food, spare clothes, and some gear for sleeping & cooking. Whatever you take, put it into water proof bags (""roll bags"") Sea water is agressive and even stainless steel will rust eventually. Depending on your need for ""luxury"" (chairs, some take foldable bikes, ...) you need a bigger boat. Packing stuff on top of the kayak is not an option because of Wind If your boat or your luggage provides too much of a silhouette for the wind to attack, this makes keeping your direction harder. You certainly will want a Rudder In whatever way this is implemented a sea-kayak should have some way to trim your direction. This can be the typical and simple external rudder mounted to the back with two pedals used as feet rests for steering and an additional rope to pull up or down into the water, or the older skeg that hides beneath the bow.
On rivers, some actually frown upon on people using a rudder instead of just adjusting paddle strokes and/or tilting/tipping the kayak to ease it around curves. However on the sea it's been used differently: Wind almost always moves you sideways to some extent, and so you already have to offset you direction of paddling to compensate and reach your wanted point of destination. To make this easier you use rudder or skeg to trim your boat. Depending on the length of the tour this is not just a matter of convenience but a matter of physical exhaustion and thus safety. Always take a boat with a steering/trimming facility. If you don't need it, it's ok. But on that particular day, you'll be happy you've got it.  Equipment (Compass, bilge pump, life jacket, paddle float, clothing) Sea-kayaks are not complete without a compass and a bilge pump. If you know the area well you might get by without the compass. And some insist they never fall in and if they do their sponge is enough to get water out. If you've ever capsized and actually have managed to get in again, you know how long it takes to get all the water out with a sponge. So imagine handling the sponge with one hand, while trying to not tip over again with one-handed paddling. In rough water. 50cm wave. Gusts of wind. No fun. A manual bilge pump at least shortens the time. Several people build electrical pumps into their kayaks with the added problem of having to tightly seal off the battery and all electrical parts against sea water while at the same time allowing charging. If you need to get back into your kayak, you need a paddle float (or be very very talented). It's a inflatable wrapper you put around one end of the paddle, pump it up by breathing into the valve. Then fasten the other end of the paddle beneath some ropes on your boat's deck and eh voila - you've got an outrigger. Practice getting out, and back in with your own kayak and paddle float. Once it works, do a practice run with friends on a small lake in adverse conditions. Ensure you're doing it where the wind pushes you against the shore, not away. Safety first! A life jacket is essential to help keep you afloat should you not manage to get into the water. It's also practical because it helps keep you warm, they have pockets for quick release knifes or a camera. They have hooks and loops again for a camera, for emergency whistles or for attaching e.g. a cow tail with a line to be able to tow someone else. User BitOff commented that gloves can be helpful to keep temperature and also reduce fatigue in the fingers and lower arms. Gloves also come in a variant that wraps around the paddle, so that your fingers have direct contact to the paddle, and everything is wrapped together (do an image search for ""paddle gloves""). I'm not going in depth into all sorts of clothing issues. But I do want to point out that generally, for safety reasons, when paddling on open water (large rivers, any lake, or ocean) one should dress for keeping warm in the water. Often enough that means either Neoprene or a Dry-Suit is advocated. Hypothermia is a real risk to your life (read->understand->act). While paddling on our small river (almost no current, 5m wide) in autumn, winter, and early spring, the water temperature is close to 4 deg Celsius and thus I wear a drysuit, and a neoprene cap. Anything else I forgot? Pls comment."
Why do the balls used in rugby and American football have a similar shape?,"Since American football evolved partly from rugby1, it's no surprise that their shapes are similar. The main reason for the oblong shape is to allow carrying the ball by hand. A round ball kicks very well indeed, but is very easy to knock away; an oblong ball is still effective to kick and is much easier to grip. American footballs kept the same basic shape but added laces and pointed ends because both features make the ball easier to throw. Rugby, of course, needs neither feature. 1 See Wikipedia's History of American Football.

Is it possible to effectively practice zone defence in basketball if you don't have 10 people?,"Yes! When my team (of 12 players) plays basketball, we have 1 person on offense dribbling the ball around, forcing all players to move around based on where the ball is. This is great practice if you go by these guidelines: Hope this helps!"
Can I use my hand to hit the ball on table tennis?,"Yes, you can use your hand to hit the ball, but only if it is your racket hand and below the wrist. A quote of the rules state: It is considered legal to hit the ball with your fingers, or with your racket hand below the wrist, or even any part of the bat.(Law 2.5.7) This means that you could quite legally return the ball by: A proviso includes - Your hand is only your racket hand if it is holding the racket, so this means you can't drop your bat and then hit the ball with your hand, because your hand is no longer your racket hand It is illegal to hit the ball with your free hand. There is a good summary of the rules here."
How to determine the correct grip size for a tennis racquet?,"There are two rules of thumb to determine your correct tennis racket grip size: Hold the racket by the handle as you would while playing and see if you can insert your your non-dominant index finger in the space between your palm and ring finger tip.  If your index finger is snug, the grip is sized correctly. A player can measure his or her grip size with a ruler.  Measure the distance from the tip of your ringer, down to the horizontal crease in your palm, closest to your wrist. These methods are described in greater detail with photographs here: http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/LC/Gripsize.html"
Benefits of compression apparel,The main benefit for me is in preventing body fluids from pooling in my legs (I have very low blood pressure).  This is billed as assisting in recovery post exercise.
Swimming and respiratory infections [closed],"Since crickets were chirping in here I did a little more research, and found that chlorine itself will cause irritation and irritated sinuses are more likely to become infected.  This seems true to me, because I don't often hear of athletes getting infections from long open water swims in rather dirty water.  Ear and nose plugs are not very useful while swimming because they prevent pressure equalization, but one can breathe out of their nose while diving and turning to prevent chlorinated water from entering the sinuses. The comment on the question by wax eagle regarding proper facilities is correct but swim teams typically have little control over their facility and there is competition to contract lane-space in the first place.  Its at a premium.  The best facility in my area has great circulation, is 8 feet deep at its shallowest (large volume of water compared to number of swimmers) has UV, ozone, and bromine treatment, and is much less irritating to the sinuses and lungs.  If only my team trained there. A couple things for the training bag: More tips are appreciated."
Shot on target with deflection - a goal or an own goal,"In the Premier League, if the shot was clearly on target before the deflection, then it is given as a goal. If there is any doubt as to whether the original shot was on target, then it is passed on to the dubious goals committee, who decide who to award the goal to. Whether or not the goalkeeper would have saved it without the deflection is not taken into consideration.  In the Sergio Ramos case, it is possible UEFA have their own definition of a goal/og that differs from the Premier League. Alternatively, UEFA could've deemed the Ramos header to be going off target before the deflection.  "
Does Vatican participate in any International sports?,"Vatican City has both a national football and cricket team. However, as neither are members of the appropriate international governing body (FIFA and the ICC respectively) they don't compete in any form of regular competition, but instead play friendlies against other teams."
Difference between medium fast and fast medium bowler?,"According to http://www.talkcricket.co.uk/guides/types_of_fast_bowling.html  Medium-Fast bowlers tend to be in the 120-129 km/h range. While Fast- Medium bowlers are in the 130-141 km/h range.  Although the differences tend vary from source to source, notably the website Espncricinfo uses the term interchangeably (Source: Wikipedia)"
Is the hand a part of the ball?,"Just a little further down in the same rule @posdef quotes, is this one: e. Contact which occurs on the hand of the offensive player, while that hand is in contact with the ball, is legal.  This is significant enough to warrant its own exception in the rules.  It also is called out as incidental contact explicitly in the first section of Contact Situations: ... The hand is considered ""part of the ball"" when it is in contact with the ball. Therefore, contact on that hand by a defender while it is in contact with the ball is not illegal. While the defender may not flagrantly attempt to injure an opponent's hand, if a defender bats at the ball to attempt a steal and contacts only the hand (not the forearm) of the ballcarrier while it is in contact with the ball, a foul will not be called.  "
When does a point count as a winner and when as unforced error?,"Winner - a shot hit by a player so the ball jumps more than once on the opponent side without the opponent being able to even touch the ball. Example Unforced error - a mistake made by the player from quite an easy shot hitted by from the opponent for example hitting the ball wrong, lack of precision or improper position.
Number of unforced errors usually counted for statistics and indicate the level of each player's game. Example"
What is the procedure to become a Cricket Umpire?,"As an umpire for cricket you are responsible for the calling of many intricate rules of the game. Cricket is a sport that is played around the world, in several different countries. Each country or territory may have different sets of training processes to become an accredited official. Instructions
Difficulty: Moderately Easy
Steps As per an Indian Newspaper To become an umpire, you have to qualify theory exams conducted by state sports bodies like the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA). Once you qualify, you become eligible for the exams conducted by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and your state cricket association will endorse your candidature. Please note, gathering information on the exam dates etc becomes easier if you are a cricket player at the state or club level. One should also ideally keep in touch with the state cricket associations’ convening committee to stay updated on exams. It has also quoted some other aspects as follows Skills
. You must know the 42 laws of cricket properly
. Incisive understanding of the game
. Ability to take spontaneous decisions
. Be a good manager
. Be very patient. You can’t afford to lose your temper at any cost How do I get there?
You have to qualify the theory and practical exams conducted from time to time by state sports bodies. You then become eligible for the exams conducted by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) at two levels — one and two. After clearing the second level, you make it to the BCCI panel and can umpire at the highest level. After your case is endorsed by the BCCI for the International Cricket Council (ICC), you can join the race to be an international umpire. But until you pass these exams, you must grab whatever opportunity comes your way to umpire — corporate match, domestic or club level Institutes There is no institute which trains you to become an umpire. It’s only the BCCI which conducts classes before the umpire’s exam. Once nominated by your state to the BCCI, you can attend these classes More at this link"
What happens if there is a tie during an olympic race?,"The IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) is the highest governing body in the sport of athletics (which includes track and field). They cover the sport at an international level, which includes the International Olympic Committee. The rules for ties are as follows: A tie remains if judges are unable to determine: The order in which the athletes finished the race A tie among athletes in different heats for a ranking or qualifying position is handled by: If a tie has been determined for a qualifying position for a subsequent round, the athletes who tied shall be placed in the next round. lots (n.): The use of objects in making a determination or choice at random. According to their 2010-2011 competition rules (see page 140/255), ties are handled based on RULE 167: 167.1: If the Judges or the Photo Finish Judges are unable to separate the athletes for any place according to Rules 164.2, 165.15, 165.21 or
  165.24 (as may be applicable), the tie shall remain. 164.2: The athletes shall be placed in the order in which any part of their
    bodies (i.e. torso, as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs,
    hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of the
    finish line as defined above. 165.15: A system which operates automatically at either the start or the finish,
    but not at both, shall be considered to produce neither Hand nor Fully
    Automatic Times and shall not therefore be used to obtain official
    times. In this case, the times read on the image will not, under any
    circumstances, be considered as official, but the image may be used
    as a valid support in order to determine placings and adjust time
    intervals between athletes.
    Note: If the timing mechanism is not started by the Starter’s gun, the
    time-scale on the image shall indicate this fact automatically. 165.21: In conjunction with the two Assistants, the Chief Photo Finish Judge
    shall determine the placing of the athletes and, as a consequence, their
    official times. He shall ensure that these results are correctly entered
    in or transferred to the competition results system and conveyed to the
    Competition Secretary. 165.24: The use of Transponder Timing Systems approved by IAAF in events
    held under Rules 230 (races not held completely in the stadium), 240
    and 250 is permitted provided that: 167.2: In determining whether there has been a tie between athletes in different heats for a ranking position according to Rule 166.3(a) or
  for a qualifying position for a subsequent round based on time, the
  Chief Photo Finish Judge shall consider the actual times recorded by
  the athletes to 1/1000th of a second. If it is thus (or according to
  167.1) determined that there has been a tie for a ranking position the tie shall be broken by draw. Where there is a tie for a qualifying
  position for a subsequent round based on time or place, the tying
  athletes shall be placed in the next round or, if that is not
  practicable, lots shall be drawn to determine who shall be placed in
  the next round."
Has the practice of retiring numbers ever become a problem?,"It's not exactly the problem you pointed out in your OP, but the Toronto Maple Leafs (NHL team) have an ongoing dispute with one of their players from 1960-1975.  The leafs have a policy of honouring jersey numbers rather than retiring them, where a banner is raised to the rafters in honour of the player, but future players can still wear the number. Given that the leafs have almost twenty number honoured, they do this to avoid the problem you mentioned in your question. They only actually retire numbers when a player has died or suffered a career ending injury while playing for the team; they only have two numbers actually retired. You can read more about the dispute here: Wikipedia 1, 2 2017 Update: The dispute is over: The Leafs decided to start retiring their numbers rather than honouring them, so Keon's number is now retired."
Why can't MLB teams trade draft picks?,"The MLB has no salary cap. Can you imagine if the Yankees wanted draft picks? They can get almost every pick they please.  In other words, ""competitive balance"" is the reason. In addition, the current expired MLB Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) does did not allow trading of draft picks. However, in 2013, the new MLB CBA will let some teams trade some picks.  After the 2012 MLB Draft signing deadline passes, MLB’s 10 smallest-market teams and 10 lowest-revenue teams (if a team is in both lists, they will count as BOTH a smallest-market AND lowest-revenue team – which means up to 20 (but most likely not 20) teams will fall under this umbrella) will be placed in a “Competitive Balance Lottery” – a product of the new CBA. The odds of winning a draft pick through the lottery will be based on each team’s winning percentage from the previous season (like the NBA). In the 2013 MLB Draft, there will be two groups of six lottery picks; one group after the first round, one group after the second round. The teams from the first group that did not win one of the picks from the first group will be re-entered in the lottery along with any other team that receives revenue sharing. However, only a team that wins a pick in the lottery can trade it, meaning the selection can be traded just once. Picks also can’t be sold for cash, and may only be dealt during the regular season."
Identify this Italian sport,"This sounds like Calcio Fiorentino Just like Roman harpastum, it was played in teams of 27, using both feet and hands. Goals could be scored by throwing the ball over a designated spot on the perimeter of the field. The playing field is a giant sand pit with a goal running the width of each end. There is a main referee, six linesmen and a field master. Each game is played out for 50 minutes with the winner being the team with the most points or 'cacce'. The modern version allows tactics such as head-butting, punching, elbowing, and choking, but forbids sucker punching and kicks to the head.[5]"
Do traded players get their names on the Stanley Cup if previous team wins?,"According to this article: Prior to 1977 only players who had completed the Stanley Cup playoffs
  were eligible. Today, players appearing in 41 regular-season games or
  one Stanley Cup Final game for the championship team have their names
  engraved on the Cup. The NHL makes exceptions for players who do not
  meet the standard because of injury or other extenuating
  circumstances. And according to the NHL: To have one's name engraved on the Stanley Cup certain requirements
  must be met. A player must have at least 41 games played with the club
  or one game played in the Stanley Cup Finals. However, in 1994 a
  stipulation was added to allow a team to petition the Commissioner for
  permission to have players' names put on the Cup if extenuating
  circumstances prevented them from being available to play. However, according to Wikipedia: The Detroit Red Wings received special permission from the NHL to
  inscribe the name of Vladimir Konstantinov, whose career ended after a
  car accident on June 13, 1997, on the Stanley Cup after Detroit
  defended their title in 1998. So it appears that player traded away could be added in theory, but probably not in practice."

How to manage wear in long-distance running?," Follow your feelings and do what you love! Why do runners love running? Runner can experience wears such as blisters, feel odd pains or feel pains too late. If you have too much adrenaline in your blood, you may feel abrupt pain at the very end and not during running -- this makes it extremely important to design training schedule or you may break your tendons or something else. Interval training is extremely important part of safe training. It is important to understand some basic physiology of your body. Dizziness may simply be because of dehydration. Fever may simply be because of running out of energy. Too much wear and too long recover time may be because of poorly-designed training schedules or misusing equipments such as shoes. Chronic diseases such as diabetes I can mean much more delicate training schedules and continuous monitoring of things such as energy intake, energy burnt and blood-sugar-level. Wear can be due to multiple reasons. It can be because of a cut. It may be because you do not understand basic skin maintenance and or basic hygiene. It may be because your diet misses some important item or you have wrong diet with certain training. Nevertheless it is extremely important to learn basic wear maintenance to avoid infections and that way also illnesses. Running can be an extremely good for the type II diabetists to work with the insulin-resistance. It will be good for your stamina or at least it can be a form of perfection to learn new things about life and how it works. I list below items for the wear management. It misses rehabilitation and how things can differ when things go very bad. For the start, you should match your fitness profile to distance like with the distance-profiler here but as injured/worn-out you may need to rehabilitate through other forms of sport first such as swimming and cycling. Safe training requires work!  Nutrients The nutrients below can be essential to your training. Health has many parts such as muscle health, joint health, bone health and performance. I recommend natural sources for Glucosamine like seashell. Measure your ground mineral levels periodically: iron deficiency can make you powerless particularly in hot sweaty weather.  BCAA: after long distance running like 60-90 minutes, catabolism will start to break down fats and muscle in order to release energy. This can be experienced as different kinds of pains such as knee pain. Before the training, BCAA supplement can protect against the muscle loss. BCAA can also be got from a variety of food. BCAA is for muscle health. Glucosamine alleviates the pain in joints particularly when digested naturally from bone marrow, animal bones, the shells of shellfish and fungi with enough fat. This is something that will make repetitive training less painful to bones and joints. In comparison, BCAA is for muscle pain and not for joint/bone pain like Glucosamine. Glucosamine is for joint/bone health. Iron is a common supplement in endurance runners by the Journal article here. It plays a key role in many metabolism reactions: too low serum ferritin levels can result to fatigue and lack of interest in training. Measure the iron levels before supplemenations because of too much iron is toxic and ground minerals such as iron and zinc are tradeoffs. Glutamine fuels white blood cells that are important for immune system. Natural sources of glutamine contain sources rich in protein. Notice that ""One of L-glutamine’s main roles in the body is to support detoxification by cleansing the body from high levels of ammonia. It acts as a buffer and converts excess ammonia into other amino acids, amino sugars and urea. (12) and it follows  ""Doing approximately one hour of exercise can cause a 40 percent reduction of glutamine in the body. It can also cause suppressed immune function. This has a negative impact on your resistance training and may lead to overtraining syndrome."" Shoes use many shoes: now the wear gets to different positions so more time for skin to heal powder in shoes to add an extra layer of movement: I use normal kitchen-cooking-powders particularly with shoes getting me blisters (my friend is recommending magnesium for this) not using the same shoes in a row: shoes require some time to recover, this makes them last longer and you can be more certain of using proper shoes enough washing of shoes: you don't want to get wear because of laziness! Training scheduled daily interval-training: 10km, 3km,3km, 5km, 10km, 15km, pause, stretching, 3km, 5km, ... enough hydration particularly during sunny training -- I have noticed that sunny training requires easily many litres more drinking than non-sunny training!  avoid too much sun -- particularly if your skin is not used to it if you have a blister during running, change the running-style: sometimes the pain goes away when you interval-run between fore-foot-running, middle-foot-running and back-foot-running. Changing running style also results in more balanced wear over your whole body. improve technique like gazello running style, glider running style, middle-foot running style and high cadency running. Please notice that the gazello running style used by elite marathoners is very exhaustive to the whole body and it requires sufficient flexibility in posterior/anterior muscles in legs, knees and hips. Personally I am right-legged and noticed that it is easy to overtrain the other side causing the inflexibilities to the legs meaning that in high tempo the middle part of your body (potentially related to Diaphragm-Psoas Connection) does unnecessary twisting around the axis.  Life-style proper diet: intensive tibial tendon training requires more protein-fat-loaded food, good against injuries and faster recovery. Bananas after normal training good. Listen to your body: any pain in muscles or bones may reflect wrong diet, many times a good balanced diet with enough fat makes knee-pains and tibial pain going away. body lotion and repeated lotioning to dry skin after intensive training enough sleep: you will get wear and blisters sooner-or-later, remember to sleep enough! Pharmacy B12 lotion or B12 powder against soar wears particularly with thighs middle-fat lotion against cuts/dry-skin for soles such as here "
Why is Cricket called Cricket? [closed],"According to Wiktionary and BBC News, the game and the word might originally be from Belgium (and “There is no way to relate the term to any existing English word”): Perhaps from a Flemish dialect of Dutch met 'with' de 'the' krik ketsen 'to ricochet', i.e. ""to chase a ball with a crook"". The Online Etymology Dictionary explains it this way: 1590s, apparently from O.Fr. criquet ""goal post, stick,"" perhaps from M.Du./M.Flem. cricke ""stick, staff,"" perhaps from the same root as crutch."
Should players in the wall jump to defend a free kick?,"Obviously, it depends very much on the distance from goal. If there's a free kick from 30 meters a low shot will be very inefficient because of the friction force with the ground; the goalkeeper will have no trouble catching the ball. When there's a closer free kick you have to consider some factors: In the first case, the defending team should be aware of kicker's habits. Most of kickers usually maintain the free kick style: David Beckham has always kicked the ball making it fly over the wall; in this case the wall has to jump. When the kicker is someone like Ronaldinho, the wall strategy becomes a bit harder. In my opionion the best way to avoid a score is to make defenders jump in an alternatively way: I mean, if you have a 5 defenders wall, you could make the 2nd and the 4th jump, and let the others stand still. In this way you should reduce (theoretically speaking) the probability to get scored. In the second case if the defenders are pretty short, the wall is actually forced to jump, because the kicker will try to use opponent's disadvantage to score, in this case a fly over the wall free kick. If the defenders are tall you can let them stand still, unless the kicker's ability is very good."
Why is there no ATP Masters series 1000 event on grass courts?,"You are not alone in asking this. Many fans and players have also started requesting a longer grass court season and having a grass court Masters 1000 event. Right now it has a lot to do with the tightness of the schedule as well as having the market and sponsors available for a Masters 1000 event on grass to make enough financial sense. The financial commitment involved for a 250 or 500 level tournament is much less than for a Masters 1000 event in addition to the venue and player services needed for a Masters event size draw - usually 64 to 96 players. Also, grass is a notoriously demanding surface to maintain so an event like that would require an expert grounds crew to prep and care for it over the life of the event like Wimbledon does. I think one day we will eventually see a Masters event on grass - all the right pieces need to fall into place first before it can happen. I wouldn't be surprised if someone like Federer took on a challenge like that after he retires, given his affinity for the surface. "
Can a pitcher also be a designated hitter?,"NO. Rule 6.10(b) 2 It is not mandatory that a club designate a hitter for the pitcher, but failure to
  do so prior to the game precludes the use of a Designated Hitter for that club
  for that game. 10 Once the game pitcher bats for the Designated Hitter, such move shall terminate the Designated Hitter role for that club for the remainder of the game.
  The game pitcher may pinch-hit only for the Designated Hitter. 12 Once a Designated Hitter assumes a position on defense, such move shall terminate the Designated Hitter role for that club for the remainder of the game These rules combine to indicate quite clearly that the Pitcher cannot be named the designated hitter for himself. Specifically 12 would be the clearest case, the DH cannot appear on defense, which is the primary role of the pitcher. What a team could do if they had a pitcher with sufficient value as a DH though is the have him DH and then allow him to pitch, perhaps in a closer type role. Though rule 15 indicate that he would not be allowed to warm up in the bullpen: 15 The Designated Hitter may not sit in the bullpen unless serving as a catcher in
  the bullpen"
Different Badminton Grip and Weight Types,"NOTE: There appears to be no universal, consistent standard for these codes as codes for a manufacturer/country may represent opposite meanings compared to another manufacturer/country. G is in reference to grip sizes. U is in reference to racket weight. For a majority(1) of rackets: In Japan, they range from G2, G3, G4 to G5 where G2 is the biggest
  size and G5 is the smallest size. In some countries, the opposite
  applies."
Are cyclists inconvenienced by support car exhausts?,"Having ridden in traffic, on 6 lanes roads, even on highways (with shoulders) I can say the exhaust is a non-issue.  Considering how few support cars there actually are, compared to a 6 lane road, I would say it is not even noticeable."
What happens to the runner if he misses a base after hitting a homerun?,"This is governed by Rule 7.10 [The runner is out on appeal when] With the ball in play, while advancing or returning to a base, he fails to touch each base in order before he, or a missed base, is tagged. So if you miss a bag on your home run trot, you not only have to hit that bag, but you need to go back to each one and re round the bases. IIRC it is still a dead ball so there is no harm in doing so. However, generally if you miss a bag you're going to end up out because you won't know it until the appeal is made. An appeal is made by either tagging the runner or the missed bag. The pitcher will throw the ball to the fielder and the fielder will tag the base. If there is confusion the fielder will need to verbally tell the umpire they are making an appeal. However, I've never seen a case where verbal communication is required. If the fielder knows to ask for the ball, the umpire has also seen the miss. Also related to this is MLB rule 7.12 Unless two are out, the status of a following runner is not affected by a preceding
  runner’s failure to touch or retouch a base. If, upon appeal, the preceding runner is the
  third out, no runners following him shall score. If such third out is the result of a force
  play, neither preceding nor following runners shall score. That's a little confusing, but the long and short of it is that unless there is a force play, all the runners ahead of the player who is called out score. The force plays in a bases loaded situation are as follows: These are the plays that negate the entire home run if the force is a third out. Any other play will only negate the following runners if it's the third out."
What happen when two players touch the finish rope at same time in running?,"First, it's important to understand what constitutes ""finishing"" a race in Track and Field.  The winner is not the first person to get a body part across the line or ""touch the tape"" as you referred.  The winner is the first person to get their torso across the finish line. A situation similar to this occurred in the US Olympic trials for the 2012 London Olympics.  Allyson Felix and Jeneba Tarmoh tied for 3rd (which was important because only the top 3 qualify for the Olympic team).  Originally, Tarmoh was declared the winner by .0001 seconds, but later they determined it was a tie (the cameras they used shot at 3000 fps - quite capable of determining a tie).   If this were to happen in the Olympics, both would be awarded the bronze medal. If the tie were for 1st, they would both be awarded a gold medal and the 3rd finisher would be awarded a bronze and no silver would be awarded (This happened in 2000 when Gary Hall Jr. and Anthony Ervin tied in the 50M freestyle swim).   However, because only 3 members of team could qualify, a tie breaker was necessary.  The USATF (nor the IAAF - the international governing body of T&F) had no rules in place to settle this particular tie, so they resorted to the following: Eventually Jenebah Tarmoh pulled out from the tie-break and surrendered the spot to Felix. A situation like this is obviously rare and will probably only happen in shorter distances.  "
What happens if an NFL kicker totally misses the ball on a kickoff?,"First there is not a designated kicker. Just because there is a little twerp in a #3 jersey doesn't make him a kicker.  If you look in Greg's answer that copies Article 1 discussing the free kick you will see that only the kicker can be more than 5 yards beyond the kickoff line.   This was put in recently for player safety.  Guys would line up 10-15 yards behind and be at full sprint when leaving.  Guys were getting hurt and too much advantage for kickoff team.   Any player can kick the ball.  Let's say that there is a ""normal"" kickoff formation 5-1-5 with the ""1"" deep.  Let's say the ""1"" doesn't kick the ball but someone else does.  Illegal formation on the ""1"" - receiving team takes the ball +5 yards or rekick minus 5 yards.  That's why on a lot of onside kick plays you see in the NFL, everyone is within 5 yards of the ball. Next let's talk about the kicker whiffing.  If the kicker misses the ball totally without the ball being removed from the tee it really depends where his kicking foot is.   Let's say the kicker plants 1 yard early and misses.  He is free to try to kick the ball again.  In reality someone on his team would have crossed the line of scrimmage and there would be an offsides penalty.  But if this were ""designed"" the kicker is fully eligible to take as many swings as needed - this isn't golf.  In the NFL there is a play clock enabled on official ""OK"" whistle.  That is the only thing standing in the way. Let's say kicker plants normal, feels twinge in his leg and slowly tries to execute kick but misses on purpose knowing kick isn't going anywhere.  Let's say plant foot is over the line and foot never reaches the ball.  Can the kicker back up and rekick?  I think the NFL rules committee minds would blow up!  This just simply isn't in the rulebook.  Can he back up after his plant foot is beyond the line?  I would tend to say no but it is not in the rulebook or any use cases I have ever seen and I have read through more than a 100 use cases from pee-wee to NFL level (I find the trivia in the use cases fascinating).  I don't think it would ever ever come up in reality because the kicking team members would jump offsides during a whiff - I could never think of a case where this would happen.  If the team didn't jump and the kicker retreated to kick again... well I wouldn't fault the official for not calling anything.  Same scenario as above - kicker plants on line or past, kicker misses kick but does not cross line or hit ball with kicking foot.  Then kicker keeps plant foot where it is and ""rekicks"".  I find this perfectly within the rules as mentioned in Article 1.  The kicker just has to worry about the play clock.  Again let's ignore that the other 10 players would have jumped.  The kicker at this point would be better off taking an offsides penalty and in all cases a coach would rather a kicker be offsides versus kicking the ball with no run up or even step. Same scenario again - except this time kicker plants anywhere and kicking foot misses the ball, but this time when the kicker misses ""high"" his foot clearly goes past the kicking line.  This is clearly offsides as illustrated in Article 1.   I have seen a couple of ""fake kickoff kicks"" at the high school level but can't remember one in the NFL (please comment if someone remembers one).  Basically kicker runs up and swings but a yard short, team runs hard to line but stops, member near kicker onside kicks as the opposing front line is retreating, team goes past line on kick and recovers ball.  I have seen it done at least 5 times.  I think 2 of the times there was an offsides and the other 3 were VERY successful.   At the NFL level this play could not only work but you could easily practice moving into a full squib if the return front line didn't retreat.  You have a ton of time to do whatever during kickoff so you could show a couple looks and still do a semi-normal kick. To summarize: There is no kicker until someone tries to strike the ball and really there is no defined kicker unless someone put a plant foot on the kickoff line.  Anyone can act like they are kicking the ball.  If that person has plant foot and kicking foot across the kickoff line then he is offsides.  So therefore you can logically deduce that the kicker is either the first person to put a foot on the kickoff line or the first person to strike the ball and once the second member of a team puts their plant foot on the line before the kick is being made, they are offsides.   From an infraction standpoint the idea of settling this sort of rule by the rules committee would be moot.  The coaches in all cases would rather just take a 5 yard penalty.  We are discussing refs not calling a penalty on a team when a coach would clearly want it called.  I can only imagine this happening and not called as kicker takes second swing and muffs it 15 yards and kicking team going crazy on the ref.  "
Cricket bat with bent handle?,"I am not familiar with the anecdote, however the laws of cricket state that the handle must be straight From The Laws of Cricket. On the other hand there doesn't appear to be any restriction on the face of the bat curving and from personal experience and from watching games most modern bats seem to be curved, but in the opposite direction from what you suggest, i.e. the face curves gently towards the direction of the bowler when held in a regular batting stance. One additional point is that I can't see anywhere in the laws that demand that the join of the handle and the bat be straight, just that the handle itself be straight. However, from a bat construction and transfer of force between hands and ball perspective, you wouldn't want to have anything other than a straight join of the handle and bat. Anyway, these days everyone wants to play T20 and hit sixes, so this kind of design would probably not be popular even if it were legal."
What do the cards in table tennis mean?,"Yellow and red cards were first introduced into the game of table tennis in 1991.
  
  Yellow and red cards are shown by umpires and referees to players and coaches who break the rules or misbehave during the course of a match or tournament.   Rule 3.05 covers the area of discipline in table tennis, and it applies to both players and coaches. The first part of this table tennis rule deals with coaches giving advice to players, Advice is only allowed to be given by a coach during the intervals between games or during other authorised suspensions of play.   So if advice is given at any other time, the umpire will hold up a yellow card and warn the coach that any further offence will result in his dismissal from the playing area.
  If the coach again gives advice illegally during the same match, the umpire will hold up a red card and send the coach away from the playing area. If this happens during a team match, and ANY authorised person gives advice to the player after a yellow card has been shown, the umpire will hold up a red card and send him away from the playing area, whether or not he was the person previously warned.
  In a team match, the dismissed adviser is not allowed to return, except where he is required to play, and cannot be replaced by another adviser until the team match has ended. The second part of this table tennis rule deals with misbehaviour by players and coaches.  The rules state that players and coaches must refrain from behaviour which may unfairly affect an opponent, offend spectators or bring the sport into disrepute.
  Examples of this are - abusive language, deliberately breaking the ball or hitting it out of the playing area, kicking the table or surrounds and disrespect of match officials. Yellow cards are designed for less serious offences but if a player or coach commits a serious offence, the umpire must suspend play and report it immediately to the referee.
  However, for less serious offences the umpire may, on the first occasion, hold up a yellow card and warn the offender that any further offence is liable to incur penalties. If the player then commits a second offence in the same individual match or team match, the umpire will award 1 point to the offender's opponent. And for a third offence he will award 2 points, each time holding up a yellow and a red card together.  If a player continues to misbehave after three offences in the same individual match or team match, the umpire will suspend play and report it immediately to the referee.
  If the coach continues to misbehave after receiving a yellow card, the umpire will hold up a red card and send the coach away from the playing area. Source"
What is the purpose of a Brick workout?,"The performance benefit of brick workouts is widely debated. One thing that is much less argued is the importance of doing some brick workouts prior to your first race(s) to get used to running off the bike.  It can be quite disorienting the first couple of times.  You can help this phenomenon by synchronizing your bike and run cadences as much as possible.  Riding at 90rpm, then jumping off the bike and trying to run at 60 (or vice-versa), your legs will feel lost for 5-15 minutes.  But riding at 90 and taking off running at 90 can smooth things out."
Were volleys considered unsportsmanlike in tennis?,"This is a speculative answer. It is nothing more than the explanation I find most reasonable. The transition from tennis as a 'gentleman's activity' into a full-fledged sport was not entirely smooth and this is an example. There is a great difference between outmaneuvering your opponent from the back of the court, and aggressively sprinting in your long white pants to pounce on the ball before it bloody lands. It's a completely different dynamism, and I'm guessing that most people did not find it particularly endearing or worthy of admiration. Maybe a not-too-bad example is playing football (soccer) with friends. It's not exactly fun if some guy starts being extremely physical and technical since even though he's not breaking any rules, you feel he's missing the ""spirit"" of the game. Really, he's just making fuller use of certain aspects of the rules than everyone else, and that's bound to piss people off. Another example is recreational table tennis. Suppose some guy suddenly switches to a high-quality racket that enables him to create vicious spins. I somehow doubt his opposition would find this experience positive. The easiest thing to do would be to say it's unfair, or unsportsmanlike - much easier than mastering spins yourself. As the sport of tennis became more competitive and people strove to master all of its aspects, it's natural volleying became less frowned upon and eventually more appreciated. As you probably know, volleying went on to become so central to the game, that people who didn't volley were looked down on as incomplete. Recall the initial reception of Borg's style - it was not all joy at all."

Are penalty shots counted in goalie's saves percentage and goal against average?,"Penalty shots during regulation count toward the save percentage of the goalie (and toward the shooting percentage of the shooter).  See for example: http://www.hockey-reference.com/boxscores/201305270DET.html Michael Frolik scored one of four Blackhawk goals on a penalty shot.  He has a 1/2 Shooting % and Jimmy Howard has a 24/28 save statistic (not 24/27 as it would be if it didn't count) and 4 GA.  You can also see that a penalty shot counts against the ""Even Strength Goals Against"", at least if it's not during a powerplay separately from the penalty that incurs the shot - Jimmy Howard has 3 EV GA and allowed one powerplay goal to open the scoring to Hossa. Shootout goals do not count; for example: http://www.hockey-reference.com/boxscores/201503030MIN.html Andrew Hammond has a 36/38 save statistic, for .947 sv%, despite allowing 3 goals during the shootout (out of 5 attempts)."
What happens when a soccer player intentionally catches the ball with their hands in front of the goal?,"You can't award a goal without the ball crossing the line.

Why are 5 runs awarded if the ball hits the helmet? [closed],It is given as a penalty for stopping or obstructing the course of the ball.
"In the Benfica vs Man Utd match, why did the referee point to his watch after the goal?",The UEFA Champion's League uses goal-line technology. This is an automated system which detects the moment the ball has crossed the goal-line under the crossbar. It sends a signal to the referee via a wrist-mounted alarm unit to show a goal has been scored. This reduces the reliance on precise visual judgements from bad angles. The referee indicated that the GLT unit had already signalled a goal.
Two dismissals off a single ball,"Is it possible to dismiss both the batsmen in ground(ie,by a catch and a run out)? No. It is not possible to dismiss both batsmen on the same delivery. Only one batsman can be legally dismissed. In the event of both being dismissed on the same delivery, the batsman dismissed first goes back to the pavilion while the other continues with his/her innings. Is ""Hit the ball twice"" out? According to the Laws of Cricket (Law 34 - as stated below), if done intentionally, then yes, it is out. Law 34 (Hit the ball twice)
  1. Out Hit the ball twice   The striker is out Hit the ball twice if, while the ball is in play, it strikes any part of his person or is struck by his bat and, before the ball has been touched by a fielder, he willfully strikes it again with his bat or person, other than a hand not holding the bat, except for the sole purpose of guarding his wicket. See 3 below and Laws 33 (Handled the ball) and 37 (Obstructing the field).   For the purpose of this Law, 'struck' or 'strike' shall include contact with the person of the striker. However, as with any potential dismissal, the batsman can still continue his/her innings in the following cases: Is it considered a dismissal if the ball hits the other side of the bat? No. As of the current laws, this does not constitute a dismissal. However, the way the modern bat is designed, the batsmen do not get any advantage by using the other side of the bat. So, it does not make sense for the batsmen to use the other side of the bat."
Ball touching the ground during a catch in cricket,"Let's take a look at the laws of cricket. Law 32 - 1 : Out Caught The striker is out Caught if a ball delivered by the bowler [...] touches his bat without having previously been in contact with any fielder, and is subsequently held by a fielder as a fair catch before it touches the ground. The above law (my emphasis) states that the ball must be held as a fair catch before it touches the ground.   If we now look at... Law 32 - 3 : A fair catch The act of making the catch shall start from the time when the ball in flight comes into contact with some part of a fielder’s person other than a protective helmet, and shall end when a fielder obtains complete control both over the ball and over his own movement. and: A catch shall be considered to have been fairly made if [...] the ball does not touch the ground even though the hand holding it does so in effecting the catch. In summary, the ball must be under complete control of the fielder before it touches the ground for it to be a fair catch. In your question scenario, the ball is in the hand but touching the ground at the same time.  In this situation, the umpire would decide which contact occurred first. (It could be a fraction of a second technically). In the applicance of this law, I have rarely seen a ball caught at exactly the same time as it touched the ground (for one would generally have the hand under the ball to catch it).  In my experience the umpire would call not out as it is unlikely that the fielder would have complete control over the ball and his movement in such a scenario. View the laws here."
Is it a goal if the ball goes through the net?,"Yes, it's a goal. And in fact, the two assistant referees are charged with checking if the net is in correct shape before the start of each period. The net is only there to help the referee see a goal, but it is a goal even if the ball goes through it, or doesn't touch it, or if the ball rebounds off the net and returns to the playing field. Law 1 - The Field of Play: 10. Goals states: A goal is scored when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line,
  between the goalposts and under the crossbar, provided that no offence
  or infringement of the Laws of the Game has been committed by the team
  scoring the goal. In Law 10 - Determining the Outcome of a Match: 1. Goals Scored the only reference to the net, reads:  Nets may be attached to the goals and the ground behind the goal,
  provided that they are properly supported and do not interfere with
  the goalkeeper. It says may be, so I suspect it might not be mandatory."
What is the difference between a manager and a coach in case of a football team?,"As you said in question these terms are used interchangeably. From Wikipedia: In association football, a manager is an occupation of head coach in the United Kingdom responsible for running a football club or a national team. Outside the British Isles and across most of Europe, a title of head coach or coach is predominant. and also, The title of manager is almost exclusively used in British football. In the majority of countries where professional football is played, the person responsible for the direction of a team is awarded the position of coach or ""trainer"". For instance, despite the general equivalence in responsibilities, Bobby Robson was referred to as the manager of England, while Joachim Löw was described as the head coach of Germany (Germany also has a team manager role that is subordinate to the head coach and that is filled by Oliver Bierhoff). However, the difference between these terms can be understood as: A manager is a part of a football team who has complete authority over the running and functioning of the team. He has the autonomy to choose his supporting staff, along with the provision to add players to the team if he deems it necessary. and, a head coach is only given the responsibility of ensuring his team putting a good performance in the match they are playing. That includes the likes of choosing a first team and training the players in specific sets of routines required for their position in the team. The management of the team is under the club board. Tottenham Manager Pochettino, in his interview accurately put what the difference is in the two roles1, 2,
3. Pochettino has explained: “If you are the manager, you decide many things about the club. But if you are a head coach, your responsibility is to play better, try to improve the players and to get positive results. “At Southampton, I was a manager. My responsibility was not only to coach the team. With Tottenham, I am a head coach.  A head coach is head of your department. My department is to train the team.” Also, when former Sunderland head coach Paolo Di Canio got sacked after just 13 games in charge in September 2013 . He stated illustrating differences between roles of these two: “Not one of those [players] was bought by me. Roberto De Fanti and Valentino Angeloni were the two responsible for that technical error, with the maximum support from the chairman, which is Ellis Short. But I didn’t bring in one player. I asked for them to bring in 80 per cent British footballers.” At last, many websites1, 2 even premierleague.com use these two terms interchangeably and shows Antonio Conte as a manager of the club Chelsea F.C., while the official website lists Conte as a head coach. For comparison against manager considering coach as head coach.

What is the six yard box (goal box) for in soccer?,"The goal area - colloquially known as the six yard box - serves a number of purposes. Its primary purpose is to designate the location from which goal kicks are to be taken. On p. 51 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of The Game: A goal kick is a method of restarting play. ... The ball is kicked from any point within the goal area by a player of the
  defending team It also serves a number of other purposes. It limits how close to the opponents' goal an indirect free kick may be taken from. On p. 42 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of The Game: Indirect free kick to the attacking team: ... It also limits how close to goal a dropped ball is taken from. On p. 32 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of The Game: Definition of dropped ball A dropped ball is a method of restarting play when, while the ball is still in play, the referee is required to stop play temporarily for any reason not mentioned elsewhere in the Laws of the Game. Procedure The referee drops the ball at the place where it was located when play was
  stopped, unless play was stopped inside the goal area, in which case the
  referee drops the ball on the goal area line parallel to the goal line at the point nearest to where the ball was located when play was stopped. Finally, if the defending team is awarded a free kick (either direct or indirect) in their goal area, they may take it from any point in the goal area. On p. 42 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of The Game: Direct or indirect free kick to the defending team: ... Historically, the goalkeeper could be charged when holding the ball, as long as they had passed outside their goal area.

What is the safe technique of coming out of a fall on a snowboard?,"If you feel that you are falling I believe the best you can do is to tuck to avoid injuring your wrists/elbows and avoid hitting the slope with your head. In certain situations falling can be avoided, but I don't know any techniques for that - it comes naturally with your experience, I believe. After the fall I do try to turn to my back - but I don't lift the board - quite the contrary, I try to come to full stop as quickly as possible. When you fall it's sometimes possible to quickly get back to your feet if you haven't lost momentum - but I'm pretty sure it's best to take your time and listen to your sensations to avoid worsing your injuries - I once broke a wrist and it took me good 10 minutes to realise something was wrong with it. And btw, getting twisted ankle on snowdoard is kind of tricky unless one of your feet gets unstrapped."

"Why do the 5th and 6th officials need magic wands, and what do they do?","The wands that we are seeing more commonly in football are known informally as ""Buzzer Flags"" or, more correctly, ""Referee Paging Systems"".  These are designed to alert the referee to his other officials, one of which may need to bring something to his attention. For example, a referee may have his back to one of the assistant referees and an off-the-ball incident such as a fight may be going on behind him.  The referee won't notice the assistant however much flag waving he is doing so the assistant referee will alert the referee by ""paging"" him with his electronic flag. In making this alert, the referee's armband or transceiver unit will vibrate and possibly also make an audio alarm in his earpiece.  The devices can be configured so that each official has a different audio tone so that the referee knows which assistant is paging him. This technology works alongside the open communication system also adopted by the officials. [This system] allows conference-type communications between 2 to 6 users over 1 km (no limit for the amount of receive only units).
  The main innovation of the system is the “ open microphone” communication concept; it allows every user to talk when they want, without waiting for their turn and without needing some accessory to start talking (push-to-talk button, Vox system). Now, you'll notice from the image I posted that the buzzer flags look like ordinary assistant flags.  In your question, you ask why the 5th and 6th officials have these wands. What you'll actually find is that all of the officials are adopting these pager and communication systems.  The 5th and 6th officals' wands look more like simply flag-handles.  This is because there is nothing in the laws of the games catering for flag signals by these two goal-line assistants - therefore they don't have the yellow and red flag fabric on them. The assistant referees will accompany their paging by the mandated flag signal as well. Sources"
Was Jelavić's goal offside?,"The crucial question here is whether Jelavić received the ball after it rebounded to him off an opponent, or if the opponent played the ball. Because the Laws of the Game define offside as (Law 11, p. 33): A player in an offside position is only penalised if, at the moment the ball touches or is played by one of his team, he is, in the opinion of the referee, involved in active play by: We are talking about the last point in this case. And, in the official interpretation of the Laws of the Game (p. 102), it is defined thus: “gaining an advantage by being in that position” means playing a ball that
  rebounds to him off a goalpost or the crossbar having been in an offside
  position or playing a ball that rebounds to him off an opponent having
  been in an offside position (emphasis mine). The referees obviously decided the Irish player has played the ball, therefore, this was not an offside. And I would say this was a correct decision, given the time it took the ball to pass through the defense line – it was not a quick rebound, the ball stopped there for a second. (But I could not find a close-up video of what exactly the Irish player did with the ball.) After the question was amended: Note there is no such thing as “active” and “passive [offside] position” in the Laws of the Game, those are just jargon terms. For an offside to be called, the player must be “involved in active play” by one of the three exactly defined activities listed above. The first one was definitely not the case here: “interfering with play” means playing or touching the ball passed or
  touched by a team-mate The second one is slightly closer, but still, no go: “interfering with an opponent” means preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing the opponent’s line of vision or movements or making a gesture or movement which, in the opinion of the referee, deceives or distracts an opponent Jelavić did not obstruct anyone’s line of vision or movements, and he definitely did not deceive/distract the opponent, since the Irish defense probably did not see him at all. Which leaves us with the last option debated above. None of the three points was fulfilled, therefore, no offside."
When is an offensive lineman allowed to move?,"Those movements are treated the same as a shift prior to the play or a tight end going into motion. From page 98 of the college football rule book (emphasis mine): ARTICLE 4.  a. If a snap is preceded by a huddle or shift, all players of the 
  offensive team must come to an absolute stop and remain stationary in their 
  positions, without movement of the feet, body, head or arms, for at least one 
  full second before the ball is snapped (A.R. 7-1-4-I) [S20]. b. It is not intended that Rule 7-1-4-a should prohibit smooth, rhythmical 
  shifts if properly executed. A smooth cadence shift or unhurried motion 
  is not an infraction. However, it is the responsibility of an offensive 
  player who moves before the snap to do so in a manner that in no way 
  simulates the beginning of a play. After the ball is ready for play and 
  all players are in scrimmage formation, no offensive player shall make 
  a quick, jerky movement before the snap, including but not limited to 
  (A.R. 7-1-4-II-IV): So, it appears that the spirit of the rule is not to prevent movement before the snap of the ball, but to prevent the offensive players from simulating the snap. This, to me, largely seems like a judgement call on behalf of the officials but it is pretty obvious that when the whole offensive line turns around to look at the sideline that they are not attempting to simulate a snap. I'm assuming that the spirit of the rule is the same in the NFL as referenced by corsiKa's answer."
What determines the spot of a field goal kick in the NFL?,"There is no rule about the required exact distance from the line of scrimmage. It can be taken from the line itself or behind. They kick from 7 yards behind the line primarily because they're used to it. The only rule covering this is Rule 11.4.1 Successful Field Goal (link): a) The kick must be a placekick or dropkick made by the offense from on
  or behind the line of scrimmage or from the spot of a fair catch (fair
  catch kick). If a fair catch is made or awarded outside the inbound
  line, the spot of the kick is the nearest inbound line.
  (...) However, because Field Goal trys have little to no margin for errors the players will do anything they can to succeed. This includes a fair distance from the LoS and always the same distance whenever possible...   TL;DR: It's allowed to use other distances, but it would be an unnecessary risk (and a lot of extra training work). That's why they don't do that."

second, third and home base before three men are put out to end the inning.
EXCEPTION: A run is not scored if the runner advances to home base during a
play in which the third out is made (1) by the batter-runner before he touches first
base; (2) by any runner being forced out; or (3) by a preceding runner who is
declared out because he failed to touch one of the bases. Since the batter-runner does not make it to first base safely, the run does not count. Similar to a force out."
How come the NFL is not allowed to play on Friday/Saturday,"If you look at Wikipedia under the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Broadcasting_Act_of_1961) which references Title 15, Chapter 32 of the United States Code (http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-32) which defines ""Telecasting of Professional Sports Contests"" in dealing broadcating TV.  Then to quote wikipedia  ""It also, in effect, protects high school football and college football game attendance by blacking out pro football games locally on Friday evenings and Saturdays during those sports' regular seasons; these measures effectively outlawed the broadcasting (and, in practice, the playing) of NFL games on those days, since virtually all of the country is within 75 miles of at least one high school game on every Friday night in September and October."""
What or who decides whether extra time is given in football?,"You have 2 kinds of ""extra time"" The first is a couple of minutes added to a half time because the match was delayed for various reasons. (injuries, subs, fouls, etc...). This one is called Stoppage time. The second is 2 additional half times of 15 minutes each (30 min total).
This extra time is only given when the match is a knockout phase and there is no winner yet. If there is still no winner after the extra time, the game proceeds in penalties. So, to answer the question:
Extra time can only be given by the referee at the end of a knockout phase when there is no winner (score is equal).
Teams can not ask for extra time. Ref: wikipedia"
Has the Lambeau Leap been banned at all NFL stadiums except Lambeau Field?,"In the early 2000s, the NFL felt that touchdown celebrations had gotten out of control, delaying the game and promoting unsportsmanlike behavior.  Some of the top ""offenders"" included Steve Smith (who ""diapered and wiped"" the football), Randy Moss (who mooned Packers fans at Lambeau) and Chad Johnson (who put on a hall of fame jacket and proposed to a cheerleader).  So in 2006, the NFL outlawed ""excessive celebration.""  Specifically, players were prohibited from any prolonged, excessive, or premeditated celebration, from using any type of prop while celebrating, from going to the ground during a celebration, and from engaging in a group celebration.   However, they clarified that the Lambeau Leap would still be allowed, as long as it was one player only that jumped.*  Essentially, the Leap was grandfathered in as a celebration.  The goal post dunk was also grandfathered in at the time, but in 2014 that was banned as well. The 2006 celebration ban was not popular with the players or fans.  And many players and fans were upset that the Packers were the only ones with a celebration that was still allowed, while their players were prohibited from celebrating. This year (2017), the NFL has made a rule change again; this time, it has relaxed the excessive celebration rules.  Players are now once again allowed to use the football as a prop, to celebrate on the ground, and to engage in group demonstrations.  Offensive or prolonged celebrations, or demonstrations directed at an opponent, are still against the rules and will result in a penalty. Before this year, it was debatable whether or not a Lambeau Leap-style celebration was within the rules at other stadiums.  Players have attempted it in other stadiums, and it is usually not flagged, as long as it follows all the other rules (no props, no groups).  With the new rule changes, a Lambeau Leap-style celebration should be allowed now in any stadium without question. * Interesting side story: Several years ago I attended the annual ""Packers Family Night"" pre-pre-season scrimmage at Lambeau Field.  Although it was strictly a practice scrimmage, there were referees there, treating it as if it was a real game (for their own practice).  Early in the scrimmage, the offense scored, and the entire offense team did a Lambeau Leap.  The refs, of course, threw the flag for excessive celebration."
Why don't pro squash players wear protective goggles?,"According to ""What do adult squash players think about protective eyewear?"" (by C. Finch, P. Vear): The major reason for not wearing protective eyewear was the perception
that it was unnecessary. Poor vision and a lack of comfort were also
  stated as reasons by a significant number of players. BBC article ""Squash players fail to protect eyes"" states as: [...] among those not wearing eye protection, over a third complained
  that it restricted their vision during play, and one in four said it
  was too uncomfortable, even though most had not actually tried it. Pro-players are being injured too. You may read SquashClub.org FAQ on ""Are eyeguards neccessary?"": Can you cite top players who have been injured? Jonathan Power was in top form and looked like winning his second
  World Open title in 2002. Up a game in the semifinal with David
  Palmer, he was hit in the eye with Palmer's racquet. Power did not
  suffer permanent damage, but he did not open his left eye for some
  weeks, and had to retire from the match. Alex Gough was up a game and beating John White in the 2006 Motor City
  Open Semifinal when White hit Gough in the eye with his racquet. ""Play
  was suspended for five minutes as Gough was treated...Gough's eye
  continued to ooze blood for the remainder of the match...The blow,
  coming late in the second game...cost him the point, and the momentum

  during a freak fit of anger, and Dugan's full vision did not return
  for three months. Will Carlin, former U.S. champion ranked as high as #60 in the world,
  received a detached and torn retina from a ball strike. He has since
  endured two long surgeries, $50k+ in medical expenses, extreme pain,
  nausea, anxiety and a flood of ""floaters."" He also lost two years from
  a promising professional squash career. Please read US National
  Champion, Will Carlin's story. Please also note that, according to the US Squash: The risk of eye injury in racquet sports such as squash is high

Is one Marathon per season more unhealthy than three Marathon per season?,"Last year I ran two ultras and four marathons, all quite slowly, all but one with negative splits, and it feels very good. I completed two marathons on two consecutive weekends, and enjoyed them both. Before that, I was trying to improve my speed, running 1-2 races per year, and that definitely was less healthy for me. I did not like tapering - last week before the race just felt terrible. I hated the recovery - I'd rather work out than rest because of sore muscles. So, for me trying to run one marathon per year with full effort was not healthy and not enjoyable at all. Running multiple ones with enjoyable speed, not hitting the wall ever, with negative splits, and no pain is a lot of fun. I am just staying in shape all the time, and enjoying a good scenic race whenever I feel like it. We are all different. What works for me might not work for others. I am not cut out for fast running: I do not look like a lean gazelle. On the other hand, having considerable muscles and thick and strong tendons allows me to run injury-free, even though it prevents me from running fast. I have lean friends who have real chances to qualify for Boston, (1-2 minutes short), but keep spending considerable time every year limping. They are much faster but more prone to injuries."
FIFA World Cup winners not qualifying automatically anymore for next edition,"The main reason is to have more spots open for qualification. In 2002, before the start of the qualification, three countries were already qualified. These countries being France (1998 champions), Japan and South-Korea (hosts). So, only 29 spots were available for approximately 200 countries.  Closely related, in the 2002 qualification there were 14,5 spots for European teams, of which one was already assigned to 1998 world cup winner France. This caused other European teams to have a smaller chance of qualifying for the world cup. So, after the rule change, a nation is not affected in its qualifying chances anymore when a fellow confederation member won the previous world cup. A minor reason could be to have the current world champion play more official matches."
Why does the US Open have a tiebreaker for the fifth set?,"Ah, the old debate about the 5th set tiebreaker. Some love it, some hate it. If you were to ask the players themselves, I think most would prefer the 5th set to end in a tiebreak so that you don't potentially end up with a 5th set score of something like 20-18 and play an extra 2 or 3 sets worth of games to decide the winner. Personally, I think it's better for fans and people watching matches to not have really prolonged matches that can become boring and lose interest from the fans. When it really comes down to it though - the real answer involves stuff like television and media scheduling. The US Open has had their ""Super Saturday"" thing for a long time - where the 2 men's semifinals are played along with the women's final on the second Saturday of the event. In order to make sure the matches conclude in a ""timely"" manner - the 5th set tiebreak is used to help make sure the men's semifinal matches don't go on for too long and mess up the schedule for the day. Seems like kind of a silly reason but, it is what it is. If you ask those involved in running the tournament (USTA) you usually get an answer like ""it's what makes the US Open unique"" or some other PR-scrubbed answer but in actuality it really just boils down to keeping the schedule running smoothly. Interestingly enough, the US Open introduced the 5th set tiebreak in 1970 - a few years before the other 3 majors switched to playing out the 5th set. Wimbledon's current 5th set rules were changed in 1979, The Australian Open's in 1971, and the French Open in 1973 - to what you see in use today by those events."
Football - Two injured players from the same team,"The referee will not require two players from the same team to leave the field if they collide and they need immediate attention (ie. are seriously injured). p. 73 - 74 of the 2013/14 FIFA Laws of the Game (abridged for clarity): The referee must adhere to the following procedure when dealing with injured
  players: ... ... ... Exceptions to this ruling are to be made only when:"
"Is a ""switch bowling"" action legal in cricket?","This would be a No-Ball as dictated by Law 21, No ball, of the Laws of Cricket 21.1 Mode of delivery 21.1.1 The umpire shall ascertain whether the bowler intends to bowl right handed or left handed, over or round the wicket, and shall so inform the striker. It is unfair if the bowler fails to notify the umpire of a change in his mode of delivery. In this case the umpire shall call and signal No ball. So the bowler has to tell the Umpire which arm they will use and which side of the wicket they will bowl from. The umpire then informs the batter. If the bowler wants to change the arm or side of the wicket they must inform the umpire first, who then relays this again to the batter."
Playing for another country,"As per the current rules set by ICC, a player is prohibited from representing one country if they have represented another ICC Member at Under 19 level or above, in an ICC sanctioned* match (Test matches, ODIs, ICC Global or regional event) in the immediately preceding four years. *ICC Sanctioned - This only includes the national Under 19 teams in the Under 19 World Cup or any direct qualifying competition for same and the full national side in Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals. In other words, it does not include under-19 matches played outside the framework of the World Cup, or any national sides outside the full first XI, such as A teams and the like. There have been a few players that have represented two countries over the years. List of players that have represented two nations in Test matches. List of players that have represented two nations in ODIs. List of players that have represented two nations in T20Is. Note: Nannes and Morgan represented 2 nations within the stipulated 4 years. This is because there is a clause stating that players are not disqualified from playing for any Test-playing nation if they are representing ICC Associate members. This allowed Nannes to quit Netherlands and play for Australia and for Morgan to quit Ireland and play for England. However, once a player plays for a Test-playing nation, they would need to wait to re-qualify (4 years) for any future appearances for associate members."
Why do some hockey players kneel as they take a shot?,"I asked my friend, who played hockey in college, and she said that it is a combination of a few things: I also found that it specifically allows a shot that is higher in the net with power; for example, this hockey tutorial shows how to do it.  They credit Brett Hull with popularizing it, and I can't say I know whether that's true or not (as my hockey watching days date to basically early Brett Hull but not before)."
"On an onside kick, what happens when a return man signals fair catch and is obstructed from reaching the ball?","Let me quote from the rule you have cited. Rule 10, Section 2, Article 1 of the NFL Rules: A Fair Catch is an unhindered catch of an airborne scrimmage kick that has crossed the line of scrimmage, or of an airborne free kick, by a player of the receiving team who has given a valid fair catch signal. The key word is ""airborne"". Once the kick has bounced, it is no longer considered airborne.  If the onside attempt is a ""pooch"" (short high kick), then even if no one signals for a fair catch the kicking team would be penalized if they interfered. By Section 1, Article 1, item 2: A receiver who is moving toward a kicked ball that is in flight has the right of way. If opponents obstruct his path to the ball, or cause a passive player of either team to obstruct his path, it is interference [...] Again, note the qualification ""in flight"". This is why most onside kickers attempt to either roll the ball along the ground or kick it down hard so that it bounces high. A high bouncing kick is ideal, since the bouncing is likely to slow it down enough that the kicking team can get into position and block the receivers. Note that ""airborne"" and ""in flight"" are not explicitly clarified anywhere in the NFL rules that I can find. A high bouncing kick could be construed as airborne by the dictionary definition; in fact, the NCAA has recently made exactly this decision: Also, receiving teams can call for a fair catch on onsides kicks that are driven directly into the ground but that don’t bounce a second time. The NFL has no such rule, though. The NFL Official Casebook clarifies the issue. A.R. 10.8 INVALID SIGNAL—KICKOFF HITS GROUND
  On an onside kick from the A35, A1 “tops” the ball causing it to go down into the ground and then bounce high in the air to the A46 where it comes down to waiting B1. B1 signals for a fair catch, but just before B1 catches the ball, A2 blocks him aside and the ball hits the ground and is recovered by B3 at the A45.
Ruling: B’s ball, first-and-10 on B49. Invalid fair-catch signal as the ball had hit the ground, so the action by A2 was legal. Spot enforcement. (hat tip wax eagle)"
Are there sports in which game theory is explicitly used?,"Game theory comes into play in American football play-calling.  To simplify the game, consider that the offense can run either a running play or a passing play.  The passing play generally has potential for more yards gained, but less chance of success than a running play.  The defense, on the other hand, also chooses a play that is either focused on stopping a running play or a passing play. The coach calling the offensive play needs to look at the situation the team is in and balance the risk and reward for each type of play.  The Normal-form game matrix might look something like this: Of course, the numbers in the matrix are just guesses based on how well the players on each team are playing, but coaches have something like this in mind when they are calling plays."
What are the national team choices for athletes in the U.K?,"So I had to dig up a bit on the regulations regarding the whole thing. So apparently while Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Englad being different countries, they are under the same international identity in the form of British passports. So that fact, together with the fact that there is no national team for the UK, means that any British citizen can play for any one of these four national teams.  That being the case, the football associations from these different nations have come to an agreement, together with FIFA, which is referred to as the ""home nations agreement"". According to the agreement a player is eligible for a national team for the nation he's born/lives in/has parents or grandparents from. In Gareth Bale's case, his grandmother is English, thus he was eligible for England but opted not to play for England but instead for Wales.  The residency clause was then removed in order to comply with FIFA regulations. Another clause was then added in 2008 to give eligibility for players that have gotten at least 5 year-long education before the age of 18, in any one of the four nations. This change aloows for example an English-born player who's been through education in Scotland to be eligible for both England and Scotland.  The interesting bit is of it all is that athletes from any other territory within Great Britain (who're eligible for a British passport) can choose to play for any one of the four nations (e.g. Matt Le Tissier, Graeme Le Saux, Owen Hargreaves).

What happens when a player loses a shoe during the course of the game?,"There is no rule I can find in the rules of basketball that says a player must remain shod (shoed?) during play of the game while the ball is live. Therefore, a player who loses a shoe must stay on the court until the next stoppage (timeout or foul call, usually). They are not allowed to leave the court to put the shoe back on (that's a technical foul for too few players on the court). They may move to the side and try to put their shoe on, or they may continue to be part of the play, but if you try running along a basketball court and then suddenly stopping or changing direction with a stocking foot you'll realize there's just no way, especially for a forward or center who has to maneuver in traffic. A shooting guard, maybe. What should happen is the player's team should get a stoppage of play; get hold of the ball, take a 20-second time out, let the guy put his shoe on or bench him. However, that doesn't always happen immediately: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4LM6OKzJqE http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2012/5/22/3037799/video-mike-miller-doesnt-need-a-shoe-to-play-basketball http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRd6welKAYI (IMO that should have been a technical)"
Advantages of 4-2-3-1 formation,"Well for one, you have the advantage of not being over run in midfield. For example, if you play 4-2-3-1 against a classic 4-4-2 then you have 3 central midfielders (2 defensive, middle of the attacking three) against the 2 central midfielders of the 4-4-2. Additionally, in a 4-2-3-1 the 2 defensive midfielders can concentrate on providing the defensive shield in front of the back 4, while converting defense into attack, yet not usually getting caught in highly advanced positions, thus leaving the team exposed on the counter. Think of players like Xabi Alonso and Sergio Busquets, who make a living out of playing these positions."
Why are there no left handed catchers in baseball?,"Well, there are a few downsides for left handed catchers, such as throwing out a base stealer at 3B, which would probably happen more often with a left handed catcher, but probably the biggest reason is pointed out in this quote I found in this ESPN.com article: Distefano offered two explanations. Bunts toward third base, he said, cause problems for left-handed catchers. In scampering to grab the ball, transferring it to their left hand and throwing to either first or second base, their bodies get closed and clumsy. Throws for right-handers are far more open and natural.
But the primary problem Distefano encountered was with plays at home. Because his glove was on his right hand, every accurate throw to the runner's side of the plate would have to be reached for backhanded, impeding a quick tag. And on outfielder throws up the first-base line, reaching out with his right hand would leave his throwing shoulder wide open to the runner. ""If there's going to be a bang-bang play, the left-handed catcher's going to get hurt,” he said."
Why don't basketballers take more long shots?,"First off, NBA teams (at least) do very frequently take 3 point shots.  The median team this year takes about 22 3 point shots per game, making about 35% of them, so around 23 points out of 100 in a game (per team) are scored by the 3 point basket. Second off, the three point shot is indeed becoming more important as teams realize it's an effective strategy statistically speaking.  Grantland frequently discusses this, as the stats tend to back more three pointers.   However, there are several issues with your assumptions.  Dunks are relatively uncommon in the NBA; while they're spectacular, they're not the point of most offensive systems.  Rather, layups or short range jumpers are the primary focus.  Inside shooters hit nearly 50% of their shots, and good players can hit more than that; a 50% 2 pointer versus a 33% 3 pointer are equivalent shots. Good (or at least frequent) three point shooters are generally guarded when they reach the three point arc.  The reason they're not guarded of course before that is they generally won't take a shot too far beyond the line; a few players regularly make shots from well beyond the arc, but most don't, and even 'regularly' means fewer than one per two games.   The NBA in fact considered adding a four point shot, although that hasn't gone anywhere in the past year.  Overall, most players simply aren't accurate much beyond the current arc, whether due to lack of practice or difficulty.   I don't know anything about Korfball personally, other than the basics behind what it is, so I couldn't say whether the reasons you're saying it 'should' be easy make sense.  I would note that basketball teams expect to score around 40 baskets per game plus free throws (penalty shots), each, so that's around double the scoring of korfball matches from what I can see.  Basketball is also a physical game - from what I've read korfball is not (in terms of players putting bodies on one another).   Defense makes a huge difference; having someone in your face while you're shooting makes it hard to make a shot, and if you don't believe a three pointer can be blocked, Vince Carter would like to have a word with you (in his early years, he was well known for blocking long-range shots, his first two years he averaged over a block per game as a guard, which is very unusual, and in fact was in the top 20 for blocks in 1998-1999.   It's also possible the ball itself is harder to shoot.  It's markedly heavier (650g vs 500g is a huge difference - nearly 1/3 heavier) and appears somewhat larger; it's also possibly different aerodynamically.  I've never shot either one, but I would suspect that NBA shooting guards are likely pretty close to as accurate as you can be for shooting a basketball; so if there is an accuracy difference, it's likely due to the nature of the game in some fashion.  (Otherwise I'd expect to see korfballers head over to the NBA and make millions...)"
Which coin is used for tossing?,"I am not sure about other international sports but this what I know about  Cricket - Which coin is used for tossing? I think the only requirement for the coin to be used in tossing will be it should have two sides heads and tails .Most of the links(like 1,2) address that the Host country's currency coin is used for toss but when it is tournament setup then the decision is with the ICC as for world cup 2011 there was a special coin. . The other one used for T20 world cup in West Indies  Is there any special coin for tossing in those international matches? Yes, as I have mentioned the decision is on the host country or the ICC in the case which type of tournament it is. Also you can refer to images I have added for the special coins used in two major tournaments of Cricket."
When is the new ball due for all forms of cricket?,"The Laws of Cricket say in Law 5: In a match of more than one day’s duration, the captain of the fielding side may demand a new ball after the prescribed number of overs has been bowled with the old one. The Governing Body for cricket in the country concerned shall decide the number of overs applicable in that country, which shall not be less than 75 overs. So in Twenty20 and one-day matches, there will generally not be a new ball in the Test Match sense. There is the rule that in ODIs, two new balls are used, one from each end, but they are never replaced by a new ball (unless damage occurs).  The previous rule was that the one ball is replaced after 34 overs, but with another used ball, not a new one, and this replacement was manadatory, not at the request of the fielding side, as in the law. In Test Matches, the law5 applies, and a new ball is available after 80 overs, per ICC playing conditions.  In English first-class cricket, the new ball is also available after 80 overs.  I haven't looked up all the other domestic first-class competitions, but the numbers are probably similar. You are not required to take the new ball.  You can use the old one as long as you like."
Why did baseball players start wearing gloves but cricket players not?,"Regarding 1.  Why didn't cricket players ever start wearing gloves?  I focused on why baseball players began to wear gloves, because it is a much more answerable question, and can be used to contrast with Cricket history to see what Baseball did and Cricket didn't.   A.G. Spalding, a premier baseball pitcher of the 19th century, a member of the first class of the Baseball Hall of Fame, and eventual founder of the Spalding sporting goods company, claims to have first seen a glove in baseball in 1875, on the hand of Charles C. Waite. Waite had a small flesh colored glove to protect his hand.  According to Spalding:  Therefore, I asked Waite about his glove. He confessed that he was a
  bit ashamed to wear it, but had it on to save his hand. He also
  admitted that he had chosen a color as inconspicuous as possible,
  because he didn't care to attract attention. He later added: If anyone wore a padded glove before this date I do not know it. It appears that Charles was certainly ridiculed for wearing a glove, and even took efforts to hide it. It is presumable that a Cricket player would receive the same treatment. Players who used them were viewed as weak. So why did it catch on? Spalding, one of the most popular players in the game, began to use one himself in 1877, and began to sell them from his catalogue: Still, it was not until 1877 that I overcame my scruples against
  joining the 'kid-glove aristocracy' by donning a glove. When I did at
  last decide to do so, I did not select a flesh-colored glove, but got
  a black one, and cut out as much of the back as possible to let the
  air in. Happily, in my case, the presence of a glove did not call out the
  ridicule that had greeted Waite. I had been playing so long and had
  become so well known that the innovation seemed rather to evoke
  sympathy than hilarity. It took a famous figure of Baseball, A.G. Spalding, to adopt the practice and sell gloves to make them more mainstream. Perhaps if a prominent cricketer adopted a glove, it would have caught on and silenced the ridicule. Regarding #2  Is fielding in baseball really more liable to lead to finger injuries than cricket fielding? I believe the answer to this question is yes. In baseball, the goal is roughly to hit the ball as hard as you can, every time you are up to bat. The MLB has recently been tracking average exit velocity. The games best hitters average 90+ mph (144kph!) hits every time they are up to bat. I believe it is a safe assumption that a harder hit ball would be more dangerous to catch and painful even if successfully and properly caught. In cricket, the batsmen, while certainly capable of hitting the ball with fantastic velocity, do not, because the strategy of the game rarely calls for it.  In cricket, a ball struck along the ground is considered safe, because you cannot be caught out.  Many balls in cricket are hit along the ground, with little velocity, making it simple and safe to pick up the ball. Occasionally the ball is hit with much greater velocity, whether on the ground or in the air, and these strikes require a great deal of defensive skill to catch for an out or to stop a boundary. In baseball, a ground ball results in an out ~75% of the time(look for ground ball BABIP). The strategy of baseball requires batters to hit the ball on line drives or in the air as often as possible. Hard ground balls are also more common, as a ground ball that does not leave the infield, similar to most dot balls in cricket, would result in a certain out.  Great skill is still required of baseball fielders, who have much less margin for error than a cricketer. A single misplayed ball may cost a team a run. In a game where each team averages between 4 and 5 runs per game, a single run can have a huge impact on the game. In cricket, a misplayed ball can sometimes result in a 4, or in very rare cases, a 6. But in a sport where the scores run up in the hundreds, an individual boundary will have less of an effect. In conclusion, due to three factors: Baseball adopted a glove for all fielders while Cricket did not"
Is there a rule for when K-Balls are used?,"There doesn't seem to be an explicit line in the rules for when to use them.  The only mention in the rulebook is in Rule 2: SECTION 2 - SUPPLY Each team will make 12 primary balls available for testing by the Referee two hours and 15 minutes prior to the starting time of the game to meet League requirements. The home team will also make 12 backup balls available for testing in all stadiums. In addition, the visitors, at their discretion, may bring 12 backup balls to be tested by the Referee for games held in outdoor stadiums. For all games, six new footballs, sealed in a special box and shipped by the manufacturer to the Referee, will be opened in the officials’ locker room two hours and 15 minutes prior to the starting time of the game. These balls are to be specially marked by the Referee and used exclusively for the kicking game. If a team were to line up in punt formation, and had a K-ball, and then shifted to a non-punt formation (or ran a fake punt), that would be legal, as far as I know.  I don't know if they can line up in non-punt formation, then change to a punt formation; my guess would be the presence of the punter is what triggers the K-ball being used, but it's just a guess. The more interesting question is, whether a team who knows they intend to fake can request a non-K ball (and can do so without being obvious to the defense).  That isn't clear in the rulebook, though I wouldn't be surprised if it were covered in the official's supplements (which aren't available online, I don't think)."
What will happen when the batsman or bowler gets injured in super-over?,"Appendix 7.5 of the IPL playing conditions states, Should any player (including the batsmen and bowler) be unable to continue to participate in the Super Over due to injury, illness or other wholly acceptable reasons, the relevant Laws and Playing Conditions as they apply in the main match shall also apply in the Super Over.  Bowling injury:  As per the normal playing conditions, the bowling captain can replace an injured bowler with another bowler of his choice. This would apply to the super-over as well and a new bowler will bowl the remaining balls of the  over. Batting injury:  In the super over, if one of the openers gets injured, then the third nominated batsman comes out to the middle.However, if one of the openers is already dismissed and if another batsman gets injured - it gets interesting.
According to the rules in the main match, if a team is 9 down and a batsman gets injured, the batting team will have to bring their innings to a closure as everyone else has been dismissed. Strange as it may sound, if the same rules apply to the super-over, if a nominated batsman has been dismissed and another injured, then the team forfeits the remaining balls in the over and they end up with the then prevalent score.

Does being good at table-tennis help when playing tennis,"you and I have a lot in common - playing both table tennis and regular tennis. My answer to this question (from years of observing the effects of playing both sports) is both yes and no. Some things are the same (and help across both sports) and some are different and don't help that much. The similarities: Balance - both require good balance and using your non-hitting hand to help you maintain your balance when having to reach for a shot. Hand-eye coordination - both require you to concentrate on, and keep your eye on, the ball. Recognizing spin - your ability to recognize what kind of spin your opponent puts on the ball helps in both sports. The differences: Stamina - high level tennis requires greater physical strength and stamina. You'll have to be in better shape and more fit to reach higher levels of the game. Stroke/Technique - This is most notable to me. In tennis, I need a much different kind of stroke (more loopy, different contact point, different follow through, etc.) in tennis than in table tennis. In table tennis I can get away with using more wrist to hit the ball and I need to apply much less effort into contacting the ball in table tennis. What I find if I am playing more tennis than table tennis is I hit a lot of shots past the end of the table in table tennis. Oppositely, I end up using too much wrist in my tennis strokes if I've been playing more table tennis. Game Pace - the back and forth action in table tennis is (on average) a lot faster than in tennis, so you have to be ready to hit your next shot much sooner in table tennis than in tennis and you sometimes adjust your strategy in table tennis to allow more time to recover for your next shot than you would in tennis (though sometimes the same strategy applies in tennis as well if you've been pulled far off the court)."
How is FIFA world cup schedule created?,"There are 32 teams in the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.  In order to get into the tournament, teams had to participate in regional preliminary qualifying tournaments.  Only Brazil, as the host country, received an automatic bid into the final tournament. (Source) These 32 teams are organized into 8 groups of 4, labelled A through H.  To decide which teams are in each group, first the top eight teams are seeded into the first position of each group.  (Brazil, as the host country, is automatically seeded as team A1.)  After these 8 teams are each put into separate groups, the rest of the teams are placed into the groups based on geography and random draw. (Source) The first stage of the tournament is called the Group Stage.  In this stage, each team plays the other three teams in their group.  That means that each of the 32 teams plays 3 matches, for a total of 6 matches in each group, and 48 matches in the entire group stage.  The Group Stage is scheduled for June 12-26, 2014. After the Group Stage is done, the teams in each group are ranked by their performance in their three matches, and the top two teams in each group go to the next stage of the tournament. These remaining 16 teams go into the Second Stage (or Knockout Stage), a single-elimination tournament.  The Second Stage begins on June 28, and the final match is scheduled for July 13, 19:00 UTC, in Rio De Janeiro."
Why were the Argentinian and Brazilian Leagues split in two parts?,"Actually, the Brazilian league is currently not split. It plays like a standard round-robin league where each team plays each of the others twice. The Argentinian league is split into two tournaments. The ""Torneo Initial"" runs from August to December and the ""Torneo Final"" from February to June. You can take this split literally, as basically it means that if it was a 'regular' European season, the first half would count as part of the torneo initial, while the second half of the matches would be part of the torneo final and thus in each tournament each team would play each other once. With all return fixtures part of the other ""Torneo"". In this case, the winners of both leagues play eachother to determine the overall winner. At the end of each season, the two teams with the worst three-year averages and the worst positioned team in the season table are relegated. Newly promoted teams only average the seasons since their last promotion."
Why are Formula 1 tracks usually oriented clockwise?,"Simply put, it's their age-old tradition.  In fact, many Europeans ask why North American race circuits are all but universally “anti-clockwise”. The origins of the various traditions are seemingly complex, and certainly debatable, but as I understand it late 1700s American horse racing power brokers purposefully created a US standard of left-turn-only racing, in defiance to England's centuries long right-hand standard.  Then later America doubled-down and did the same exact thing with field and track.  Olympic standards went back and forth in the early days of the modern Olympic era, but world pressure to standardize one way or the other happened to fall in a pro-American era, and basically the world adopted the American left-only standard for track and field – as I understand it - and this in turn influenced just about every other 'rotational sport', if you will. Then later still, America adopted the German left-side automobile standard, and roadways, and this led to the natural adoption of left-hand race circuits here, and I believe that bit is actually well documented – why left-hand wheeled cars race turning mostly left. All the while right handed race circuits never lost hold in Europe, from a time before automobiles. Germans invented automobiles as we know them, and the French invented the Grand Prix format, so one would think they would have also went with left-handed race circuits (both F1 and MotoGP - and all their precursors), but apparently they stuck with the old-school right hand turn standard, which was helped considerably by the fact that certain infrastructure was already built. (Note: A Brit will no doubt summarize this all quite different: ~“Brits invented the standards in motorsport that all of Europe now uses.” : ) But Romans used a sun dial.  A post sticking up in the Northern hemisphere, as the sun moves across the sky East to West, the shadow moves “clockwise” around the dial. (So basically I have no idea what I'm talking about, but your question hasn't been answered so I'm giving it a go with this ""straw man"" post.) I'm going with “it's simply their age-old tradition”., and you fill in the blanks as to why that is."
How come Belgium and even Switzerland are atop of Holland on FifaRankings for WorldCup 2014?,"One key thing to keep in mind is that the FIFA ranking does not indicate how strong a team is but how well they have done.  As the ranking procedure indicates, it only uses results of past games to give a score. Citing results from 2010 is also slightly misleading since those results are divided by 5 (20%), where results from 2013 are worth significantly more. Netherlands played a lot of games that were outside of the three bullet points you've mentioned. Those friendlies made all the difference.  FIFA shows all the games Netherlands have played here.
You will see draws to Portugal, Estonia, Germany, Japan, Colombia, Italy.  Some of these were before the draw took place and ended up costing them a seed. That being said...it was very close and could have changed even in the last 2 games of qualifying."
Table Tennis exercises by yourself and without a table?,"One article discussed various solo table tennis training drills. Topics included: Each topic had several practical pointers and tips. One table tennis forum post dealt with this question and had two suggestions: Regarding the return board, one poster noted: return boards have proper rubber on them, and can actually help you,
  unlike folding the table up These resources suggest that there's a wide range of drills that one can do without purchasing any equipment - at minimum shadow play and footwork drills can be done without any equipment. At the high end, buying a robot or doing video analysis can be costly, but can provide good returns if solo practice is very important."
Do teams announce their exact formations before a match?,"It really depends on the manager. In Belgium I've seen managers give their full line up including exact positions in pregame interviews, while in other games they would even leave a spot open until right before kick off.  So,  sometimes they know it exactly. Other times they may have to make an educated guess.  When TV broadcasters show the team they already know the eleven/twenty-two names and their analysts need all they need to know most of the time. Even most supporters will put the eleven names in the right position if given.  For most games,  most teams do not change their basic tactic too much. A team that has played 4-4-2 for their whole season would for instance not switch to 5-4-1 suddenly. If such change was in the cards,  the analysts would also know. It's their job. The manager might also just say defender X will play in midfield today. It's not that uncommon in case of injuries etc.. There's not always need for secrecy. He'll just say it in most cases in a pregame interview.  "
How are the uniform colours determined in the World Cup?,"This is regulated by FIFA. They require that each team provides two kits for the outfield players, and three for the goalkeeper, and submits them to FIFA before the tournament starts. The process is described in this FIFA document 35.2 Each team shall inform FIFA of two different and contrasting colours
  (one predominately dark and one predominately light kit) for its 
  official and reserve team kit (shirt, shorts and socks). In addition, each
  team shall select three contrasting colours for the goalkeepers. As you state, most teams have traditional colours for the official kit, and FIFA requires that this is worn by both teams if the colours are different enough. If the colours could cause confusion, then one team must wear the reserve kit, and this is usually team B in the official schedule, unless FIFA decides otherwise. 35.5
  FIFA will inform the teams of the colours that they shall wear for
  each match. As far as possible, each team shall wear its official
  colours as declared on the official team colour form. If the two
  teams’ colours and the match officials’ colour might cause confusion,
  in principle, team A in the official match schedule shall be entitled
  to wear its official team kit and team B shall use its reserve team
  kit or, if necessary, both teams may have to wear a combination of
  their official and reserve team kits. FIFA will endeavour to ensure that each team
  wears its official team kit at least once during the group stage. I assume that FIFA also decide which of the three goalkeeper's kits is to be worn, but couldn't find a quote. The referee's kit is supplied by FIFA, and I assume that they made enough colors available to avoid confusion, then picked the best kit for the match based on what the players are wearing. The match officials shall receive their official refereeing kit and
  equipment from FIFA. They shall wear and use only this kit and
  equipment on matchdays."

Differences between NBA and European/FIBA/Olympic basketball rules,"There are a lot more differences than I will state, but these are the major differences between NBA and FIBA Basketball Game Rules: Time-outs In the NBA, there are two types of time-outs: 100 (60)-second ones and
  20-second ones. Each team is allowed to benefit from up to six
  time-outs during regulation play (four quarters), but no more than
  three in the fourth period. They are allowed one 20-second time-out in
  every half and one in each overtime. The timeout can be requested by a
  head coach or by a player in control of the ball. If neither of the
  teams requests any timeouts during a period, the game officials have
  to call a number of mandatory timeouts, mainly for commercial reasons. In FIBA regulations, teams are allowed to benefit from two time-outs
  in the first half, three in the second half, and one in each overtime.
  Every time-out is one minute long, except for occasional TV time-outs,
  which may or may not be included by the organizer of the game. If the
  organizer wishes, they may include one TV time-out per quarter (none
  in overtimes), with a length of 60 to 100 seconds, but this is in no
  way mandatory. In fact, these are rarely applied. Regular
  (non-commercial) time-outs may only be requested by coaches (not by
  players) and may only be granted when the ball is dead. Game Spirit It is not only the strict letter of regulations that referees have to
  consider when officiating. There is also the so-called ‘spirit of the
  game’, which allows referees and officials to give different meanings
  to rules in cases which are not completely specified in the
  regulation. This too, is different. The best example for this is when
  they will not call a traveling violation against a player on a fast
  break, even though he has taken three steps without dribbling, on
  lay-up; but they will allow him to go on ahead and score his goal if
  no defender has any chance of reaching him, in order to make the game
  dynamic and entertaining. This will often happen in the NBA but not in
  FIBA-officiated games. Needless to say, the differences are much more detailed and would take hundreds of pages to be explained thoroughly. But it is interesting to think about NBA players who are used to their home rules, having to play in FIBA-governed championships. And, vice versa, even though that is much rarer.

Declining a delay-of-game penalty: what about an infinite loop?,"At every level of football there are (sportsmanship) forfeit rules in place for teams that try to create an infinite loop of events.  Sometimes these things are done with the most malicious expectations.  An example is a team is losing, so they have their offensive line jump and hit d-line.  Over and over.  Even if the defense accepts these penalties a referee can deem the situation unsportsmanlike and simply warn the offense.  After three such times (if that) any crew I worked on would go over to the coach and warn them about their unsportsmanlike behavior and possible forfeit.  If it happened on next play an ultimatum would be issued and then after that game would be forfeited.   I don't think this would ever happen at the major college or NFL level because coaches and teams may face harsh harsh penalties/suspensions.  They have the same level of rules which generally allows referees to make the decisions upon discretion.  This is a two-sided sword since a referee that ever made this decision would also be under as much scrutiny.   A real world example I have personally been involved with was a late game situation.  There was 10 seconds on the clock and team had first and goal at the 1 with two timeouts.  The defense stacked the line and jumped offsides 4 times in a row.  Two of the times they barely jumped off, play ran, and during those plays 6 seconds came off the clock.  On the third time I went and warned the defensive head coach that if his team kept jumping then I would award the offense the touchdown.   So on the 4th time we awarded offense a touchdown.  This almost caused a riot.   This was 15+ years ago and I was a young ref doing a big high school game.  Today we would have gone the forfeit route but at the time awarding touchdown was the way to go.   Now offense goes up by 4 after XP try is good.  We access 15 yard penalty against defensive team on the kickoff because we flagged the head coach and every assistant they had.   Offensive team muffs the kickoff (4 seconds left), damn them.  The kids at this point haven't played a snap other than XP in 45 minutes.  Returner breaks through and takes it to the house...  but there was a holding flag so game over.  I watched the tape and there was a holding on the play which was about 40 yards from the referee that threw it and on the other side of the field.   I hate in any sport where referees determine winner and for the most part you should never remember the refs but I am thankful years later that the elder of the crew did the ""right"" thing.   Note:  Rule 12, Section 3 would cover this in the NFL.  In the NCAA Rules 9-2-3-b and -c and really the entire forward of the rulebook. Some excerpts:  The rules committee reminds head coaches of their responsibility for
  the behavior of their players before and after, as well as during, the
  game. Players must be cautioned against pre-game unsportsmanlike
  conduct on the field that can lead to confrontation between the teams.
  Such action can lead to penalties enforced on the opening kickoff,
  possibly including disqualification of players. Repeated occurrence of
  such unsportsmanlike behavior by a team may result in punitive action
  by the conference against the head coach and his institution Disqualified Players ARTICLE 6. a. Any player or identified squad
  member in uniform who commits two unsportsmanlike conduct fouls in the
  same game shall be disqualified. b. A player disqualified from the
  game must leave the playing enclosure under team supervision within a
  reasonable amount of time after his disqualification. He must remain
  out of view of the field of play under team supervision for the
  duration of the game"
Skip a media timeout in NCAA basketball?,"I am unaware of any game in which this actually happened, but this is my interpretation of the rules: By rule 5, section 13, the media timeouts take place ""at the first dead ball"" after the 16, 12, 8, and 4-minute marks (or 15, 10, and 5-minute marks, depending on the agreement, but this is rare). By rule 6, section 5: The ball shall become dead or remain dead when:
  [...]
  e. Time expires for a half or extra period. Therefore, if there were no stoppages of play in the last four minutes, there would be a media timeout immediately preceding halftime. This would be consistent with other timeout rules; it is, in fact, legal to call a timeout during halftime or between the second half and overtime (though two successive timeouts cannot be called during such break periods; see Approved Ruling 161 in the 2012 Case Book). As a side note, if there were no stoppages in play between the 9:00 and 3:30 mark and a player is fouled in the act of shooting, the 8 minute timeout would occur before the first free throw and the 4 minute timeout would occur at the next dead ball, which is before the second free throw (AR 159)."
Why do teams reveal injuries?,"@ThomasDB is quite right in his comment. It would be difficult to hide, with the modern technology and the press being on top of literally everything.  That doesn't mean the coaches have to be 100% honest or don't have the wiggle-room in press conferences.  For example, Mourinho is quite famous for ""overestimating"" injuries to his key players, only to figure out later that the player could play just fine (Diego Costa, anyone?). He's far from being the only manager who does tricks like that but perhaps one of the most famous. The main advantage is that you can mess with the opponent managers tactical plans/preparations. The opposite scenario is also quite common. A key player gets injured in a game, the press asks how serious it is, and the manager might downplay the injury even if he knows that the player might be out for a month or two.  Practically what a manager says about the injuries at the pre-/post-game conferences is not binding in any way, and practically all is fair in this type of mindgame ""warfare"".  So to answer the OP, why say anything at all? Mind-games! To mess with the morale or tactics of the opponents.  It could also be a matter of man management for his own squad, for instance: i) to cheer up/support the injured player, or ii) to give confidence to a replacement player... "
Why do female footballers play a higher number of international matches compared to a male footballer?,"There are more international competitions for female national teams.
For example the Algarve-Cup, the 4-nations-tournament and the Cyprus Cup. Most male national teams just playing the World Cup, the continental Cup, the Confed-Cup and the qualifications for them. Often less games in league: It's possible to play these additional tournaments, because their schedules are less close than the male ones. For example the german league (one of the best female leagues) only contains 12 teams (18 in the male league) and they play each team two times (22 matches, 34 for males). So the females have 12 games less in league.
Also in Norway: 12 female teams, 16 male teams. In addition there is no U21 team for females. In german amateur division the eldest class is A (U19/U18). There's no A (U19/U18) for females, they play in the adults team after B (U17/U16). An additional factor might be that there are much more ""new"" teams in male competitions, than in the female competitions. (A reason why player of ""lesser"" teams have more games could be, that in ""lesser"" continental associations are more competitions (eaven for males) and players of ""big"" clubs wont participate at nonrelevant competitions.)"
Does MLB Rule 7.13(2) (on blocking the plate) apply to players other than the catcher?,"Both of the links that I have found that talk about the call believe the rule is applied to position players too.  Part 2 does not state anything about players besides catchers, so I wouldn't necessarily come to this conclusion.  During the broadcast on Fox Sports 1, a rules official did clarify that if the pitcher was blocking the plate, part 2 of Rule 7.13 would apply. It will be interesting to see where this rule goes, there has already been a lot of grey area exposed, and some of it has been clarified. Here are the links I could find that explicitly talk about Rule 7.13: MLB.com SB Nation"
What determines a double hit in volleyball?,"Normally, if a player touches the ball with two different parts of the body in succession (not simultaneously), it is a Double Contact fault.  However, the block and the first team hit are exceptions to this.  During the block and during the first hit, a player can contact the ball more than once, as long as the contacts are all part of one action. From FIVB Official Volleyball Rules 2013-2016: 9.2.3 The ball may touch various parts of the body, provided that the contacts 
  take place simultaneously.
  Exceptions:
  9.2.3.1 at blocking, consecutive contacts may be made by one or more player(s), 
  provided that the contacts occur during one action;
  9.2.3.2 at the first hit of the team, the ball may contact various parts of the 
  body consecutively, provided that the contacts occur during one 
  action."
"Origin of the term ""Heavy Ball""?","I found some link for you which is here This is only the term which is used as a ""Heavy Ball"", but there is no heavy or light. Only the effort of bowler makes this. Bowlers who bowl the heavy ball hit the deck lot harder than average bowlers. Michael Kasprowicz, Andrew Flintoff, and Andrew Caddick are good examples of such bowlers. While there are bowlers who skid the bowl through quicker than others. Lasith Malinga is one such bowler. Some bowlers are quicker through the air and these are ones who are mostly called tearaway or genuine fast bowlers like Shoaib Akhtar, Brett Lee and Waqar Younis."
Why don't more NBA teams use the triangle offense?,"This article by Chuck Klosterman does a good job of explaining why.  Here are some of the highlights: Phil Jackson's explanation (in 2012 mind you) - ""When asked why the Triangle is disappearing, Jackson suggested that it’s a hard offense for an impatient person to teach to modern athletes: “The problem with the Triangle is that you have to teach the most basic, basic skills: Footwork. Where you stand on the floor. And if you have the kind of player who wants to attack and score every time he touches the ball, he will hurt this offense.” In general, Jackson sees the league imprudently moving away from post-oriented sets: “The game is evolving into a 3-point shooting game. You can’t win a championship with a European offense"" ""The strength of the offense is that all five players are interchangeable and that anyone on the floor can occupy the post (assuming that player has the best post matchup)."" The emergence of the Golden State Warriors disproves that you can't win with heavy emphasis on 3-point shooting. It should be noted that the coach of the Warriors, Steve Kerr played under Phil Jackson, understands the triangle very well but also realizes the limitations the offense given its reliance on post-up players and long to mid-range two point shots as described below. In a separate article the emergence of advanced analytics, which uses math to optimize playing styles based on the expected outcome of various actions, greatly discounts the value of the mid-range jump shot.  In short players should mostly take 3-point shots (because the payoff is 50% higher than a 2-pointer) or very high shooting percentage 2-point shots like dunks and layups. From this article: ""On the other side, one of the biggest skeptics of analytics is the Zen Master, Phil Jackson... This also comes to the defense of his famous Triangle Offense which is predicated on ball movement and dominated with midrange jumpers: a shot that Daryl Morey will cut you immediately if you dare take such an inefficient shot."" Daryl Morey is the General Manager of the Houston Rockets - a team that pioneered the use of 3-point or dunks style analytically driven basketball."
Why can't modern starting pitchers consistently pitch on 2-3 days rest?,"The major reason players pitch on four days rest is that they are better pitchers when they do so.  They are able to throw harder, throw more pitches, and throw more difficult pitches (with more spin/etc.) than they would if they had less rest.  They are also less prone to injury. Some evidence exists that pitching on three days rest in the postseason (where it's somewhat common); for example, this article at BleacherReport finds pitchers pitching on three days rest (who are usually the ace or #2 pitcher of a team) have a 4.48 ERA and win less than 40% of the games they pitch.  Some of this may be pitchers being unused to pitching in those circumstances (and pitching against fairly good teams, it being the postseason); but it does seem logical that pitching on short rest is somewhat harder. The other major factor is the fact that for most teams, the fifth starter isn't all that much worse than the fourth starter.  While a few teams might have four great starters and then a poor fifth starters (the 2014 Tigers post-Price trade for example), the large amount of starting talent plus the ability to use multiple relievers means you wouldn't lose much by starting that fifth starter, particularly if it allows you to have better performances on the other four days.   If the question is what's the difference between then and now, you'll probably find that the major difference is in modern strength techniques allowing pitchers to throw that much harder; this both increases the number of pitchers who can competently pitch, and increases the benefit from rest - I'd rather have my starter hit 94 on most of his pitches every fifth day, rather than throw at 92 every fourth day. The other issue with this is the premise of the question - namely, that the four man rotation was very common 20-30 years ago.  This is simply untrue. Reading SABR's Origins of the Pitching Rotation by Frank Vaccaro, the 5 man rotation existed in the 1930s, and even in the 1930s was the most common kind of rotation.  See the chart (unfortunately very low DPI) in that article; by 1935 more teams pitched with a five man rotation than a four man rotation.  If I have some time (maybe on the train home) I'll download the retrosheet data he used and make a better chart. In the 1970s, you typically had 20-30 pitchers who started at least 36 games (a true four man rotation would start 40).  Given every pitcher on a team would start that many games in a true four man rotation, that means a whopping 8 to 10 teams may have had four man rotations; the rest likely had five man rotations.  If you up the number of games started to 40 (again, the true four man rotation), you are in the teens or less in the 1970s - so maybe a handful of teams had a true four man rotation. Many teams had modified 4 man - 4 day rest rotations during this period, where a team had four starters and used a fifth periodically when needed to keep them on four day rest.  This often led to #1 pitchers having 36-37 starts, so 3 or 4 more starts than the true 5 man rotation (33).  To some extent this fell out of style finally in the late 1980s and 1990s, where Bobby Cox and Joe Torre used true 5 man rotations with great success; while it seems like you might as well keep your aces on 5 days rest, it may be that an occasional sixth day is helpful for their rest, and/or keeping the 5th man on a regular rotation is better than having him only pitch every 10-20 days.  (It also may be largely irrelevant, who knows.) Either way, anyone arguing that ""most teams had four man rotations in the 1970s"" is misremembering, probably thanks to folks in the 1970s and 1980s misremembering themselves.  "
Athletes who have competed in the Olympics for more than one country [closed],"I recall Merlene Ottey, who represented Jamaica (1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996 and 2000) and Slovenia (2004). She obtained 9 medals representing Jamaica: 3 silver and 6 bronze. I also recall the cross-country skier Johann Mühlegg, who competed in the 1992, 1994 and 1998 Winter Olympics representing Germany and the 2002 Winter Olympics representing Spain (he got medals, but was later on disqualified after testing positive on drugs). For a comprehensive list, you can check the List of nationality transfers in sport list in Wikipedia. It is astonishing long!"
Which Marathons to run? [closed],"Having done 37 marathons I can say some are definitely nicer than others.  Rating them is an impossible task. I do recommend NYC at least once.  I have guided disabled athletes 4 times now at NYC (run it 5 times myself) and doing it as a guide is a very different perspective and an amazing experience.  (Thus I can say I have run across the Verezanno Narrows bridge with 40,000 other people, and as a group of 50 people on the early start for disabled athletes.  Both ways are awesome!) For example Salt Lake City is in July, starts on a mountain top at 5:30AM (start was 55F, finish was 110F) and has tons of downhill, however most of it is outside the city in the mountains and was beautiful.  Chicago is still easy to get into, and is a great big city marathon.  There is something unique about 40,000 people starting with you.  (I have done NYC 9 times, and Chicago once).   Cincinnati is a smaller race, but has great crowd support and a very bizarre pig theme that is probably taken a smidgen too far. Often the race directors try to get the course through interesting areas.  In St Louis they run through the Budweiser factory which is sort of clever.  On the other hand, Mississauga marathon, a city outside Toronto is pretty boring, and I have done it twice, but would probably not do it again.  Not much in terms of sights. As is London, Ontario (Forest City marathon, also done it twice, so I clearly ignore my own advice).   Atlanta was nice but nothing special.   I have a friend who did all seven continents and she greatly enjoyed all of them.  If you can get to the point where a marathon is 'fun', then you are most of the way there.   There are so many races all over the world, pretty much every weekend, that you can travel where ever you like to do a race. "
"Is ""What happens on the pitch stays on the pitch"" appropriate sporting behavior?","My question is: is it okay to be overly passionate/borderline aggressive when on the pitch playing a team sport without it carrying over to off the pitch interactions? Simple answer: Unless everybody on the team thinks that's okay (or they are paid to accept it), that's simply not okay. Being on the pitch reveals the worst of a person's character. In your case that's apparently ""borderline aggressive"" behavior. Clearly there is somebody on the team who isn't simply accepting/ignoring that behavior, so now it's up to you how you want to handle this. Sportsmanship - named after sports itself - is all about one upping normal daily behavior. During normal interactions shouting abusively isn't accepted, so on the pitch you should one-up that. Yes, you will be under stress and it can be hard, but sports is typically about a whole lot more than just winning. Honestly, there are a lot of bad role models in sports. We often see professional coaches losing their cool on TV. We have all heard about abusive high school coaches. So in that sense it's not surprising that such behavior will feel acceptable, especially if you had such a coach at some point. The simple reality however, is that outside of very 'serious' contexts this behavior is simply considered abusive. If it's not okay in the office, nor in the bar, why would it be acceptable on the pitch?  Outside of sports a lot of research has been done into this type of leadership and it turns out that all it does is demotivate the large majority of people causing most companies with such leadership do well short term and then burn up quickly and completely.  If your goal is to win, think about what will motivate each individual player. Maybe there are players who will get motivated by being shouted at and actually enjoy it (who knows, there are a lot of weird kinks out there and shouting at each other might get the adrenaline flowing), but for most there are different far better ways to motivate them."
How many football teams have won the treble?,"If instead of ""European Championship"" you mean the continental championship of the continent where the team is located (since it is not possible for any team outside of Europe to win the European championship) then the answer is:"
Nationalised players scoring against their country of birth,"This Footytube forum discussion mentions several players (most French) from other countries: Zidane (Algeria), Desailly (Ghana), Vieira (Senegal), that went on to not play for their country of birth. The decision by Algeria to not accept Zidane because he was too slow sure turned out to be a poor decision, 'eh? One other that comes to mind is Dani Osvaldo, who plays for Italy but was born in Argentina (a common relationship for the two countries). The aforementioned Kevin-Prince (Germany) plays for Ghana and played against Germany. Unfortunately, none of these players have scored against their countries of birth as far as I can see scanning their International Goals, but the chances are high that each played against their country of birth (all three French players have many, many caps for Les Bleus) Players who play against their national team: David Trezeguet (Argentina): at least played a game against Argentine (playing for france). Guillermo Franco (Argentina): Plays for Mexico, and plays at least two times against argentina. One he didn't enter the field, and the other he enter as a substitute. The two matches where on world cup (2006 and 2010) Player who didn't play against his national team: Alfredo Di Stefano (Argentina): I can't find any reference if he plays a match vs Argentina when he was playing for Spain. Camoranesi (Argentina):  didn't play against Argentina, when he was playing for Italy. After looking at this list of players who have switched nationalities in football I saw that Mathias Fernadez represented Chile despite being Argentinian. In a game in 2011 he scored vs Argentina. He does however consider himself Chilean having left Argentina aged 4."
Why are tennis players so bad at serving?,"The strategy is indeed deliberate and it comes from a risk/reward evaluation. Keep in mind that the goal of each serve is not simply to have it be in, but to win a point.  Just as the server has been practicing the serve their whole life, the other person has practiced returning serves their whole life.  Pro tennis players are good enough, I'm sure, to get practically every serve in; but when that's the goal, the risk becomes having easily returnable serves wherein the opponent gets the upper hand.  You could look at first serves as the server pushing the boundaries--they want to maximize the possible reward of an ace or a poorly returned serve and in doing so they risk a lower success rates.  On second serves, less of a chance is taken, they knowingly reduce the effectiveness (reward) of the serve in order to minimize the risk (double fault and giving up point).  It's not that they can't control their serve, it's just that they're aiming for the very best serve they're capable of. You could liken it to a professional soccer player taking a penalty kick.  Sometimes the kick ends up sailing over the goal or to one of the sides.  It's not because the player isn't any good--they could hit the ball into the net 100% of the time practicing by themself--but the fact that a goalie is trying to stop him causes the player to push the limits of his skill and sometimes fail at it."
How can I prevent football/soccer net theft?,"In general, the ""anti-vandal"" or ""anti-theft"" refers to the goal frames themselves, rather than the nets; there's very little you can do if someone is actually out to vandalise the net with a big pair of scissors or equivalent. The simplest solution by far is just to put the nets up when you need them - this then just becomes a question of whether it is more cost effective to replace the nets when they are stolen or have your staff time spent putting up and taking down the nets every time they are needed."
"During a race, how often should I drink water?","Hydration when racing has a lot of variables, all of which need to be taken into consideration for longer races - which I would say is anything longer than a 10k: First - try to do a sweat test in an environment as close as you can to the race, and get a good idea of what you generally need, and then consider the other variables. At the end of a race you will almost never hear people saying ""oh dang, I drank too much"", but go by the medical tent after a marathon, and you will see racks of people wishing they had taken hydration more seriously."
Is it possible for an NFL team to go 20-0?,"It is not.  This is because of the regular reason scheduling: Each team plays 16 games. 6 games are in their own division (3 teams, each twice). 4 games are against a division in the other conference. 4 games are against a division in their own conference. 2 remaining games are against the other 2 divisions in their conference based on final standings from the year before. There are 4 divisions in each conference. So when the inter-conference divisions play each other, there can be a maximum of 2 undefeated teams in a conference.  This also (obviously) means they didn't play each other in the 2 remaining games. As an add on, there could be a total of 4 undefeated regular season teams in one year.  2 in each conference."
If a player loses his footwear while scoring a goal will it be considered a legal goal?,"There is a law regarding such situation: See IFAB Law 4 - The players' equipment: A player whose footwear or shinguard is lost accidentally must replace it as soon as possible and no later than when the ball next goes out of play; if before doing so the player plays the ball and/or scores a goal, the goal is awarded."
How do you make 100 free throws in a row?,"I can give some advice as to what I did to improve my free throws and how that may help in your quest for 100 consecutive. 
Just to give you a measure, I left high school shooting 27% from the free throw line. Yes, you read correctly, 27%. I'm 6'5"" and played center while in high school. After being recruited, my future college coach told me that if I wanted to play my freshman year I needed to get that above 65%. By the time my freshman season started I was shooting 84% (from preseason averages) and would regularly shoot over 90% when shooting 100 FT at the end of practice. My method: So how will this help with consecutive FT makes? Muscle memory and stamina. I'm out of college now and haven't practice free throws in god knows how long yet I continue to shoot a high percentage whenever I play any sort of league. After reading your post (yesterday) I went to the gym and shot 100 FTs to see how I would fare: 92/100. I didn't keep track of how many in a row (I missed my first 3) but I'm fairly certain I was over 40 in a row before my last miss which ironically enough was at the hundredth FT (lack of focus I guess)."
"Is a goal scored if the goalkeeper, but not the ball, enters the goal?","No goal. This is a basic rule of football: it's the position of the ball that matters, not the players. Specifically quoting from the Laws of the Game, Law 10 - The Method of Scoring (page 35): A goal is scored when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, between
  the goalposts and under the crossbar (my emphasis). In your example, the whole of the ball has not crossed the goal line, so no goal is scored."
How can an American football team tie with another team?,"In the NFL, if the score is tied at the end of the fourth quarter, the game goes into overtime (OT).   The current overtime rules follow a modified sudden death format.  In this format, the first team to score wins the game, unless a field goal is scored on the first possession of overtime.  In that event, the team that did not score is allowed one possession to try to score. Overtime is a 10-minute period.  (Before 2017, overtime was 15 minutes.) During the regular season, if the entire 10-minute overtime period is played and the teams are still tied, the game ends in a tie. During the playoffs, however, tie games are not allowed.  If the overtime period ends with no result, another overtime period is begun, and the game will continue until there is a winner.

Incomplete stage in Tour de France,"No, the cyclists are not allowed to get back on the bike for the next stage if they do not finish. This has as a consequence that the cyclists continue with very heavy injuries just after a crash, because they hope that tomorrow will be better. (For example, Dutch cyclist Wout Poels, continued racing for 10km after Fridays huge crash, but is now still in the intensive care in a French hospital with torn spleen and kidney and three broken bones in his chest) Also, I found this article ( http://www.uci.ch/includes/asp/getTarget.asp?type=FILE&id=34028 ) on the UCI website. 2.6.026 A rider dropping out of the race may not compete in any other cycling events for the duration of the
  stage race that he abandoned, on pain of a 15 day suspension and a fine of CHF 200 to 1,000.
  After consulting the event directors and the president of the commissaires panel, the UCI may, how-
  ever, grant exceptions at the request of a rider and with the agreement of his sports director."
Can the captain change players' positions without permission from a coach or manager?,"Other than the goalkeeper, there are no positions defined in the Laws of the Game, so nobody needs ""permission"" from anybody play anywhere on the pitch. The captain, or anyone else on the team for that matter, can tell anyone to move into any position at all. Whether they'll be listened to our not is a different question of course, and that's down to the relationship between the manager, the captain and everybody else."
Is it a foul if no contact is made during an attempted reckless tackle?,"Law 12 (here) point you in the right direction about this:  Group of Six: Anyway, referee has the option to allow the play to continue, and when the play stops, take a disciplinary measure (like a yellow or red card). Remember that everything that happens in play, is judged by the referee. The rule clearly states about the attempts, so missing the tackle could be interpreted by the referee as a foul."
What makes US Open golf courses difficult?,"The US Open is a major golf championship, the second during a given calendar year, that commences in mid-June. It is dubbed ""Golf's Toughest Test,"" and for great reason. The USGA, the organization that stages the US Open, sets up its golf courses as a rigorous test to challenge a golfer's shot-making ability, course management, and composure under pressure.  The USGA considers the following factors in setting up US Open golf courses: Length, variation and playing characteristics of individual holes; Length of overall golf course relative to total par; Teeing ground locations (i.e., angles of play, variation of distance day to day); Fairway width and contours; Fairway firmness and speed; Green speed relative to percentage slopes and contours of the putting greens; Putting green firmness; Rough height, density and stages of severity; Bunker preparation (i.e., create challenge of recovery); Green surrounds (e.g., closely mown areas vs. primary rough); Hole locations (relative difficulty, balance in location of left vs. right, front vs. back of green, anticipated wind, anticipated
  length of approach shot); Risk and reward options; Anticipated weather conditions; Pace of Play An example in relation to the Olympic Club, the USGA added a bunker on the 17th hole to ""complicate the 'lay-up' shot and encourage players to go for the green in two.""(1) Wikipedia's description of the US Open: The U.S. Open is staged at a variety of courses, set up in such a way
  that scoring is very difficult with a premium placed on accurate
  driving. U.S. Open play is characterized by tight scoring at or around
  par by the leaders, with the winner usually emerging at around even
  par. A U.S. Open course is seldom beaten severely, and there have been
  many over-par wins (in part because par is usually set at 70 except
  for the very longest courses). Normally, an Open course is quite long
  and will have a high cut of primary rough (termed ""Open rough"" by the
  American press and fans), undulating greens (such as at Pinehurst No.
  2 in 2005, which was described by Johnny Miller of NBC as ""like trying
  to hit a ball on top of a VW Beetle""), and pinched fairways
  (especially on what are expected to be less difficult holes). Historically, winners finish around even par. Only extreme cases (Low scores: Tiger Woods in 2000, Rory McIlroy in 2011...High scores: Geoff Ogilvy in 2006, and Angel Cabrera in 2007...in recent history) show otherwise.  In 2000, Tiger Woods won at -12, 272. Ernie Els and Miguel Angel-Jimenez finished tied for second place....at +3, 287....15 shots behind Woods. This has been portrayed as the most dominating major victory in history(1). Take away Woods's performance, and you will see that the 2000 US Open played difficult among the golfers.  In 2011, Rory McIlroy broke Woods's record score in relation to par and aggregate by winning at -16, 268. Jason Day finished second at -8, 8 shots behind McIlroy. However, 20 golfers finished under par that week, and 38 golfers finished at +3 or better. Take away McIlroy's performance, and you will see that the 2011 US Open still played favorable among the golfers. Reason for the relatively favorable play that week? Rain, and lots of it. It softented up the course and slowed down fairways and greens. US Open fairways and greens are historically very fast. A brief comparison to the Masters: The Masters historically scores under par. A Masters winner has finished over par only a few times (like Zach Johnson in 2007. Reason? Mid-50s°F weather the whole week. The Masters usually plays in the 80s°F).  The point of the US Open is to see which golfer survives after four (or more) rounds of golf. The Olympic Club is ""so difficult"" because of the standards in which the USGA sets up US Open golf courses.  Note: Based on your question, I interpreted that your observation that the Olympic Club is difficult was based on first round scores of the US Open. Therefore, I answered with the purpose of the US Open in mind. There is another answer that illustrates the difficulty of the Olympic Club itself."
Is it true that a line backer is the quarterback for the defense?,"Absolutely it is. The middle linebacker has the best vantage point on the defensive field. He also has the best opportunity to look in the quarterback's eyes to see where he is looking. Armed with this knowledge, as well as watching tape (tons and tons of tape) it's expected that the middle linebacker will have more awareness of the field and in the best position to signal his teammates about the upcoming play. The middle linebacker is also in the position requiring the most versatility. They can expect a lot of run 'up the gut' plays, but also have to drop back for pass coverage. They often blitz opposite their front blocker. Because it requires such versatility, you can expect the player you put there to be one of your best 'jack of all trades' types. Because they understand different positions so well, they are also likely to be more aware of the offense as well - they'll be more in the mental aspect of the game than their comrades."
Why are there dimples on the surface of golf balls and how do they function?,"You are correct that this has to do with aerodynamics, more specifically drag and air friction. This article goes over all of the specifics. Ultimately, it boils down to less drag on the ball, allowing it to fly farther. The exact details and an explanation of the difference between a smooth sphere and a dimpled ball are included in the linked article.  The following image shows the difference between a smooth sphere and a dimpled ball. The smooth sphere separates the air rapidly, creating a large pressure differential between the front and rear of the ball. This creates a large wake that creates lots of drag, forcing the ball to descend more quickly. In contrast, the dimpled ball delays the separation of the air, reducing the size of the wake. This helps to also reduce the pressure differential between the front and rear of the ball, reducing the drag and subsequently allowing the dimpled ball to fly farther than the smooth sphere. "
What type of individual player incentives are allowed in the NFL?,"Well, quite a question. As of the latest (August 2011) NFL CBA - Incentives have a lot of rules around them. I'm not a lawyer or arbitrator but from what I can tell, Brooks' contract sounds legal (and fairly typical) for a player of his status in the NFL. As far as what is spelled out around individual player incentives in the NFL CBA - Section 6(c).v on page 96 of the CBA states, ""Any incentive bonus that depends on team performance in any category not identified in Exhibit A hereto is prohibited."" while section 6(c).vi at the top of page 97 states, ""Any incentive bonus that depends on a player’s individual performance in any category not identified in Exhibit B hereto is prohibited."" so the incentives listed in the CBA are what players & teams are limited to as far as incentives go. INDIVIDUAL INCENTIVES RUSHING PASSING RECEIVING DEFENSE PUNT RETURNS KICKOFF RETURNS PUNTING PLACE KICKING OTHERS There are also team incentives where the amount set aside in the pot for each incentive is split evenly among all players on the team. The rules around how team incentive money is calculated into the salary cap is long-winded and written in legalese so I will refer you to the NFL CBA PDF if you wish to read more about it. Do I get some incentive for having back-to-back-to-back 3-letter acronyms in my answer? ;)"
Why does F.C. Hapoel Tel Aviv play in Europe,"Israel is not in Europe but is a member of UEFA for political reasons (From Wikipedia): Israel competed in the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) between 1954
  and 1974. Due to the Arab–Israeli conflict, several Muslim states
  refused to compete against Israel. The political situation culminated
  in Israel winning the 1958 World Cup qualifying stage for Asia and
  Africa without playing a single game, forcing FIFA to schedule a
  playoff between Israel and Wales to ensure the team did not qualify
  without playing at least one game (which Wales won).   In 1974, Israel was excluded from AFC competitions, as a result of a proposal by Kuwait which was adopted by a vote of 17 to 13 with 6 abstentions.
  .... In 1991, Israeli clubs began participating in European club
  competitions, and Israel returned to the European leg of World Cup
  qualifying in 1992. In 1994, Israel received full UEFA membership, 20 years after it had left Asia."

Is there offside when the ball deflects off an opponent?,"In this situation one has to refer to Law 11 - Offside: 2. Offside Offence. Which states that: A player in an offside position at the moment the ball is played or
  touched by a team-mate is only penalised on becoming involved in
  active play by: ... gaining an advantage by playing the ball or interfering with an opponent when it has: A player in an offside position receiving the ball from an opponent who deliberately plays the ball (except from a deliberate save by any
  opponent) is not considered to have gained an advantage. A ‘save’ is when a player stops a ball which is going into or very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands (unless
  the goalkeeper within the penalty area). So, in your case it was offside, because the ball deflected off an opponent. If it were a deliberate save by an opponent then again offside. If it were a deliberate play by an opponent (that was not a save), then no offside."
Can a player get his second yellow card while being replaced? What happens then?,"This is covered by Law 3: The Players: Substitution Procedure: The substitution is completed when a substitute enters the field of play;from that moment, the substitute becomes a player and the replaced player becomes a substituted player. If the player receives a second yellow card while he is leaving the field, he is still the ""active"" player and is sent off. Sent off players cannot be replaced, so the substitution cannot happen. A very similar situation happens in this video where the player leaving the field receives a second yellow card for removing his shirt."

What happens when a boxer/fighter/wrestler retires while holding a title?,"In boxing, the fighter who retires will keep the belt and the committee will generally schedule a fight between the next two contenders to recognize the new champion. A new belt will be made for the new champion. Lennox Lewis was a recent retired champ. In terms of belts a new belt is made every time a new champion is crowned. The ex-champion gets to keep his belt. (source: Wikipedia) Champions maintain permanent possession of these belts even upon losing their title, with a new belt made when a new champion is crowned."

Here the different situations are outlined when you need to play a let and in paragraph 14.2.3 the following about that is mentioned: 14. LETS From your description, it seems as if the second subparagraph is applicable: 14.2.3.2. As to your second question, it does matter when it happens. The title of 14.2.3 states that it is only valid, when the service is returned. So, if it were to happen during a backhand low service for example, then a point would be given to your opponent. "
How does the match time work in soccer?,"Well the regular amount of time for each half normally lasts 45 minutes: The match lasts two equal periods of 45 minutes, unless otherwise mutually agreed between the referee and the two participating teams. Any agreement to alter the periods of play (for example to reduce each half to 40 minutes because of insufficient light) must be made before the start of play and must comply with competition rules. Injury Time is added at the end of each half: Allowance is made in either period for all time lost through: The allowance for time lost is at the discretion of the referee. And in certain competitions, Extra Time may be required at the end of a game, for example in the World Cup, where two halves of 15 minutes in length are played, with the above rules of added time applying to those two halves."
Why do German football clubs have a number in their name?,"According to this article on the the Bundesliga's website: Germans are traditionally sticklers for accuracy and they're no different when it comes to football. As a general rule of thumb, if you see a '1.' in front of your team's name that's because they want you to know they were the first such club to be founded in their city. Similarly, any other numbers that feature (usually at the end) demonstrate the club's pride in their historical roots by flaunting the year they came into existence."
When do teams wear their away jerseys at international level?,"The FIFA Equipment Regulations state (Article 65): In the event that, in the opinion of the referee or Match Commissioner,
  the Playing Equipment of the two opposing teams is not clearly distinguishable
  for all Players, the Match Officials, spectators and media under the prevailing
  conditions, such as weather and light, the referee or Match Commissioner may
  instruct the host team to use Official Equipment and the visiting team to use
  either its Reserve Equipment or a combination of both. In exceptional cases,
  both teams may be asked to wear different Colours. That answers the general question for ""international matches"". For more specific tournaments, The 2018 World Cup Regulations (Section 24.4) contain similar language, but unhelpfully make no definition of ""host team"" that I can see. I can't see anything in the 2016 European Championship Regulations about kits. Just to add to the confusion, there was at least one World Cup match, the Brazil vs Sweden semifinal in 1994, when both teams wore their away kits. I can't find a reference at the moment, but my memory says that their was a coin toss to determine who would wear their home kit (as both teams traditionally wear yellow and blue), but the away kit of the losing team still clashed with the yellow and blue, so both teams played in their away kits."
Defense against an isolation play,"Simplest solution is to go for a strict force-a-side defense. There's at least some chance the defender can watch both the disc at the current handler and keep track of Bob's actions in the corner of the eye. If the marker on the handler enforces one closed side, the defender can put himself clearly on the open side and watch both. Of course, there's no ideal world, and no side is always 100% closed, and there's overheads and hammers and such. But it does work rather well, especially if the team is trained well in forcing a side. A system my team once played is rather hard to do: We called it the ""buddy system"": Every player on the field has a buddy on the outside. Before the game the team agrees on active players either watching the handlers or watching the respective marked offense player. Let's say for example the team agrees to always watch the handler. Then each buddy on the sideline watches the marked offense player and shouts his direction of movement to his active player on the field. There are several points to this: The result is a cacophony of voices at the match which can be quite intimidating. Some teams may consider this foul play because they mistake this system for an aggressiveness. The point really is that there's no possibility for any kind of trick play such as the ""iso bob"" mentioned in the question. Imho iso plays will always be popular, but they cannot be used to win a game. It's one of those tricks an experienced, competitive team should have up their sleeves and pull out of the hat once in a while. Disclaimer: I'm a geezer now, too ;)"
Where should the play restart from an offside?,"The answer has now changed, see the 2022/23 revisions to the Laws of the Game.

Can a switch hitter change positions during an at bat?,"According to baseballrules.com: A batter may switch to the other box after every pitch if he so
  desires. He may do it on any ball strike count. One of the oldest
  myths in baseball is the one that says you can't switch boxes when you
  have two strikes on you. The only restriction on the batter is that he may not step into the other box after the pitcher is in position ready to pitch. Rule
  6.06(b) So by the wording of the MLB rule, the batter can't switch batters boxes after the pitcher is set: 6.06 (b) He steps from one batters box to the other while the pitcher is in position ready to pitch; There appear to be no other restrictions specific to switch-hitters."
Snowboarding in powdery trees,"3 things I've found for tight areas: Wear a helmet, I've bounced off of trees and it HURTS. Move both of your bindings back at the start of the day to help you keep your weight over the back, preventing the tip from digging in and sending you into a cartwheel. Don't push too hard into the outer branches of the trees, the branches catch all the snow meaning there's often a big hole underneath that's very easy to fall into, and very hard to climb out of."

Why is field hockey played with water on the field?,"The game was being played on artificial turf. According to Wikipedia: There are three main types of artificial hockey surface: 
   - Unfilled or water-based – artificial fibres that are densely packed    for stabilisation, requires irrigation or watering to avoid
  pitch    wear
   - Dressed or sand-dressed – artificial fibres can be less densely    packed and sand supports the fibres for part of the pile depth
   - Filled or sand-filled – artificial fibres can be longer and less    densely packed and sand supports the fibres for 100% of the
  pile    depth The purpose of water is: On water-based pitches, shorter fibres and wetted turf reduce friction and increase the speed at which the game can be played. The article also states: Elite-level competitions, such as the Olympic Games and World Cup, require a water-based playing surface. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_hockey_pitch#Artificial_playing_surface"
"What happens if a goalkeeper catches the ball whilst their body/legs are still in the box, but the ball is just out of the box?","In football, the ball is the one that determined the position in the field.  So if the goalkeeper handles the ball outside of the box, it's considered a foul (handball) by the goalkeeper and a free kick should be granted to the other team. Also, all of the body of the goalkeeper could be outside the box, but if the ball and his hands are inside, there is no foul. This also is taken into account when granting a goal. The whole ball has to pass the goal line, and any player inside the box or even inside the goal line can try to prevent it, no matter where his body is."
"On a no ball, can both batsmen carry the stumps and run forever?","If a batsman carries the stumps deliberately, he is actually obstructing the field.

In particular, but not solely, it shall be regarded as obstruction and either batsman will be out Obstructing the field if while the ball is in play and after the striker has completed the act of playing the ball. So if he carry the stump after playing the ball he is obstructing the field. Law 24 (No ball): When No ball has been called, neither batsman shall be out under any

How do the leading makes of red cricket ball vary in performance?,"Which manufacturers cricket balls are currently used at Test level, and by which teams? What is the difference? Kookaburra has a very low seam which generally holds true for 20 overs and then dies after that.  The seam in the SG ball is upright and very prominent. It stays the same till the 80th over or more. The ball tends to lose shine because of the nature of the outfields in Indian conditions, but the seam stays intact. Because of the seam, the ball tends to grip the pitch and assist in spin and lateral movement. Whereas in Duke balls the seam remains pronounced even till 50-55 overs if proper care is taken. SG balls swing for a max of 5 overs whereas the Dukes balls swing for about 20 overs, making the Dukes most favourable for bowlers.

One Gap vs Two Gap The one-gap lineman is only responsible for the one gap in the offensive linemen and he typically lines up directly in this gap on the defensive line. The two-gap lineman is technically responsible for the gap on either side of the offensive lineman that he is lined up across from. The main purpose of the one-gap technique is for the defensive lineman to get past the offensive lineman and either sack the quarterback or tackle the ball carrier behind the line of scrimmage. On the other hand, the main purpose of the two-gap technique is for the defensive line to ""clog"" the line of scrimmage which allows for the more athletic linebackers to make plays on the outside of the play or gives them time to support in case of a run up the middle. 3-4 vs 4-3 However, not all 3-4 defenses exclusively use the two-gap technique and not all 4-3 defenses use the one-gap technique. Often 4-3 defenses can drop a single linemen into pass coverage leaving the other three defensive linemen playing a two-gap technique. Also, when playing the 3-4 and expecting a run play, defenses will often bring two linebackers to the defensive line just before the snap of the ball in support. In this case, all five defenders will play a one-gap technique, this is sometimes referred to as a 5-2 defense though there is not much difference between the 5-2 and the 3-4. Explaining the Techinque As far as having a better way to explain it to the player, I think the way you stated it is pretty good. However, it is important to note that with the one-gap technique the main objective is to get into the backfield and make a tackle or generally cause havoc. But with the two-gap technique, your main objective is to ""clog"" the line of scrimmage (draw double teams, prevent holes from opening, etc...) so that the linebackers can run free to the ball carrier and make the tackle. For this reason, linemen who play the two-gap technique are less likely to accrue lots of statistics for tackles, fumbles, etc... This is the main reason that many high-profile defensive linemen in the NFL do not like to play in 3-4 defensive schemes."
How is WAR defined as a baseball statistic?,"WAR is a context used by leagues and ballparks independently to measure a baseball player's performance and relative value. As such, WAR can be used to compare players across different years and teams. WAR is derived from weighted runs above average, or the number of runs a player contributes through both his offense and defense above and beyond your typical ""replacement level"" player (i.e. waiver-wire pickup or the next guy in AAA). You divide the total offensive and defensive runs above average by 10 to arrive at wins. Note that these numbers are also adjusted by position since playing the catcher position is harder to play than playing right field. Both Fangraphs (fWAR) and Baseball Reference (rWAR) use many of the same statistics to measure a player's offensive and defensive contributions, with the following differences:  By the way, I've paraphrased the above from Fangraph's excellent intro to WAR, which I recommend you take a look at: http://www.fangraphs.com/library/index.php/misc/war/"
Does the tackle box in gridiron football extend through all the offensive linemen even if they're a long way apart?,"This is a more complex question than I initially thought, and most of that stems from some weird wording in the NFL rules. The provision that allows the QB to throw the ball away once he's outside the tackle position refers specifically to that - ""the tackle position."" (Rule 8, Section 2, Article 1, Item 1.) However, the tackle position is never fully defined. What is defined is the tackle box (Rule 3, Section 35) and the pocket area (Rule 3, Section 25). The pocket area refers to the ""normal tackle position,"" which is a little subjective, but I think we can agree that Vereen is not in the normal tackle position in the above picture, but rather that the lineman second from the right of the center is in the normal tackle position.  The rules make reference to the tackle box when talking about unsportsmanlike conduct penalties (horse collar tackle, illegal chop blocks, illegal hits on defenseless players) but not in the rules on intentional grounding. The pocket area is referred to in the intentional grounding rule, even if not specifically in the section that concerns your situation. So I would say that we use the definition of the pocket, and not that of the tackle box, to determine whether or not intentional grounding has been committed; this takes us back to the ""normal tackle position."" (For what it's worth, the tackle box extends from ""tackle to tackle"" and I think you'd be hard pressed to define Vereen as the right tackle here, considering there is a traditional right guard and tackle on the line as well.) To further my case, it seems most of the talk about this play has referred to the Pats having 4 offensive lineman, and not counting Vereen as one of them. (A couple different tweets and people refer to that in this SB Nation article on it.) Ultimately, there definitely is some ambiguity here, and I think there's some leeway for the referee to decide for himself, but looking at what I see here, I'd say that if Brady makes it outside of the traditional tackle box but is still inside of Vereen's position, he wouldn't get called for grounding.  All the rules I referenced in here come from this edition of the rules on the NFL website. (Warning: that is a rather large PDF). "
When can you lift your pivot foot and go for a shot?,"2018-08-04 update: Ronnie Nunn on BballBreakdown 2018-07-30 says exactly what I've said here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_t4GADxJwQ See in particular the bit from the 2:00 mark. It includes also a discussion of exactly the contrived scenario I made up below. There is no rule against the mere lifting of your pivot foot (or indeed any foot in any situation). It's what you do after you've lifted your pivot foot that may constitute a traveling violation. In particular: Imagine the following contrived scenario: I've just terminated my dribble; I've also established a pivot foot. I then lift up that pivot foot and stand on the other foot (the non-pivot foot) for 10 seconds while still holding on firmly to the ball (a somewhat odd scenario). Here there is absolutely no traveling violation even though I have lifted my pivot foot. The mere lifting of the pivot foot is never a traveling violation. Again, it is only what you do thereafter that constitutes a traveling violation (see 1 and 2 above). Another contrived scenario: I've established a pivot foot and I now jump. I've succeeded in mastering the art of levitation. I stay afloat in the air for 10 seconds while still holding on firmly to the ball but don't do anything with it. Here again there is absolutely no traveling violation even though I have lifted my pivot foot.  In the 2015-2016 NBA rule book, the only rules governing traveling are Rule 4 - Sections VII (Pivot) and VIII (Traveling) and Rule 10 - Section XIII (Traveling). These are fully reproduced below.  From Rule 4  From Rule 10  From the FIBA Official Basketball Rules 2017: "
energy efficiency of the 2014 Formula 1 cars?,"2014 introduced a new rule that fundamentally changes much of the strategy behind a Formula 1 race.  F1 cars are now limited to 100 kg of fuel per race, and limited to a maximum fuel flow of 100 kg/hour.  Prior to this year, there were no fuel limits. In 2013, F1 vehicles typically used 160 kg of fuel per race at a flow of 170 kg/hour (Source).  The new limits require vehicles to use approximately one-third less fuel in each race than they did last year.  For efficiency in terms of distance per unit of fuel (miles per gallon), this means that this year the vehicles will be about one-third more efficient than last year. Before this year, cars could burn as much fuel as necessary to get as fast as possible.  Under the new fuel limit rules, cars can only go as fast as they can while staying under the fuel limits.  The penalty for breaking these rules is disqualification, as Daniel Ricciardo found out last week at the Australian Formula 1 Grand Prix, when he finished second, but was later disqualified when it was determined that his car exceeded the 100 kg/hour flow limit (Source)."
Why does freestyle swimming restrict underwater swimming?,"Ultimately this goes back to David Berkoff, a US Olympic backstroker in the '88 and '92 games. He realized that by dolphin kicking underwater he could go faster than swimming on top of the water (no surface tension to slow you down).  Using this technique, he was able to set several world records and an NCAA championship.
The problem was, this underwater dolphin kick is also quite suitable for freestyle or butterfly, and if most of the race is underwater dolphin kicks there wouldn't be much difference between the strokes. (Breaststroke requirements preclude dolphin kicking). Therefore FINA decided to limit the distance that a back/fly/free swimmer could remain underwater dolphin kicking.  Why 15 meters was chosen isn't completely clear, other than being a manageable fraction of a 50 meter long course pool, and not to far off what many people were doing already coming off a wall with a few kicks. At least one note I have found states the original limit was 10 meters (Source: Berkoff's bio at the International Swimming Hall of Fame site)."
What is the world record in high jump if you allow taking off on both feet?,"I read somewhere that in normal high jump, jumpers must take off on one foot. Correct.  According to Rule 182 of the IAFF's 2012/2013 Competition Rules, the athlete must take off on one foot: RULE 182  : High Jump The Competition As you correctly state, the world record for the high jump is 2.45 metres. A quick search of the Guinness World Records show us that: The highest standing jump onto a platform was 1.48 m (4 ft 10.27 in) by Jonas Huusom (Denmark) at Gerlev Sports Academy in Slagelse, Denmark, on 27 August 2011. From a still, standing position, Huusom leaped to the top of 37 firm judo mats stacked one upon the other. In addition to this record, this wiki page claims that the world record is 1.9m. Now, there doesn't seem to be an official Guinness record for a vertical, running jump although there are some sites claiming jumps of around 1.55m. Now neither of these are directly comparable seeing as there is a lot of difference between how the high jump and the vertical standing or running jumps are performed. That said, with the high jump record being almost 0.5m higher than that of the standing jump I would probably maintain a hypothesis that the one foot jump would be better because of the technique involved, as well as the momentum caused through the bringing up the non-standing leg. In addition, it appears that the high-jump rules have always requried the taking off being from one foot. I did once read speculation that a gymnast could do a series of tumbles and somersaults before their final ""high jump"" which was higher than a one-foot launch but I'd need to see some research or historical evidence to agree with that."
Can a goalkeeper chip the ball to the head of a teammate from a goal kick to circumvent the backpass restriction?,"The IFAB issued a clarifiying statement on the matter. There has been much debate about whether, at a goal kick, the goalkeeper is permitted to ‘lift’ the ball to a team mate to head or chest it back to the goalkeeper to catch and then put into play. The views of technical and refereeing experts about whether this is within the ‘spirit’ of the Laws is divided so the matter will be discussed by The IFAB. Until then, this practice should not be permitted nor should it be penalised. If it occurs the referee should order the goal kick to be re-taken (but without any disciplinary action). Apparently, the IFAB is having the same discussion as you. Until further notice, the goal kick shall be re-taken without yellow card. Therefore, this move is illegal, as of the writing of this post.

Has a ATP / WTA / Grand slam ever been rained out?,"For questions of this type, it seems reasonable to create a CW answer where various users can contribute the instances they are aware of, add references, etc. (We will probably not create a complete list, but at least we will have some of them.) Grand Prix tennis circuit was a predecessor of ATP Tour. I will add that the final of 1984 ABN World Tennis Tournament was unfinished, too. But the reasons had nothing to do with weather, the final was cancelled after an anonymous bomb thread. Other sources: 1, 1a"
"In 8-ball, do I win if I shoot in the 8 ball and my last ball in the same shot?","One official source: WPA rulebook. Rule 3.8c says that the shooter loses if he pockets the eight ball in an uncalled pocket. Furthermore, Rule 3.6 says that every shot must be called (except for the break) AND says that ""The eight ball may be called only after the shot on which the shooter's group has been cleared from the table."" Therefore, you cannot possibly call the eight ball on a shot as you described. And since you did not call it, you lose. (Side note about a common misconception in pool - If you look at rule 3.6a, if you're shooting at the eight ball you only lose on a scratch if you also pocket the eight ball. In other words, if you scratch but the eight ball doesn't go in, the game continues.)"
"What made Notre Dame, Notre Dame?","Notre Dame became Notre Dame because it was one of the best football schools in the early days of college football, when a great coach with a few interesting strategies could make all the difference in the quality of a school's team.  They then managed to keep that advantage instead of either disbanding the football team (Thanks for the memories, Amos Alonzo Stagg) or losing the momentum due to poor coaching or difficult entry requirements (see Yale/Harvard/Army/Navy etc.).  Notre Dame managed to find a compromise in terms of academics that allowed them to recruit effectively while maintaining a mostly high academic standard (compared to other schools with strong football programs) when the great shift from the Ivies to the State Schools occurred in the middle of the century. In this case, it was Knute Rockne who led the school to prominence.  He played for them in the early 1910s, and in 1913 led them to beat the then-dominant Army team soundly (35-13) thanks to his practicing the forward pass with his quarterback extensively during the off-season; the forward pass was legal but rarely used in football at the time. He then became the head coach starting a few years later (1918), and led them to four national championships (1919, 1924, 1929, 1930, using the NCF designation as is usual in that era) and regularly won 9 or 10 games per year.  He emphasized athleticism and speed, a change from many other teams at the time who were more of the pounding sort.  He introduced the 'shift' (ie, changing alignment just before the snap).  He also continued to emphasize the modern forward pass - while other teams did use passes, they tended to be shorter, screen-variety, while he used passing more extensively and more downfield. He also was a great showman, as Wikipedia goes into some length to describe; as much as winning games, he had to sell the school and make the team profitable (or at least pay for itself!) as athletics weren't the big industry back then they are now. Notre Dame then built on his legacy in the 40s and 50s with Frank Leahy, who won four national championships and had the second highest winning percentage in NCAA history (.846).  Future coaches built on the legacy, with several more national championships and very competitive teams until the last decade or so the SEC recruiting advantage seems to have lessened their status, although they still manage to be competitive on a fairly regular basis. They continue to have a few advantages. One is their TV deal, which as being a single school with no conference to share revenue with is substantial, and pays for very good facilities.  They also have a national following (driving the TV deal, among other things) because they are one of the leading Catholic schools in the nation, so their alumni tend to be more spread out over the country than a state school who would have most of their alumni centered near the school."
Does the team with the extra rest day perform better?,"1994 and before, World Cup semifinals often took place on the same day, so one team had only a few hours more preparation time than the other. When semifinals did not take place on the same day, the team with the extra rest day most often lost. Here is a list with the team with 5 days between semifinal and final first, team with 4 days second: Only twice did the team with more preparation time win, and this team did not win in regular time.  The latter instance of the two also seems to be the only time when the later semifinal went into extra time while the earlier one did not. The very first world cup final was four and three days, resp., after the semifinals, and also won by the team with fewer time to prepare. Interesting side observation: The third place match was won by the team in the same semifinal as the eventual champion every time except 1990 (host Italy came third after being knocked out by eventual final loser Argentina) and 2014 (Netherlands, despite professing lack of motivation beforehand, beat Brazil, who had apparently not recovered from a severe semifinal loss against eventual champion Germany). While these may not be enough observations to establish that less preparation time is actually useful, one can likely rule out a significant advantage. The results of the four most recent European Championships and Copa Américas is in fact even: 2 wins each for the team from the earlier semifinal, 2 for the one from the later one."
What is the difference between swing and seam bowling?,"Both of these styles of bowling are performed by bowlers who are medium pace or fast bowlers. A swing bowler tries to deceive the batter by getting sideways movement through the air (known as 'swing' in cricket). By contrast, a seam bowler tries to get sideways movement off the pitch by landing the ball right on the seam so that it may deviate one way or the other if it hits an imperfection (such as a crack or lump) on the pitch. Generally speaking, a swing bowler will try and 'pitch the ball up' landing the ball closer to the batter. This is because it allows more time in the air for swing to occur, and makes the batter more likely to play a straight bat shot (such as a drive) that might cause them to misplay the ball and get out if they don't pick up the swing. On the other hand, a seamer will generally pitch the ball a little shorter in order to hit the pitch harder (i.e. have a more vertical impact) in order to get more out of any deviation off the pitch. There are certainly some bowlers who can be classed as predominantly swing bowlers and others who are mostly seam bowlers, but most medium and fast bowlers with try and utilise both techniques at different times, depending on the conditions, the batter and the state of the ball at the time."
Is a match forfeit always scored as 3-0 regardless of situation?,"This is what I found on forfeits over two legs; according to fifa.  A team sanctioned with a forfeit is considered to have lost the match by 3-0. If the goal difference at the end of the match is greater than three,
  the result on the pitch is upheld. Never heard of a team actually doing this though. Would be interesting to see what Fifa would do if a team won 4-0 and decided to forfeit the 2nd leg so they could go through. I guess in most cases the money lost by not playing the game is a deterrent. Edit I've found more info from Uefa where if a team refuses to play a match then they forfeit that game and face elimination from the competition. I think this relates more to your question. If a club refuses to play or is responsible for a match not taking
  place or not  being played in full, the Control and Disciplinary Body
  declares the match  forfeited and/or disqualifies the club concerned
  in combination with the following fines The fines range up to 1 million euro for doing so before the final."
What is the difference between googly and doosra spin?,"A 'doosra' is a delivery that an off-spinner bowls with an off spin action that spins from right to left. (This is different to a normal off spin delivery that spins left to right.) A 'googly' is a delivery that a leg spinner bowls with a leg spin action that spins from left to right. A 'googly' is also referred to as a 'wrong'un'. (This is different to a normal leg spin delivery that spins right to left.) Saqlain Mushtaq was the inventor of the 'doosra' and he bowled it quite well. Currently, Muttiah Muralidaran, Harbhajan Singh and Ajantha Mendis bowl it very well. The master of the Doosra is definitely Muttiah Muralidaran. Shane Warne and Anil Kumble are one of best 'wrong-un' bowler ever."
What kind of shoes are suitable for a Novice/Sprint triathlon?,"For short course triathlon as you suggest it is not worth worrying this much about shoes. Either use pedals with clips and straps (cages if you will) and ride in your running shoes, or else switch shoes in transition. For your runners, they sell stretchy laces so you can slip the shoes on, no need to retie the laces.   This will minimize transition time. Running shoes that are properly fit to you are way more important than anything else.  You can ride a bike in sneakers or in road shoes, but you cannot run in improper shoes for very long."
"When a QB slides, is it considered a dead ball?","First, is the play dead after a QB slides, regardless of whether he is hit? If the QB slides feet-first, then yes, the play is dead. Second, if it is dead on the slide, is there a penalty for hitting the QB after the slide? Not if the defender has ""committed himself, and the contact is unavoidable."" Rule 7, Section 2 of the NFL Rulebook describe a ""Dead Ball."" Article 1 describes when an official shall declare the ball dead. Letter (d) states: When a runner declares himself down by sliding feet first on the
  ground. The ball is dead the instant the runner touches the ground
  with anything other than his hands or his feet; Additionally, a note states: Defenders are required to treat a sliding runner as they would a
  runner who is down by contact. A defender must pull up when a runner begins a feet-first slide. This does not mean that all contact by a defender is illegal. If a defender has already committed himself, and 
  the contact is unavoidable, it is not a foul unless the defender commits some other act, such as helmet-to-helmet contact or by driving his forearm or shoulder into the head or neck are of the runner."
What should a referee do if he physically obstructs a player?,"In the situation you describe, that being the referee impeding a player, the referee has no obligation to stop play or provide compensation to either the attacking or defending team. Law 9 of the FIFA Laws of the Game state: Ball Out of Play The ball is out of play when: it has wholly crossed the goal line or touch line whether on the ground or
  in the air play has been stopped by the referee Ball In Play The ball is in play at all other times, including when: it rebounds off a goalpost, crossbar or corner flagpost and remains in the
  field of play it rebounds off either the referee So, there is nothing that states explicitly that the ball is out of play in the event of a collision. Now, if we look at the interpretation of the rule, we have the bullet above which states ""play has been stopped by the referee"".  So we ask, should the referee stop play? The answer is ""No"".  The referee is deemed as part of the field of play.  A player colliding with the referee is, for all intents and purposes, the same as a player colliding with the post, tripping over on the grass or catching his foot on the corner flag. One exception to this would be if the player was substantially injured (such as a head injury).  The referee would then use his discretion to stop the play if desired. In summary, the referee will do his best to keep out of the way of the ball and players but, if he does collide with the ball or a player, play shall continue."
What football formations have been most prevalent in the English Premier League since 1992?,"It is certainly 4-4-2 as almost all teams in England were using that formation back then. Of course the English Premier League didn't exist in the 1980s as it started in 1992, but I have assumed the question relates to the top-flight English league, so that would be Division One (the First Division) pre-1992. One reason often cited for the poor performance of the English national football (soccer) team is that the club sides play the predictable 4-4-2 formation and this isn't effective at the international level.  So often the England national team plays a variation of this, 4-3-3 for example, but as the players are not used to it this gets used as an excuse, rightly or wrongly, for their underperforming. Wikipedia has a lot of information on this topic and you can see 4-4-2 has been popular in many countries until recently: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football). Liverpool (for one) are still using the 4-4-2 formation and dominated English football especially in the 1980s; here's another interesting link: http://thebeaveronline.co.uk/2012/03/15/the-death-of-the-4-4-2/.

How important is it to be able to roll a sea-kayak? [closed],"The question should be more related to the type of water you're on. The type of kayak you're in should then follow the type of water you're on and the type of experience you are looking for... If you're paddling on water large enough for waves, with currents, with big and/or fast ships/boats, or which is too big to comfortably swim to the shore in clothes, rolling is considered to be a very essential safety measure. Paddling in a group though is worth even more than rolling. Even if you can roll on calm waters in practice situations, you might not be able to after your involuntary exit. Always remember that there was a reason why you suddenly find yourself outside of a kayak: Also, if you're on cold water (even if the air temp is comfortable), you may not be able to roll. There is a phenomenon of your breathing stopping suddenly when you get your head into ice-cold water. In several of these cases being able to roll is not the solution to the problem. Again, being in a group is a much better safety measure. Never paddle alone on open water. And before you go in a group ensure that everyone can reenter the kayak with help from others. For practicing, get near the beach with a group of people who all can safely and quickly reenter the kayak (as you posted for yourself). All of this group must be able to use buddy techniques to reenter the kayak in groups on calm water. (E.g. one stabilizes while the other enters). Then practice one after the other reentering with waves. First time you do this ensure it's a place with lifeguard on duty and/or boat access. In addition, learn to read the weather, and weather forecasts. By the way: If you cannot roll, wear a dry-suit! It helps you stay warm. Never risk hypothermia. Depending on the difference in water temperature and air temperature it's hard to wear clothing to survive 10 mins in cold water while avoiding a heatstroke while paddling normally. I cannot roll my sea-kayak, and usually paddle on a small river (6m width). But I still paddle until the water starts developing ice. I start wearing a drysuit in autumn, when the water gets below 10C because on a rainy day no-one would notice me drifting in the ice cold water. It does not take long to bring your body temperature down to critical levels in 4 C water. Good luck and lots of fun!"
"""Pressing high"" in football (aka ""soccer"")","It means the team without the ball, moves higher up the pitch to put pressure on the team with the ball, with the idea of getting the ball back or forcing the other team to make a mistake. Say, teamA has the ball near their own goal. Then teamB will start putting pressure on teamA, by moving higher in the direction of teamA's goal. Players of teamB will start attacking teamA players to get the ball back. But the key point here is, it will be done nearer to teamA's goal. That's why it's called pressing high. As shown in the image below, blue team tries to pressure the red team, near the red team's goal.  Few benefits of pressing high are: A disadvantage would be, you are more susceptible to quick counter attacks, and over the top balls."
Is it a foul in ultimate if the pursuer unintentionally clips the runner from behind?,"Whether or not the contact is intentional has no bearing on the outcome of this call. Your question is really ""is clipping from behind considered as a foul?"", and the answer is yes. From the 11th Edition rules: Foul: Non-Incidental contact: contact between opposing players (see
  II.H for a definition of incidental contact). In general, the player
  initiating the contact has committed the foul. Incidental-contact: Contact between opposing players that does not
  affect continued play. The situation you describe is definitely non-incidental, so is a foul, and it is a foul on the initiating player. The trailing player is almost always the player initiating contact. It's not ""out of nowhere"" that their back foot clips your thigh. They were running. You were running behind them. You were in complete control of how close you were to them. This is supported by USA Ultimate's Standing Rules Committee in this article: The answer is that it's a foul on whoever initiated the contact
  (II.E). In practice, this is often hard to determine, but usually
  means that it’s a foul on the trailing person, since the motion of the
  person in front is directed away from the other player, and therefore
  that player is less likely to have been the initiator of the contact.
  If it's really impossible to say who initiated the contact though,
  then it should be treated as a case of offsetting fouls, and the disc
  should go back to the thrower. For the situation where you are standing still, and another player twists, runs and clips you, then clearly you have not initiated the contact and therefore have not committed a foul. Here's another quote from USA Ultimate's FAQ supporting the downfield player (even if you are impeded). This quote talks about a defender moving into the path of an offensive player to box-out, but it equally applies to an offensive player moving into the path of a defender to box-out. However, if a defender is playing the disc (e.g. looking at and
  reacting to the trajectory of the disc in order to make the catch/D),
  they are allowed to move into unoccupied space for the purpose of
  preventing their opponent from taking that space (ie- “boxing out”),
  since they are not solely playing their opponent."
What advantages does a softer putter provide?,"Grip is a bit of a misnomer, but from a distance that's what it looks like it's doing. Having a softer material for your putter (or any disc really, but you only expect to do this with a putter) causes more of the energy to go into the chain and less energy back into the disc. The more energy in the disc, the further it's going to go. Either it's going to push the chain out of the way and fly past it, or it's going to hit the chain and bounce backward. Either way, it's going to go somewhere other than where it is - but right now it's hitting a chain, and you'd like it to stay where it is!! Imagine you shot a ping pong ball at the chain - it would bounce off almost every time (assuming you could hit the thing). But if you threw a pillow, there's a good chance that it would stay. Obviously neither ping pong balls or pillows are recommend for disc golf, but they illustrate the physics. Soft materials absorb/transfer energy instead of bouncing."
What does the superscript used in tennis scores mean?,"When a set reaches 6-6, a tiebreaker is used to determine the winner of the thirteenth game and hence the set. The first player serves once, then the players alternate serving twice consecutively, scoring one point per point won, until one player has both seven points or more, and a lead on the opponent of two points or more The superscript numbers record the final score in the tiebreaker. The first set went to 6-6, where a tiebreaker was played to a score of 7-4 in Carreno Busta's favour, winning him the set 7-6. Compare with other matches in the competition on the same day. Dolgopolov wins first set versus Schwartzman, tiebreaker 7-1. Seppi wins second set versus Karlovic, tiebreaker 7-4. Karlovic wins third set versus Seppi, tiebreaker 7-3. Edmund wins first set versus Basilashvili, tiebreaker 7-0. Kyrgios wins first set and third set and fourth set versus Tsonga, tiebreakers 7-5 and 8-6 and 7-5. Cilic wins first and third sets versus  Harrison, tiebreakers 7-4 and 7-4."
Can a player stretch into opponent's court to play a shot?,"A player is only allowed to stretch into the opponent's court in 2 situations: The player is near the net and they hit the ball after it has passed over the net.  The follow through on their swing is allowed to extend into the opponent's court (provided that they do not touch the net or the ground). The ball bounces on the player's side of the court, and due to spin or wind, it goes back over the net.  In this situation, the player is allowed to reach over the net and hit the ball (provided that they do not touch the net or the ground). Here are a couple sources: USTA: A player may break the plane of the net on a follow through from a shot as long as the ball was on that player’s side of the court when the ball was struck. (The player can only reach over to play a ball in the situation stated in the paragraph below). If the spin or wind brings the ball back over the net to the side of the player(s) who hit the shot, the opponent(s) may then reach over the net and play the ball. They may not touch the net or the opponent’s court. This is the only situation when a player may reach over the net to play a ball. If the opponent does not play the ball and it bounces on the side of the player who hit the spin shot, that player who hit that shot wins the point. The player in either situation may not touch the net, or the opponent’s court with anything he wears or carries or with any part of the body. ITF: The point is lost if:  [...] g. The player or the racket, whether in the player’s hand or not, or anything 
  which the player is wearing or carrying touches the net, net posts/singles

Who was the quickest player in the English Premier League in 2014?,"It's very hard to pick the quickest player in the EPL. It also depends if you measure the run without the ball or with the ball. To sum up the answer, Theo Walcott is probably the fastest but it's inconclusive. Measurements are being done all the time by several organizations. In the last measurement done by FIFA, Antonio Valencia was chosen fastest football player on the planet. Other EPL players who also appear on the list are:  The accuracy of these numbers can probably be disputed, since all FIFA has stated  that the data was pulled off from their own computers and tracking systems.

Another source is Goal.com. Their 5 fastest players in the Premier League are: According to ftbpro.com, Theo Walcott is also the fastest one.

But if you ask Kyle Walker (Tottenham), he will present this as proof that he is the fastest.

What happened to the wishbone?,"Defenses have indeed, ""figured it out"". The top 4 rushing teams that run the Wishbone/Triple-Option—Georgia Tech, Air Force, Army, and Navy—are a combined 21-35. However, they are successful running the ball with all four being in the top 6 in rushing in the FBS. Teams approach this offense by containing the rush and funneling the play up the middle. This limits big gains and forces the offense to put together drives of 10-15 plays. Inevitably, a penalty or error derails a drive and they are left in a 3rd and long situation. This offense is not built to overcome long down and distances. In response to comments below.. The legitimacy and effectiveness of an offensive system can be measured by the number of points it is able to produce. The object of the game, after all, is to score more points than your opponent. Wins and losses is an easy, but maybe too simple, way of judging this. The four prominent Wishbone/Triple-Option teams have scored 1,334 points. That's good for 333 on average which would place them on the list of FBS scoring offense at 71 out of 134. Teams that have finished 71st in scoring offense in the past 5 years have combined for a win loss record of 29 - 33. The last time a Wishbone led offense won a National Championship was in 1986. Frankly, the speed of the game has made the Wishbone obsolete. Even ultra conservative teams like Alabama use offenses that look like a Spread in comparison to the Wishbone."
What is seedings in grouping the teams in cricket?,"Ten of the teams in the ICC Twenty20 Cricket World Cup are ""seeded"" teams.

Jumping a cue ball,"There actually three different skills here for you to learn -- The Jump, The Massé and the Jump Massé. Let's start with the jump first and then get to the massé and then combine the two.  In order to jump the cue ball, elevate the back of your cue stick to 45 degrees and then shoot down, through the center, of the cue ball.  Follow straight through the ball (don't jerk back on contact.)  This will cause the cue ball to jump.  If you hit the ball perfectly, the height and distance of the ball will vary based on the force with which you hit it.  If you need a sharper, higher jump, you can elevate your cue beyond the 45 degrees, but still hit through the center of the cue ball.  Once you get the hang of this, it's pretty easy to adapt to real game situations as needed.  Though, I still always take a kick over a jump simply for predictability. A massé shot is basically just a way to make the cue ball curve.  The way that you make a cue ball curve is to impart spin on the cue ball that is contrary to the direction it is moving such that the spin grabs prior to the cue ball striking something else.  So, start simple here.  Starting with your cue stick level, aim at the top right of the cue ball.  Elevate the back end of your cue 30-45 degrees strike the cue ball in the spot in which you were aiming in a straight line.  Not too hard.  Your cue ball should move forward and slide left before grabbing and curving back to the right.  The simpler massé shots come up occasionally in regular play and is pretty easy to adapt as needed. Finally, a jump massé is just a combination of two except the cue is traveling in the air with English rather than along the felt.  Elevate your cue to the 80-90 degree range and strike the cue ball firmly in a straight line in the same spot you were aiming for your previous massé shot.  The ball should elevate with spin and respond accordingly once it gets back to the table.  This is a difficult shot that, in years and years of playing, I've never actually needed. There should be a few good tutorials of the first two shots on YouTube for sure.  The last one is mostly used for trick shots, so you might not find a good tutorial. (edit: found an okay one here)"
"In football, is the inside of each goal part of the field of play?","The field of play does not include the goal nets, as defined in the laws of the game. Law 1.2 states  The field of play must be rectangular which is only possible if the area enclosed by the goal nets is excluded And Law 1.12 states No form of commercial advertising, whether real or virtual, is
  permitted on  the field of play, on the ground within the area
  enclosed by the goal nets or the technical area... which strongly suggests that the goal nets are not part of the field of play. This would appear to be in contradiction with the glossary definition you quoted in the question.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the more detailed laws of the game have priority over a glossary, which gives a short and quick definition of various terms as an aid to understanding the laws."
How can a top seed in a tennis tournament be a qualifier?,"I wanted to come back and add an answer to this question because it happened again this week (27 Apr 2015) in a Challenger event in Tallahassee involving Facundo Bagnis of Argentina. You can find the draw for the 2015 event on their Facebook Page, or the Wikipedia page for it once it's updated. The reason for this happening is that Bagnis is currently ranked 90 in the world (pretty high for a Challenger event being played the same week as 3 ATP tour events also). The problem is, Bagnis didn't sign up to play the event in time, so he was forced to play qualifying in order to make his way into the main draw. THEN - the tournament organizers didn't make up the draw (and thus, the seeds) until AFTER qualifying had completed - therefore allowing them to give Bagnis the #1 seed (appropriately) but he still has the ""Q"" by his name, since he made the main draw as a qualifier. According to some sources that follow pro tennis closely, this happens fairly regularly at the Futures level, but rarely in Challenger level tournaments.  Glad to have finally got an answer to this question!"
How can a player have more points in race rankings than in the ATP world rankings?,"EDIT: Ok, I have completely rewritten my answer now that I understand this completely myself. In my opinion, these rankings being so hard to figure out is one thing that tennis suffers from - the rankings should be easier to figure out and to know ""why"" someone is ranked where they are. Anyway...here we go. How tennis rankings work: So, to determine a tennis players ranking, their best 18 tournament results are counted (19 if the player made the previous year's masters cup). 12 of these 18 events are mandatory (4 slams, 8 Masters Series) - they are counted first. This leaves a further 6 tournaments to be counted and they are counted in this order: first, the one optional Masters Series tournament (Monte Carlo), then any ATP 500 level and Davis Cup matches. If there are any countable tournament results left after this, then Olympics (if applicable) and the best ATP 250 results make up the points, until 18 tournaments have been counted (19 for Masters Cup players).  So in Nadal's case (keep in mind he didn't play after Wimbledon in 2012 so he missed a bunch of tournaments), it has to do with this rule, regarding which tournaments can count towards Nadal's ranking, since he is a ""commitment player"". See the 2nd question on the ATP's rankings FAQ page. In November 2011, the ATP Board passed a rule to allow more
  flexibility in which tournaments count toward the ranking of a
  commitment player in 2012 and 2013.  Commitment players (top 30 in 2012 year-end ranking) can count their
  best six (6) results from ATP World Tour 500, ATP World Tour 250 and
  other events (Challengers, Futures, Davis Cup, Olympics) toward their
  ranking. To count their best six (6), players must have fulfilled
  their commitment to 500 events - 4 total per year (at least 1 after
  the US Open). So what was left out of this explanation was - that UNTIL a commitment player has fulfilled their commitment to playing in four 500 level tournaments for the year (with 1 being post US Open) - they aren't allowed to count points earned at lesser tournaments (such as Vina Del Mar, in Nadal's case). Once Nadal plays in four 500 level tournaments in 2013, he can opt to (but probably won't need/want to) use the points earned at Vina Del Mar. When a player fails to meet that four 500 level tournament commitment, they are assigned zero points from however many 500 level tournaments they didn't play in. This is referred to as the ""zero point penalty"" for tennis rankings. In Nadal's case, he only played in one 500 level tournament in 2012 (Barcelona) so he was assigned/given a result of 0 points from three other 500 level tournaments at the end of 2012 (even though he never showed up or played at them). In the first image you posted of the Rankings - you can see he has zero points for Valencia and Beijing, even though he didn't play in those tournaments (He added points from Acapulco this year - it replaced a zero point result from 2012). Once Nadal plays in four 500 level tournaments in 2013 (with at least 1 being after the US Open) - those Vina Del Mar points would be eligible or ""countable"" as it says on the ATP website.

On the scoring system for synchronised diving,"The short answer: to prevent a judge from manipulating scores. The highest and lowest scores are discarded (crossed out) and the middle scores are summed, weighted by 3/5, then multiplied by the degree of difficulty.

Why did newly formed Premiership and FA agree on the promotion system?,"There are some corrections to your question. It seems to me like a bad divorce between the 22 involved clubs and
  the FA. Nope, it was a divorce between the 22 clubs and the Football League. The Football League is different from the FA. In fact the foundation of the Premier League states  The five (big) clubs decided it was a good idea and decided to press
  ahead with it, however the league would have no credibility without
  the backing of The Football Association and so David Dein of Arsenal
  F.C. held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The
  FA did not enjoy an amicable relationship with the Football League at
  the time and considered it as a way to weaken the Football League's
  position. So now to the question: Why did the FA agree to rename its divisions and that the highest
  ranked league will become the second tier of English football? As earlier, the FA pushed this idea. The web archive article says But rumblings of discontent had started in 1991 with the FA's
  unveiling of their 'Blueprint for Football' which put forward the idea
  of a Super League of 18 clubs. The Football League strongly resisted
  the proposals, but on June 14, 1991 16 First Division clubs signed a
  document of intent to join the newly named Premier League. Eventually
  all 22 First Division clubs tendered their resignation from the League
  and, after months of financial wranglings and threats of a players'
  strike, the PL became official on September 23. The FA agreed to
  continue with three up and three down promotion and relegation, vowed
  to reduce the Premier League to 20 and struck a record five-year
  £304 million television deal with Sky and BBC. So in this case it seems that the FA actually agreed with the Football League to allow promotions for 3 teams from the Championship rather than keep it a closed shop, in order that those teams get part of the earnings. Note in the Premier League, your final standings at the end of the year specify the % of the Sky TV kitty you take home. So even though positions 18 - 20 are relegated, they will get a proportional share of the TV earnings. There is an incentive to be 18th, rather than 20th. In each year, there is a chance for 3 teams from the Championship to get into the Premier League TV revenue. and 3 teams fall out of the Premier League too."
Fueling strategy while running a marathon in warm weather [closed],"There are many factors that cut your marathon short. Firstly, the heat dissipation is better in a shorter runner than in a tall runner (the area-volume ratio larger to transfer heat if shorter). Secondly, the warm environment requires extra effort from your body like running extra miles. The ideal solution is to get used to the warm environment weeks before the competition. Lastly, the worrying thing is the inexperience in warm weather that can result to lack of consistency. To run marathon in warm weather, you need to get used to such climate and distances.  Just two weeks until the warm marathon race Extra heat must transferred somehow away because your body is not yet used to it. Either you need to cut your goals (less heat from muscles generated) or cool down your body other ways such as run-showers, cooling body in aid stations and more hydration. The risks contain overhydration and hyponatremia where you start to feel fatique and heavier body can result to more pain in joints such as knees.  Strategies to tackle the extra heat in warmer race environment water yourself in aid stations drink more during the race: extra weight requires more effort from your legs, your front thighs/shins may fail. Relax calves, shins and front thighs before the race: backwards walking/running etc, more here. plan your hydration on aid stations such as more gels and watering pre 20km while more cold watering later More about aid stations planning in https://sports.stackexchange.com/questions/13718/how-to-manage-hydration-in-aid-stations-during-marathon is covered in terms of the opposite hydration levels where dehydration versus overhydration analysed. Long term It seems that the distance is not your main problem but the consistency. The inconsistency is probably due to the lack of experience in warm runs. 2 weeks before race should be more intensive training and you have little time to do major changes. Just 1 week before the race it is important to build up the glycogen reserves and work particularly on the front thighs and knees -- particularly if your plan is to do major changes in hydration. Your body cannot adapt in a split second to more hydration and watering can also be an obstacle. In long term, overhydration can drain important trace minerals. In next run, train in warmer weather or simulate it with clothes. "
Improving 7 vs 7 team and strategy,"I have to agree with @gbianchi's comment. If the field is narrow but rather long, you most likely won't be need a 4-man defensive line.  As soon as I read your question, and looked at the first formation graph (which is awesome btw) I came to think of the games I've played with my team. I recall that we almost always ended up playing in a 2-3-1 formation: 2 CBs which are solid in their build and good in their passing, one midfielder who'll be the joker being practically everywhere he's needed, 2 wingers who're quick (especially when playing counter-attack) and good in dribbling, and finally one forward who's up for some roughing, challenging the defenders as much and as often as he can.  This formation has the benefit of being very versatile; given some pressure from the opposition the central midfielder can fall back to triple the D-line, and you can play ""wide"" midfielders (3-2-1). Given an attacking situation, you can triple the offense instead putting the pressure on the opposition defense, while the central midfielder can have a free role, or picks up the cleared balls/takes the long shot.  No matter which formation you end up using, it's good to keep in mind that modern football is going away from solid formations towards a more fluid teamplay. Essentially your backs will need to step up, while your CF will need to come to midfield to help out. In my experience the most valuable skill for a team in amateur leagues is to be able to handle pressure high up in the pitch. You should have a good strategy to get the ball out from defense without much fuss, and also keep a high pass completion ratio.  The fact the field is narrow doesn't really mean much, other than you won't have to worry much about diagonal crosses. Short and quick passes between the CF and the left/right winger should be enough to distress the opposition. If not you can always try to sneak in the central midfielder behind the defenders with through passes from the wing, in that case however the other winger should be ready to fall back in case of a missed pass."

Enforcement of traveling in basketball,"There aren't all that many international competitions, but since this rule was enacted in 2009, it didn't seem to stop the United States team from winning the 2010 FIBA World Championship. With winning, they withdrew from the 2011 FIBA World Cup, since they already qualified for the 2012 Olympics as a result of the 2010 championship and had little to gain. So being that there has only been one world class international competition, it's difficult to say. The US did win it though, so that would seem to indicate that it was not a significant factor. Whether there was an increase in travel calls, I wasn't able to find any reports on the matter. It's also a very small sample size. To really answer this question we will have to see what happens in London, keeping track of travels against the US versus other teams."
What is the scoring system in sailing?,"The Low point scoring system is used. The winner is the boat with the lowest score at the end of the event or series of races. The first boat across the line gets 1 point, the second 2 points, the third gets 3 and so on. For boats who are entered but did not start (cross the start line legally)(DNS), Did not finish (DNF) or were disqualified (DSQ), they will be given scores equal to the number of boats entered - (minus) 1, 2 or 3. Often DNF has a slightly lower score than DNS and DSQ. In a longer series it is common for one or more result to be ""discardable"". Most sailing scoring software will automatically discard each competitor's worst result. So, across a series of 5 races each with ten boats, a boat which one every race would be given 5 points. If they missed a race (and weren't able to discard the result), they might get 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 11 = 15 points. In the case of points ties, the later results are usually given more weight (as in the case of the Olympic medal race). The advantages of this system are as follows: Details of the scoring can be found on the USA Sailing site or the UK's RYA."
How does the NBA get paid by the networks for playoff games?,"The NBA included rights to broadcast playoff games in the $24 billion extension signed with Disney/ESPN and TNT. This deal covers both regular season and playoff games:  Under this arrangement, ESPN will pay $1.4 billion per year, while

Why does the Vuelta a España have a combination classification?,"Few weeks ago I did some research for the question Why does not Vuelta have young rider jersey?. For that, I found an interview with La Vuelta's general director Javier Guillén from back in 2014. It is a pity it is in Spanish, but to simplify things I translated into English the relevant parts of it. In a specific moment he stated: We do have the same amount of maillots as the other ones; this is, four. We do not have young classification, and I am not saying we should not have it, but nowadays we have the combination with a sponsor which is very much identified with this ranking since it has been sponsoring La Vuelta for 19 years. The combination is a distinguishing mark of La Vuelta, since it is the only race having it and we want to keep it like this. If we ever get the chance, we could include the young rider classification, but nowadays we think that the podium is full enough. I also found you are absolutely right about this classification being quite secondary, since people winning it are normally those trying to win La Vuelta itself. I could not find a full statistic on the winners of the combined classification compared to the overall winner. However, the Catalan article of Wikipedia on Combination classification in the Vuelta a España contains a very representative column. There, you can see which others jerseys the winner won: from 2004, just in one case (Joaquim Rodríguez in 2015) the winner just won this one. And in total just in 7 cases out of almost 30."

Any association which is a member of FISU may enter a team or an individual competitor. Entries are accepted from any country eligible for the Olympic Games and from any national federation affiliated to the appropriate international federation. In addition, the individual sports may have placed additional entry criteria on the participants in that sport (for example, a country can only delegate at most two athletes for most athletics events and both athletes must have achieved a certain minimum result in that event). I can't comment on how common it is for athletes to compete both in a Universiade and a World Championship/Olympic Games."

Why is a penalty not given if a goal comes right after the foul?,"This is due to the advantage rule, From Laws of the Game - Law 5: The Referee - 3. Powers and Duties: The referee allows play to continue when an offence occurs and the

  offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue at that time or
  within a few seconds. The referee allowed to play on advantage because Spaniards (non-offending team) benefited from it (they scored a goal)."
Where does the assistant referee watch to realize when a soccer player is offside?,"When the ball is in play, the assistant referee will do their best to remain in line with whichever one of is closest to the goal line (p.86 - FIFA 2014/15 Laws of The Game). They will generally side-step, only running facing the goal line when required to do so to keep up (p.86, p. 95 - FIFA 2014/15 Laws of The Game). This enables them to have a view of the offside line, the ball, the referee and the majority of the players at once. By occasionally placing their chin on their chest, they can use the touch line to gauge whether they are remaining square with the offside line. When it appears that an attacker is going to play a ball and other attackers are close to being offside, the assistant referee will focus on the offside line and use their peripheral vision to judge when the ball is last played."
Why doesn't the MLB implement a salary cap?,"The owners would implement a salary cap in a New York Minute if they had the opportunity.  The players, however, would not agree, and because MLB is so successful monetarily even without one, and also has one of the most powerful players unions, the owners don't have the power to force it on them.  It's not hard to find articles about how the MLB owners would like a salary cap and the MLBPA refuses; see this one, this one,  Why is that?  Because a salary cap is not intended to create parity.  The primary function of a salary cap is to reduce player salaries, or at least keep them from escalating too quickly.  Salary caps reduce the maximum a player can earn - either directly (NBA-style) or indirectly (NFL style) by simply reducing the total amount a team may spend on salaries.   The problem with MLB being uncapped (particularly pre-recent luxury tax rules) was that player contracts simply escalated as new owners came in and decided to spend a lot.  That escalation was not necessarily related to total income of the league.  NFL and NHL, and to a lesser extent NBA (which is a softer cap closer to MLB's current system) have direct ties between revenue and player salaries - which mean you can't have player salaries escalate dramatically, unless the total revenue for the league is very high. Look at the following chart of post-1994 strike revenue vs. player salaries:  While the two lines trend together over the long term, there are some regions that are very different - particularly in 2001-2004 and 2008-2012 where player salaries were well above the trend line compared to the MLB revenue.  Some of the major CBA changes were in direct result of these differences.  Note that the latest CBA seems to have finally had enough impact that the players' line is below the MLB line for the first time since 1998. A full salary cap would guarantee it stayed below or on the trend line.  Hence why the owners - who are almost all businessmen who want to run a successful business, Jerry Reinsdorf aside - want a full salary cap.  And conversely, the MLBPA would prefer not to have one, so salaries can be higher thanks to free market bidding. One note about the NBA: Because of the NBA's very ... odd ... salary cap, it actually has less fairness.  That's because Lebron-type players are badly underpaid due to the player-salary limit.  NFL and NHL style salary caps are much more fair in terms of evening out competition.  They also reward good front offices though - which is probably why they have fewer 'new winners' compared to the MLB. They also have less trading than the MLB of future talent for now talent, meaning that teams like the Rays, the Royals, the A's, etc. can grow on relatively small salaries by trading their good players away for future prospects who will be much cheaper.  MLB also has a far more limited salary structure for newer players - most players play three full seasons for almost nothing and three more at very low rates before becoming free agents, as opposed to the NFL (rookie salaries are limited, but far less so than MLB) or NBA."
Tactics to counter pushing,"If it is a particular player and you see him coming at you, it is not illegal to position yourself to take the push. Lean into the push and/or go shoulder to shoulder with the player. If someone gets physical with you, you have to get physcial back. Obviously, I don't mean fighting and confronting the player, but you can't just give up the physical battle with someone. Outmuscling opponents is part of the game. Alternativley, you could just flop and call for the foul. This is also a part of the game... although it is a strategy that is looked down upon, and is actually techinically illegal."
Lowest championship finishing position for a defending champion,"After winning the 1952 and 1953 World Championships, Alberto Ascari only finished 25th in the 1954 Championship. He failed to finish any of the four races he entered that season, and his only points came from setting the fastest laps at the British and Spanish GPs (the former was shared wih six other drivers, hence his bizarre final points tally of 1 1/7).

New soccer ball for 2014 World Cup,"Soccer balls are a bit different from the balls in other sports. They are often very colorful and are a significant part of the brands of the companies that make them. Unlike in sports like Baseball and American Football where a couple of suppliers make all of the baseballs for pretty much all levels of the game, and they are all identicle except the occasional logo, soccer ball manufacturers make new balls all the time (every year, multiple times a year). These balls usually have unique color schemes, different stitch and panel patterns, all designed for different amounts of visibility, aerodynamics and other properties.  The World Cup ball is special though. It's the signature ball that people will remember for four years. It usually includes colors and designs that are relevant to the home country. The Brazuca is a colorful ball with the star pattern that can be seen on the Brazilian flag. I'm sure there is a huge marketing schpiel, but mostly this is part of creating an enduring symbol for the World Cup. While the Brazuca seems to be largely uncontroversial (literally the first WC ball in my memory to not have a volume of negative articles written about it), the Jabulani from the South Africa WC had a lot of complaints about it's aerodynamics, causing long shots to float and knuckle in ways that made them very difficult on keepers.

What's the etymology of the term Red Zone?,"Joe Gibbs, the former Washington Redskins coach (1981–1992, 2004-2007), is widely credited with making the phrase popular in a Washington Post article in 1982. Supposedly, he tried to use it to motivate his 1981 team that was off to a terrible 0-4 start and had the worst offensive efficiency in the league when inside their opponents' 20 yard line. The concept behind the phrase was created by a statistician (Dave Plati) working for the Denver Broncos in 1980, in which he was given free reign to create new statistics, so he began tracking offensive efficiency inside the opponent's 20 yard line. Joe Theissman, the famed Washington Redskins quarterback from the early 80's, remarks in his book The Complete Idiot's Guide to Football: ""The red zone was so named because it represents the area where a red flashing light should go off. Don Shula, long-time NFL coach, called it the green zone because that was where the money was made. However, it was originally a military phrase used for an area that was particularly dangerous, i.e., an area within firing range of the enemy that had no cover. The first documented use I can find of the phrase was during WW1, when areas of France were so devastated that they were deemed uninhabitable by humans and labeled ""zone rouge"" (which means ""red zone"" in English). They often contained unexploded ordinance, toxic chemicals, dangerous gasses, and many human remains, and the French government passed laws to temporarily (or permanently in some cases) keep humans from inhabiting or building on the areas.

"Football - Who gets the match ball, if 2 or more players score hat-tricks in a game?","As usual, the very excellent The Knowledge series of The Guardian has an answer. The January 28, 2004 entry goes like this: ""On Sunday, Empoli drew 3-3 with Juventus, Tommaso Rocchi bagging a hat-trick for the home side, and David Trezeguet claiming all three goals for Juve,"" says Stuart Bruce. ""With the scorers of hat-tricks traditionally claiming the match ball, who gets to take it home in a situation like this? Has there ever been a situation of three or more players all with a valid claim to the match ball in any one match?"" But, we have consulted with the FA stattos on this one and are told that though there are no rules, the convention would in all likelihood be that the first player to score a hat-trick would receive the match ball. Thus, as Rocchi completed his hat-trick in the 62nd minute, 14 minutes before Trezeguet made it 3-3, the Empoli striker should have be the one making space on his mantelpiece, which we hope is level or else the ball will keep rolling off it. As far as your second question goes Stuart, there are in fact several examples of three players scoring a hat-trick in one game. The last instance - which, incidentally, is also the last instance of a team scoring 10 goals in an English league game - comes from November 7 1987, when Manchester City beat Huddersfield Town 10-1 in the old Second Division.

"What is the ""Magic Spray""?",The spray is actually a burst of very cold water/mist with ingredients to help/make it cool (I don't have one on hand to know what is inside). The term 'magic' can refer to its history and the seemingly miraculous way the player gets back on his feet. It is cold because it can help with reducing inflammation which in turn can reduce pain on knocks / joints.  You may also get a heat spray which can help muscles. reference
"Who are the ""Olympic Athletes from Russia""?","The Russian Olympic Committee was suspended from the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games as a result of state-sponsored doping and testing fraud in the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games. They are disallowed from any national presence at the Games. 42 Russian athletes were banned and had medals stripped as a result. Athletes from Russia were permitted to apply and compete individually (respectively, as individual teams in sports such as curling or bobsled) apart from 28 whose bans were overturned but remain uninvited 11 whose appeals against bans were denied 3 whose appeals will not be completed until after the Games end along with those who did not otherwise qualify or meet the conditions required. After passing all tests and meeting conditions, 169 athletes were permitted to compete as Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR). As with previous cases, they compete as independent athletes wearing a neutral uniform under the Olympic flag with the Olympic anthem."
Lowest score that has never scored by a batsman in an innings?,"For Tests and ODIs, Fillet's answer is correct: The lowest score that has never been scored in a Test innings remains 229, which is also the lowest score never achieved in any international, and the lowest score that has never been scored in ODIs remains 155. However, there were three innings of 82* in Twenty20 Internationals in 2016:

The current lowest score that has never been achieved in a Twenty20 International is 92:

The method used to find these scores was the following Bash command: class=1 is for Test matches; this can be changed to class=2 for ODIs, class=3 for Twenty20 Internationals, and class=11 for all internationals."
What is the Spider 2 Y Banana?,"This is an example of play calling in the West Coast Offense.  The play call itself could be called something else in another offensive scheme.  Here is a breakdown of the playcall and terms: This play would be preceded by calling out a formation.  An example is ""Green Right Strong Slot Spider Y 2 Banana"".  Green right strong slot is the formation that the offense will line up in. The play unfolds as a play action power run with the halfback, the full back shows block and continues into the flat and is the primary receiver.  The secondary receiver is the tight end (Y receiver). The video shows the play that unfolds with the quarterback throwing to the tight end on the banana route."
"If a college player declares for the draft early and doesn't get drafted, can he go back to school?","Regarding the NFL and NBA drafts, once a college player declares for the draft, irrespective of whether he gets drafted or not, he cannot play college sports again. Source: This  The deadline for underclassmen, sophomores and juniors, to declare themselves eligible for the NFL draft is in January. Once a player declares for the draft, they forego their remaining eligibility to play college football, which means that once they declare for the draft they cannot return to play in college. And this. College players who have finished their four-year college eligibility are automatically eligible for selection, while the underclassmen have to declare their eligibility and give up their remaining college eligibility."
"If grunting is not related to performance, why do tennis players do it excessively?","You should look at the question in the eyes of two sides who play the game.
The first is the ""Grunting"" player and the second is his opponent. From ""Grunting"" player side their coaches and trainers sometimes 
claim it helps a player's timing and physiological release of hitting the ball. Nick Bollettieri, seen by many as the world's top tennis coach, and whose proteges include many of the noisiest players, says grunting is natural, not planned. ""I prefer to use the word 'exhaling'. I think that if you look at
  other sports, weightlifting or doing squats or a golfer when he
  executes the shot or a hockey player, the exhaling is a release of
  energy in a constructive way,"" says Bollettieri, speaking to the BBC
  News Magazine.     ""If you hold your lips tightly, you're not breathing
  and you become very tense and less flexible so you get tight more
  quickly Louise Deeley, a sports psychologist at Roehampton University explain: ""The timing of when they actually grunt helps them with the rhythm of
  how they're hitting and how they're pacing things, It may be
  that their perception is that if they grunt, they are hitting it
  harder. It's going to give you confidence and a sense of being in
  control of your game."" And world class tennis players such as Serena Williams are not alone
  in their loud grunts. ""When people are exercising on their own,
  they'll use things like how they breathe in and out as a rhythm, They may make similar kinds of noises to [the grunts]."" From other side it sometimes can affect opponent's performance. Tennis great Martina Navratilova summed up the problem with grunting in a Sunday Times column last year:  ""It affected my game because to me it is important to hear the ball
  hit the racket; you can hear a bad shot before you can see it and the
  sound is an imperative part of the game."" A recent study has shown that distracting noises during tennis games can affect an opponent's performance. 33 undergrad tennis players to view videos of a tennis shot being hit
  toward them and to quickly judge whether the ball would go to their
  left or right.    After measuring their response and accuracy when only
  hearing the sound of the ball on the racket, he then introduced an
  extraneous noise similar to a grunt at the instant the ball was
  struck. The students' response time and accuracy of direction
  prediction decreased significantly when the sound was included. So to sum up I think most tennis players who grunt do it because players simply need to grunt as they swing, it’s probably more relevant to ask if it’s dramatized. Some players might exaggerate their grunts simply to surprise or throw off their opponent. Source"
What is the difference between australian rules football and rugby?,"The major differences are in the shape of the pitch (oval vs rectangle), the methods of passing (any direction from the hand not just backwards), the number of players on a team (18 vs 15 or 13), the number of posts to score through (4 not 2, no crossbar) and the methods of scoring (through the posts, not touching down).  It would probably be easier to just say that the similarities are in that they have a similar shaped ball. "
What is the job of the Assistant Coach in the NFL?,"Typically, in NFL and other sports, assistant coaches are responsible for a particular aspect of the team, while the head coach is responsible for the overall direction of the team. For example in football you might have a quarterback coach, an offensive line coach, a running back coach, a kicking coach, a special teams coach, an athletic fitness coach, many of whom are given the title of assistant coach. Their job is to provide specific and expert direction in their areas. This isn't to say that the head coach wouldn't also be an expert in all areas of his team, because it would be bad if he wasn't. But his level of expertise will not be that of the specific coaches, unless he happened to grow out of that position or coaching position before being promoted to head coach. It is very common for someone to be promoted to head coach and keep the responsibilities he held before promotion (especially in interim promotions). Some teams do have a specific title of ""Assistant Head Coach"" - their responsibility is to act as the enforcers of the plan set forth by the head coach. The head coach can only supervise so many things at a time - some clubs feel the need for the extra management. Only two NFL clubs have an ""Assistant Head Coach"" position that is not also another type of coach like Offensive Line or Defensive Line - Kansas City and St. Louis. It could be a regional thing, both those teams have had a pretty rocky couple years lately, so it could just be that they wanted the extra emphasis on following the team direction. I can't find a reference for it, but I would assume that for the teams that have Assistant Head Coaches that are also another type of coach (about half of them do) that if for some reason the Head Coach were unavailable, incapacited, or otherwise unable to perform his duties, that the Assistant Head Coach would take his position."
Which is the fifth in the Big Five of European football leagues?,"French Ligue 1 is de-facto considered to be in top 5 for several reasons: Higher salaries: UEFA report, 2018 (pdf link, page 84):
 Daily Mail article, 2014:
 Besides that, the only practical scenario when being in top 5 actually matters is when deciding the winner of prestigious Golden Shoe award: Golden Shoe is awarded based on a points system where the weightings are determined by the league's ranking on the UEFA coefficients. Goals scored in the top five leagues are multiplied by a factor of two, so players in tougher leagues have better chances to win."
When can you get up again after falling on the ground?,"Since you specified American football with no indication to which league you are asking about (although I presume NFL due to your scenario), I will cover drastically different rules for the same scenario in two different leagues. One important thing to note is that the ball carrier with possession of the ball can fall to the ground...and get back up to resume the play if said player has not been touched by a defender, given the player does not declare himself down (see Rule 7, Section 2, Article 1-d).  This is covered in Rule 7, Section 2, Article 1-a of the NFL rulebook: An official shall declare the ball dead and the down ended: when a runner is contacted by an opponent and touches the ground with
    any part of his body other than his hands or feet. The ball is dead
    the instant the runner touches the ground... Note: If, after contact by an opponent, any part of a runner’s leg
    above the ankle or any part of his arm above the wrist touches the
    ground, the runner is down. Aside: I recall a playoff game in which Marvin Harrison fell to the ground after catching the ball, and since no defender touched him to declare him down, he got back up and ran for a touchdown. When can you get up again after falling on the ground? Immediately...at least with respect to making an effort to get back up to resume the play. Is there a time limit for getting up to resume play? Yes. This falls under declaring himself down. This is covered in Rule 7, Section 2, Article 1-d-1: An official shall declare the ball dead and the down ended: when a runner declares himself down by:  falling to the ground, or
      kneeling, and clearly making no immediate effort to advance Unlike the NFL, the ball carrier with possession of the ball cannot fall to the ground and get back up to resume the play. The ball is dead upon touching the ground by anything other than your hands and feet.  This is covered in Rule 4, Article 3-b in the NCAA rulebook: A live ball becomes dead and an official shall sound his
  whistle or declare it dead: When any part of the ball carrier’s body, except his hand or foot,
    touches the ground or when the ball carrier is tackled or otherwise
    falls and loses possession of the ball as he contacts the ground with any
    part of his body, except his hand or foot  Note the difference between NFL and NCAA rules. In the NFL, the ball is dead when the runner is contacted by a defender and touches the ground. In the NCAA, the ball is dead when the runner touches the ground or is tackled to the ground."
Why do batsmen usually ask a fielder to tie their shoelaces?,"If a batsman has to tie his own shoelaces, he has to remove his gloves, and also look around his pads. Try wearing pads, kneeling down, and tying your shoelaces. You'll see the pads do seem to get in the way. Also, it's not like the batsman walks very far to ask a fielder/umpire to do this. He only asks the nearest person to him (who can tie his laces without much bother) to help him out, be it a fielder or an umpire. But its not that a batsman cannot tie his own laces. I have seen plenty of cases where the batsman does it himself (like you mentioned, usually when there is nobody nearby to help). He just asks a fielder/umpire because it is less of a hassle and usually, fielders/umpires are glad to help out. Cricket is said to be the ""gentleman's game"" after all."
How can F1 teams be competitive if they produce engines for each other?,"There is far more to F1 than just engines, so even if a team is losing some competitiveness by selling their engines to a rival, they still have other areas where they can compete. In F1, engines are very expensive, typically around $3M per unit.  Imagine 4 engines for each car during the season, that's $24M alone for each team to spend.  But having said that, by far the biggest cost regards engines, is the development cost, you can easily spend $100M developing an engine, so most of the smaller teams buy their engines, as on their budgets developing their own is simply not possible. http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing/fia-must-cap-f1-engine-costs-says-former-top-adviser-9874319.html A lot of the midfield and smaller teams survive on budgets of under $100M a season, some on around half that amount, so they are forced to buy their engines. With recent changes to F1, trying to cut costs to make the sport more feasible, the engine manufacturers are encouraged to sell their engines to the other teams. Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault have all sold their engines to other teams in the past. It's difficult to say if the engines sold are identical or not to those used by the ""works"" teams - officially they are identical. However, in 2014 the Mercedes team radically changed the design of their engines and their customer teams, Williams, McLaren and Force India, didn't find out until very late and so this may have compromised their car design: http://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12472/9243875/revealed-how-mercedes-packaging-of-their-turbo-engine-has-given-them-the-edge The ""works"" team always has a bit of an advantage over the customer teams for this reason, they can plan ahead for engine changes and they get a head start in designing their car around the engine. For the team selling the engines, they get a bit of extra revenue to pay for all that R&D but also they get extra data back from their customers so they can refine the design, maybe iron out some glitches that may make it sub-optimal in terms of performance and reliability. But engines are not everything in F1.  Last season Mercedes were generally accepted to have the best engine while Red Bull struggled with the Renault engine which was regarded as being well down on power.  However, at Singapore for one, Mercedes struggled and Red Bull were competitive.  Chassis and aerodynamic design are also very important.  Even if Enzo Ferrari did once say ""Aerodynamics are for people who can't build engines!"" You usually find the works teams do well not only because they have their own engines, but because they tend to have most money as well! Now, if Honda can sort themselves out they may mean McLaren can challenge the front-runners, but not for another season or two probably. This is all relevant to the health of F1 as the smaller teams cannot compete with the bigger teams and it's a vicious circle as you need money to compete but need to be competitive to earn that money.  There is talk of a price limit on engines that would help a little bit. http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/121526 Ultimately, if there were no manufacturers selling engines to the teams, the sport would die, or it would be Ferrari vs Renault vs Mercedes vs McLaren (currently) with just the 4 teams on the grid - unless you go down the route of GP2 for example and make it a spec series with all the cars being identical."
Is there a limit on the number of events that a track and field athlete may enter in one meet?,"I looked through the IAAF Competition Rules [PDF]. The most relevant piece I saw was rule 142.3, Simultaneous Entries, which basically permits the referee to allow a participant to compete in the high jump or pole vault out-of-order. I didn't find anything from the IOC, but I doubt they'd impose an extra limit (especially considering the apparent lack of one in swimming). Plus, the rules are focused on preventing athletes from gaining an unfair advantage, I don't think more events are going to help an athlete gain an advantage. There may be high-school athletic associations that limit event entries, IIRC my high school association had a limit of four, which couldn't all be the same area (Track|Field), e.g. 3 track and a field event."
Is Fartlek more effective than regular training [closed],"To me, fartlek is not just fun. As our body is a very adaptive system, if one sticks to a training routine long enough, his body gets used to it, and thus will not make much improvement. So variation is the key (at least to me and itself is fun) so that fartlek can trick the body to keep adapting to different training intensity and condition, thus it can be effective than, but not replace, regular training."
"Are players allowed to convert a penalty kick into a ""multiple passes goal""? [duplicate]","Yes, absolutely. There are essentially only two major restrictions on play after a penalty kick: The player taking the penalty kick must kick the ball forward [...] The kicker must not play the ball again until it has touched another player. So long as those restrictions are met, the ball is in play as in normal play and anything goes."
How does retired hurt and absent hurt affect career average?,"Law 2 in the ICC Law Book states that, Batsman retiring A batsman may retire at any time during his innings when the ball is dead. The umpires, before allowing play to proceed shall be informed of the reason for a batsman retiring. (a)    If a batsman retires because of illness, injury or any other unavoidable cause, he is entitled to resume his innings subject to (c) below. If for any reason he does not do so, his innings is to be recorded as ‘Retired - not out’. (b)    If a batsman retires for any reason other than as in (a) above, he may resume his innings only with the consent of the opposing captain. If for any reason he does not resume his innings it is to be recorded as ‘Retired - out’. (c)    If after retiring a batsman resumes his innings, it shall be only at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of another batsman. Retired Hurt:
If a batsman falls ill or gets injured while batting, he may retire with the umpires permission. At the end of the teams innings, if this batsman does not return to bat, he is considered 'Retired Hurt' and is considered not-out. Statistics-wise, the runs scored by him will be added to his career total as well as the innings. However, as average is calculated by ""Runs scored / ( Innings - Not outs )"", the denominator would not be affected by this game, as he is still not out. As long as he has scored a run or more before retiring hurt, it effectively means his career average will be better at the end of the game than it did at the start of it. Absent-Hurt:
This is a scenario where a batsman is not able to come to the pitch to bat even without facing a ball, due to prior illness or injury. In this case, no runs will be added to his career stats and therefore, will not affect this average as neither will the (Innings - not outs) change. So, his batting average prior to the game is the same as that at the end of it. Retired out:
If a batsman retired without the umpire's consent and if he does not have permission from the opposing captain, then he is considered 'Retired-out'. This is considered as a dismissal. Only two batsmen have retired out in an international cricket Test match. Both instances occurred in the same match, with the Sri Lankan batsmen Marvan Atapattu and Mahela Jayawardene retiring out."
Is it possible to change playing styles in cricket?,"The batsman can change his stance whenever he likes. See Pieterson's switch hitting and the discussion on ESPN here - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2t3ja3sZ5M In terms of bowling, I believe that you are not able to swap the sides of the wicket you bowl from or which hand you bowl from without first informing the batsman. Theres no reason you can't change the style from medium to spin, I've seen people do this when having a bad over."
Are there any rules regarding the position of the Wicket Keeper?,"From the relevant law: If by his actions and positioning it is apparent to the umpires that he will not be able to discharge his duties as a wicket-keeper, he shall forfeit this right [to gloves and external leg guards] and also the right to be recognised as a wicket-keeper for the purposes of [other laws]. I haven't seen the incident, but the umpire evidently opined that standing at the 30-yard circle is not a suitable position to discharge the duties as a wicket-keeper.  Which is probably reasonable, because the fielding side was probably trying to have an extra ""normal"" fielder to stop runs rather than someone tending to the wicket.  So the umpire advised the player to either come closer to a position suitable for a wicket-keeper, or he would have to take off his gloves and leg guards.  The alternative would be that the umpire does not advise the fielder and immediately calls him for illegal fielding, but that's not how things are typically done."

What is the advantage of wearing polyester for basketball?,"The reason for using polyester is, Provide support and ventilation. Absorbs water and transfers body perspiration away from the skin. Prevent sweat buildup. Although this material dries quickly, the sweat is expelled onto the
outer layers of the garment and wind may cause the player to feel
cold. It is best to wear in hot or humid conditions."
