How can I chop onions without crying?,"The tearing of the eyes is a result of enzymes that form a sulpherous gas when the onion is cut (concentrated inside the inner core or bulb of the onion) being released into the surrounding air.  You have a few options to avoid this - one would be to not cut through the center of the onion but to extract the ""core"". This is kind of a pain and means you are discarding a decent chunk of onion, so I don't like it too much.  Another option is to use a fan to blow the gases away from you. A small fan next to you blowing horizontally should do the trick. You could also wear goggles, although you'd have to leave them on for a while until the gas dissipates from the area. Another technique is to cut a lemon in half and rub the fresh lemon against both sides of the blade. You'll have to keep ""refreshing"" the juice coat and your onions will have some lemon juice on them, so this is somewhat limited by that factor."
Translating cooking terms between US / UK / AU / CA / NZ,"US : jam/jelly/preserves/etc In the US, there are specific definitions from the Food & Drug Administration on what can be labeled as jam, jelly, etc. From CookingLight.com, but preserved here in case of link rot: Jelly is a clear, bright product. It is generally made by cooking fruit juice and sugar with pectin as a jelling agent and lemon juice as an acid to maintain a consistent texture. Jelly is firm and will hold its shape (it 'shakes'). Generally, jelly contains no pieces of fruit, although specialty jellies, like pepper jelly, may include pieces of jalapeño or other pepper.  Jam is made from crushed or chopped fruit cooked with sugar, and often pectin and lemon juice. Jam can be a purée of fruit or have a soft pulp, but it does not contain chunks of fruit.  Preserves are fruit cooked with sugar to the point where large chunks of fruit or whole fruit, such as berries, are suspended in a syrup base. The texture of preserves is not smooth like jelly or jam.  Marmalade is a soft jelly, often citrus-based, that includes both the flesh and peel of the fruit suspended throughout the jelly base. The bitterness of the peel offsets the sweetness of the jelly.  Conserve is a mixture of more than one fruit, often with added nuts and raisins, that is cooked until it becomes thick. It is used as a spread for breads, pastries and meats, and in the latter use is closest to chutney. Chutney is a spiced condiment of Indian origin (chatni is the Hindi word for strongly spiced) made of fruit or vegetables. It is typically served as an accompaniment to food, not as a spread. The spice level can range from mild to hot, and the consistency from a fine relish to a preserve or conserve. Fruit chutney consists of chopped fruit, vinegar, spices and sugar cooked into a chunky sweet-tart-spicy mix: according to one explanation, it 'blurs the Western distinction between preserves and pickles.'  Fruit Butter, such as apple butter or prune butter, is fruit purée or pulp combined with sugar, lemon juice and spices, slowly cooked down to a smooth consistency. The 'butter' refers to its spreadability: there is no actual butter in the product.  Fruit Curd is a creamy spread made with sugar, eggs and butter, generally flavored with citrus juice and zest.  Fruit Spread is generally a reduced-calorie product made with fruit juice concentrate and low-calorie sweeteners replacing all or part of the sugar."
Why add salt to the water when cooking pasta?,"The salt adds flavor, but it also helps reduce the gelatinization of the starch in the pasta.  The starch in food is the form of microscopic grains.  When these grains come into contact with water, they will trap some of it (think cornstarch in cold water), but when the water is hot they swell up like balloons and merge with each other, and you have starch gelatinization. Another thing you may want to add to the pasta water is some acid (lemon or cream of tartar).  Tap water in most cities is made alkaline, which increases the starch loss from the pasta to the water, making the pasta stickier."
Why would boiling milk in an electric kettle break the kettle?,"The electric kettle is (clearly) not designed for this. The main issue is that milk doesn't evaporate, whereas water (obviously) does. The secondary reason is that milk will burn. Milk is a complex mixture of water, fats, and proteins. The fats and proteins will separate out from the water when heated, and form a layer on top. Unfortunately, this layer prevents the water from evaporating - it traps it. This is what causes milk to boil over. Incidentally, the reason potato or pasta water boils over is due to the starch. The way kettles turn off is by steam reaching the top of the kettle, rushing down a tube and causing a bi-metallic plate to expand unevenly, tripping the switch. No steam means the kettle will never turn off. Because the kettle doesn't turn off, the element continues to heat the milk next to it. With water, the hot water will rise, rather than stick to the element. This means leaving the lid open won't cause a fire - at least not until all your water has boiled away. Unfortunately, milk will burn, and this layer of burnt milk will prevent effective heat dissipation - the milk in contact with the element is not moving throughout the remainder of the liquid. This causes the element to get hotter than it is meant to. However, kettle manufacturers have thought this through - they don't want their products to catch on fire (well, most don't) - even when they are misused like this. They will have included a small (one time) temperature switch, like this one. This acts a little like a fuse, but for heat, not current. They are often called ""thermal fuses"" for this reason. When the element reaches a temperature which has been deemed ""too hot"" (probably around 190ºC, perhaps a little hotter) this switch is tripped, and electricity can no longer reach the element. This is normally a permanent state. You could open the kettle, find the temperature, voltage and current rating for the thermal fuse, buy one on eBay or Amazon and replace it (you would have to crimp, not solder, for obvious reasons), and be confident it was installed safely, in good thermal contact with the element. But if I'm honest, it's sensible to just buy a new kettle."
What is this colored fiber in my chicken?,"It's called deep pectoral myopathy or ""green muscle disease"", and it's a problem with heavy breasted poultry. The vessels are unable to supply enough blood to the muscle, with the result of death of the muscles affected. It's not detectable until the chicken is cut open. By the time you see the green colour, muscle death occurred a couple of weeks prior and fibrous woody tissue has developed. Since breeding practices for roaster chickens and turkeys often favor heavy-breasted poultry, this is likely to be found more often until that changes. There is no odour or bacterial growth with this, and the meat itself is safe to eat, though no one would eat the green part. The Occurrence of Deep Pectoral Myopathy in Roaster Chickens, from The Journal of Applied Poultry Research, has extensive info available about it."
Is it possible to cook a whole fish in a dishwasher?,"Cooking in a dishwasher is related to some other non-orthodox places to cook, like on the manifold of a car on a road trip. Basically, you're aiming to put food in an environment that's somewhere between 160F (71C) and 300F (150C) already, for non-cooking reasons. That's strange, but not entirely nuts. The dishwasher is going to stay south of 212F (100C), but, a decent dishwasher doesn't stay very far below that threshold.  It's going to go through several variations of how that heat's applied, from the actual washing cycle to the drying cycle. And, if you run a regular cycle of dishes, there's going to be a bunch of foreign substances (soap, food bits from the dishes (and in the car manifold situation, things like oil)) all around it. So, your goal is to wrap the food in something that can both handle the heat and seal out the foreign stuff. To me, the most obvious solution to this is the vacuum sealed pouches used for sous vide. You're not going to get anything remotely close to the consistent temps for sous vide, but for the dishwasher, you're still talking about mostly cooking in ""hot water"" and hot, moist air, so that's close enough to give a shot.  So, I'd fill the pouch with seasonings/marinades and let it ride and see what comes out. I wouldn't expect it to be great, but it might be worth a shot for the shock value alone."
How can I tell the difference between a rabbit and a cat?,"In Germany we have an old (joking) saying that roughly translates to ""head off, tail off - bunny"", so your question is legitimate. But first thing's first: There is no health risk1 involved if you ate the latest shipment of ""meowling rabbit"". (To cat lovers everywhere: This is no endorsement, I have a much loved and pampered cat, too!) The most obvious differences are But I suspect these would be removed prior to sale, so we'd have to dig a bit deeper into anatomy: Shoulder blades: 
Cats' shoulder blades are rounded on top, especially in the front, making the shoulder blade almost semicircular with the ridge making for two differently shaped parts, rabbits' shoulder blades are triangular with the ridge somewhat parallel to the front side.  Femur (thigh bone):
A cat's femora are straight, whereas a rabbit's is more or less bent, especially pronounced in older animals. Same applies to a lesser extent to radius and ulna (forearm), but they might have been removed. Ribs:
Cats' ribs are ""rounder"" than rabbits' ribs according to this source. I can't say by how much, but @aitchnyu's comment below suggests the difference is obvious enough to play a significant role in the novel/movie Papillon. Pelvis:
The same source as above states that the foramen obturatum (= the loop-like opening near/below the hip joint) is oval in rabbits and round in cats. I couldn't find a good picture to show this, though. Here's a rabbit:

How do you properly cook a steak?,"You should be able to get a reasonable steak stovetop using a cast iron grill pan, if you have a strong enough exhaust. Oil the cast iron pan (with canola or such), then heat it very hot, until it starts to smoke. Make sure the meat is completely dry on the outside (wipe with a paper towel, water will prevent browning) and gently place in the pan. Leave it there for a minute or two (it'll smoke quite a bit!), rotate 90° to get the nice grill marks. Leave for another minute or two. Flip, and repeat for the other side. It may splatter, have a splatter screen handy. It will smoke, quite a bit, make sure the exhaust is on high. You will probably have a medium-rare steak now. Using a thinner cut will make it more well done (you can cut a thick steak in half with your chef's knife, making two thin steaks); so will plopping it in the oven (not sure if you want the oven before or after searing, I like 'em medium rare...). Remember to let the meat rest for 5 minutes or so before serving. Also, if your steaks are coming out ridiculously tough, you're probably using the wrong cut of meat, or some terrible grade. What cut are you using? [edit: I should note that, in case it wasn't obvious, the burner should be up pretty high] Edit by rumtscho There is a reason this answer specifies a cast iron pan. If you are limited in your cookware choice, pay attention to the maximum temperature your pan can tolerate. If you are using a non-stick pan, you have to go on medium heat and wait longer, else you'll damage the pan. (And sorry, but you can't get it as tasty as on high heat that way). "
Why use milk in scrambled eggs?,"Well, it makes the eggs go further for one... But it also produces softer, creamier results. You're moving toward something like a custard or quiche. If you like your eggs very stiff, this is probably a bad idea."
Is it safe to leave butter at room temperature?,"Try a butter crock. This will keep your butter fresh at room temperature for a fairly long time (weeks, not days)."
"Do you heat the pan first, then add oil? Or put the oil in and heat up with the pan?","The typical rule of thumb is that if it's a non-stick pan you do add a little oil to the pan first before heating.  Most manufacturers usually recommend this to extend the life of the non-stick coating. For regular pans (those without non-stick coating) you should heat them dry until you can feel the heat radiating from the surface when your hand is held about 6-inches above the bottom.  Add your oil at this point.  You'll actually need to use less oil because the same amount will spread across a greater surface area due to its decreased viscosity as it heats.  Plus, your oil will heat up instantly and when you add your food it's less inclined to stick.  Most people get impatient waiting for pans to heat (and in general) and this also ensures that the food isn't going into a pan with oil that's cold or not hot enough.  When cold oil goes into a pan and cold food ends up on top of it you'll end up with one big sticky mess.  As for adding oil before heating the pan, the longer fats heat without anything else in the pan, the quicker they'll break down and burn.  "
Why did my banana catch fire in the microwave?,"It's caused by the high amount of potassium in the banana. Microwaves react with metals, bouncing off and cause arcing. You can even create a cool light show by putting a raw peeled banana in the microwave. Don't worry, it won't explode, but it will make a mess, it's also harmless. This can also happen in some frozen vegetables depending on the soil conditions they grew in. As noted in the linked article, other high concentrations of metals such as magnesium, iron, and zinc can be the responsible mineral. Momentary brief sparking is harmless and won't harm your microwave, but the USDA recommends turning off your microwave if you see sparks nonetheless. If it does start a fire, unless it's a very small fire, do not open your microwave door. The safest thing is to turn off the microwave and let the fire burn itself out by consuming all the oxygen. Opening the door could create a dangerous backdraft induced fireball.  See Also:"
Is it safe to eat potatoes that have sprouted?,"Not safe enough for me to try it. Potatoes actually contain a very dangerous toxin called solanine. This toxin is concentrated enough in the green parts in the plant to cause solanine poisoning. This includes the sprouts/eyes, and the potato itself if it's green. This article from the New York Times health guide indicates that it is something to be taken seriously. Per this article, if the sprouts have been removed, and the potato is not green then it is safe to eat as far as solanine poisoning is concerned.  However, a potato as far gone as you have described sounds disgusting. A soft potato is on its way to going bad. Where I am from, potatoes are cheap enough that it's just not worth the gross factor for me to eat a potato that has 10 cm sprouts and is squishy. I do eat potatoes that have little nub sprouts on them and that are slightly less than firm, after removing the sprouts of course."
How do you peel garlic easily?,"Even with a whole bulb, break it into cloves. Put clove(s) on a cutting board. I usually cut off the root end of each clove. Lay a large chef's knife flat on the clove, then smack the knife to crush the clove.  This breaks the skin of the clove and makes it much easier to peel."
Why do grape-flavored foods taste different than actual grapes?,"Concord grapes, which most grape jellies/jams/preserves in the US are made from, are derived from the (US-native) ""fox grape"" (Vitis labrusca) rather than (Europe-native) wine grape (Vitis vinifera). Common table grapes (the ones eaten as fresh fruit) such as Thompson seedless are also derived from Vitis vinifera wine grapes.  Fox grapes have a ""foxy"" taste character, which is a result of the presence of the naturally occurring compound methyl anthranilate. Methyl anthranilate is a rather simple compound, and is used in many situations as an ""artificial grape flavor"". In many cases ""grape flavored"" candies, drinks and medicines are flavored not with grape extracts, but with synthetically produced methyl anthranilate. As such, these artificially flavored foods taste like Concord grapes (fox grapes), rather than table or wine grapes. While it would be possible to come up with ""artificial wine grape"" flavor, the flavor profile of wine and table grapes is not dominated by a single compound, as fox grapes are. Therefore, any such ""artificial wine grape"" flavor would be much more expensive than artificial Concord grape flavor (i.e. just methyl anthranilate). As such, when companies reach for ""grape flavor"", they tend to go for the more inexpensive Concord grape flavor. This also adds to the persistent expectation (at least in the US) as to what ""grape flavored"" means. Even if you came out with a wine-grape-flavored Jolly Rancher, many in the US would think it wouldn't taste right, as they expect grape flavored things to taste like Concord grapes."
"What knives are ""required"" for a serious home kitchen?","There are three core essentials: You may want to check out Alton Brown's book, Alton Brown's Gear For Your Kitchen. He spends a chapter on knives and where to go past the essentials. He also suggests which ones are worth spending money on and which should be throwaways."
Is it safe to put hot food in the fridge?,"Two problems: Hot or warm food will briefly warm up the air and therefore to some degree the food already in fridge, especially items immediately near it. Cycling temperatures does not help fresh food quality or life. Modern fan forced fridges may suffer this problem less. It is very power inefficient to do this. Just let it cool on the bench until it reaches a cooler temperature and then place it in the refrigerator. Use any of the well-documented and appropriate techniques to cool food quickly and safely if it is going to longer than 2 hours to cool."
Browning Avocados - What Helps?,"See the improved answer here: What DOES Help? Which acid works best to keep avocados from browning? Answer: None (of the acids tested) It's not that acid doesn't do much to help. ALL OF THE ACIDS TESTED CAUSED AVOCADOS TO BECOME MORE BROWN AND TO BECOME BROWN FASTER THAN NO TREATMENT AT ALL I am not kidding. Method For acid, I used freshly squeezed lemon juice, freshly squeezed lime juice, distilled white vinegar (diluted to 5% acidity), and Ball brand Fruit Fresh mixed per package instructions, 2 tsp powder to 3 TBS water. Fruit Fresh contains dextrose, ascorbic acid, citric acid and silicon dioxide. According to the label, 1/4 tsp of the powder contains 230% of the US RDA of Vitamin C (ascorbic acid). That roughly translates to the solution I used having 100X the concentration of Vitamin C of lemon juice. I was not able find anything to give me a basis for comparison of citric acid concentration. I diced 1 avocado and shuffled up the chunks so that no 1 pile had chunks from only 1 part of the fruit. I dropped the chunks into small bowls of the acids, removed the chunks, and allowed to air dry. They remained at room temperature for 24 hours. I mashed 2 avocados together and put 50 grams of the mash into each of 5 small bowls. I added 1/4 tsp of each individual acid to each bowl, leaving 1 bowl plain. I mixed thoroughly and scooped the mash onto 2 plates, 1 to be refrigerated, and 1 to be left at room temperature. I washed and dried the scoop between changes in acid. Results The diced avocados just gradually became darker over 24 hours, with the vinegar treated fruit the first to show signs of browning, and ultimately the vinegar treated fruit became the darkest. The untreated fruit resisted browning the longest and ultimately browned the least. The lemon juice and lime juice were about tied, they both significantly sped darkening and ultimately became significantly darker than the untreated fruit. The Fruit Fresh barely made any difference, but the slight difference there was, was negative. Fruit Fresh also caused the avocado to become darker and to brown faster, but just barely.  At 24 hours all of the mashed, unrefrigerated avocado had become equally brown and unappetizing, it just happened faster to the treated avocado. The difference was most dramatic at 6 hours:  It's not clearly visible in the photo, but the Fruit Fresh treated avocado was ever-so-slightly more brown than the untreated avocado. At 6 hours none of the refrigerated, mashed avocado was significantly browning.  At 24 hours all of the mashed avocado was the worse for wear. On the non-refrigerated side, it looks on this photo like the vinegar treated avocado ultimately fared the best. It actually didn't. I didn't think to snap a picture, but the vinegar treated avocado was the only one to discolor all the way through. The others were still green on the inside, the vinegar treated scoop was slightly browned even on the inside.  There came a point about 12 hours in that the refrigerated side just stopped browning. It had dried out, leaving it more green than the non-refrigerated side, but no more pleasant. All of the samples browned and dried out fairly equally. At 48 hours I had one scoop of mashed avocado left that I cared to eat.  By adding nothing, keeping it refrigerated and covered in plastic wrap clinging to the surface, so that it had no air at all, this avocado is still fresh, green and ready to eat. I'll add lime now for flavor, and some cilantro and cumin. Pass the chips. Note: I am honored that this answer has been so generously received, but the fact is, it really doesn't answer the question very well. This answer shows what doesn't help. As of 1/8/15 I have added and accepted a new answer based on new experiments that show what does help, it's HERE next to the checkmark."
Are rare burgers safe?,"Applying USDA standards (which may or may not be the 'same' as elsewhere, but (IMHO) serve as a reasonable standard for ""Safe"") Hamburger must be cooked to an internal temperature of 160°F [71°C] in order to be 'Guaranteed Safe', which is typically defined as 'well done'.  On the other hand hamburger may be perfectly safe at medium rare to rare (120°F - 49°C) depending on how the beef was raised and processed. Actual cases of serious food borne illness from even raw meat are fairly rare (or should I say uncommon? ;) ). As far as I can tell the French are doing nothing 'special' to neither decrease nor increase the risks involved. Many restaurants (in the US) will specify on their menu some thing like: All burgers cooked med-well unless otherwise requested  A variety of circumstances from acid levels in the meat to the application of dyes may cause meat to appear 'pink' but be perfectly safe, ground beef may also appear to be brown, but may not be safe at all. Pink is not necessarily a good standard.  Since you are unlikely to get an 'accurate reading' carrying your own food thermometer with you where ever you may go (if your food sits on the counter for a while before getting served the temp by the time it gets to you will be less), the best test to apply in a restaurant is 'cooked' vs. 'raw' A quick Google search ""Hamburger Rare vs. Raw"" will display a myriad of images from which you may discern what you are comfortable with.  By 'serious' food borne illness I am referring to things which might
  require a doctors care or put your life in jeopardy. While lower-grade
  illness maybe 'unpleasant' they are not necessarily 'unsafe' ""As far as I can tell"" denotes the inability to prove a negative.
  Having looked through the Anses website, particularly their
  section on 'nutrivigilence' and 'animal nutrition and welfare' looking
  for any exceptional methods (radiation treatment, quarantines,
  chemical therapies etc) that might have the goal (even if not the
  effect) of making the beef supply more safe...I found nothing to cause
  me to believe that they are actually doing anything exceptional (over
  and above US or EU standards)"
What's the best way to season a cast iron skillet?,"First, there is no difference between seasoning and re-seasoning, unless you need to do some extra work to remove rust (see instructions below). In fact, for new cast iron, scouring is also usually a good idea since you need to get off whatever wax or protective oil the manufacturer or seller may have put onto the cookware. (They don't use cooking oil for that sort of thing, believe me.) If you need to remove rust: use a mixture of salt and oil and scrub that hard into the rust, then rinse thoroughly in hot water. Use steel wool if necessary. Next, scour the pan completely under hot water. Do this for several minutes or until the water runs clean. I've heard varying things about whether soap or an SOS pad is OK at this step. My personal opinion is that it's OK, but you must wash the soap completely off before continuing with the seasoning so that your seasoning doesn't taste like soap! Coat the cookware with grease or oil. (I do this with the whole pan, not just the cooking surface, to reduce the possibility of external rust.) Crisco, vegetable oil, and lard all work well. Don't pick something with a low smoking point, or too strong a flavor. Make sure it's a light coating... you shouldn't have pools of oil anywhere on your cookware. Bake your skillet in a 250 - 350 °F (121 - 178 °C) oven for an hour. If you used liquid oil, you may want to put the cookware in upside down so excess oil drips off. But it's good to put a cookie sheet or something underneath the cookware to catch the drips if you do! Let the cookware cool, and wipe off any excess oil. For best results, do this two or three times, though a skillet can be satisfactory after a single treatment. To keep the seasoning happy: Don't let the cast iron sit too long without using it (you may notice a rancid smell or flavor if the seasoning turns bad; I'm not sure at what point this happens, but it's happened to me before). Don't cook anything acidic (e.g. tomatoes) during the first or second use of your pan. Don't use dishwashing liquid or soap on the pan (hot water and scrubbing only). After cleaning the pan after each use, wipe it lightly with another bit of oil, using simple vegetable oil. Another trick sometimes used to season Chinese woks: rub Chinese chives over the surface of the cookware when the oil is being heated (this works best on a stovetop, not in the oven). The juice of the chive has sulfur compounds that help remove remaining flavor from the previous coating of the cookware. Be aware that this technique really kicks up a lot of steam and smoke. I've never tried it on cast iron skillets, but I'd be curious if anyone out there has."
How can I keep pasta from sticking to itself?,"Italian here :) I know that the oil is a well known trick everywhere ... but Italy. The main problem about pasta is that people just tend to cook it too much. The cooking time for pasta should be between 8 and 12 minutes, above this number it will be sticky. Spaghetti is the quickest kind of pasta to get ready, so just cook it around 8-9 minutes and it won't stick."
Are there any advantages to freshly ground salt?,"Not really in terms of flavor, no. Salt doesn't have a substantial number of volatile compounds that are released by grinding, in contrast to something like whole peppercorn, which releases a range of aromatics when the outer hull is breached. Even specially-sourced salts which contain a range of flavorful minerals don't really release them into the air, they dissolve into the foods they're added to instead, and/or are picked up by your tongue as you eat. One advantage grinders offer is that a lot of them are adjustable, and can be tweaked for everything from a very fine grind to large crystals. This can be helpful depending on the effect that you're going for - seasoning popcorn with very fine salt vs. garnishing a steak with large crunchy chunks, for example. Smaller crystals with more surface area will generally tend to be perceived as saltier due to more taste bud contact, and will also dissolve into liquids (i.e. soups or stews) more quickly. I like using larger crystals sometimes for flavor/texture contrast and visual appeal for some dishes. Another advantage mentioned by others is that finely pre-ground salt may also contain anti-caking agents to keep it from clumping together. If that bothers you, a grinder gets around this because larger pieces won't stick together as much before being pulverized by the grinding mechanism. Some producers package salt in disposable grinders just as they do with pepper, and they share the same problems: cheap grinders simply aren't very good at getting a consistent grind size, or they have mechanisms which wear down quickly. Reusable grinders are often much better, and as you've seen they're getting very easy to find even in non-specialty stores. I like ceramic grinding mechanisms personally, because I feel that they get a better ""grip"" on the particles and are better at consistency, but good steel mechanisms will do well too. Here are some suggestions for care to help you get the most out of them."
Cooking away alcohol,"You will never fully cook away alcohol, only reduce the amount.  See Alcohol retention in food preparation, or for the quick table, see wikipedia. They covered this on an episode of America's Test Kitchen, and concluded that surface area matters -- a wider vessel would cook off more alcohol; it wasn't just a function of time.  "
Any benefit to buy high-quality meat for a mediocre cook?,"This is a great question, but not one that can be answered with ""yes"" or ""no"".  In some areas, it is known that the professional grade tools and ingredients require much skill to use well and so the general public is better off using consumer grade tools. (Try tasking the average office drone to create a report with Word or QuarkXpress and you'll see what I mean). But there is no such general rule in cooking. And yet, this does not mean that better quality meat will always make better quality food. It depends on the details of each situation.  First, what does ""high quality meat"" mean? A filet mignon is a prized cut, and costs much more than shank. But even the best cook cannot make a good stew out of filet mignon. So in the first place, you have to know which category of meat is suited for the dish you are making. Only within a given category will better meat produce better results.  Second, ""quality"" means different things to different people. A cooking beginner usually cannot recognize which meat will produce better results in the given category and goes by factors like price and store reputation to decide which meat must be better quality. This is not necessarily correlated to better taste. So, as a beginner, you can pick meat you believe to be better, but end up with worse results.  The combination of these two points means that you should be aware of the difference between a ""better"" cut and a higher-quality version of the same cut. A ""better"" cut is actually a different cut, so it's a substitution that usually won't guarantee a better result. But a higher-quality upgrade of the same cut is likely to make a dish better. So, you need the cooking skill to tell a given piece of meat will be a good substitution for your earlier choice (a higher-quality version) or not (it is simply a better cut). Also, if somebody is trying to sell you a different version, you need to be able to recognize its quality (marbling in steaks, color intensity in pork chops, etc.) Third, you can certainly find many cases where the more refined dishes, which need rarer, prized cuts, require a lot of skill to pull off well. So, if you decide to buy the ""better"" meat - as in the filet mignon vs. shank example - and have enough knowledge to match the dish to it, your skill might not be sufficient to pull off the dish for that meat well, while it would have been sufficient to make a good dish of the type for which the cheaper meat was suited.  Fourth, for each dish, the relative influence of skill vs. ingredient quality will be different for the final dish quality. So, it is possible that for going from ""horrible"" to ""kinda edible"" you need to get some skill, no matter what meat you use, but the jump from ""kinda edible"" to ""not that bad"" requires better meat, not better skill.  It is impossible to list all possible situations, dishes and meat cuts and say for each where the end result quality is skill-limited and where it is ingredient-limited. I am afraid that you have to be an intermediate cook before you can recognize if a mediocre cook can improve his results by cooking a given dish with better ingredients. "
What cookbooks do you always come back to? [closed],"Definitely the Joy of Cooking.  It's not a convenience cookbook for people with busy schedules or low patience - the majority of recipes in there are geared toward flavour and not specialty diets or quick prep times - but at least 9 out of 10 recipes I try in there have near-perfect flavour and texture. IMO, this should be in every cook's kitchen, even the ones that don't really use cookbooks.  It has all the classic recipes, and you never know when somebody will ask you to make Chicken Kiev."
Why did people start using CO2 (instead of e.g. oxygen) for carbonated drinks?,"CO2 tastes good! Carbonated water is actually a weak carbonic acid solution; this is what you taste. It's like ""salt and pepper"", but for water. Slightly acidic water is usually popular, hence lemon juice is sometimes used to taint a jug of water in times when no carbonated water is available. Carbonated water releases CO2 bubbles for many minutes after pressure is released (dissolved carbonic acid reforming), which is an important presentation effect that other gases do not generally have. In many countries the local water supply is slightly alkaline (due to limestone rock being very common), and this can leave a bad after-taste, and make food in your mouth taste soapy. The addition of weak acids to water helps with neutralising this effect. Around the world, some lucky towns have natural springs with effervescent water (carbonated water), and man-made carbonated water is just imitating this. In history people have often travelled great distances to try effervescent water, so its popularity is well recorded. Nitrogen is used for water pressurisation in brewing and cooking as it leaves little or no taste, and generally does not form other chemical compounds. It's used mainly when bubbles are required, but not an acidic taste. Oxygen is unsuitable for water pressurisation as very little can be dissolved at normal soda pressures, and it has no taste, but may readily form unwanted chemical compounds. In the 18th century, Joseph Priestley was the first person to document this manufacturing discovery. He noted precisely that it tasted good, and that it was similar to the German Selters water. He was discovering ""airs"" (gases), and uniquely identified quite a few different gases. CO2 was the only one he listed as tasting good. His cheap source of CO2 was the fermenting grains from the nearby brewery."
Why shallots over onions?,"Shallots certainly aren't more popular than onions, otherwise they'd be far more abundant and less expensive. I do cook with shallots from time to time and would describe them as most people describe them - as somewhere between the flavour of garlic and onion, but also a good deal milder/sweeter. I prefer to use them simply when I do not want the strong taste of onions.  In fact, many of us are so accustomed to the harsh taste of onions that it's actually quite a surprise to find out how much better a certain dish might taste by substituting shallots. They're especially common in Asian cooking, I find.  Very often you're providing a lot of spice or heat from other ingredients - chilies, five spice, curry powder, etc. - and don't want the overwhelming pungency of onions mixed in.  Shallots give just a little bit of ""sharpness"" without much of the sulfur taste. Would I substitute them everywhere?  Absolutely not.  Some recipes really do call for the pungency of onions, for example almost anything involving ground beef.  But try it at least once - get yourself a bag of shallots and try substituting them for onions in a few recipes.  You may be pleasantly surprised. I would say that ideal recipes to try this on, if you're unfamiliar with shallots, are stovetop recipes calling for a relatively small amount of chopped or sliced (not minced) onion; stir fries are ideal, which perhaps is why they seem to be so common in Asian cuisine.  Also, as far as pricing is concerned: Locally, where a 2 lb bag of onions might cost $1.99, a 1 lb bag of shallots would cost $1.49, which makes them roughly 50% more expensive, very far from an ""order of magnitude.""  If you meant that literally and are finding them close to 10x more expensive than onions, then you are either shopping at the wrong stores or living in an area where they are hard to find.  Try an Asian grocery store if you have one; they can usually be found for dirt cheap in those."
"In a tomato sauce recipe, how can I cut the acidity?","My secret weapon is onion. Caramelize the onions first.  This creates a natural sweetness.  Always use ripe tomatoes; if you cannot then use canned.  The canned are made from ripe tomatoes and tend to be a very good substitute. Also, the celery and carrot suggestions are very much a good addition - you are making a classic tomato sauce when you include the celery and carrots, 1 part each celery and carrot to 2 parts onion.  Add the onions first to get the caramelization. I don't get too fancy with herbs, usually one good fresh herb does it for me, basil or sage are two favorites of mine. There is a suggestion to add cream, why not use the parmesan end you may have in your fridge, it is dairy and allowed to slowly simmer in the sauce will lend a very nice flavor note. Acidic sauces are usually reserved for nights when I make a puttanesca sauce - it goes with the capers and calamata olives I add to it. Don't forget to season with salt and pepper."
What is the difference between white and brown eggs?,"The Egg Nutrition Center's FAQ page has an entry on this very topic. Basically, the color of the egg does not affect the egg's flavor, nutritional value, etc. It simply depends on the particular breed of chicken that lays the egg -- white eggs from white hens, brown eggs from brown hens. It's also worth noting, as the ENC points out:  Generally, brown hens are larger and
  require more feed and therefore their
  eggs may be slightly higher priced."
"How long can I store a food in the pantry, refrigerator, or freezer?","The shelf-life is the amount of time a food can be stored before it is considered unsuitable for use. It may be unsuitable due to quality degradation (no longer tasty) or food safety (risk of food poisoning). [1] As far as food safety goes, food stored frozen at 0°F (-18°C) or below is remains safe forever; only quality degrades over time. [2]. Thus the freezer-storage times below are entirely about quality. This temperature should be maintained fairly closely (within 3°C[6] or 5°F) and a defrost / no-frost freezer should not heat air surrounding the products by enough to heat the products more than that. If your freezer is set at a temperature higher than -18°C (three-star setting), these times may not apply. Especially the safe storage time in one-star freezers (-6°C) is much reduced. The times all assume proper storage. Freezers 0°F or below, refrigerators 40°F (4°C) or below. [3] Cans should be stored in a cool, dry place, below 85°F (30°C) [4]. The freezer itself should also be placed correctly: if the environmental temperature drops below 10°C (50°F), oil might be too viscous and work less well or damage the compressor[7], so please refer to the operating manual before deciding on an unheated garage. The tables given here assume proper storage. Food which requires refrigeration is considered unsafe if left for over two hours at temperatures between 41–135°F (5–57°C) [5]. Regardless of the table below, if a food shows signs of spoilage (including mold, with some exceptions described below), its past its shelf-life. Note that the lack of spoilage does not imply safety. For home-made mayo, there don't seem to be official shelf-life estimates.
Seasoned Advice has a question on this,
Making ""long(er)-life"" homemade mayonnaise. Freezer times are given for cooked or blanched, then frozen. Generally, this is
required, otherwise enzymatic degradation will occur. See ""Where can I go for
details on a specific food?"" for where to find specific steps for each vegetable. Refrigerator and shelf times are for storage raw. If a column is -, it means that storage type is not recommended. ""Ripe"" means
""until ripe"". Many fruits must be at least partially cooked (blanched) before freezing in
order to deactivate enzymes that would otherwise degrade quality while in
storage. Some are best frozen packed in acid (lemon juice or citric acid)
and/or syrup. See ""Where can I go for details on a specific food?"" for where to
find specific steps for each fruit. If a column is -, it means that storage type is not recommended. ""Ripe"" means
""until ripe"". *: bananas stored in the fridge will blacken. This is not a sign of spoilage, and they can be eaten safely. 2 hours on the counter, for all of them, unless you prepared a known shelf-stable item which generally does not go in the fridge (like cookies, or a canned jam, or others). It does not matter how long the individual components would have lasted on their own. Refrigerated: generally 3–4 days in the fridge. This includes pizza, soups, stews,
casseroles, pies, and quiche [KC]. Some salads get a fifth day [CFG].
Freezer time is generally under three months. Rice is an exception due to the risk of bacillus cereus, the spores of which can survive cooking.  After cooling and refrigerating it should be consumed within 24 hours, either chilled or thoroughly reheated. Putting any plant matter in oil (such as garlic, chillies or herbs) creates the danger for botulism, a rare but fatal disease. Thus infused oils are not shelf-stable. They can be kept in the refrigerator for 3-5 days, discard them earlier if you see cloudiness or gas bubbles. Or buy commercially produced infused oils, they have been treated with industrial methods to kill the botulinum spores. Fruit. Ripe (but not overripe) fruit should be used. Wash them, and sort according to size. Working in small batches, remove pits, seeds, and blemishes. For fruits that turn brown, apply ascorbic acid or sugar and citric acid. Most fruits benefit from packing in dry sugar or a sugar syrup. Small, whole fruits (e.g., berries) can be spread on a tray and individually frozen, then packed in a freezer bag or other airtight container. Vegetables. Most vegetables need blanching. To blanch, immerse in boiling water over high heat or steam over rapidly boiling water (steam). After blanching, transfer to ice bath for the same amount of time as blanched. Drain and dry. Freeze either by packing in a freezer bag with as much air as possible removed, or by allowing to freeze on a tray, then putting in a bag or other container. General guideline is 8–12 months for best quality. The above is a very quick summary of Iowa State University's Preserve the
Taste of Summer: Freezing: Fruits and
Vegetables. The
five-page document includes full details on over forty fruits and vegetables.
Feel free to ask here on Seasoned Advice if that guide doesn't answer your
question. Some foods are expected to have mold in them (e.g., P. roqueforti in
Roquefort cheese). Unexpected mold, however, is something to be concerned
about. Mold can grow even on refrigerated foods, and even those high enough in
salt or sugar to deter bacteria. Some molds produce mycotoxins. Mold growth can
be minimized by cleaning the refrigerator every few months (use a mixture of 1
tablespoon of baking soda per quart of water, then rinse with plain water, then
dry), by keeping dishcloths, sponges, mops, etc. clean and fresh-smelling; and
keeping indoor humidity levels under 40%. In general, the visible surface mold on a food is only a small part of the
actual mold growth. For most foods, any visible unexpected mold growth means
you should discard the entire item. There are several exceptions: Everything else, including soft or shredded cheese, soft fruits and vegetables,
bread, peanut butter, jams and jellies, sour cream, yogurt, luncheon meats,
casseroles, and cooked pasta should be discarded. All this information comes from the USDA FS&IS's Molds on Food: Are They
Dangerous? fact
sheet. The web site StillTasty maintains a comprehensive list
of food storage times, notes, and procedures for a wide variety of food items.

Why do you need to heat the pan before heating the olive oil?,"TL;DR: heating the pan before the oil has no useful effects in most cases. While this is a duplicate of another question, I'm going to answer it again because that question's accepted answer provides zero evidence or citations to back itself up.  Which is important, because the accepted answer is wrong. The popular myth is ""Cold oil in hot pan and food won't stick"".  Like most such cooking myths, this one is nonsense; as Kitchen Myths points out: What you really want is “hot pan, hot oil” and that’s what you are actually getting because the cold oil heats up almost instantly when added to the hot pan. You’ll get the same results if you heat the oil along with the pan rather than adding the oil at the last minute. In fact some cooks prefer this technique because the appearance of the oil in the pan can give you some indication of when the pan has reached the proper temperature.  Serious Eats says the same thing: The thing is, only raw proteins will form this bond. Heat causes proteins to fold in on themselves, or even to break down and form all new compounds. Once in their folded or rearranged form, they no longer stick. So the goal is to get the meat to cook before it even comes into contact with the metal by heating oil hot enough that it can cook the meat in the time it takes for it to pass from the air, through the film of oil, and into the pan. So, you want a hot pan with hot oil.  Most of the time, this means that you want to preheat the oil with the pan, not add oil to a preheated pan, although the latter doesn't do any harm.  It just doesn't provide any benefit. You'll notice I said most of the time, though.  There are times when you do want to preheat the cooking vessel before adding fat, and both of those times have to do with needing to heat the metal hotter than the smoke point of the oil you are using. Neither of these cases has anything to do with preventing sticking, though. They are both about not burning the cooking fat.  And the first technique only makes sense if you are using cast iron or carbon steel; it can damage other types of cookware. You might ask: doesn't this apply to cooking sofrito, though?  And the answer is no.  Filtered olive oil has a smoke point of 210 °C, which is plenty hot enough for the very wet ingredients in a sofrito, which will drag the real pan temperature down to 105 °C or so in a few seconds anyway. Further, a sofrito is made up entirely of non-starchy vegetables and aromatics, which means that sticking isn't a serious concern. So, myth busted!"

How dangerous is it to refreeze meat that has been thawed?,"In theory you could thaw and refreeze as many times as you like, though the changes in temperature would definitely alter the quality of the meat's taste and texture. What matters most is how long the meat has been in the so-called ""danger zone"" speaking from a temperature perspective. The ""danger zone"" is defined as being between 41 to 135 °F (5 to 57 °C). Here is an excerpt from The Professional Chef, by the Culinary Institute of America: Foods left in the danger zone for a period longer than four hours are considered adulterated. Additionally, one should be fully aware that the four-hour period is cumulative, meaning that the meter starts running again every time the food enters the danger zone. Therefore, once the four-hour period has been exceeded, heating, cooling, or any other cooking method cannot recover foods."
Why wooden sticks for ice cream bars?,"One element is tradition.  The popsicle was supposedly invented by Frank Epperson when he left a drink mixture on the porch overnight in with a wooden stirrer in it.  (Some historians have questioned this narrative, however, given that Epperson claimed this occurred in 1905 in San Francisco, but weather records show that it never got cold enough in the 1905 winter there for Epperson's story to hold up.)  The choice of wood, according to this traditional story, was somewhat accidental, though given that plastics were not yet available in 1905, Epperson's main choices for stirring would probably have been metal or wood.  (And obviously metal would be uncomfortable to hold in a frozen treat, regardless of whether this origin story is true or not.) In any case, Epperson later patented his invention (including the wooden stick) in Oakland in 1923 and started selling them.  Again, this would have been too early for plastic to be a reasonable alternative, so part of the reason for wooden popsicle sticks may just be that they are traditional and familiar to customers. A business seeking to make a change away from such a tradition would need motivation, either an economic reason (a cheaper but still acceptable product) or an actual product improvement.  Given that wooden popsicle sticks are intended to be disposable and already function well, economics would be a primary reason to switch, if there were a cheaper material.  But Memj's answer is correct here.  It's simple economics: wood is cheaper in this case, which is the reason it is used for various small uniform disposable items from toothpicks to chopsticks, utilizing technology that has been in wide use since the early 1900s.  (For more information on the reason for manufacturing and process on producing small wooden items cheaply, I'd recommend Henry Petroski's book The Toothpick: Technology and Culture.) It's also important to note that some businesses actually have experimented with disposable plastic sticks.  The most common type were so-called Elsie Stix or Icetix, which were distributed by Borden Dairy in the U.S.  They were intended to be collectible and manufactured to be used as toys after serving their purpose in the ice cream bar.  (See photos and further description here and here, for example.) I would note that these sticks easily solved potential problems brought up in some of the other answers: A series of holes allowed the popsicle to be frozen through the plastic and thus added to adhesion.  And the holes also decreased thermal mass and heat transfer, which would negate any potential discomfort from holding a piece of cold plastic, which seems to be a strange concern to me anyhow.** In any case, these plastic sticks were undoubtedly more expensive to manufacture, but they were marketed as a novelty item.  And their interlocking nature and use as a toy required people to buy more popsicles to build with them, thereby providing an economic incentive to justify the added expense.   Without such an economic incentive for ""standard"" disposable popsicle sticks, and with wooden sticks being traditional, there's little reason for businesses to make a switch to plastic. ** More details about thermal properties: While some plastics are somewhat better at transferring heat than wood, there are many types of plastic which would not be noticeably uncomfortable compared to wood in a small stick, even if they were solid.  Note that the thermal conductivity of many standard plastics is around 0.2-0.3 W/m-K, only roughly double that of wood, which is around 0.13 W/m-K.  Compare that to most metals, which could actually freeze one's hand to them, which have conductivities which are hundreds of times that big.  Specific heat is roughly the same for plastic and wood, and the density of most plastics is only a little higher than birch, which is a standard wood for popsicle sticks.  Bottom line is that plastic popsicle sticks would absorb heat somewhat more quickly and stay colder a little longer, but not enough to produce significant discomfort for a small, thin piece of plastic. But, theory aside, one can easily buy reusable plastic sticks for homemade popsicles -- just search Amazon for ""plastic popsicle sticks"".  (Here's a review comparing 26 different varieties of plastic molds, almost all with plastic sticks/handles.)  And I don't think I've ever seen a review complaining about discomfort in holding them.  I've also seen multitudes of baby teething toys, for example, which are meant to be frozen and are made out of plastic: the idea of a ""damp hand freezing"" to a small thin piece of plastic seems quite unlikely."
Why does plastic never dry properly in a dishwasher?,"According to this article the problem seems mainly two fold, conductivity and thermal inertia (among other factors). During washing temperatures get relatively hot (depending on the particular program chosen) to promote sterilization and help with cleaning. Conductivity: Different utensils are made of different materials which will absorb this heat at different rates. Plastic has relatively low conductivity compared to say a metal pan or stainless steel object, thus both gaining heat slower and transferring that energy to water less efficiently leading to less evaporation. Thermal Inertia: Plastic objects are generally thinner and lighter, plastic is generally also less dense than other common kitchen materials, leading to retaining less heat, and conserving less energy, thus remaining warm for shorter periods, again promoting less evaporation. There may also be other factors at work; such as surface properties of plastics like roughness and porosity that make it hydrophobic, which may cause water droplets stick more to its surface, or evaporate slower. I have recently developed a practice that I feel helps getting most items (even plastics) almost dry. After the cycles finishes, (the sooner the better so that the least amount of heat is lost), immediately turn off the dish washer and open the door. Leave it open for a few brief seconds, long enough to let most vapor escape, but short enough that the minimum amount of heat is lost.
After that close the door again and let it sit for a while, no need to shut it tight, leaving it ajar will suffice. Ten to twenty minutes is probably more than enough if you are in a hurry. This will ensure a lot of the humidity will leave the compartment while still remaining warm, promoting quicker evaporation, ensuring that most items will be either almost dry or have a minimum amount of water when you return to unload the dishwasher. One other optional thing you may do in addition to the previous procedure, (if you can waste the time and have the energy) is, after opening the door while waiting for the steam to escape, individually grab any plastic objects and one by one give them a vigorous shake to loosen any droplets on its surface. If your ratio of plastics to other materials is anything like mine those should be a minority so it shouldn't take too long. One or two shakes per item is generally enough, just let them splash into the sink, or even back into the dishwasher to get most of the surface water off. Then just put them back in and close the door again and let them dry along with other items, the remaining heat should take care of most residual humidity. As mentioned in the comments, if you have no delicate items that might break, you can also just give the whole rack a shake instead. Items with intricate designs or crevices that pool water may still benefit from a good individual shake though. In case you aren't already for some reason, using rinse aid seems to helps considerably achieving drier items after the cycle. Backstory: After purchasing a new ""fancy"" zeolitihc dish washer we were told it needed no rinse aid since local water quality is satisfactory; so we didn't for a while, and were pleased with the results. In time however we found, that despite all the bells and whistles the new dishwasher seemed to achieved poorer results compared with the previous one. So for a change we decided to add some rinse aid once and it made a very considerable difference in the wetness of all item types after a cycle, not only plastics but also, metals, glass and ceramics (in addition to considerably reducing cycle duration by 1/3 of the time, thus also saving energy)."
How Did I Explode A Saucepan?,"I work in a commercial kitchen and I've seen this happen before, which is why we do not use copper-plated cookware. This can happen whenever you have two different alloys welded together and apply heat to one side or non-uniformly; An effect known as 'thermal shock'. What happens is one metal expands faster than the other, causing a deformation or fracture. Think of it as one side trying to 'pull' the other at the edges. The pop you heard was undoubtedly this delineation occurring, followed by the kinetic reaction of the pot jumping. I find your claim that the pot leaped through the air difficult to believe, but I have observed audible pops and visible movement when they fail. If you have a flat top (like an electric stove), it could skid for up to a foot from this due to the lack of friction and possible presence of condensate (water) on the surface which can at certain temperatures act like a nearly friction-less cushion. Oil doesn't do this, only water. If you've ever been in a commercial kitchen you'll notice every cookware item is made of a single cast of metal (most usually stainless steel) because of this. Welded alloy pots and pans just don't last very long -- the effect observed so violently happens at a smaller scale with every heating cycle, eventually resulting in ruined cookware. Also, being a line cook means being exposed to things exploding, dying, catching fire, etc., on a near-daily basis, not to mention an assortment of knives that would make most Hollywood bad-asses blush, so obviously we try to limit the number of things that can go wrong. Do yourself a favor -- if you stick with the copper-bottomed pots and pans, make sure to put plenty of water or oil in them. Heat with nowhere to go will cause failure quickly. "
What is the difference between a prawn and a shrimp?,"Biologically speaking, they are actually different species, but the names are so commonly used interchangeably as to completely muddle the distinctions. For example, spot prawns are actually shrimp while ridgeback shrimp are actually prawns. Prawns have claws on three of their five pairs of legs, shrimp have claws on two of their five pairs of legs. Their gills and body shape are different too. As far as cooking them goes, they are virtually identical and interchangeable.  Source"
Is there a problem with defrosting meat on the counter?,"A lot of bacteria grows in the range of 40-100°F (4-38°C) (i.e. room temperature). It's definitely not recommended to defrost meat at room temperature. In fact, you are not supposed to leave meat at room temperature for more than an hour.  However, defrosting in the refrigerator can take a long time and require you to plan at least one day ahead of time. I'm not so good at this, which leads to a safe and fast solution: Defrost meat in a waterproof ziploc bag in cold water. Change the water every 30 minutes until defrosted. The water is a better  conductor of heat than air, so the defrosting is quite fast and the water is cold so there's minimal safety risk. From the USDA: Uh, oh! You're home and forgot to
  defrost something for dinner. You grab
  a package of meat or chicken and use
  hot water to thaw it fast. But is this
  safe? What if you remembered to take
  food out of the freezer, but forgot
  and left the package on the counter
  all day while you were at work? Neither of these situations are safe,
  and these methods of thawing lead to
  foodborne illness. Food must be kept
  at a safe temperature during ""the big
  thaw."" Foods are safe indefinitely
  while frozen. However, as soon as food
  begins to defrost and become warmer
  than 40 °F (4 °C), any bacteria that may have
  been present before freezing can begin
  to multiply. Foods should never be thawed or even
  stored on the counter, or defrosted in
  hot water. Food left above 40 °F
  (unrefrigerated) is not at a safe
  temperature. Even though the center of the package
  may still be frozen as it thaws on the
  counter, the outer layer of the food
  is in the ""Danger Zone,"" between 40
  and 140 °F (4 °C and 60 °C) – at temperatures where
  bacteria multiply rapidly. When defrosting frozen foods, it's
  best to plan ahead and thaw food in
  the refrigerator where food will
  remain at a safe, constant temperature
  – 40 °F (4 °C) or below. There are three safe ways to defrost
  food: in the refrigerator, in cold
  water, and in the microwave. Refrigerator Thawing Planning ahead is
  the key to this method because of the
  lengthy time involved. A large frozen
  item like a turkey requires at least a
  day (24 hours) for every 5 pounds of
  weight. Even small amounts of frozen
  food -- such as a pound of ground meat
  or boneless chicken breasts -- require
  a full day to thaw. When thawing foods
  in the refrigerator, there are several
  variables to take into account. Some
  areas of an appliance may keep the
  food colder than other areas. Food
  placed in the coldest part will
  require longer defrosting time. Food
  takes longer to thaw in a refrigerator
  set at 35 °F (2 °C) than one set at 40 °F (4 °C). After thawing in the refrigerator,
  ground meat and poultry should remain
  useable for an additional day or two
  before cooking; red meat, 3 to 5 days.
  Foods defrosted in the refrigerator
  can be refrozen without cooking,
  although there may be some loss of
  quality. Cold Water Thawing This method is faster than
  refrigerator thawing but requires more
  attention. The food must be in a
  leak-proof package or plastic bag. If
  the bag leaks, bacteria from the air
  or surrounding environment could be
  introduced into the food. Also, meat
  tissue can also absorb water like a
  sponge, resulting in a watery product. The bag should be submerged in cold
  tap water, changing the water every 30
  minutes so it continues to thaw. Small
  packages of meat or poultry – about a
  pound – may defrost in an hour or
  less. A 3- to 4-pound package may take
  2 to 3 hours. For whole turkeys,
  estimate about 30 minutes per pound.
  If thawed completely, the food must be
  cooked immediately.  Foods thawed by the cold water method
  should be cooked before refreezing."
Why did flatbread dominate the Middle East but Europe adopted raised breads?,"I'm going to agree with Szczerzo about this being an anthropologic question, but I'm going to disagree about the cause.  While nomadic lifestyles was an influence, it's not causative. I'm also going to ignore the distinction made about raising agents in the OP, because it's factually incorrect; most Arab/Levantine/Turkish/Kurdish breads use yeast.  Instead, I'm going to answer the distinction between loaf bread and flatbread. Specifically: loaf bread is an aberration, not flatbread.  You find flatbreads around the world in every society that has access to any kind of grain anywhere.  Europe, Asia, Africa, Americas, Malaysia, everywhere.  Some are raised (yeasted) and some are not.  Some are filled and some are not.  All grains are used: wheat, barley, millet, rice, lentils, corn, etc. Whereas: loaf bread pretty much only shows up in Egypt (and nearby) and in Europe, and there's good reason to believe that the latter two regions learned it from Egypt.  Thing is, loaf bread requires several different things to be easily and cheaply available in the same place: This combination simply didn't happen in too many places; either people lacked suitable grains, lacked cheap fuel, didn't build ovens, or simply never got started (the Babylonians appear to only have made flatbread, for example, despite having all the right ingredients and tools). So it's really not so much a question of ""why did X culture only make flatbread"" as ""why did these three places make loaf bread?"" If you're interested in this, I highly recommend the book Six Thousand Years Of Bread."

How is sushi supposed to be eaten?,"Clean your hands before you eat. Often, you will be given a hot towel for the purpose. Return the towel to the server neatly folded. It is fine to eat sushi with your hand, as long as there is rice with each piece of fish. Sashimi (sliced fish not prepared with rice) should only be eaten with chopsticks. If you sit at the sushi bar, feel free to converse with the itamae (sushi chef) if he's not too busy, and to order sushi from him. Do not order anything but sushi from him, order non-sushi items from your server. It is classy to ask the itamae to recommend a sushi item or even to ask him to surprise you. If there is something you know you don't like (uni is mine), let him know because it is very rude to not clean your plate. By that I mean don't even leave a grain of rice. Mixing wasabi with the soy sauce is so common that you can get away with it, but it is considered kind of tacky, at least in a fine restaurant. So is eating ginger with a bite of sushi. You're correct that it is intended as a palate cleanser between sushi 'courses'. Again, if you want to, you're not going to get kicked out for it. In fine sushi restaurants, sushi is often not served with wasabi on the side. After all, the chef is an expert, he knows more about sushi than you! And presumably he knows how much wasabi should go on each piece of sushi. If you really want more, go ahead and add it if it's there, or let the itamae know your preferences in the matter. Regarding dipping into the soy, try not to soak the rice of nigiri-zushi (shaped rice with a slice of fish on top). Just lightly dip the fish. Ideally, place the bite into your mouth fish down. Try to eat the whole piece in one bite. If you must, bite it in half but don't put the second half back on the plate. It's funny, but the video in @Mel's comment to the question shows tossing a big piece of sushi down pretty well :) Just know that the dunking it in soy sauce is a joke! If you are in a part of the word where tipping is expected, tip the server and itamae separately. Often there will be a jar on the bar for tipping the chef. He would rather not touch money while he is working. You can offer the itamae a sake if you're so inclined.  Finally, leave your chopsticks laying across the soya bowl between uses, or on the holder if there is one. Never leave them on your plate or (heaven forbid) sticking out of your rice.  Regarding your edit, not necessarily. It is completely optional to use chopsticks to eat rolls or nigiri. It is entirely up to you.

How do you funnel food off a cutting board?,"I have a few ways of dealing with this: Which method I use depends on the food, amount, cut size, and what bowls I have available. I have a fair amount of plastic bowls specifically to simplify the whole cutting-and-storing part of our rather large meal preps."
How should I poach an egg?,
What constitutes the majority of meat?,"It's essentially just water. You can directly see this in the full USDA nutrition facts (link is for ""Chicken, broilers or fryers, breast, meat only, cooked, roasted""). Per 100g, there is 65.26g of water, 31.02g protein, 3.57g fat, accounting for 99.85g. The rest is probably just trace nutrients and rounding errors. You'll see the same kind of thing for other meats. Details vary by cut, but for example here's beef chuck eye steak (64.48g water, 18.86g protein, 16.35g fat), pork loin chops (69.7g water, 20.71g protein, 9.03g fat), and Atlantic salmon (64.89g water, 20.42g protein, 13.42g fat)."
How can I get chewy chocolate chip cookies?,"I like my chocolate chip cookies chewy too and I do it all the time. Here is what I do: The recipe is straightforward: cream butter with sugar, add wet ingredients, incorporate dry ingredients slowly and lastly add the chips. Be sure to chill the dough for at least 30 min. The more you rest, the better. See this NY Times Article for effects of resting the dough."
"Is there a quick, easy, mess-free way to peel an orange (or grapefruit)?","Yes! I just came across this, and it just so happens I could use an orange in a slaw I'm making right now.  Tablespoon Orange Hack Simply lop off the ends, make a small incision in the side and carefully open to reveal easy-to-eat orange segments. (Or as I prefer to call it, an orange caterpillar.) I did it with my orange, and I had never peeled an orange so quickly:  Now if you just want to eat the orange, you can just pluck off the segments as you pop them into your mouth. If you roll the orange around a bit first, before you lop off the ends (as in @Barry Staes' answer), it should make it even easier and more pith-free. But what was really neat is that by prepping it that way, I had a pretty close approximation to supremes, supremely easily! (haha) With two passes of the knife and 5 seconds of picking at it, this is close enough for my slaw.  Just flatten the ""caterpillar"" as much as you can with one hand, and with one slice (or two), cut between the peel and the segments. I just picked away most of the remaining connective ""stuff"" and membranes with the knife and my fingers at this point, but a pair of kitchen shears would  make even quicker work out of it. It's not absolutely perfect, the traditional method of supreming seen here would be the way to go if you're gunning for a Michelin Star, but this is fine for more casual applications. With the practice of a couple more oranges, I think I could go from an intact orange to ""cheater"" supremed segments in less than a minute (and without getting my hands sticky!) Pretty cool. BTW, there is a pretty neat animated GIF on the linked page that will make it all clear if the pictures don't. EDIT: It works even better with grapefruit! Open the grapefruit just enough to use a pair of kitchen shears to cut away the the connective membrane from the ""points"" of the segments (what would be at the center of intact fruit). While you're at it, remove any seeds.   Be careful when you roll out the ""caterpillar"" to separate every segment and to put pressure evenly on all parts of the peel. The peel is a bit more prone to tearing than orange peel.  Since the membranes between the segments are more like leather and less fragile than the membranes on orange segments, they are very easy to pluck away. This makes the supremed segments perfect. This gives better results even than the traditional method of supreming! "
"How do I wash the ""pokey"" side of a box grater?","A dishwasher gets cheese off even that side - but that's no good if you don't have one, nor is it very effective against ginger and other fibrous foods.  The best I've found is simply a washing up brush (i.e. plastic bristles and a long handle) from both sides. I would then put it in the dishwasher for a final clean unless I'm doing a proper load of washing up, which is rare "
What is the point of a salt mill?,"Trying to get to the bottom of the issue, I decided to take a few pictures of a few different types of salt. The pictures shown below were taken by me and are all proportional (the camera was the same distance away from each type of salt, so you are getting an accurate size comparison).   The picture illustrates my suspicions, which is the difference is the surface area (ignoring of course mineral content and different types of grinding salt). Standard table salt is a compact little cube, effective when it’s to be dissolved in a liquid, but not so much when it comes to direct contact with the taste buds. Place one cube on your tongue and you get 1/6th of the surface area in contact, meaning, a lot of salt without much saltiness.  Sea salt, with a more rectangular shape is closer to 1/4th the surface area touching your tongue. Ground salt is more like shards of glass, so nearly half of the exposed area could be in contact making things taste that much more salty. Also with a much finer texture, you are left with many more particles in a wider area, meaning, a saltier taste with less salt.   It’s a good way of finishing a dish when the salt is going to be lightly dusted on top or mixed with an oil where it will not dissolve at all. When you are dissolving it in a liquid, it really makes little difference which type you use. When it comes down to it, it’s all about how picky you want to be with it.   "
"What does the ""bagel"" setting on toasters do?","Unfortunately, the function depends on the manufacturer.   While turning off a set of elements may be common, another option is that the setting may just increase the cook time.  Bagels are thicker and have more mass than sliced bread, so a longer toast time is necessary to have a similar level of toasting. In particular there are Cuisinart toasters where the bagel button only lengthens the time of the toasting and does not change the pattern. From Cuisinart PDF manual Bagel button  The bagel feature adds extra time to the toasting cycle

Why should I soak beans before cooking?,"One reason is to remove some of the indigestible complex sugars that cause gas. Another reason is that beans are dirty, so you're just cleaning them with the soaking. If the recipe wants the beans to be cooked in the water used for soaking, the washing needs to be done before the soaking. On top of that the soaking can reduce cooking time considerably, which might be the biggest advantage."
What's the ideal coffee to water ratio for a French press?,"I don't know if there's an ideal ratio since this is really about how strong you want the coffee to be. It depends on the strength of the roast you're using, the grind, and how strong you like the coffee. I generally use 2 tbs / 6 oz, but vary it to taste."
Why can applesauce be used in place of oil?,"Fundamentally, the reason for this substitution is that applesauce contains pectin. In baking, the role of oil is to coat the flour, preventing it from combining with the water (or other wet ingredients) and developing gluten.  Gluten is what causes dough to rise, and also gives elasticity to the final product - what most people think of as ""chewiness."" When you're baking, for example, a cake, or even a pie crust, you want to limit the amount of gluten that develops.  A cake or pie crust should be moist, light, and fluffy, not tough and chewy.  When you bite into a cake and find it very dry and bread-like, that is because it has developed a lot of gluten.  A good amount of oil or other fat leads to a lighter, moister, less-glutinous result. The pectin in applesauce can also, to a certain extent, help to inhibit gluten formation in a dough, but the similarities end there.  I cannot stress this point enough, and I've seen many other online resources get this dead wrong: Pectin (applesauce) is not a straightforward or foolproof substitute for fat. The mechanisms by which pectin and oil work in this context are completely different: Oil is a lipid.  Lipids bind to starch (including the ~75% starch in flour) and are hydrophobic - the traditional example of this is dew drops forming on the surface of grass or plants (the latter being the hydrophobe).  In a sense, oil forms a protective ""shield"" around the flour molecules. Pectin, on the other hand, is a gelling agent, and specifically a polysaccharide.  Pectin is not hydrophobic and does not actually protect the flour molecules.  In fact, pectin is of the same family as starches, which are also polysaccharides.  What's really happening here is that the pectin competes with the flour for water.  That means less water overall reaches the starch and gluten-forming proteins (giladin and glutenin) in the flour, and because of this, it is not able to develop as much gluten or gelatinize much of the other starch. What does all of this actually mean for you, the baker?  Quite simply, it means you have to be very careful with this substitution: Too much pectin can turn your recipe into a jelly-like consistency. Too little pectin will fail to prevent glutenization (in other words, you'll get bread). Pectin has the property of syneresis - meaning that once it starts to gel, it also starts to expel liquid, and your dessert will dry out or deflate over time. Pectin is actually water-soluble at high temperatures (technically, it forms a colloid), it just happens to absorb a lot of water along the way.  Baking for too long, or at too high a temperature, will cause the pectin to break down and dissolve completely, making it useless. There are also several other problems (or at least ""gotchas"") when making the apple sauce substitution: Applesauce is not just pectin.  It has a good deal of water and various proteins and acids, and even a certain amount of lipids.  The exact quantities, however, depend on how the applesauce was made, so it is very hard to get precise control over the amount of pectin, and the textbook 1:1 substitution ratio is almost never correct. Another thing that applesauce contains is sugar - even unsweetened applesauce.  You will almost certainly need to reduce the amount of sugar elsewhere in your recipe.  This may be difficult, especially if the bulk of the sugar is used as a dry ingredient. Applesauce behaves somewhat similarly to oil, but do not even try using it as a substitute for any other fat.  Butter, in particular, contains milk proteins which act as natural emulsifiers; pectin does have certain stabilizing properties but is a rather poor emulsifier compared to butter[citation needed].  And it goes without saying that the flavour is substantially different from that of applesauce; oil is ""OK"" to substitute for because it has very little flavour of its own. If you plan on using applesauce as a substitute for oil in a recipe that does not specifically explain how to use it as a substitute, then I strongly suggest you do two things: Don't substitute the entire quantity.  Use 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce, or maybe 1/4 oil and 3/4 applesauce.  You will likely also have to lower the total quantity of oil/applesauce to approximately half of what it originally was (give or take 1/4). If you can, try this substitution on a small scale first, and experiment with the quantities of oil, sugar, and applesauce, before going all-out and putting it into the oven while your guests arrive.  It's very likely that on the first few attempts, you'll end up with something that's palatable, but nowhere near the quality of the oil-based recipe. Ignore these disclaimers at your own risk!"
Why isn't Almond Milk (and other non-animal based 'milk') considered juice?,"One reason is simple appearance, I think - opaque white liquids or saps have long been called ""milky"", including nut milks, coconut milk, dandelion or milk thistle saps, and several other white substances.  Nut milks get called milk because they look like milk to the eye. Another reason is that nut milks behave like milks in recipes - they are emulsions with sugars, proteins, and fats... fruit juices tend to have nutrients and sugars, mostly, they behave rather differently in cooking.  Almond milk was a long held substitute for animal milk in medieval times because it was more reliable - the nuts would be shelf-stable, while actual milk could spoil within hours.  It is worth pointing out that nut milks were substitute for so long because they worked in dishes calling for milk, at both the chemical level and for rough flavor profiling. Also, it is probably worth noting that nut milks taste like milk, as well - a mellow flavor, very mild and a bit rich.  The flavor isn't strong or sweet like other juices.  They are different from cow's milk, true, but perhaps nut milks are not immensely more different from cow's milk than it is different from sheep's milk or goat's milk. In the end, nut milks get called milk because they seem similar, and there's no other category they fit into more neatly.  If it is to label them as an alternative, it is a very old label, and for an alternative that works very well in nearly all applications. Ps: if it helps, the nutrients extracted from the almonds into the milk were produced by the parent tree and intended to sustain the baby almond-plant... so the major difference is that the plant stores the milk in solid form, not whether it was meant for the next generation or not"
How should I care for my knives?,"Always use a cutting surface made for a knife, particularly a wooden chopping board/block. Avoid contact with hard surfaces such as metal, glass, or stone; these will quickly cause dulling or even chipping of most knives. Also avoid cutting frozen items, for the same reason. Use the dull end (""top"") of the knife for scraping food off surfaces, or use a scraper or spatula instead. Knives are meant to cut straight, along the edge; scraping one sideways across any surface will misalign the edge very quickly. Do not use more force than necessary. A sharp knife should cut with very little effort. The more pressure you apply, the faster it will dull. Use a cleaver for bones or other very hard foods. General-purpose chef's knives or smaller knives aren't appropriate for this task, and may chip or even snap. Wash or rinse knives promptly after use. The moisture in many foods can be acidic and/or corrosive to the metal (fruits, onions, etc.). Dry knives immediately with a soft cloth or towel. Stainless steel is resistant to rust and corrosion but not immune. This goes for all metal but especially knives, because even an imperceptible amount of rust along the edge will drastically hinder its ability to cut. Air-drying may also leave you with stains or ""spots"" due to salts and other trace minerals in the water. Store knives in a dry, open area, away from other objects, to avoid moisture build-up, impacts, and secondary rust. Do not put a knife in the dishwasher. A knife in a dishwasher is subject to impacts, corrosion, and warping of the wooden handle/joint. Quality knives should be hand-washed. Honing a knife is a good way to restore a slightly dull knife. You will need an honing steel (sometimes misleadingly referred to as a sharpening steel), which can be bought inexpensively. Note that there are differences between steels; the best value tends to be in the $30 (USD) range. Honing is not the same as sharpening. Honing helps to align the existing edge, which becomes skewed or ""curled"" after regular use. It will not help to create a new edge if the knife is damaged, e.g. if it is corroded or chipped due to not following the ""General Care"" advice above. To hone a knife: Here is a video illustrating the technique. Knife sharpening involves a whetstone (AKA sharpening stone) and is an art unto itself. Some knife manufacturers do explain the process, however, the technique takes a long time to master and most home cooks will prefer to leave this to a professional. If you find that regular honing is no longer effective at maintaining a knife's edge - and if it's been well-maintained, this should take several weeks or months - then it's time to get the knife sharpened. An alternative to professional sharpening (or learning to use a whetstone) is to use a good-quality motorized electric sharpener, such as the Chef's Choice. This will obviously not yield the same result as a professional sharpening, but it is very convenient and fast. Some people believe that all electric sharpeners will damage your knives. This may still be true of the cheaper, single-stage sharpeners, because they do a lot of grinding and generate a lot of heat. However, the more modern, higher-end sharpeners operate very quickly, have precise angle control, and use multiple stages mimicking the manual process (grinding, steeling, stropping). The ""grinding"" stage on a multi-stage sharpener should only be used if the knife is already badly damaged, and will actually create a new edge. If your knife is in reasonable shape, then it's fine to use a good sharpener on a semi-regular basis as long as you don't grind too much. (Honing should still be your primary form of maintenance). Yet another option, if you're on a tight budget, is to use sandpaper. Follow the link for additional information on technique, grit, and tutorials."
Why is it dangerous to eat meat which has been left out and then cooked?,"hobodave's answer is most of the way there but I think it understates the importance of protein toxins.  With the vast majority of foodborne illnesses, the bacteria aren't particularly harmful at all; what you need to worry about is the protein toxins they produce. E.Coli - probably the most well-known form of food poisoning along with Salmonella - is actually a harmless bacteria that already lives in your lower intestine.  But there is a particular strain of E.Coli, notably O157:H7, that is primarily associated with food poisoning.  The reason?  It produces what's called a Shiga-like Toxin. E.Coli contamination is actually dangerous on two fronts.  Because the bacteria are so well-adapted to surviving in the human digestive system (as I pointed out earlier, that's their primary habitat), ingesting even a relatively small number of the bacteria will result in them multiplying and producing those toxins in your gut (and the rest of the way down).  This is why it normally takes several days for you to feel the effects of this type of food poisoning; that's how long it takes for them to produce the toxins in sufficient quantity for your body to notice. But they don't need to be in your gut to produce those toxins; a piece of meat at room temperature provides good enough conditions and more than enough raw material for them reproduce and emit those same toxins.  So if you leave it sitting out too long, then it really doesn't matter how many bacteria you kill, you are going to end up with E.Coli poisoning fast, because you don't even need to wait for them to produce the toxins; they're already there. The problem is that you can't ""kill"" a protein toxin with a brief burst of heat because a protein isn't alive.  It's just a protein.  The temperatures and times needed to destroy that toxin would be similar to the temperatures and times needed to destroy all of the protein in the food, draining all the nutrition value and quite possibly turning it into a lump of charcoal. Salmonella seems to be a fountain of misinformation with all sorts of people saying that it doesn't produce toxins.  This simply isn't true.  Inside the host it produces what's called an AvrA toxin (which isn't ""toxic"" per se, but allows the bacteria to grow to larger numbers), and some strains can also produce a CdtB toxin, which is highly toxic.  (Apparently there's also a similar toxin produced by other strains.) I'll be honest, a lot of the medical mumbo-jumbo is way beyond my ability to comprehend, but it seems that a lot of the public confusion comes from the fact that salmonella can do some nasty things even without the toxins - but that doesn't mean that the toxins themselves can't do plenty of damage even if you manage to kill the bacteria. The same applies to many other types of dangerous bacteria; C.diptheriae produce the diphtheria toxin, C.botulinum produce the botulinum toxin (botulism); even the infamous mad cow disease was, as far as we know, caused by a protein, not a bacteria, which is why it was able to be transmitted to humans even through cooked beef. Are protein toxins the only reason why the USDA insists on a maximum 4-hour cumulative danger zone?  Probably not.  As hobodave says, the more the bacteria multiply, the harder is to kill all of them, even at high temperatures.  The figure of 74° C / 165° F that the food agencies give us for poultry is not going to kill exactly 100% of all the bacteria, and if it only kills - I'm just throwing out a number here - 99.999% of them, that may be good enough for relatively fresh poultry but won't be enough if you've got a whole bacterial colony to worry about. We can only speculate as to exactly what's entailed by the ""danger zone"" but my guess is that it's actually a combination of statistics, probabilities, and safety margins, which include, but are not limited to, the effects of protein toxins."
"What exactly is ""Sushi Grade"" fish?","""Sushi grade"" means that it is safe to prepare and eat raw.  In order to do that, it must be frozen to kill any parasites.  That means it either has to be: There aren't any official regulations about the fish itself or its quality, and most sushi/sashimi distributors have much more stringent rules of their own beyond the freezing guarantee."
"Why is my red cabbage suddenly turning blue when cooking, while it never did so before?","The red in red cabbage is Anthocyanin, which is a natural pigment which turns blue in the presence of a base. Apples are slightly acidic, adding apples kept the cabbage's ph towards the acid side, keeping it red. Adding a squeeze of lemon juice will do the same thing as apples."
Why does my food turn out poorly using an All-Clad Stainless-Steel Fry Pan?,"You've got a great pan and in a short time I'm sure you'll come to love it. When using a standard pan (one without non-stick coating), heat your pan dry over high heat until you can hold your hand about 6-inches above the cooking surface and feel the heat radiating upward.  This allows the tiny cracks and crevices that are imperceptible to the bare hand to expand and when the oil is added, it will coat and create a more even cooking surface.   Add just enough oil to lightly coat the surface.  Adding to much oil leads to pan-frying which is fine if you're frying chicken but not what you want when searing and sauteing meat.  There should just be a thin film across the bottom of the pan.  An additional benefit to first heating the pan is the fact that it will actually take less oil to coat the pan due to the decreased viscosity.  When the oil hits the hot pan it will instantly heat and should shimmer across the bottom like water on a freshly cleaned windshield. You don't put the oil in the pan first because the longer oils and fats heat the quicker they break down and smoke.  If you were to add cold oil and cold food to a cold pan and then start heating, you just end up with a big sticky mess. Make sure you're prepared to add the food to the pan once the oil goes in otherwise the oil will start to burn.   The issue with burning and overcooking is going to be a matter of controlling the heat.  Start searing and sauteeing over high heat because as food is added it will suck a good deal of heat from the pan.  If it isn't extremely hot to begin with you'll end up with a steaming mess of gray colored meat or vegetables that aren't doing much cooking.  Once the meat is browned but needs further cooking you can always turn down the heat to prevent excessive browning and crusting before the interior is done.   Even if you aren't planning to do a pan sauce, or if you've burnt what was cooking in the pan, you'll still want to deglaze with some water while the pan is hot (you can reheat it if it has already cooled down) so that you can scraped up the cooked on bits more easily and have less scrubbing to do when cleaning the pan."

"When making batter/dough, why is it really bad to clean your spoon by hitting it on the edge of the bowl a few times?","Oh, those cooking myths!  Whenever you think you have heard them all, there's a new one. In a yeasted dough, the yeast is perfectly fine with being tossed, beaten and generally mangled. The little yeast cells couldn't care less about what you do in the initial stage of mixing and kneading. (That's obviously different when you consider the dough after the bulk raise: You want to keep the existing bubbles, sometimes more - think baguette or ciabatta - sometimes less, when you punch out the larger ones for a smoother texture, but I digress.) What is an issue, is the kind of air that didn't come from yeast digestion and is safely entrapped in a gluten network, but the air that was beaten into the batter mechanically. In the oliebollen recipe I have, you make a fairly liquid yeasted batter and finally add beaten egg whites. Now, thats a material that doesn't take well to being jostled around. Just consider how carefully the egg whites are usually incorporated: There's even a cooking term for the method, you fold them in, instead of stirring like crazy. Many bakers will handle a batter with incorporated egg whites very carefully, because they don't want to burst those precious bubbles1. But unless I am working with something super delicate, a gentle tap of the filled pan can help too-large bubbles rise to the top (and subsequently be pierced) instead of creating unsightly cavities or worse, darkened patches on the surface. The kitchen rule of ""don't bang the spoon on the bowl"" may well originate from there - but then the rule applies to all kinds of batter with stiff egg whites. You can be on the very safe side and desist, but I am quite sure that it won't really matter if you tap gently. On the other hand, wiping the spoon with your finger or a spatula means you get all batter in your bowl, and not in the sink, which the frugal me appreciates. Not tapping the spoon will also prevent chipping the mixing bowl, which in the past was often made of clay or ceramics, and avoid splattering. 1 That's something that fires back in macaron making, where you have to purposefully destroy some of the bubbles... "
Why didn't microwaving a stainless steel spoon set my kitchen on fire?,"Metal has a lot of potential issues in the microwave (electric charge buildup + arcing, and microwave reflection). There are too many variables to make general statements like ""such-and-such metal is safe"" or ""smooth objects are safe"" with confidence, hence the sweeping guaranteed-safe blanket advice to not put metal in the microwave. The reason it didn't cause issues for you is likely the fact that it was insulated in a plastic container (thus preventing arcing to the microwave walls / magnetron) and that you also had some water in there to absorb any excess reflected energy (and maybe electrical energy through physics that I don't understand, but don't quote me on that one).  In fact a cursory search just happened to turn up this paper regarding sterilization of metal objects in a microwave, which mentions: Arcing back to the magnetron and damage to the microwave oven are prevented by placing a radar absorbent material within the oven and with proper insulation of the item to be sterilized And you've got both of those things: A radar absorbent material (the water) and the insulation (a perfectly sealed plastic container). The type and shape of your metal object is probably unrelated to the success of your accidental ""experiment"". As an aside: It's worth mentioning that in the case where a microwave oven does catch fire, the NFPA mentions that 17% of those fires involved the housing/casing of the appliance itself as the first item ignited, where the danger is presumably excess energy reflected back to the appliance, rather than arcing (magnified by poor design or older microwaves that didn't have as good of an ability to absorb reflected energy). That's why, for example, the authors of the sterilization paper linked above included a radar-absorbent material, strange and unpredictable reflections off of metal can easily put the microwave under uneven energy loads it wasn't designed to handle (see also thermal runaway). And of course, there's also issues with defective appliances or design flaws as well, e.g. that old GE spontaneous microwave fire lawsuit. While the causes of those fires aren't really related to the OP's situation, the point is making blanket statements about metals and such is further complicated by the potential for poorly designed or defective appliances. Also, this answer isn't intended to say ""insulation + water = always safe"", it's just intended as an explanation for your specific experience. Even ""safe"" is flexible: A microwave fire doesn't necessarily lead to a kitchen fire or a burned down house or an injury, e.g. I suppose you could call a microwave fire hazard ""safe"" if you were standing there on the ready with a fire extinguisher and protective clothing."
Should I rinse canned beans before using them?,"I finally found what I'm looking for, from the University of Michigan - some actual data on the subject! They say that rinsing canned beans can reduce the amount of sodium by half, and also reduces the amount of complex sugars which humans can't digest (but the bacteria in our intestines can, with uncomfortable results!) It appears that draining the fluid is likely to improve the flavor and texture of the resulting food by concentrating the flavor of the beans -- unless you're following a soup recipe that specifically suggests retaining the liquid to thicken the soup. I still haven't found any information about what healthy nutrients might be lost by rinsing the beans, but the general consensus seems to be that it rinsing will do more good than harm in almost all cases."
Can I fry food with solely essential lemon oil?,"Lemon & other citrus oils are primarily (90+%) made up of Limonene, which has a ""fire diamond"" of 🟦2-🟥2-🟨0:  The red 2 indicates flammability: Must be moderately heated or exposed to relatively high ambient temperature before ignition can occur (e.g. diesel fuel, paper, sulfur and multiple finely divided suspended solids that do not require heating before ignition can occur). Flash point between 37.8 and 93.3 °C (100 and 200 °F). Limonene has a flash point of only 50°C (122°F). Canola oil & most ""frying oils"", by contrast has a flash point of closer to 315°C (600°F). Note that the ""flash point"" is the temperature where flames & active combustion take place. This is generally a good bit above the usual ""smoke point"" which is used to rank cooking oils. The flash point is the more dangerous temperature, as it equates to fire. This limits the feasibility of doing any cooking in citrus oils, due to their flammability. The high limonene content would render lemon oil to be a fire hazard well below ""frying"" temperatures. If you've ever seen a flamed citrus peel used as a cocktail garnish, you would have witnessed the flammability of citrus oils. The blue 2 indicates a health risk: Intense or continued but not chronic exposure could cause temporary incapacitation or possible residual injury (e.g. diethyl ether, ammonium phosphate, carbon dioxide, iodine, chloroform, DEET). As mentioned in another answer, even if flammability wasn't an issue, this could be dangerous. Contact with the skin can cause a rash (""contact dermatitis"" if you're being technical about it) in certain cases. Even if it didn't burn at such a low temperature, the quantity of limonene needed for cooking, and the direct contact with your mouth while eating would result in a potentially dangerous situation. Small amounts are considered safe for consumption (and even used in supplements), but any significant quantity of lemon oil should not be consumed directly."
How do I get something sticky like honey or Golden Syrup off measuring spoons or measuring cups? Is there a better way?,"As, since this answer other suggestions have abounded, let me clarify.
These methods assume you want no wastage & also no cross-contamination of your source jar of the sticky component. They also require almost nothing in the way of 'extra equipment'. Depending on what the next steps to your recipe are, I can think of three alternatives. None are perfect and each would suit a different scenario. Tip it and leave it a long time. Heat it slightly. Microwave or sit the container in hot water.   or my favourite,"
Are there any dishes that can only be cooked with a microwave?,"Yes! In 1969, the physicist Nicholas Kurti gave a talk in which he demonstrated a variant of Baked Alaska called ""Frozen Florida"": a shell of frozen meringue around a center of hot liquor. This was done by chilling the meringue and the liquor together, then cooking in a microwave oven which had a rotating platter and no stirring fan. Because the microwave beam was always heating the center but only intermittently heating any given part of the meringue, and because the meringue was low-density and frozen, the liquor could be heated while the meringue remained frozen. (The idea was broadly similar to, and presumably inspired by, radiation therapy for cancer, in which a tightly focused beam of radiation revolves around a particular spot which may be deep inside the subject's body: only that single spot is always being energized by the beam, so it receives much more energy than the rest of the body does.)"
Once a month cooking,"For years I did the 'once a week' cooking, which has the advantage of not requiring much freezer space (which I didn't have, with my under-counter apartment fridge).  Part of the trick was cooking something that could be used multiple ways with minimal effort -- a blend of ground beef, onions and peppers could be turned into a pasta sauce, mexican food, etc. These days, I still don't go quite to the extreme you're talking about, but I will do things like make way more than I know I'm going to use right away, and freeze the rest -- chili, black bean soup, stock, lasagna, etc.  When chicken's on sale, I'll poach a large batch, shred it, then freeze it in zip top freezer bags.  I can turn it into chicken tacos in a few minutes -- thaw with some water in a pan, add spices, and cook 'til the water's mostly boiled off. Now, as in the past few months I've made a lot of meals for my brother's family while his wife was pregnant with twins, some considerations: One thing I've heard about, but never done myself, is people who have a dinner exchange -- sort of like a cookie exchange for the holidays -- everyone makes up a number of casseroles, or whatever, and then people meet up, and everyone takes one of everyone else's items home.  So, if you're thinking about doing this, and know of other people who might want to, also, you might be able to get some extra variety.  (of course, if you don't like their cooking, it might not work out so well). ... and one last thought -- it won't help on the baby preparation front, but if I were going to do this as a regular thing, I'd consider making one or two recipes, with batches for 4-5 dinners each ... so I was staggering things, and not having to spend a whole day (or weekend) trying to make enough different things to have variety for a whole month."
Is it safe to eat moldy cheese if you slice off the edges?,I think it would depend on the cheese.
How do you make a cake lift equally and minimize doming?,"When you heat leavened dough, two things happen: The pattern you are seeing means that your cake gets hotter on the sides than in the middle. The sides get set early and stop rising, while the middle is still soft and continues rising. This happens because the walls of the pan conduct heat to the sides of the cake quicker than heat is conducted inside the cake. You see the phenomenon in an exaggarated form in a muffin, which is usually higher than wide: it is always rounded on top, and often split, because the liquid core from the middle continues to rise after a crust has formed on the surface.  This can be accomplished by using a pan which insulates well. With an insulating pan, the sides will stay liquid longer and rise more. Unfortunately there are no insulated drop-out-bottom pans. Porcelain
I have had good results in a porcelain or Pyrex pan. The pan insulates the cake from the bottom and the sides, but not from the top, so you will need to bake it on a lower rack and/or reduce temperature on the upper heater in order to not burn the upper surface. Getting a cake layer out of the pan in one piece can be hard.
To deal with this problem, if your batter is not too sticky, the bottom of the pan can be lined with parchment paper. The sides can be lined with a strip of parchment or well lubricated with fat. This approach is a hassle.
 Insulate a metal pan
Perhaps, when combined with other approaches, a metal cake pan with thicker walls will work well enough.
You could also try a more DIY solution, like attaching 2-3 layers of a cut-to-fit silicone rolling mat stripes to the outside of the walls of a metal pan. However, it is quite hard to come up with a good attachment method (glue could release toxic fumes at oven temperatures, if it holds at all). So this method should work, but is somewhat hard to apply. Glass and silicone pans
There are pans with glass bottoms and silicone walls but I think these would not help because the glass would insulate better than the thin silicone. Preheating
Perhaps preheating the detached bottom of a metal pan with the oven could help, but I haven't tried it. Pre-shape the cake
If your batter is liquid, you cannot use this method. But if you are working with a batter that has a spoonable consistency, don't spread it level. Instead, spread it slightly concave, with a shallow dell in the middle. This will equalize while baking. Use a bigger pan.
I think that Americans mostly use 9 inch pans, but if you used an original sacher recipe from Austria, it is probably meant for a 26 or a 28 cm pan. Also, there is something I have noticed empirically, even though I don't have an explanation: if you bake the same batter in pans of different width, side-by-side in the same oven, and fill them to the same depth, the smaller diameter pans will tend to dome more. So, the size contributes a lot. Bake the two layers separately
Divide the batter into two pans instead of making a single layer and cutting it. This is unorthodox, as you get more crust but it's better than a hunchbacked sacher. You should use a scale or at least a measuring jug to divide the batter, or you'll end up with different thicknesses. Also remember to reduce the baking time, as the core will heat up faster. Use a toothpick for probing doneness. The walls will always set before the core and, if there is enough baking powder, the core will still expand a little bit more. If the concentration of baking powder is low you'll get less bubbles, so less lift.
Of course, using too little baking powder will also ruin the cake, so you'll have to be cautious and experiment a bit before hitting the correct amount. This is somewhat risky, as it can result in a different texture of the final product, due to the different rate at which water will evaporate from the dough and a longer baking time. Also, if your temperature is too low, you won't get a golden crust on a light-coloured dough. This should not be a problem for a frosted cake like the sacher. With less gluten you get a mesh which is less dense and needs more time until it gets firm enough to prevent rising. Use cake flour instead of all purpose flour. A bit more fat will also help to inhibit gluten development but too much will change the taste and texture. All methods I described should attribute to a solution, but probably none of them will be sufficient by itself. You'll have to pick a combination of them and see what works best for you. You should also apply all the usual methods for getting a good cake: These techniques ensure a better batter texture, which means a more even heating. They will also ensure a more consistent leavening process because: Not following these techniques is more likely to result in a lopsided cake or a big bubble. I realize that this hasn't happened in the case you describe, but it would be too bad to get an asymmetrically risen cake after you took all the precautions against a disproportionally rising center."
Why drain soaked rice?,"Apart from water, rice is mainly made from starch. Starch is initially packed in a crystalline structure that is not soluble. However if you soak it for long enough or expose it to heat, the starch slowly 'unpacks' and binds with water, resulting in a soluble compound. This is called starch gelatinization, and is what you are aiming for when you soak your rice in water (note it gains volume!). But it works in two ways: now soluble starch molecules detach from the rice and go into the water. This is why it gets cloudy.  The upshot is that this water is full of rice starch, and if you cook it will behave similar to when you add corn starch to water: thicken and form a glue. If you cook your rice in this water you should thus expect a much stickier result, with big lumps of rice 'glued' together. This is not always undesirable! Risotto is an example of cooked rice where we deliberately use this effect (so don't wash or soak your risotto rice). "
"Why is some metal safe to use in a microwave, but others not?","Metal on its own doesn't necessarily cause electric discharge in a microwave.  What causes the sparking that you see when you put a fork in a microwave is due to the ""sharp"" edges of the fork. These edges concentrate the voltage at their tips which will cause a spark when it exceeds the dielectric breakdown of air. Things like sheet pans (with rounded edges), or rounded metal racks are used frequently in microwaves with no ill effect. The absence of any pointed edges allows this. The rim of your bowl fits this requirement."
Frying Oil Reuse,"It is absolutely OK to filter and reuse deep-fry oil. It's not uncommon at some short-order restaurants for them to filter the oil daily and only change it once a week.  Of course, it does start to taste a little ""off"" when you reuse it that many times. There's also the matter of impurities lowering the smoke point; even when you filter, the result is obviously not ""pure"" oil; the more you reuse it, the lower the smoke point gets, and eventually it will actually start to smoke at deep-fry temperatures (i.e. become unusable). For home use, I'd recommend no more than 3 or 4 reuses.  Check the oil to see if it needs to be changed sooner than that - if the colour or smell is off, don't use it again.  Best to compare it against a sample of the same ""fresh"" oil; sometimes it's hard to just eyeball it without a frame of reference.  If it looks totally clear and smells fresh, you could probably go up to 5 or 6 reuses - but definitely not more than that. P.S. There will be some people who tell you that you should never reuse oil for general health (not safety) reasons.  My response to that tends to be that if you're eating deep-fried food, you're probably not all that concerned about long-term health risks.  Rest assured that if you do a lot of eating out, you've eaten plenty of food fried in ""leftover"" oil."
What's the proper way to dispose of used fats & oils?,"Never down the drain.  We've had a few incidents in my neighborhood where the sewer pipes were clogged with fat, and a few people's basements flooded with sewage as a result. For fats that solidify, let them do so, then pitch them in your regular garbage. Chill grease in the fridge if you need to get it to harden up. For ones that don't solidify, pour them into a sealable (hopefully non-recyclable) bottle, and throw the whole container away with your regular garbage.  It's possible that your area might accept cooking fats & oils as part of a recycling effort. Ours does for motor oil (I live in Maryland). For restaurants, some places (eg, the state of Maryland) require a system for catching grease that's been washed down the sink. It's my understanding that they're fairly expensive (a couple thousand dollars US), but the fines for not having one installed may be even more, and they won't let new restaurants open without one."
Should I refrigerate eggs?,"The exterior coating on an egg is known as the ""cuticle"".  It helps to protect the (porous) shell and minimize moisture loss, but it eventually breaks down as the chick matures and prepares to hatch. The reason that eggs in the US are typically sold under refrigeration is because they are washed with warm water and detergent to remove the large amount of bacteria that are deposited on the shell while being laid.  Once the cuticle is removed the egg becomes more porous. Most bakeries that are using whole eggs will typically keep several flats out at all times to have them at room temperature.  Eggs will store better and longer in the refrigerator but if being used frequently and fairly quickly, they can also be left at room temperature.  Howard McGee in On Food & Cooking says that egg quality deteriorates as much in one day at room temperature as it does four days under refrigeration."
What's the difference between a cupcake and a muffin?,"There is considerable overlap between cupcakes and muffins. From a technical point of view, muffins are made by the muffin method, making them small quickbreads.  In the muffin method, the wet ingredients are combined in one bowl; and the dry ingredients are combined in another bowl.  Then the two are quickly incorporated together with minimal mixing to avoid gluten development.  This gives muffins a somewhat coarse crumb. Cupcakes are small cakes, and are made by one of the traditional cake methods such as the creaming method, the reverse creaming method, the genoise method, the chiffon method, and so on.  They tend to have a finer crumb than muffins. While no single criterion distinguishes a muffin from a cupcake if you do not adopt the technical definition above, the following trends exist:"
Why wait for water to boil?,"The primary reason is for accuracy and reliability in cooking times. Boiling water is guaranteed (not accounting for altitude) to be at 212 F (100 C). With a set temperature you can then say things like ""boil X for 9 minutes"" with a very high measure of confidence. You certainly can cook things in the water as you go, but it's going to be a lot more hit-and-miss. Pasta, for example, will begin to cook before it reaches the boiling point. You would need to measure the temperature, and check the pasta regularly to determine when it was done. You can't give someone an accurate cooking time with this method either. The time it takes for water to boil will vary greatly with stove heat output, pot size & shape, and the amount of water."
Why let dough rise twice?,Allowing dough to rise twice results in a finer gluten structure than allowing it to rise once.  It results in a smaller crumb and prevents huge gaping airholes in your bread.  The reason that you have to let it re-rise is that you just pushed all the air out with the kneading you did developing that gluten structure.
Is it true that bananas are radioactive?,"Well, yes to both, up to a point. All things are radioactive - radioactive isotopes occur in minute concentrations in nature, so stones, trees, water, air, and indeed fruits are radioactive, and it can be measured too, but only because our instruments are very sensitive. Life has evolved in this environment for ~4 billion years, and it is clearly not enough to harm us. As for the second question - if you will forgive the tongue-in-cheek answer - anything will kill you if you eat too much; that could be concidered the definition of 'too much'. But I think you will have to eat an incredible number of bananas, and it won't be the radiation that kills you, but the overeating."
"When boiling water without any other ingredients in it, why start from cold?","Some people say cold water boils faster than hot water, this is false, found here and here. One reason might be (from the first link):
""Some water heaters may introduce additional sediment into the water, giving you another reason to consider starting with cold—at least, if time is not of the essence."""
Why throw pizza dough besides for show?,"A lot of it depends on the type of pizza you make. Where I worked we did thin crust pizza, and these were the reasons we tossed: Speed. Trying to roll or pat out a 17 inch pizza would be very time consuming.  Consistency. Was easier to make the crust a consistent size and shape. Space. Rolling or patting a person needs the table space 100% of the time. When tossing you can step back from the table and let another person get in to prep (or finish) their toss. Job marketing. People wanted to work there just to learn how to toss, and it helped maintain that ""authentic"" vibe. And as you pointed out, the show aspect of it. Kids loved to watch our staff toss."
"When you cook spaghetti, do you add olive oil to the boiling water?","Yes, it is true that we don't add oil to the boiling water. I'm not aware of any good reason to waste extra-virgin olive oil that way! Some oil is always added at the end, over the sauce, when the pasta is already in the plate! It has to be raw, so that it retains its fruit nuances and texture. If you are doing cold pasta salad and want to avoid sticky pasta, adding oil in advance won't help. You have instead to wash pasta under cold water to wash the starch away (you can put the pasta in the colander directly under the running cold tap)."
Why is eating pretzels safe when they are bathed in lye?,"Basically, the lye reacts with the CO₂ and moisture present during baking to form a non-toxic carbonate.  This makes it safe to eat. The reaction: CO₂ (g) + H₂O (l) ­⇄ H₂CO₃ (aq) H₂CO₃ (aq) + 2 NaOH (aq) → Na₂CO₃ (aq) + 2 H₂O (l) From here (MS doc)  [EDIT] Spurred by the comments, I have searched further. tl;dr There is much going on wrt the lye dip. As far as safety goes, the lye is consumed in many reactions, including the above. The effects of alkali dipping on starch, protein, and color changes in hard pretzel products have never been researched. Experiments were conducted to mimic reactions occurring on the pretzel dough surface. Dough was dipped in water or 1% sodium hydroxide solution at different temperatures between 50°C and 80°C. Protein and starch profile after dipping were analyzed. Color development on pretzel surface following the extraction of pigments from flour was investigated. Whole dough and pretzel samples were also made at pilot plant and the properties were analyzed. Only starch granules on the dough surface were gelatinized following dipping. Amylose-lipid complex dissociated at a lower temperature with alkali treatment but were not dissociated, even at high-temperature dipping in water. Treating the dough at 80°C in alkali solution resulted in the hydrolysis of proteins into smaller peptides that could be not precipitated by trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Dough surface color was different following pigment extraction from flour but not significantly different following baking. The results suggest that the color that developed on pretzel surface was not due to pigments present in the flour but was contributed by the reaction within or between the starch and protein hydrolysis derivatives during baking. and what I think is the pertinent quote from the blog: The protein results (2 in the list above [reproduced following]) indicate that the lye dip provides the smaller proteins needed for Maillard reactions, whereas the water dip does not. This seemed like perhaps the most important point to me. Both the blog and the paper are worth reading. My conclusion: the lye is consumed by the various reactions and therefore poses no safety concerns."
How do I know if food left at room temperature is still safe to eat?,"You cannot always see or smell bacterial contamination. Mold that appears to be growing only on the surface may grow invisible roots into softer foods. Do not rely on a visual inspection or ""smell test"" to tell you whether or not a food is safe. It's not worth the risk - food poisoning can be much, much worse than an upset stomach. Per the USDA guidelines, potentially hazardous food that stays in the temperature ""danger zone"", 40-140 °F (4-60 °C), for more than 2 hours should be discarded. For temperatures above 90°F (32°C), the limit is 1 hour.* Potentially hazardous foods are those foods that spoil most easily, such as unshelled eggs, raw meats, fish, shell fish, dairy products, almost all cooked foods. This time is cumulative, so it includes time bringing the food home from the grocery store, time before cooking, time after cooking, and so on.   The reason is that while cooking may destroy bacteria or other pathogens, it doesn't always destroy the toxins that they have produced. In general, regarding perishable foods like meat, most dairy, unshelled eggs and shell eggs (in the US), cooked casseroles, and so on:  if the food (or its perishable components) have been at room temperature for more than two hours, you should discard that food. To avoid the danger zone, keep cooked food hot until ready to eat, then refrigerate immediately. Separate large items into smaller containers to help them to cool more quickly. If you’re defrosting something, do it in the fridge or under cold running water. If you can be certain that the food was not in the danger zone, then yes, it is safe. For example, if you left a large chunk of frozen meat out and it is still frozen solid (including the surface) when you come back to it, it was not in the danger zone. These guidelines are about making sure you don't get a foodborne illness, i.e. reducing the risk to where it's so small as to not be an issue. So if you break the rules, e.g. eating food that's been left at room temperature for 8 hours, that doesn't mean you will get sick, just that you're taking a risk. Some bacteria leave behind harmful protein toxins that cannot be ""killed"" (denatured) by cooking. Cooking food is only effective against live organisms, not their toxic waste products. Spoiled food cannot be cooked back to safety and must be discarded. Cooking is pasteurization, not sterilization. Pasteurization means killing most microbes, so as to render the food safe for human consumption.  Sterilization methods (e.g. pressure-canning and irradiation) are the only safe methods for longer-term room-temperature storage. Otherwise, the danger zone rules always apply. Even sterilized food can only remain sterile under an airtight seal, e.g. when properly canned or vacuum-sealed. Once it is opened, it is no longer sterile. Air contains countless bacteria and molds, and their spores, which will readily re-colonize any suitable environment they encounter. Cooked food tends to be an ideal medium for growth. For foods that aren't potentially hazardous as described above, there's no solid rule, but things are generally safe for much longer than the 2 hours given above. For example, things which are sold at room temperature (e.g. fresh produce, bread, or cookies) are most likely safe at least all day or overnight if not for days or even months. You can find guidelines for common things at StillTasty. Follow the guidelines set out by reputable regulatory agencies, especially when serving others. Local organizations include: Other regulatory sources apply in other parts of the word, but major food safety organizations usually agree in essence (if not in complete detail) on most issues. Failure to follow reputable guidelines is irresponsible if you are serving guests, and failure to follow your specific local codes is likely to be illegal if you are serving customers. Health codes tend to be very conservative, to fully protect the community.    You have the right to take risks on yourself by ignoring their recommendations, but please do not risk the safety of others. Once again, if you suspect spoilage or contamination, please, throw it out. * Note: this is the USDA's rule. Other agencies may have variations on it. Additionally, government agencies generally make very conservative recommendations - they're trying to make sure that no one who follows the rules gets sick. Breaking the rules means maybe taking on some risk. That's up to you - just remember, eventually someone gets unlucky, and food poisoning is not fun."
Why fry rice before boiling?,"This is sometimes called ""pilaf style"", though technically actual pilafs do not require the sauteeing step. It is, however, very common in pilaf and related dishes. The main function of this is to change the composition of the starch on the surface of the rice. This reduces the starches that cross-link and make rice sticky. It helps your rice to cook up into separate grains. While you're at it, it also adds some flavor to the rice, by caramelizing some of the starches. Plus, it adds oil, which can carry flavors of its own and help distribute fat-soluble flavors in the other ingredients. The effect is very different from ""fried rice"", where the starches have already been cooked and gelatinized before frying. The goals are somewhat the same, adding browned flavors and distributing fat-soluble ingredients, but the chemical changes to the surface of the rice itself will be different."
How can you reduce the heat of a chili pepper?,"In Indian cooking we usually add Ghee (Clarified butter) to reduce the heat of a chili pepper. Most Indian dishes, we would add a good heaping spoon of ghee before feeding little ones. This helps temper the heat but keeps the flavors alive so that the children get used to them and can gradually learn to eat hotter foods."
Is it bad to cook frozen meat without thawing it?,"It's really a question of taste.  It's not going to hurt you, but there will be some undesirable effects.  For example, to cook turkey properly, it must come to an internal temp. of 180. If the meat is frozen, it is going to take a lot longer for the internal temperature to rise that high, so the outside of the bird will be somewhat overcooked (compared to roasting a thawed bird). That meat will be much tougher than it would be otherwise. If your question is querying as to whether it will cause ill health, then no, it will not. My mom does it all the time.  Her roasts are tough, though. I have done this, but only when I am braising the meat, or using a slow cooker, which will cause the meat to be tender either way."
Never ending soup; is it actually safe?,"It takes quite a while for a pot of hot soup to cool down to 40°F in the fridge. Several hours, sometimes, depending on the shape of the pot and the volume of soup. If you're heating and re-chilling the same soup daily, it's going to spend a lot of time in the danger zone. From a safety perspective, you'd be much better off making a pot of soup every few days and then reheating just the portion that you're actually going to eat. I still recommend this money saving idea to current students Soup is a great food for stretching a dollar, but I don't see how it's any more expensive to make a fresh pot twice a week and it shouldn't take much time either. I understand that you were adding scraps each night, but you could as easily save those scraps for a day or two until you make the next pot of soup."
"When I'm separating egg whites, how much does it matter if a little yolk gets in?","Yes, it matters a lot. When you are separating egg whites, it is for whipping them into a foam. This foam is a protein-based foam, relying on protein ends hooking into each other. Even small traces of fat will prevent the foam from forming. Egg yolks contain high amounts of fat. Once an egg yolk breaks in your whites, you have to start the separation anew, because it can prevent your foam from forming. Also, don't use plastic bowls for whipping egg whites (their surface retains some fat molecules even after washing, giving you a less stable foam) and only whip with a cleanly washed whisk or mixer attachment (not one you have just used for something else, not even if you wiped it clean).  To prevent big mishaps, just separate each new egg in a teacup and only add the new white to the old whites after it has separated cleanly. Else you are in big trouble if you are separating a lot and the last egg contaminates the whole whites with yolk. And a single contaminated egg is easily reused for a quick egg-and-feta sandwich or something else.  Contamination the other way round isn't so worrisome. You still want to work as precisely as possible, as yolk-only recipes will often have somewhat worse texture if eggwhite is included, but small contaminating amounts are usually not noticeable in the finished product, even in foams (zabaglione, mayonnaise). This is because yolk foams are fat-based, and small amounts of protein don't prevent a fat foam from forming. "
Is it safe to eat smoked bacon without grilling?,"In such a case, for any food item, ask yourself a question: In a 19th century household, would it have been kept in the cellar, or eaten immediately?  For bacon, it is common knowledge (or at least I think everybody knows it) that it was kept in a cellar for long time. So this is definitely not a food which perishes too quickly. You can eat it raw. (In fact, I often do when I need a quick sandwich). It can be a bit tough to tear apart with your teeth, so pre-cut it.  The reason for this is that bacon is cured meat. There are two reasons not to eat raw meat: taste and food safety. Taste is individual, some people are OK with the taste and eat raw meat as long as they can find a source of meat fresh enough (think sashimi, carpaccio, steak tartare). Food safety is not a problem with bacon. The process of turning pork to bacon includes salt and smoke. Both of these kill bacteria, create an environment which is not hospitable to new colonization (dry, salty), and give the meat a new flavor which is better than the raw meat.  If you are now asking yourself why we are bothering with the fridge for bacon and other ex-""cellar foods"" at all, there is still a reason. First, most of us don't have a convenient cellar at 12° - 15°C, and not only is the bacon's life shortened if kept at usual kitchen temperatures, it also doesn't taste too good. It is just greasy. Second, you seldom get dry bacon at the supermarket; even if the curing process doesn't include brining, bacon is often aged much less than in old times, and then packed in vacuum, so it doesn't get really dry on the outside. So bacteria could very well start growing on it outside of the freezer. Inside the freezer, it keeps much longer than raw meat, and is certainly OK for consumption without frying. I guess that the popularity of fried bacon is mainly due to taste reasons. "
Could coconut cream be used to create a non-dairy ganache for whipping?,"Abstract: Ganache is delicious, but not everyone eats dairy. We examined whether coconut milk can be used for the creation of a non-dairy ganache. We ran a series of experiments. The answer is that, with some creative techniques, you can use it, but it does not come anywhere near to the real thing.  Introduction. Someone wrote a question on Seasoned advice about coconut based ganache and we got curious.  Background. We love ganache even more than pure chocolate, and make it often ourselves, so we think we have all the prerequisites needed to create and judge a coconut based ganache recipe. Our favorite ganache recipe 1 (which we used as a starting point) is: 100 g chocolate, 72% cocoa (only made from cocoa, sugar, and cocoa butter, no vegetable fat or emulsifiers); 100 g cream, at least 30% (non-UHT), 25 g butter.   Method. We prepared the base mix as follows: 25 g coconut milk were heated until boiling. They were removed from the heat. 25 g chocolate (72%) and 6g cocoa butter were added. Everything was left to dissolve. After 5 minutes, the mixture was whipped with a handheld mixer at the second-to-highest setting. This was Version 0. It was divided in two batches. Different versions were made from each batch by gradually adding guar (a knife-point-ful), egg yolk (1, in lieu of lecithine) and sugar (8g per batch). Each version was whipped for at least 3 minutes. The final versions (1c and 2b) where put for 30 min in the refrigerator, then taken out and whipped again. As there were no observable changes after the cold whipping, we do not treat them as a different version. We also made a small portion of dairy ganache for comparison purposes.  Results. These are listed in Table 1. The numbers in the ingredients columns of the table represent the order of adding the ingredients to the mixtures. 
Table 1. Experiment results. 
  The final consistency of version 1c is documented in Figure 1. Note that the peaks do not drip and you can rotate the bowl at 180° without anything falling out. The piece of chocolate was added for color comparison. 
 Figure 2 shows a zoom of the blue bordered area in Figure 1.
  Discussion. It is possible to make a profiterole filling with coconut milk based ganache, but it isn't quite like the real deal. Also, it resembles non-whipped ganache more closely than whipped ganache.  The basic ganache recipe can be done with coconut milk instead of cream and cocoa butter instead of butter. However, it tastes fattier than real ganache, and it is runnier. Unlike dairy ganache, whipping does not result in aeration.  We think that eliminating the cocoa butter altogether will somewhat alleviate the fatiness problem, but we did not test this proposal yet.  A thickening and or emulsifying agent can improve the ganache texture. Even though egg yolk improves aeration, is not a good choice, as it results in a slimy feel. Guar is a better solution.  The addition of sugar ruins the chocolateness of the taste. If bitterness is not desired, a sweeter chocolate (50%) should be used. Only dedicated sugar lovers or Americans should resort to adding sugar. In that case, it should be added before the guar (we would suggest dissolving it in the coconut milk before boiling it) as not to interfere with the texture of the final product.  Threats to validity. First, there was a single tester (the quasi-royal we). Second, this tester is already biased in favor of dairy products in general and specifically for dairy based ganache. Third, many interesting combinations (including xanthan gum and corn starch) could not be tested due to lack of resources.  Conclusion and outlook. We found the experiment very inspirating. It was also yummy. But we'd like to issue an warning: This experiment is dangerous. In the preparation phase, we discovered a penchant for guared coconut water deep fried in coconut fat we'd rather not have known about. Nevertheless, we are looking forward to offering the results for peer preview to a chocolate-loving lactose intolerant co worker.  References: 1 My own recipe book"
How to Store Fresh Herbs,"If you're going to store anything leafy in a plastic bag, I wrap it first in a paper towel, then in the plastic bag, so none of the leaves touch the bag.  This prevents the issue where the outer leaves turn to goo.  (I'm not sure what the actual biological issue is ... moisture/condensation? poor respiration?) Don't wash it before storage, as the extra moisture will cause it to rot faster. I think I've gotten as long as a month out of flat leaf parsley, when I buried them in the back of my crisper drawer and forgot about them.  (of course, I wasn't constantly opening the bag as you would when using them, and I'm not sure exactly when I placed it in there, as I had forgotten about it)."
How do you clean a seasoned cast iron skillet?,"Kosher salt and a small amount of vegetable oil.  Scrub the pan with the salt on a rag or paper towel, if there are stubborn bits mix a couple drops of oil with the salt, wipe dry with clean towel.  If you use a wet method to clean the pan re-heat it after cleaning to make sure it is completely dry before storing. "
Why do people smash garlic?,"Contrary to what several folks have said, garlic is not crushed primarily to help peel the skin. For example, garlic can be peeled easily with the clove intact, by cutting the small hard circular bottom of the clove (the part that's attached to the base, opposite to the pointy end). This will help loosen the skin, which should then come off very easily or will separate if you gently slide the blade of your knife in and loosen it. While it certainly is true that crushing helps separate the skin, making it easier to peel (perhaps some folks might do it for that reason at home), that isn't the reason why professional cooks do it or the reason why recipes suggest it. Garlic is primarily crushed to release its oils, which in turn infuses subtly different flavours to the dish than if you didn't crush. Joe's comment above explains the chemical reaction: ... within the garlic cells are alliin and alliinase, which when combined, form allicin, which is the 'strong' flavor ... You might also find this article from the Washington Post, where the author talks about the art of cooking with crushed garlic in Italian restaurants, a really good read. Specifically, the author addresses some of these key points which are very relevant here. From basic physics, something that is broken up into several tiny bits has a much larger total surface area than the whole intact piece. Since the oils extrude from the cut surface, it stands to reason that minced garlic will release them sooner and readily, often leading to a more pungent taste than desired. In addition, minced garlic can be quite temperamental and you might often end up over cooking/burning.  As the author notes: In its customary minced or chopped form, garlic can impart a pungent flavor that is difficult to harness. Add it too early to a sauté or stew and garlic burns and becomes acrid. Add it in the latter stages of cooking and the garlic steams or boils, leaving it raw-tasting and unpleasant. On the other hand, slightly crushed garlic is more versatile and heat tolerant. Left whole and partially smashed (just enough to release its powerful oils), garlic adapts to a range of high-heat techniques, cooking steadily and lending a mellow richness to a dish. Crushed garlic is pretty standard in several Italian dishes. The advantage of having one or two large crushed pieces (in addition to those mentioned above) is that you can easily remove them from the dish once you're satisfied with the aroma/taste of the dish. This can be extremely annoying to do with minced garlic. Some of the dishes that are enhanced by using crushed garlic are: In [roasts, stews, quick meals and stir-fries], smashed garlic cloves are remarkably flexible, absorbing high heat and in turn giving off subtle but substantial flavor. To answer why crushing garlic works, let me quote a bit from a good answer to the very popular question on chopping onions (since we all understand onions better): The enzymes and amino acids involved in producing the Onion Lachrymatory Factor (seriously!) are normally contained in the cells, and only become a problem when released in volume. Using a sharper knife will avoid mangling cell walls, creating more clean separations between layers, and reducing the amount of enzymes released. Garlic, along with onions, shallots and leeks belong to the group of plants (genus) called Allium and being very closely related, the above is more or less true. Indeed, it makes sense that if you want large volumes of oils/enzymes, you'd do exactly the opposite of the above advice, which is to crush it and break all the cell walls! This also aids in the mixing of the chemicals per Joe's comment above. Note that although a large volume is ""released"" or ready to be released due to the crushed cell walls, they make their way to the dish slowly because of the smaller surface area."
What's the right way to hard boil eggs?,"I've never adjusted the length of time based on number of eggs. As long as the water is boiling I don't think it would take any longer to cook a dozen than to cook one (it might take the water longer to come up to boiling, I guess). For hard boiled I normally bring them up to the boil and then turn the heat off, and leave them for 15 minutes. If you like them less well-cooked, you could reduce this to 12 minutes. Then empty the pan and re-fill it cold water a couple of times to cool them down quickly. Leave rest of them sitting in the cold water while you prepare each one."
Why are there so many different pasta shapes?,"One answer to this is that Americans have a reversed understanding of the relationship of pasta to sauce compared to Italians. In Italy, the sauce is called the condimento, meaning literally it is a condiment to the noodles, which are intended to be the main source of enjoyment in the dish. When you begin to understand it that way, it makes sense that you would want to have a wide variety of sizes, shapes and textures. (What Taeraresh said is also true, there are functional differences in how the different shapes hold sauces.)"
"Why skim ""scum"" from the surface of a simmering stock?","Skimming is for aesthetic purposes. The scum is denatured protein, mostly comprising the same proteins that make up egg whites.  It is harmless and flavorless, but visually unappealing.  Eventually, the foam will break up into microscopic particles and disperse into your stock, leaving it grayish and cloudy.  The more vigorously your stock bubbles, the faster this process will occur.   If the grayness or cloudiness bothers you but skimming is not an option for some reason, you can always remove the micro-particulates later through the clarification process used to make consomme."
Are carrots dyed orange?,"Probably not. Carrots naturally (or due to selective breeding) come in an extremely wide variety of colors from white to yellow to orange to red/pink to purple. It's likely that you were simply looking at two different varieties, one of which was more pale than the other. 
click image for source Even the color being only ""skin deep"" isn't necessarily a sign of it being a dye as many carrots have white cores, or at least cores that are more white than their surrounding flesh. Which you can see an example of below: "
Does ginger have to be peeled? If so how?,"There's no reason to peel besides the aesthetics of it. There's no major flavor or nutritional difference either way. If the ginger is going to be seen then peel it, if not don't bother.  The best way to peel ginger is to use the edge of a small spoon to rub it off, it works really well, takes seconds, and doesn't waste as much as using a knife or peeler. "
Is there something I can do to keep ice-cream soft?,"Yes, actually, there are two magic ingredients: Guar gum and Xanthan gum. Guar gum is a thickener, but in small quantities can also prevent the growth of ice crystals which would cause the ice cream to harden into icicles. Xanthan gum is a stabilizer which helps keep air (called overrun) in the mixture.  Air is generally churned into ice cream by ice cream machines, but it won't stay that way without the stabilizer."
How long can I keep eggs in the refrigerator?,"Back in the 70's, the folks at Mother Earth News performed an egg storage experiment.  They stored them in a variety of ways, both refrigerated and unrefrigerated, to see how long they could keep.  They concluded that unwashed eggs (aka, ""hen fruit"" or ""cackleberries"") stored in a sealed container, and kept at 35° to 40°F, were still perfectly edible after seven months: (1) Unwashed, fertile homestead eggs seem
to store much better than washed,
unfertile agribiz eggs. Why? Probably
for the simple reason that they're
unwashed ... and not because they're
fertile. Hen fruit, as it comes from
the chicken, is coated with a light
layer of a natural sealing agent
called ""bloom"". And, while a good wash
may make a batch of eggs look more
attractive, it also removes this
natural protective coating ... leaving
the eggs more subject to aging and
attack by the air and bacteria in the
air. (2) The very best way we've found to stash
eggs away for long-term storage is in
a sealed container at a temperature of
35° to 40°F. Their whites may become
somewhat runny looking over a period
of time, but even after seven
months—the cackleberries stored in
this manner smell good, taste good,
have a good texture, and—in short—seem
""almost fresh"". Update 2011-02-19: This discussion inspired me to do some experimentation of my own.  We keep chickens, so I plucked two eggs on October 2, 2010 and put them in the refrigerator.  I just pulled them out today.  Here's a picture of one of them next to a fresh egg.  One of these eggs was laid yesterday and the other was laid 140 days (4 months 17 days) ago.  Can you guess which is which? Update 2011-06-05: I completed my eggsperiment today by cracking open two more eggs that I have had in the refrigerator since October 21, 2010.  Here they are:  There was no trace of odor, but the whites were definitely lacking in firmness.  I scrambled them.  They didn't make for very fluffy scramblers due to the watery whites, but they tasted fine.  So, I can confirm the findings of the Mother Earth News experiment.  Fresh, unwashed eggs stored in the refrigerator were perfectly edible after 7 months 15 days (227 days)!"
Where does the green part of the scallion start and the white part end?,"If you want to be really, really picky, then the 'green' is each individual leaf as it breaks away from the cylindrical whole. That leaves you with the decision as to whether to pick off each leaf, giving you a bit of extra 'white' or just make some relatively arbitrary decision after you hit that first leaf 'node'. So, unless you want to pick off each leaf, then it's 'about here… ish… '  Personally, if I'm being 'a bit picky' I will unwrap the outer layer for the first couple of nodes, where they go unattractively lumpy, purely for aesthetic reasons & include the rest in my 'white' distinction. Once I get far enough I [that I can't be bothered any further] then I pick out any remaining 'white' bits & go all-in for the rest  of the greens, until I hit the raggy ends, which join the roots in the compost bag.
Once you've actually cut to the green line, separation for 'fussy distinction' reasons does get easier, as you're no longer dealing with the entirety of the onion & its reluctance to part layers without ripping down to the root - you can just pull bits off & deal with them separately."
Why do some foods taste better the next day?,"For pastas at least, the noodles have a chance to absorb more flavor directly into the bland noodles. Same with potatoes in stews. If the dish cools and is then reheated, more water is lost into the air. This effectively reduces the dish and intensifies flavors."
"""Room temperature"" and ""cool, dry place"" -- are there actual temperatures associated with these canned phrases?","""Room temperature"" as used for testing, analysis, and validation purposes generally falls within the range of 65F-75F (18C-24C). Published research will typically specify temperature ranges used. Both the FDA Food Code (2017) and Canadian Food Retail and Food Services Code (2016), providing guidelines for inspection activities, take an outcome-based approach and do not reference specific storage temperatures or humidity levels as products stored unopened in these conditions are designed to be safe or are self-evident if spoiled/unsafe - mouldy potatoes, rusted or swollen cans, etc. In most jurisdictions in North America, refrigerator and freezer temperature conditions are often codified in laws and may be required to be explicitly labelled for consumer protection since pathogen activity is not as readily evident as spoilage - some Listeria, for example, can reproduce in food below 40F/4C, making both maximum storage temperature and duration needed. A better source for optimum room temperature conditions would be your local building code, though most will specify the same range noted above and humidity <60%. If it's comfortable for humans, it's most likely suitable for products designed for those conditions. For your ghee example - it originates in India for preserving butterfat at 30C+ temperatures and seasonal relative humidity close to 100%. When properly stored in an airtight container there is no water available for microorganism activity, and the concern is more for long-term quality decline due to oxidative rancidity."
How do I pick a watermelon at the supermarket?,"I don't believe there is a fool-proof way to determine 'ripeness' without taking a slice out of it. The best you can do is look for certain signs: Unfortunately, melons don't continue to ripen once picked, unlike fruits such as apples, bananas etc. which contain ethylene. As a tip don't store melons with these kinds of fruit, they may well go 'soggy'. Extra: NYtimes video on picking the right watermelon."
"If you add spices to boiling pasta, will it absorb spices/flavours?","Poorly. Pasta doesn't absorb all that much flavor from spices in the water, other than maybe salt (and even then you must add excessive amounts of salt to make the resulting pasta evidently salty.) Add spices to whatever sauce you pour on the pasta, otherwise you're wasting like 90% of them.  An alternative would be kneading the spices into the pasta dough. There are several pasta brands with spices/herbs in the dough like that."
Does active dry yeast really expire?,"I've used yeast that was even older than yours and although the taste of the resulting bread was fine, and it foamed up properly when tested, I found I had to use about 50% more of it to get the same density of the bread.  In the end, I threw it out because it was too much trouble to experiment with it every time."
Stock vs Broth - What's the difference in usage?,"Classification and use of Stocks vs. Broth: Broths are the result of cooking meat, not just bones. They're generally the result of preparing another item and usually not prepared specifically on their own. The juices poured off from a roasted turkey (after being degreased) would be considered broth.  Whole chickens being poached for another preparation would create broth. Stocks are made from just the bones. They are prepared specifically for use in other recipes (sauces, soups, stews, rice, etc.)  Stocks are never salted in their preparation or the finished dish will most likely end up too salty due to reduction that will take place upon further cooking. Note that homemade stock will be often a bit more broth-like than restaurant/commercial stocks, since it's really hard to get all the meat off the bones. Stocks are usually simmered for a very long time (4-6 hours for chicken & 8-12 for veal/beef) to extract maximum flavor and gelatin from the bones. Broths aren't usually cooked nearly as long due to the fact that cooking the meat for extended periods (even chicken surrounded by the liquid) will result in tough, flavorless meat. Consomme: a fortified and clarified stock.  The stock is fortified in flavor by the addition of a ""raft"" which is a combination of lean ground meat (appropriate to the type of stock being used) with brunoise (1/16 inch) mirepoix (carrots, onions, celery), and egg whites.  The raft mixture is stirred into the cold stock and as it gently heats, the proteins coagulate forming a ""raft"" on top of the stock.  A small hole is poked in the center (if one hasn't already formed) and as the stock bubbles through the hole it leaches back through the ground meat/egg white raft which filters out impurities to clarify the stock and fortify it with flavor. Bouillon:  French word for broth. Court Bouillon: sometimes called a ""short broth"".  A poaching liquid usually used for fish that is usually comprised of water,  acid (lemon juice, vinegar, wine), parsley stems, bay leaves, peppercorns, and some salt. When to use Stock vs. Broth:
Use stock when a sauce is to be reduced significantly or when clarity of the final result is preferred. Broths can be substituted for stock when the body of the liquid or clarity isn't important, and when the liquid will be thickened by addition of a starch."
Was honey in ancient times different than now?,"It's not honey that's changed since ancient times, it's wine! Wine makers in ancient Rome lacked the knowledge and equipment to prevent oxidation and unwanted bacterial colonies, so their product was pretty awful by modern standards, being both sour and bitter with all sorts of off flavors. Honey and spices were added to try and make it palatable.  So you can't re-create the roman recipe without roman style wine, which you won't find in any store because nobody would want to buy it! If you add the same amount of honey to wine of today it will be overwhelmingly sweet, my suggestion would be to add a little bit of honey to it and work your way up. I would also suggest you not follow the recipe to the letter:"
Caffeine content of cold-brewed coffee: higher or lower than hot-brewed?,"According to the Wikipedia article on caffeine, its solubility is drastically different between room temperature and boiling (2 g/100 mL room temperature to 66 g/100 mL at boiling). I assume this means it's easier to get caffeine into boiling rather than cold water, but the drastically longer steeping time may counteract this. It's worth noting that the solubility is far higher than the actual amounts of caffeine that's in coffee. Farther down the page it mentions caffeine per liter of liquids like coffee (386-652 mg/L). If you can find similar information about cold-steeped coffee, it might help."
How can I train myself to identify flavors better?,"This is a really difficult topic to approach, and I think the only reliable way to identify flavours is through years and years of practice using those flavours in your cooking. To start with, I think the easiest thing to do would be to understand the different types of flavours.  Those are: Sweet Everybody knows this one.  Sweet is the taste of sugar, candy, and so on. Sour Sour is the taste of acidity.  Citrus fruits like lemons/limes, vinegar, pickles, and so on. Salty This is the taste of, well, salt.  Needs no further explanation, I hope. Bitter Bitterness is what makes you want to grimace - but many people do acquire a taste for it.  The best examples of bitter are probably coffee and beer.  Leafy greens and horseradish are other good examples. Savoury or Umami This is the taste of ""hearty"" foods - meats and cheese especially.  Specifically, it's the taste of protein.  Glutamates (i.e. MSG) also provide this flavour. It's actually a lot more involved than this - our taste receptors can detect many more subtle flavors, but those are the easiest to tell apart.  The most notable ""quasi-flavour"" is probably Hot or Piquant (not to be confused with pungency, which is a more general term for anything ""strong"" tasting such as horseradish or garlic); this type of heat is due to capsaicin, which is found especially in chili peppers, and I call it a quasi-flavour because it doesn't actually work on taste receptors, it works on pain receptors, and it's addictive due to the subsequent release of endorphins. Anyway, all that aside, the place to start would be to get used to the five basic flavours above.  Eat some foods that are chiefly one flavour - a caramel, a lime, a few flakes of horseradish, a hunk of meat, or... a dash of salt, I guess.  Get used to what they taste like. Then you should be able to start recognizing combinations - for example, a cured sausage will be salty and savoury.  Lemonade is sweet and sour.  If you're able to start identifying the flavour types then you can start trying to narrow down the actual ingredients and ask yourself, ""What could be adding this [bitter] flavour?"" Most full entrées will try to establish a balance of all of these flavours with all of these flavour elements.  For example, a Chinese stir-fry sauce will include sweet (sugar or honey), sour (rice vinegar), salty (soy), and umami (sesame oil), and used on vegetables which are primarily bitter (i.e. broccoli).  Whenever you're eating a food that's really great, expect it to have something contributing to all the basic flavours and try to think about what elements could be used to create them.  Even if you only manage to figure out 4 out of 5, chances are you can substitute something else for the 5th and manage a similar taste. Of course, it's worth repeating that this isn't just going to come magically to you.  You need to pay attention to what you're cooking; only when you've constructed hundreds if not thousands of your own concoctions will you be able to deconstruct the ones that others have made - and even then, it's kind of tricky if the recipe is complicated, because lots of preparation steps will change the flavour, like browning (Maillard reaction, adds sweetness) or roasting (tends to add savouriness). As far as spices go, they're pretty much all in the same flavour category (which I'd really just call ""spicy"") although they may also lend varying amounts of umami or pungency to the final dish.  The only way you're ever going to be able to identify spices is to start experimenting with them - lots of them - and learn what they taste like separately and together.  I would say that this takes years for most cooks, and sadly, I don't think there are any shortcuts. Well, that's it for my intro.  Hope that helps!"
Why use yeast instead of baking powder?,"Baking powder, especially if too great a quantity is used, adds an unpleasant flavor to a baked good.  Even in an appropriate quantity it can be noticeable and it certainly doesn't do anything to enhance the flavor.  Many baked goods traditionally don't use a chemical leavener at all, but instead rely on technique.  Creaming butter and sugar together or whipping egg whites was historically used to make cakes which rose solely based on the bubble network that was created. Yeast, on the other hand, creates a delightful flavor that you associate with your favorite crusty loaf of bread.  Yeast can be used not only in making bread but also in some excellent cakes (St. Louis Gooey Butter Cake, for example, although many ""knock off"" recipes cheat here and miss out on the true goodness).  Yeast also provides a significantly different texture during the rising due to the intentional creation of a gluten network (usually something you absolutely don't want in a quick bread or quick cake) — you don't get a crumb with big, airy holes from baking powder or baking soda with an acid. Also, in my experience baking powder lasts six months in the pantry and yeast lasts at least six months in the fridge.  The shelf life is not so different. If yeast scares you, you may want to check out some of the proponents of the no-knead bread technique. For a lot more information on this subject, there is a recent publication that covers all sorts of leavening agents."
What is the difference between baking soda and baking powder?,"Normal double-acting baking powder makes CO2 (thus giving a rising effect) in two ways: when it gets wet, and when it is heated. Baking soda only makes CO2 when it gets wet. From Wikipedia: The acid in a baking powder can be
  either fast-acting or slow-acting.[6]
  A fast-acting acid reacts in a wet
  mixture with baking soda at room
  temperature, and a slow-acting acid
  will not react until heated in an
  oven. Baking powders that contain both
  fast- and slow-acting acids are double
  acting; those that contain only one
  acid are single acting. By providing a
  second rise in the oven, double-acting
  baking powders increase the
  reliability of baked goods by
  rendering the time elapsed between
  mixing and baking less critical, and
  this is the type most widely available
  to consumers today. "
Why is 180 degrees C so common in recipes?,"Ovens are by their nature a high-heat cooking method, and thus create a temperature gradient in the food.  The outside of the item is the hottest, because it is in contact with the hot air, and exposed to the radiant (infrared) heat coming from the oven walls, ceiling and floor. Heat from the outside then conducts into the inside overtime.  The effect of this is that the surface of the food will be the hottest, and the center the coolest., 180 C (350 F) is a moderate oven.  It balances: It is suitable for a wide range of baked goods and other dishes, although often within limits (especially for non-baked goods) you can trade temperature and time off. Note that a single oven can only have one temperature, and a moderate oven is good for many cakes and cookies; for baking and heating through casseroles; for roasting root vegetables; for maintaining a braise; and for roasting many meats; and many other tasks.  If you want to have multiple items in the oven at the same time, it is a good temperature to choose that will give good results for a wide variety of items, even if it is not ideal for every item. Still, it is not ideal for every cooking technique and food item.  Low and slow roasting (for tremendously succulent pulled pork, brisket, and so on) is done as low as 200 F (93 C); some people favor high temperature roasting of certain meats to get a crispy exterior while maintaining a rare interior with temperatures of 450 F (232 C), or even higher. Many breads are baked at higher temperatures--and of course, pizza infamously is ideally done at temperatures home ovens cannot even achieve, so at home they are often baked at the maximum oven setting around 550 F (280 C). Deep frying is a separate matter, and it is a complete coincidence that the ideal temperature for deep frying matches that of roasting. The way deep frying works is that the heat of the oil heats the outside of the food, but it is hot enough to nearly instantly vaporize the water at the surface of the food.  This water creates a small pocket of vapor around the food, preventing the oil from entering and making the item completely oily.   In order for this effect to happen, the oil must be sufficiently hot which starts around 180 C / 350 F. On the other hand, again, you don't want the food to burn on the outside before it cooks through, but more importantly, you don't want the oil smoking, and developing off flavors (many culinary fats have a smoke point starting not too far above these temperatures).   For these reasons, frying much above this temperature is generally not a good idea.  Most ideal frying temperatures are somewhere in the 350 F - 365 F (180 C 0 185 C) range. I suspect many recipes indicate 350 F simply because it has become common and conventional."
How to peel hard boiled eggs easily?,"Buy almost-late eggs. The worst-case scenario of egg-shelling is a farm-fresh egg. That annoying film that sticks to both the shell and to the egg will detach, the older the egg gets. The bubble at the fat end, too, will get bigger as the egg ages, which also makes the bottom cap pop off more easily. Obviously, we don't want rotten eggs. We want the almost expired but not expired ones. Roll the egg against the countertop, cracking it along the ""equator"". This will give you lots of starting points, and it will weaken the shell in enough directions that the rest of the peeling becomes easier. Usually, the top and bottom caps come off in large and clean pieces, so don't bother cracking that part unless it sticks. Start from the fat end of the egg. After much experimenting, I've determined that starting from the bottom of the egg (the fat end) is the best way to do it. Give the egg one good whack on the countertop, and the bottom caves in quite easily. This gives you a really nice starting point. Now peel out from there in a spiraling pattern down the rest of the egg. The top cap still comes off quite easily in one big chunk, if the egg is old enough."
"When making sushi, why do you have to rinse the rice?","It removes excess starch, so your sushi rice doesn't turn into nasty glutinous slop. The texture of the rice is very important, so you'll need to rinse it several times before you steam it. Make sure the water is nice and clear after the last time you rinse it, and make sure you buy japonica or similar: if you use regular rice, you may not get good results. I wouldn't worry overmuch about the nutritional content of white sushi rice (you can starve on a diet of it). It's what you put into your sushi that'll give it nutritional value."
Why does a brown paper bag speed ripening?,"The ripening itself is caused by ethylene gas released by the food, which is trapped by any kind of bag. As far as I know, there's nothing inherently special about a brown paper bag, other than the fact that it's porous and thus still allows some air to get in and out.  Plastic ziplock bags have no ventilation, so they don't work nearly as well."
How do I make prettier fried eggs?,"One factor you may not be considering is the quality of the egg itself. The highest-grade eggs have firm whites and more regular shapes when cracked onto a flat surface. The fresher the egg, generally, the higher the grade. If you've ever cracked a grocery store egg next to a fresh-laid egg, the difference is clear. The hen's diet makes a big difference, too. But judging by the pictures, I'd say your biggest problem is cooking with too much heat. Notice how much your whites have bubbled and that the edges are already browning while the inner albumen (the thick part of the white that surrounds the yolk) is still raw. In comparison, the albumen of the ""prettier"" egg has a visibly consistent cook on the whites. To get that consistent cook on a sunny side up egg you need to use less heat than you'd use for other fried eggs. The inner albumen cooks slower because it's sitting up higher than the outer albumen, farther from the heat. And you're not going to flip this egg, so it's a very uneven heat that you have to work with. Imagine trying to cook a hamburger, entirely on one side! That's the challenge you have here, except with an egg, which is thinner than a hamburger but also less evenly-shaped and much more delicate. Some people like to loosely cover the pan for part of the cooking time, which reflects some heat and traps some steam to help cook the inner albumen from above. The risk there is that you're also cooking the yolk faster; if you cover the pan tightly, you can end up steaming the egg instead of frying it. You can use a plate, a lid of the wrong size, or another pan if you like. Assuming you can get the temperature right, though, you don't need to cover the pan. To practice, start with the heat around medium-low and try to find the right balance of heat and time through trial and error. Crispy, brown edges means either too much time or too much heat. If you're practicing, try not to adjust the heat too much in the middle of cooking an egg. Cook one egg through, then assess the result and adjust your heat if necessary on the next one. Once you get the temperature right, assuming your eggs are decent quality, your only other challenge is getting it into and out of the pan gently. If you're rough with the egg, not only will it spread out unevenly, but you can break the membrane that separates the inner and outer albumen. This makes the white cook faster but it definitely doesn't lead to an attractive sunny side up egg. Cracking the egg into a ramekin or small prep bowl rather than directly into the pan or pot makes it much easier to get a regular, attractive shape on your fried or poached egg. As far as centering the yolk, I suspect that's all about the grade of the egg; high-quality fresh eggs are just firmer and tend not to wander so much. I wouldn't recommend separating the yolk and adding it after the white -- I think that would do more harm than good. You want to keep that nested membrane structure, but separating the yolk requires breaking the inner albumen's membrane. What you get is a yolk that's just going to slide around on the raw surface of the white, instead of being held by the membrane in one place. It takes some practice but cooking an egg every which way is a very basic technical skill that will stay with you forever once learned. As you get better you may start to notice how much of a difference the freshness of the egg makes, or how the color of the yolk indicates the quality of the hen's diet (and the flavor and nutrition in the egg as a result). You don't have to go buy the fanciest eggs on the shelf -- plenty of restaurants get good results with whatever they order from their supplier -- but there's definitely a difference between brands. Hard to tell the gimmick from the real deal without cracking one open; I remember a story on the radio a couple years ago about a woman who resold grocery store eggs at a farmer's market when her hens weren't laying well, passing them off as fresh-laid. Best thing is to keep your own hens, but that's obviously not possible (or desirable) for everyone. Next best source is likely a CSA or farm stand. Oh and by the way -- I never ate egg breakfast growing up. Couldn't stand them, especially the runny yolks! Tastes change; now I keep my own hens and I love a good runny poached egg. I don't claim to be any sort of professional in the kitchen; it's all about quality ingredients and practice, practice, practice. I wrote above that ""crispy, brown edges means either too much time or too much heat."" To be clear, that's assuming your goal is a classic American diner-style sunny side up egg, evenly cooked and pale in color, like the photo shown in the question. But crispy fried eggs are also delicious, and require more heat rather than less. I cooked two crispy fried eggs, sunny side up in my wok this morning on a high-output propane burner. The image shows that the edges are crisp and lacy without being burned or ragged, the inner albumen is fully set and the yolk is liquid. I didn't cover the pan, baste with fat, or use any sort of ring mold or specialty egg device as other answers have suggested; I just have enough practice with this pan and heat source to be able to get this result. Which is to say, I've ruined dozens of eggs over the years trying and failing to get this result. It's fine to cover the pan, to baste the egg, to use egg molds. All of these methods involve trade-offs and you may find that one of them is your preferred method. But if there is a simple thesis to my answer, it's that cooking an egg is fundamentally a problem of finding the right time and temp. And there's no substitute for experience because everyone's kitchen and ingredients are a little different."

Pasta: is simmering equivalent to roiling boil?,"You should boil noodles. Simmering is not the same as boiling. Boiling water is 212 ℉ (100 ℃). Simmering water is in the range of 185 ℉ to 200 ℉ (85 ℃ to 93 ℃).  Your engineer friend is under the mistaken assumption that simmering is somehow a weaker boil than a rolling boil, but still 212 ℉. It's not. You are correct in your assumption that the more vigorous rolling boil will agitate pasta and help prevent sticking."
Why should (or shouldn't) we wash rice before cooking?,Reasons to wash your rice: Reduce/Control Starch levels To clean out impurities Reasons to not wash your rice: It removes nutrients. You actually want to keep the extra starch.
What caused my meringue to fall after adding cocoa?,"It was timing.  If you want to make chocolate meringues, add the cocoa powder to the liquid egg whites, and then whisk it all together at once.   Beaten egg whites are bubbles.  Don't add things to an already-formed meringue, as they will just cause the bubble structure to collapse. Ever sprinkled sugar or cinnamon powder on a cappuccino?  Notice how the milk foam immediately collapses?  The same thing happened to your meringue."
Is this a bad apple?,"This appears to be watercore, specifically radial watercore, from the image you have posted.  It should be safe to eat, according to this site and this site. According to an article from Washington State University, watercore is a disorder of some apple variants, which can cause the internal flesh to appear glassy [shiny and translucent] later into the growing season.  In some studies, low levels of calcium have been shown alongside the condition.  As well, it should be noted that the condition 1) does not occur after harvesting 2) may cause an increase of sweetness, and 3) cause the apple to quickly degrade during storage. As to the causes of this disorder, there are a number of theoretical factors for causation:  Genetic defects, water regiment, temperature, minerals, leaf-to-fruit ratio, maturation and ripening, sorbitol metabolism and altered transport.  These are discussed to some degree in both the WSU article and this MSU article"
"Can one be ""taste blind"" to the sweetness of stevia?","There's some variation in how people respond to Stevia: From 2013: Multiple genes manage how people taste sweeteners another study recently published in the journal Chemosensory Perception, Allen had 122 participants taste two stevia extracts, RebA -- Rebaudioside A -- and RebD -- Rebaudioside D. Stevia is a South American plant that has served as a sweetener for centuries, according to the researchers. While the plant is becoming more popular as a natural non-nutritive sweetener, consumers have reported a variety of tastes from stevia-based sweeteners, including bitterness. No mention of people not tasting the sweet at all, but it is a big gene pool.
In me, the stuff is a slow,tight binder. It takes a while for the sweet to come on once I've eaten the stevia, and it takes a minute or two for the sweet to wear off after I've had it."
How to quickly and safely defrost chicken?,"I suppose that depends on what you're defrosting it for. The microwave (on low power) is safe and quick.  The downside is that you're using a microwave, which means there's a good chance you'll actually cook the outside slightly in the process, and you're killing enzymes that are normally part of the flavour.  The lower the heat, the less the impact of this, but it's still a problem.  If I'm preparing the meat for marinating, stir-fry, etc., something with a powerful or thick sauce, then I wouldn't worry about it, but if it's going onto a grill with just a little bit of seasoning, you might want to avoid this. Running it under warm water would seem to work, but I've found that it takes forever to defrost this way (the exterior will loosen up but the interior stays stubbornly frozen), and you're soaking it in the process.  This really isn't suitable if you need to pound or fold the meat or do anything complicated with it. I would use the microwave if desperate, but it's really best to thaw the meat in the refrigerator or, if you're in a bit of a hurry, the sink.  It takes longer, but it'll turn out much better than the microwave in terms of flavour and tenderness. P.S. One other word of advice: If you're making a dish that requires the chicken to be cut or sliced, it's best not to defrost it all the way.  It's easier to cut when frozen, and will defrost very quickly once it's in pieces.  I'm mainly talking about the breast here, this doesn't work so well with meat stuck to bones. Update: I'm noticing a lot of recent hubbub about the dangers of defrosting in the sink / on the countertop or using warm water and I wanted to clarify something.  Please note that that the advice above applies to chicken that will be immediately cooked after defrosting and that the defrosting is done over a period shorter than 2 hours. Raw chicken must not be kept at any temperature above 40° F (4.4° C) for more than an hour or so.  Do not defrost a chicken breast in the sink and then toss it back in the fridge.  Definitely don't try to defrost a whole bird this way - stick to the refrigerator or very cold running water. As long as you follow the above precautions and cook the chicken thoroughly (up to an internal temperature of 165° F), you're not in any serious danger of salmonella poisoning, even if the original piece of meat was contaminated - and most chicken sold today is contaminated, for the record. If the meat is going back in the refrigerator for marinating or you plan to delay cooking for any other reason, then you need to either thaw it very fast (using the microwave) or at a very low temperature (using the refrigerator or cold running water)."
How to know when a recipe shouldn't contain onion/garlic?,"The general category for vegetables/herbs (that are not leafy green herbs, or spices) added to a dish for flavor (rather than bulk/texture/nutrition) is ""aromatics"", and that describes what they are there for: Add some basic aroma to complete the flavor profile. Typically added early and sauteed or sweated with some kind of culinary fat present to bind the aroma to something that can carry it. Commonly used: Alliums (onions, spring onions, leeks, garlic,....), celery, rhizomes (ginger, galangal, (finely cut) carrot ...), capsicums (chile peppers, (finely cut) bell peppers..) ... Arguably, one might include tomato concentrate given the way it is sometimes used. Sometimes the aroma is used as is, sometimes it's augmented by treating the aromatics in a way that adds Maillard reaction products. There is also some effect on taste, mostly sweet and bitter components. Some categories where onion and garlic are not always suitable: Sweet dishes - there typically is no sauteing step involved, and vegetable flavors typically do not work too well here - also because there is too little salt to offset bitter elements introduced. Dishes made in any culinary tradition that does not approve of alliums, e.g. Jain food, or recipes where alternatives like asafoetida are supposed to take this role completely Food to be served to people who want to avoid smelling of garlic or onions, or who are allergic or intolerant to it Raw preparations, sometimes - raw onions and garlic are very spicy and pungent, and have an even higher risk of causing undesirable breath seasoning. Anything where the garlic would burn (though, of course, you can add a garlic preparation afterwards) - burnt garlic is a generally very undesirable flavor. Using ""normal"" onions in dishes calling for shallots and/or spring onions can have undesirable flavor and/or texture effects."
"What's the difference between latte, mocha, and all the other drinks on a coffee-house menu?","Espresso: This is a finely ground very dark roast coffee, packed somewhat tightly in a special metal filter, with water ""expressed"" through it under pressure.  A very strong dark coffee, typically served in 1-2 ounce portions. Very commonly incorrectly called ""Expresso."" Americano:  Italians typically don't drink American Strength coffee.  They drink espresso in tiny cups.  Then the tourists came and wanted a mug of coffee like they get at home.  The Italian solution was to make an espresso and keep the water running through the grounds to weaken the coffee, and make the desired quantity. (edit: Some locations may simply add hot water to the espresso in the cup. This doesn't change the basic concept.)  An Americano is simply an espresso that has been drawn out with extra water to an American strength beverage -- Not to be confused with the typical brewed coffee, which is usually filtered.  Caffe au Lait: This is strong filtered or brewed coffee (not espresso), with warmed milk. This is probably the easiest specialty coffee to make at home.  Just scald some milk in a pot and pour it over strongly brewed coffee. Cappuccino:  A 1:1:1 ratio of espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam.  Typically the milk is steamed through a special high pressure steam pipe on the espresso machine. This serves two functions.  To warm up the milk and to create a stiff foam on the top.  When pouring, the foam is held back with a spoon, and then scooped out on top.  I'll arbitrarily define the cappuccino as the base beverage for all that follow. Macchiato: Typically in North America, this is a cappuccino, but with the steamed milk component missing.  That is, it is espresso and frothed milk foam only.  Also called a ""Dry"" Cappuccino. Macchiato has different meanings elsewhere. Latte: A ""wet"" cappuccino.  Hold back the foam with a spoon, and pour the warm milk over the espresso.  Put a little bit of foam on top for decoration only. Mocha: Any one of the above espresso + milk drinks with chocolate added.  Some places will add hot chocolate to the drink, others will add a chocolate syrup.  A mocha latte is the common preparation.  Not to be confused with Mocha beans, which are an Ethiopian coffee bean which has a little bit of a naturally occurring chocolate flavour. Misto: A Starbucks synonym for a Cafe au Lait. "
"What qualities to look for in a cut of beef destined for ""well done""?","I'm rather surprised by the judgmental tone in some of the answers here.  A well-done steak is a culinary preference; just because you don't share that preference is no reason to be rude about it.  Some people like caviar; others don't, despite the fact that it is expensive and lauded by many ""people in the know.""  Some people appreciate an espresso made lovingly with freshly ground coffee in the ""right"" kind of grinder; others find it too strong or bitter and would prefer an ""American style"" of coffee with cream and sugar. Taste is subjective. I'll admit something personal -- for the first quarter-century or so of my life, I only ate well-done or medium-well steak.  It's how my father always cooked it at home on the grill.  He didn't actually prefer steak well-done: when we'd go out to the restaurants, he'd generally order medium-rare.  But even though he'd time steaks, adjust heat on the grill, etc., the vast majority of the time, they were well-done.  I was used to it.  I liked it, because it was what I knew.  The few times I encountered less-done meat, I found the texture odd or even slightly off-putting. Then, at some point, I was convinced to try more rare steak, and I soon accepted it.  I now almost always order steaks medium-rare, and I do prefer them that way.  But I also spent a lot of time ordering steaks more well-done (at restaurants, I'd almost always order medium-well), and to those of you who claim you can't tell the difference when a steak is that done, you don't know what you're talking about, because it's not your common way of eating and perhaps you've never had a well-done steak that was prepared in a reasonable fashion. Anyhow, to answer the question: as some others have hinted at, choose a cut that has a ""looser"" texture with fat running through it if possible.  Also, consider using a cut that you'd often tend to slice thinly when serving anyway, like skirt, flank, bavette, etc.  You can also use more expensive somewhat fatty cuts (like ribeye), though the meat will toughen, so you won't get the benefit of the tenderness in such expensive cuts.  Plus some of the cheaper cuts (or at least less expensive) have superior flavor.   Quality is actually more important in cooking well-done steaks, because older or worse quality meat with more connective tissue will become even chewier and tough when cooked longer. A somewhat high-quality ribeye cooked well-done can be a somewhat chewy but very pleasant caramelized experience with melt-in-your-mouth browned crispy fat interspersed.  A poor-quality steak with poor-quality fat will just become tough and have its bad qualities exaggerated. What you want to avoid -- unless your guests insist on them -- are lean cuts, which will end up tough AND dry.  Filet mignon is a very poor choice (which will end up tasteless and tough), as is sirloin, as would be other lean tough cuts (like round).  Also avoid cuts with a lot of connective tissue (but sometimes are sold as steaks to be cooked fast and rare), like chuck. Marinating will help if you allow enough time for brine to soak in a bit (thereby adding not only flavor, but more moisture). As for cooking, keep in mind many types of meat are cooked to ""well-done"" temperatures and still can remain juicy with proper technique (e.g., chicken).  There's absolutely no reason to serve a tough, dry well-done steak unless you're incompetent.  A ""loose"" textured steak as mentioned above that's sliced thin before serving will be chewy but won't necessarily seem ""tough"" if marinated and cooked properly. How to cook properly?  Do NOT do what most people do when cooking steak and just flip once.  You'll end up drying out both sides of the steak by the time cooking is finished.  Butterflying (which restaurants will sometimes offer to do for you when you request a medium-well or well-done steak) can be counterproductive for some cuts and can also dry things out more.  (Restaurants do it mostly for their own convenience; it speeds cooking.)  Unless you have a very loose-textured steak, which might benefit from additional browning reactions with greater surface area while not getting tough, you probably don't want to decrease thickness deliberately.  Instead, keep moisture in with a somewhat thicker cut. And flip often during cooking.  It's more work because cooking to well-done takes longer, but it's the best way to keep juices moving around inside rather than boiling out the top while the bottom gets dry and burnt.  (Think of what a rotisserie does; you're doing the same by flipping steak often.)  Flipping frequently also can help soften fat and begin to break it down, which can add flavor and a ""moist"" aspect (if done right with high-quality meat, the fat might even be almost ""melt-in-your-mouth"").  Frequent flipping also aids in more browning reactions, which develop more flavor, and well-done steak does at least get that advantage of extra browning flavor (perhaps even crisped brown outer layers of fat).  Obviously control heat; overall you'll need to cook at a slightly lower heat to avoid burning the outside before interior is well-done. Then pull steak off while slightly less than well-done, and let it rest to creep up to well-done. To summarize: I've accidentally overcooked skirt steak this way a couple times, and it was just as tasty (if not more so), basically as juicy, and almost as tender as if I cooked it to medium rare.  (Skirt is always chewy anyway; well-done steaks will always be chewy, but they don't have to be excessively tough.) Cooking steak to medium-rare and getting passable results is relatively easy with a thermometer.  Cooking a decent well-done steak takes a lot more skill. EDIT: A couple comments have noted that there are better ways to cook steaks.  I absolutely agree.  The OP didn't ask about preparation technique, so I was assuming a somewhat ""standard"" cooking technique for steaks (grilling, pan-frying, broiling, etc.), which my advice applies to.  Personally, I'd recommend things like reverse searing or finishing in the oven, etc. too for better results, but I wasn't trying to turn this answer into ""how to cook a steak"" in general."
How to clean mushrooms?,"It's important to note that wash or no wash, mushrooms themselves already have a high water content so their ability to absorb more water is limited. Estimates I've found put the range between 75-90% water, depending on the type of mushroom. Cooks Illustrated, for example, puts it at 80%.  Sources such as Cooks Illustrated, Alton Brown, Harold McGee, Robert Wolke, and Kenji Lopez Alt have tested washing mushrooms by weighing them pre- and post-wash, and all found that mushrooms absorb a minimal amount of water that does not significantly affect cooking time. Both McGee and Wolke soaked the mushroom for five minutes - so much longer and with more direct contact than than a normal simple rinsing. Lopez Alt's testing, for example, found that the mushrooms absorbed only about 2% of their total weight which translated to an extra 15 to 30 seconds of cooking time. After testing, these sources all encourage washing mushrooms.   Several of the sources also observed that most of the additional weight is on the surface of the mushroom, which can either be patted dry with a towel or paper towel, or removed with a salad spinner, as other previous answers here have noted.  Cooks Illustrated suggests only washing whole mushrooms, as when cut they can become more absorbent. They also suggest that if you are serving the mushrooms raw, use a tooth brush to brush them clean rather than rinsing because rising can cause discoloration.  Washing should be only done just before cooking. Washing and then storing mushrooms can shorten their shelf life and they can become slimy on the surface.  Wolke notes that if your mushrooms are steaming rather than browning, it's more likely that your pan is too crowded rather than a function of having washed them.  Cooks Illustrated describes their process here, McGee in The Curious Cook, Wolke in What Einstein Told His Cook, Lopez Alt in The Food Lab (and also Serious Eats) and the best I could find for Alton Brown were transcripts from the Good Eats Fan Page. Both the the Cooks Illustrated and Serious Eats links also have more general tips on mushroom storage and prep."
How do you reduce static in a coffee grinder?,"My grounds bin has a lid. So while the grounds still collect static, they don't fly all over the place when I remove the bin from the grinder.  Giving the bin few sharp taps on the counter top prior to opening seems to shake off most of what clings to the top and sides. Then I tap out the grounds, wipe out the bin with a napkin, and I'm ready for the next morning. Beyond that, try switching up your coffee. The cheap ""8 O'Clock"" stuff I keep on reserve is terribly staticy, while the beans I roast myself don't have nearly the trouble. I tend to enjoy a lighter roast, so keep that in mind - you might benefit from grinding beans with just a bit higher moisture content (of course, if you have a strong preference for dark roasts, this doesn't help much)."
Tea water: heat to 80 °C or boil to 100 °C and let it cool down to 80 °C?,"It's actually the opposite, you shouldn't boil water for tea unless you want it boiling. Water has dissolved oxygen in it, the more you have the nicer your tea will taste. This has been covered in this question.  The hotter your water gets, the faster it loses dissolved oxygen, so you'll get better tea (for most people's palates) if you raise your water to 80°C and use it right away. If you boil it and then let it cool you will lose much more O2.  FYI, 80°C is pretty low for most black teas, I experimented with this some years ago and found that most black teas brewed at 80°C came out pretty awful, green tea seemed to be the exception to this. I found 90–95°C to be more of the sweet spot. Other than boiling to kill pathogens the one thing I can think of would be to purge chlorine from the water, which boiling does. However, you'd need to boil it for 15 minutes to get rid of all of it, not just raise it to boiling. Also, boiling doesn't get rid of chlorinates, which are used to purify water more often these days. See this question for more details on that. "
How to fix food that got extra salty?,Or just serve extra beer with it.
Why are certain fruit & veg bought in UK supermarkets tasteless?,"Non-native and out of season fruits and vegetables that are available in northern countries (e.g. UK, Canada) need to be shipped from far away and will be picked before they are naturally ripe (under the normal sun and heat and getting nutrients from the soil). They will ripen in controlled environments (UV lights, maybe controlled atmosphere and temperature) to be able to be ripen on time during the long transit to be ready when they are put on shelves in your local stores. In the UK, it is currently the high season for strawberries (I assume it is the same time as in Québec); compare locally-grown strawberries to imported strawberries and compare the flavour and aromas. (anecdotal) A quick tip when buying imported fruits (and vegetables); keep them outside of the fridge as much as possible, and if planning to eat soon, place them in the sun for a little while and the flavours will get better."
Why use onions in cooking?,"As a child, I used to hate the feel and taste when I conciously bit on a piece of onion (strongest offender: medium-sized chunks, sautéed glassy but still firm). Sometimes that still happens. However, I use onion a lot myself now in cooking. Lots of dishes really need the kind of taste onions can supply; even though that taste may by itself be a bit gross, it's really useful in the mix. (This is true for many other ingredients as well!) I can only speak for myself, but very likely, there are some dishes where you don't even notice that onions are in, but they are – and you wouldn't like it if they weren't! Do use onions, just do it consciously. There are broadly three ways of preparing them that I consider effective, each suited to different cases: Perhaps you won't be able to befriend yourself with all of these preparation methods, but you should give them a try."
"What does ""natural"" actually mean?","Short answer? Not a damn thing. The term is pretty much meaningless in the US; at best it only means that the product doesn't have added colors, artificial flavors or synthetic ""stuff"". From the FDA: What is the meaning of 'natural' on the label of food? From a food science perspective, it is difficult to define a food product that is 'natural' because the food has probably been processed and is no longer the product of the earth. That said, FDA has not developed a definition for use of the term natural or its derivatives. However, the agency has not objected to the use of the term if the food does not contain added color, artificial flavors, or synthetic substances."
What temperatures should I keep my refrigerator and freezer set at?,"Daniel is spot-on with his answer. I'll elaborate on it a bit here. As indicated by his bottled water in the freezer trick, a full freezer is a happy freezer. The same applies to the refrigerator too. While I wouldn't put random bottles of water throughout my refrigerator, it's important to know that the fuller your refrigerator is, the more it holds its temperature when opening/closing, and the less energy you'll use. However, you don't want to jam pack it so full that there isn't any airflow around your stuff, because this can hamper the cooling efficiency as well. The ideal refrigerator temperature is 35°F (1.6°C). You're not hugging the danger zone like you would be at 40°F (4.4°C), and you're distancing yourself sufficiently from 32°F (0°C) that you don't freeze half the stuff in your refrigerator. That said, the temperature within your fridge can vary rather significantly with normal usage. The coldest parts of your refrigerator are the back, and the bottom. The back because the cooling element is there, and the bottom because warm air rises. If items you don't want frosty are getting frosty, then move them away from the back of the fridge. I would avoid putting items in the door of your fridge that are particularly sensitive to spoilage. The items in the door of your fridge can easily get as high as 59°F (15°C), and do so often. Putting milk and eggs in your door will significantly decrease their shelf life. Butter is OK in the little covered section in the door, because the door actually helps keep it's temperature a little better. You also generally don't want rock solid frozen butter.  So, put your meats on the bottom shelf in the back, your condiments (mayo, ketchup, mustard, etc.) in the door, and put everything else where it fits."
"What should I look for in a good, multi-purpose chef's knife?","One of the most important things is a full tang. The tang is an extension of the metal of the blade into the handle. In knives with a full tang, it goes all the way through the handle. This improves stability, control, and durability. Cheaper knives with partial tangs will have the handle break off over time. In a chef's knife, you want a blade from 8 to 10 inches long, whichever is more comfortable. You can also either get a forged or stamped blade. I suggest reading this article on the differences. To summarize, forged blades are softer, easier to sharpen, heavier, and have a bolster. Stamped blades are sharper, harder to sharpen, lighter, and have a welded on a bolster if any. With current manufacturing processes forged is not necessarily better than stamped. You should make your own decisions. All crap knives are stamped, but not all stamped knives are crap. This brings me to one of the most important points: It must feel good in your hand. Don't buy an expensive knife just because it's expensive, or you recognize the name. Go to a store that will let you use the knife, Williams-Sonoma will do this. If you can, bring a carrot in your pocket and actually cut that in the store. I'll do some research on steel quality and update this later."
Which method of killing the lobster would cause the least pain and distress?,"Put the lobster in the freezer for about 30 minutes, it will basically be in a sleeping/coma state when you take it out. Then cut into its head lengthwise to destroy its brain before it wakes up.  Some people say that killing the lobster in a less stressful way gives the meat a better texture/flavor. But personally I have not been able to tell any difference. EDIT: Another solution, though not a clean or popular method for lobster; If you destroy its brain faster than the speed pain travels through nerves, it would be dead before the pain reaches the brain. Could be accomplished by shooting it in the brain with a gun... a common method used to humanely kill many things."
How do you cook a steak like those found in fine steakhouses?,"The most important thing you can do is buy quality beef. You can throw a USDA Select steak on a 700 degree charcoal grill, cook it perfectly, and it'll still be tough and not at all what you'd get at a fine steakhouse. In the USA there are three grades of beef available to a consumer: Select, Choice, and Prime. There are lesser grades but they go to fast food joints, prisons, military personnel, and miscellaneous other weird uses. In most american supermarkets you will find only select, period. This is an ""average"" steak. It's typically devoid of marbling, and results in a rather flavorless tough steak.  To find choice steaks you have to go to a higher end supermarket, e.g. Whole Foods You will pay significantly more for a choice steak, but the difference is marked. The marbling will result in a tenderer steak due to the internal fat melting and tenderizing the steak. Finally, prime cuts. These are very hard to come by in any supermarket unless you live in a bigger city. You typically have to go to a specialty shop or butcher for these. Less than 2% of all beef is classified as prime. On top of this, restaurants get first pick. So even if you do buy a great prime steak, you are likely getting the lower end of the prime spectrum. However, the difference is amazing. The marbling is more intense, more evenly distributed and when cooked properly results in a steak that melts under your knife. Another one-up a fine steakhouse has on you is they age their beef. Any steak you buy in the grocery store is minimally wet aged. The finest steakhouses dry age their beef. The difference? Wet aging consists of simply vacuum packing the meat (as in a whole side of cow) and refrigerating it for about a week. After that, it's cut smaller and sold to stores. Dry aging is a more complicated and expensive process. Dry aged beef is hung for at least two weeks in a refrigerator. Moisture in the meat is allowed to escape and evaporate, which concentrates the beef flavor of the beef. The beef also grows a moldy rind which is cut off and thrown away. After the aging is complete you're left with 75-80% of the meat you started with. This commands a premium price. Unfortunately, you can't dry age a steak in your home. There are some refrigerator aging processes that you'll find on this site and others, but they aren't a true comparison. Another variation that has become more popular is grass-fed beef. This has become a recent fad, at least in the USA. Cattle are traditionally fed corn which makes them fatter and ""juicier"", but it also leaves the meat tasting very bland. Likely, if you live in the USA, every steak you've ever had was corn-fed. Grass-fed beef on the other hand is fed predominantly grass, they're allowed to graze as cows should. This is good for the cows, because they don't actually eat corn. A cow is made to eat grass. Corn is rather harsh on their digestive system, but they are given no other choice. In the wild a cow would never eat corn. The end result is a very different flavored steak. Grass-fed beef has a much richer, meatier flavor. However, it's also tougher than corn-fed beef. For this reason a steak you will be served in a fine steakhouse is likely not to be grass-fed unless it is specifically designated as such. With all that out of the way I suggest doing what I do. When I feel like an amazing home cooked steak, I'll splurge on a nice choice ribeye, dip it in a mixture of melted clarified butter and oil, season liberally with salt and pepper, and pan fry it. "
How can you make a sauce less spicy/hot?,"In general, it is a good idea to go light on spices when trying a new recipe, if you're not intimately familiar with the flavor and spice combinations in question.  It's a great deal easier to add spice later than it is to mask it once you've added too much. Assuming you are reading this because you didn't do that, and have now ended up with a sauce that's far too spicy, then read on. The pertinent question here is where is the spiciness coming from?  There are actually several kinds of compounds that can produce that general aroma and/or sensation.  In most dishes they'll tend to fall loosely into one or more of the following: Piperine, which is the active alkaloid in black pepper.  This has poor solubility in water, however, it has better solubility in alcohol.  If you can incorporate wine or better yet, brandy or vodka or some other strong alcohol, this can go a long way toward reducing the heat from pepper. Capsaicin, the heat-producing compound in most types of hot peppers, is the highest on the Scoville Scale; extremely piquant and can produce a ""burning"" sensation in very small quantities.  It is also poorly soluble in water, but is far more soluble in fat, especially oils.  Adding some olive oil or a good quantity of butter to your recipe is a good bet for reducing capsaicin/capsicum heat. Garlic, onion, and other members of the Allium family put out a volatile sulfur compound called Allicin.  Although this is not ""spicy"" in the same sense as pepper, many people perceive it as such.  Like piperine, it is more soluble in alcohol than in water.  However, and here's the catch: That allicin breaks down into various polysulfides when cooked, and those polysulfides are fat soluble.  So if you're trying to mask a strong garlic or onion flavour, it's best if you can add alcohol and fat to cover all your bases. If you've added too much Ginger - another ingredient often perceived as spicy - then you're dealing with Gingerols and Shoagols, the latter of which pack a much bigger punch.  One of the things you can actually do with ginger is cook the spice off which converts those into much milder Zingerone.  In other words, add some water to the sauce and then boil it to reduce the sauce again - you'll lose some flavour but in the process you'll break down the ginger spice. Alternatively (for ginger), all of the above compounds are alkali soluble, so if you add a buffering agent - say, Trisodium citrate (additive E331), it will improve the solubility a great deal.  If, like most people, you don't happen to keep food additives in your kitchen, you can try using something like baking soda, but too much of that will completely ruin the taste, so be careful.  In fact, don't add too much of any buffer because the acidity of most sauces is an integral part of their flavor. I think that about covers it for common ""spicy stuff"" that goes in sauces.  If you want to fix a dish that's too spicy, you need to know where the spice is coming from and choose what's most appropriate for that particular sauce. You can also try to mask or balance the spice with something sweet, for example roasted vegetables or plain old sugar.  That will not eliminate the heat at all, but does seem to make it more tolerable for many."

Can someone please give an explanation of different egg preparations?,"Fried Eggs: Sunny Side Up -- Not flipped, unbroken yolk. The top of the egg is just barely set. Basted -- Sunny Side Up, hot fat spooned over until the white surrounding the yolk is opaque. Over Easy / lite -- Flipped,  whites  fully cooked, unbroken yolk, yolk runny. Over medium -- flipped, whites fully cooked, unbroken yolk, yolk creamy (not completely runny). Over Medium Well -- Flipped, unbroken yolk, yolk cooked to have a firm but wet-appearing center. Over Hard -- Flipped, broken, fully-cooked yolk. Over Well -- Flipped, intact, fully-cooked yolk. Broken / Lightly Scrambled -- Broken in pan and gently stirred while cooking - yolk and whites should not be mixed entirely. Scrambled Eggs -- Made in many different ways. Generally the eggs are mixed in a bowl before being put into the pan, and often stirred while cooking. Some recipes add fat to the eggs in the form of milk, cream, butter, or oil. A distinction can be made between Wet/Loose or Dry, which refers to the degree of doneness. Omelettes: Filled Omelette -- Eggs mixed before cooking, possibly with added fat as in Scrambled Eggs. Cooked in fat in a saute pan; when set but the interior still wet, previously-cooked fillings (cheese, onions, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes...) are added, and the eggs folded over into a half-moon shape. Spanish Omelette / Western Omelette -- Same as filled, but the egg mixture is poured over the fillings in a hot pan and cooked, thus incorporating the fillings into the egg. Fluffy Omelette -- Whites and yolks beaten separately. Yolks are gently folded into the whites without breaking the structure of the whites. Optional toppings are added. Cooked slowly in a pan, or baked (an electric frying pan with a lid works well for this preparation). French Omelette -- Cooked soft & creamy with no color on the egg. Omelette is folded 1/3 in the pan, knocked to the edge so it can be rolled out onto the plate. It ends up being folded into thirds and is very creamy and soft. Boiled: Cooked in shell in water for a timed period. Some people will refer to degree of doneness by cooking time, i.e., a ""3-minute egg"" is soft-boiled with some runny white around the yolk. Some recipes call for eggs to be added to boiling water, others to be started in cold water. In the cold-water start, the pot may be left on the heat or removed when the water reaches a boil. The eggs may be shocked in ice water when removed. Soft -- Yolk runny, potentially with slight unset white around the yolk. Medium -- White completely set, yolk firm but with a dark, wet appearance. Hard -- Yolk completely set and pale yellow. Poached: Egg cooked, out of shell, in water, stock, or other liquid --  excluding fats or oils -- at a temperature in the range of 160-180˚F (70-82˚C). There are possible degrees of doneness, however the typical poached egg has a runny but warm and thickened yolk and fully-set white. Coddled: An egg that has been very lightly cooked (poached eggs are sometimes considered coddled). This can either be accomplished with an egg coddler or cooking an egg in its shell with water that is slightly below boiling point. Shirred: An egg cooked in an oven at the low-mid 300's˚F (~160˚C), contained in a ramekin, until the whites are just set and the yolk is runny but thickened. Often butter or another fat is placed on top before cooking. Steamed: Very similar to shirred eggs, but the ramekin is covered with some aluminum foil and put in a steamer for 7-15 minutes. In a basket:

White pepper vs. black pepper,"They don't taste identical at all, and even more important, they don't smell the same. White pepper has a distinct ""barnyard"" odor.

How do restaurants make chicken fried rice? What ingredient am I missing?,"For me it isn't fried rice without toasted sesame oil, and the fried rice I have had in restaurants always tastes to me as if it contains toasted sesame oil. Peas are pretty required too. BTW, La Choy is synthetic soy sauce, it was at the very bottom of the America's Test Kitchen taste testing of soy sauce (sorry, paywalled), the only soy sauce to get a ""not recommended"" rating. Use anything but that. From that taste test: ""In summary, could this be any worse?"" I actually fry the rice in toasted sesame oil, but I have reason to believe that some toasted sesame oils will burn at that temperature. To experiment with that is on my list of things to do. So I can only say that this sesame oil has a high enough smoke point to fry rice. For whatever reason, the label does not say that this sesame oil is toasted. It is, and it's a very high quality oil. Amazon Link  EDIT: In other answers, Pepi mentions ginger, and Teresa mentions oyster sauce. I second both of those. I always use ginger and garlic and either oyster sauce or hoisin sauce. Also, Cindy mentions salt, the eggs do need salt. I actually use all of these in my rice (which looks like this when it is done, this is mine):  I'm assuming already cooked meat, peas sitting in a colander defrosting, water run over them enough to rinse off any clinging ice, and day-old rice. I start by making slightly underdone scrambled eggs, seasoned just like I season eggs that I'm eating for breakfast. I set the eggs aside on a plate and wipe out the skillet (or flat bottomed wok) with a paper towel, and let it get pretty hot. I don't attempt to use extreme heat, the same level of heat I'd use to sear chicken works fine for me. I add a good pour of the sesame oil, perhaps 1.5 tablespoons for two big servings (like the amount of fried rice in the picture above), let it heat for 30 seconds or so, then add ginger and garlic and stir. Then I add whatever veggies I'm using in the order of how long I want them to cook (all veggies except peas). When the veggies are just about fully cooked to to the level I want them in the rice, I add the rice, breaking it up and stirring in the veggies. I lightly press everything into the bottom of the pan, then I don""t touch it for a few minutes. I want the rice to get a bit of a brown crust along the bottom and to get mostly heated through before stirring again. This adds color and flavor, and helps keep the rice from sticking. This step seems to bridge the flavor gap between the the rice made with the super-high-heat that Asian restaurants can achieve, and the more moderate heat of a typical home stove.  In the meantime I mix my sauce. The proportions are up to taste, I usually go about half and half soy sauce and hoisin or oyster sauce. Less soy if is is dark, more if it is light or reduced sodium. I'll usually make just shy of a cup of sauce, knowing I won't use it all. When the rice has formed a crust, I stir in the meat. Then the sauce, a bit at a time, tasting as I go. Finally I stir in the peas and eggs. I garnish with some chopped cilantro on the plate. Voila. You mention Five Spice. That would be interesting, and possibly very good, but it is not a flavor that I associate with fried rice."
"When making yogurt, why doesn't bad bacteria grow as well?","The initial heating of the milk, besides denaturing proteins to improve the texture, also pasteurizes the milk. The culture needs to be added in a high enough concentration to crowd out harmful bacteria that might exist. That said, if your tools or containers are dirty or if your starter is dead, or you don't add enough starter, your yogurt can grow accidental bacteria and go off. Note
As Bob1 commented, this applies to the first few hours of fermentation before the milk has become acidic enough to inhibit other microbes."
Why do we use so much water to cook spaghetti?,"A tall thin pot is a hazard as it can be tipped over all too easily The book says use lots of water to ensure even cooking and to stop the pasta sticking. But regular stirring will solve this problem too Just use less water in a regular pot and feed the pasta into the boiling water. It takes about 30 seconds for long spaghetti to soften enough for it to fit into a regular pot. It cooks just fine WITHOUT breaking it up if you give it a quick stir after a minute, and then every couple of minutes or so If you know your stove temperature and spaghetti type, it will only take a couple of goes to work out the least amount of water you can use. I use about 1 l of boiling water for three adult servings of spaghetti in a medium domestic pot. With the lid half on it is cooked to a firm bite point in less than 8 minutes, and the water just covers the spaghetti when finished"

"Does water ""go bad"" in this sense?","It doesn't go bad, but it does change the taste. When water is just sitting there, water evaporates, but most things dissolved in it don't. Then, each time you boil it, the steam causes additional water to escape leaving the same amount of dissolved stuff in there. So, the concentration of dissolved stuff keeps going up. Dissolved oxygen also decreases when you heat or boil water, changing the taste. Finally, even if your kettle is stainless steel, it can eventually rust."
Why does pistachio ice cream not taste like pistachio nuts?,"Firstly, let me disagree and say that I have tasted some (amazing) pistachio ice creams that tasted very much like the actual nuts. That said, I can think of several reasons why the ice cream might taste differently from the nuts: A final side note, which I include mostly because I find it interesting: I used to think 'banana flavour' was based on a different type of banana than commonly found in stores. Doing some searching for this question, it turns out I was wrong."
Should pasta be started in cold or boiling water?,"For dried pasta it doesn’t really matter if you start with cold or hot water, as most of the time pasta spends in water is for hydration. And once the hydrated starches reach a certain temperature they gelatinize, thus cooking the pasta. When you start with cold water, you should use less water, which is actually a plus... Note: I forgot to mention, you should swirl the pot every couple of minutes to prevent sticking. However, when you’re cooking fresh pasta, you should directly start with boiling water. As it’s already hydrated, you just need gelatinization. As for which you should do for dry pasta, there are benefits to both:"
Why is it necessary to preheat an oven?,"When you don't preheat, you cook your food at a lower temperature as your oven heats up for the first 5-15 minutes, depending on the target temperature and your oven's strength. For forgiving foods, like a casserole, this may not affect you much - you'll just have to bake longer than the recipe says to. As long as you're careful, you'll be fine. But if you're baking something that should be baked for a short time at a relatively high temperature, your results are going to be very different. For example, take traditional Southern biscuits: they're baked very hot for less than ten minutes. This cooks them all the way through, and browns the top and bottom. If your oven starts out cold, they're going to be done in the middle before they're brown! Beyond under-browning, you'll also run into problems like lack of rising in steam-leavened foods. Pastries, in particular, could probably be disastrous."
Why do tomatoes get so hot?,"Another physics digression. All cooked food gets hot, and everything in any given dish will have the same temperature {*}. The tomatoes don't get hotter than the other ingredients. But they do have a tendency to burn more than certain other substances, so the question is ""Why?"". You get burned when a portion of your flesh reaches a high enough temperature{+}. The food warms your tongue, lips, etc. by heat conduction until either you move the food or your mouth parts and the food reach the same temperature (a condition known as thermal equilibrium). What that common temperature is depends on the amount of heat (i.e. thermal energy) in the system. Some of the factors that come into play are: How fast the common temperature is reached depends on Some consequences of all this: {*} Well, sort of. But take that as true for any particular region of any particular dish.

How can I make bacon powder?,"My wife loves bacon that's cooked to the cusp of burning, so I've got a good knowledge of the properties of bacon on that fine line. It's so brittle, you can powder it very easily.  I myself would probably just stick it in a plastic bag, and whack it a few times with a pan, but I don't see any reason why you couldn't put it in the blender. I have a nice mortar and pestle I use for powdering things, but that's probably overkill in this case."
Is pad thai actually Thai?,"It's Thai, but it's a relatively new dish as it doesn't date back when the country was called Siam, and it uses Chinese style noodles and preparation (with Thai flavors). There was a coup against the monarchy in 1932; in 1938 Plaek Phibunsongkhram (aka Phibun) came to power as prime minister.  Phibun ordered the creation of a new national dish, ""Gway Teow Pad Thai"" (Thai fried rice noodles).  The thing was, noodles weren't popular in Thailand before that, but there are stories that as this coincided with World War II, it was a way to get people to eat less rice.  (although, it's rice noodles, so I don't understand that part) The government pushed for the dish, including subsidizing food carts (and banning non-Thai food cart vendors, so there wasn't competition from the Chinese noodle vendors) ... But they're not the only country where foods we associate with them are relatively new -- potatoes and tomatoes are ""new world"" crops, not European, and untrusted (as they're part of the nightshade family along with capsicums (peppers), eggplant, and tomatillos).  So Irish and Italian cuisines before 1500CE (aka 1500AD) were extremely different from what we think of as their cuisines today."
What are the impacts of common pizza dough errors?,"I don't see anything in the question that is peculiar to pizza dough. Anything I answer will apply to any kind of yeast-risen, glutenous dough. The goal with any such dough is a well hydrated protein matrix that has been arranged in sheets that will trap the gas produced by yeast. The end result is that you don't need to worry about most of these things.
The biggest mistakes I see people make is making a dough too dry or simply not kneading enough. It is easier to add flour than water so put in less than the full amount of flour, knead for a while, if the dough stays too sticky then add a bit more flour and knead in. As answers to other questions have said- you want a dough that is ""smooth and elastic"" it isn't sticky and looks homogeneous. After just a couple tries you will get a feel for how wet that means and you'll be an expert. For pizza dough in particular- almost as important as the dough construction is the baking temperature. You want to cook it as hot as you can. 500F in an oven or on a grill. It will only take 5-10 minutes. The fast hot cooking will do a lot for your crust texture. It makes the difference between a crispy, chewy pizza crust and a soft, bready (and soggy under the toppings) crust."
How do you ensure a tortilla keeps all its contents when making a burrito?,"Folding a burrito is serious business. Get it wrong and you'll end up dumping most of the contents all over the place and look like a burrito noob. Get it right and your hands and plate will be perfectly clean, and you'll no longer be hungry. Beware: publicly flaunting these skills might lead to people wanting you to fold their burritos for them. First off: make sure your tortilla is ready to be folded. A cold or dried out tortilla is likely to crack or split. Use a warm and moist tortilla.  Second: don't overfill the tortilla. If you have small tortillas don't try to make a giant burrito and expect that to work. Now that we have the basics out of the way let's get to folding. See the flash animation at Chow.com (which I've converted into an image here):  Place the contents in the approximately center of your partially folded tortilla. Leave plenty of room on the ends otherwise you'll most surely have food spilling out once it's folded up. Hold the filled tortilla so the weight of the filling pulls it tight. If your burrito busts through now, it will certainly burst later. If not, proceed to step 2. Fold one end towards the center. Fold the other end over. Roll the bottom (the end nearest you) up towards the top. This isn't the intuitive way, but it's the right way. Make sure not to let the food squeeze out. I hold it with my fingers at the crease where the bottom edge that's been folded up meets the food. Keep rolling it up. Om nom nom."
"Dishwasher safety - ""top shelf"" vs. ""bottom shelf""","In most dishwashers the heating elements are on the bottom only. Lightweight plastic items might melt (soften and distort, not drip away) on the bottom, but they don't mind being in the steamy environment or being sprayed with hot detergent-laced water. They are therefore only dishwasher safe on the top shelf. I've melted a plastic bowl or two in my time; there is a definite difference between top and bottom."
Resources that explain the science of cooking?,"IMO, this really would have greater lasting value with a single detailed answer instead of a poll.  Here's an annotated list of all the recommendations so far: On Food And Cooking (Harold McGee) is all science at a very detailed level, combining food chemistry and biology and explaining the interactions between ingredients and the mechanisms behind various cooking methods.  If you're looking for a pure science book, this is it. Good Eats: The Early Years and Good Eats 2: The Middle Years by Alton Brown.  His books are less technical/scientific than other authors and tend to focus more on application, making them more accessible to less hardcore cooks. CookWise (Shirley O. Corriher).  Written by a biochemist who has done a lot of consulting in the food industry.  This is more practical than McGee and more technical than Alton's books.  It also includes a ton of recipes, which can be a good thing or bad thing depending on your personal preferences. She has also written a baking version, BakeWise. Molecular Gastronomy (Hervé This, translated by Malcolm DeBevoise).  This is more of a niche book (about - surprise - Molecular Gastronomy) and as you might expect is a little French-centric.  What's really great about this book is how it debunks a lot of popular cooking myths with actual controlled experiments and hard data.  It wouldn't be my first choice to recommend to a Food Science newbie, but nevertheless a good one to add to your collection. The Fat Duck Cookbook (Heston Blumenthal).  Written by the founder of the Fat Duck Restaurant in the UK.  It's about the history of the Fat Duck and has a big recipe collection (from the restaurant, obviously) and a section at the end dedicated to food science.  This one's really for the advanced crowd as it involves a lot of molecular gastronomy, sous-vide and other esoterica - complex preparations, hard-to-find ingredients and unusual/expensive equipment. Cooking for Geeks (Jeff Potter) is, as the title implies, written to appeal to geeks, and as such has a certain amount of science but tends to be quite a bit more basic as far as actual cooking technique goes.  It's more ""applied science.""  Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this for very experienced cooks, but it's great for getting into cooking and gaining an enthusiasm for it (if you're kind of a geek). Cooking for Engineers is a web site, not a book, which has the obvious advantage of being free and searchable.  It's hard to really define this as its scope is so wide, but I will say that I've found it to be a surprisingly useful and detailed resource whenever I need to find out something quickly. What Einstein Told His Cook (Robert L. Wolke) is also mostly on the science itself but is written to be more accessible to the layperson.  As one reviewer on Amazon put it, Wolke is like the Bill Nye of Food Science.  One part science, two parts entertainment.  Another member has criticized it for making unproven claims (particularly on nutrition). The Cooks Illustrated annuals (from America's Test Kitchen) are less about the actual chemistry of food but do highlight a very scientific approach to cooking based on up-front research, experimentation and testing.  See David LeBauer's Answer for a more detailed explanation. The Science of Cooking (Peter Barham) focuses on the chemistry and physics of why some recipes work and some fail. khymos.org - on the surface it's about molecular gastronomy, but you'll find much of the science of cooking (e.g. the chemistry behind ""working"" flavour pairings etc) on there too. The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science (J. Kenji López-Alt) is a collection of detailed recipes, tips and explanations.  It's written to be easily accessible to a chef without much experience. Serious Eats is a website with both recipes and stories about how the recipes were developed (often with pictures of various attempts to compare how changing processes or ingredients affected things).  Especially see the 'techniques' section of The Food Lab"
What was Indian food like before the arrival of the chili pepper from the Americas?,"Hardly - pepper was exported from India before chillis were introduced. Some linguistic subgroups still use it in preference to chillis, and certain dishes use it in preference to (or in addition to) chillies. Ginger's also native (or at least an early import) to India (and while not always used in 'traditional' cooking), I do believe that garlic and ginger were as well. Many other spices - one of the cinnamon varieties, cardamom and quite a few other spices were native.  While fairly well known, chillis aren't essential to cooking. Oddly enough, the 'source' I used to try to reverse engineer what are 'native' and what aren't is the traditional funeral anniversary or 'thevasam' menu. While essentially vegetarian, it would use mostly native produce and spices. You can find an example here, though specifics tend to differ with cultural groups or even families "
Can I use cooking sherry instead of red wine in my stew?,"""Cooking wine"" is unfortunately ubiquitous on US mega-mart shelves. It is notoriously bad. I mean really, really notoriously bad. It starts bad, and then they add obscene amounts of salt so that it can be sold on grocery store shelves for $6.  As pointed out by @Malvolio, ""salted wine is supposed to be disgusting! Many US states have special licensing requirements for any store that wants to sell alcohol, even wine and beer, but wine that is so heavily salted it cannot reasonably be consumed directly is exempt."" The salt literally makes it undrinkable, so underage and other sales that would otherwise be illegal aren't an issue. The added salt also ups the shelf life, but not nearly enough to justify the sensory assault of these stunningly awful ""wines"". Canadian ""cooking wine"" is the same thing, just with different levels of salt just like the 50 states. (these are just examples, all ""cooking wine"" brands on US grocery store shelves are the same level of truly insulting):  Skip the cooking wine. Go to a liquor store and look at the inexpensive bottles of wine. You might be surprised - bargains abound. Incidentally, if you don't generally love to drink wine but occasionally like to cook with it, you might try what I do. I keep a bottle of inexpensive but good dry sherry and another bottle of inexpensive but good dry vermouth tightly capped in the fridge. Those wines, along with marsala, port, and others are fortified with liquor, giving them a much longer refrigerated-after-open shelf life than normal wine. Fortified wine can often replace the wine in recipes, at an equal or slightly reduced volume of the non-fortified wine called for. Sherry is often actually called for in Chinese and other Asian recipes, and dry vermouth can generally sub for ""dry white wine"" in recipes.  Cook's Illustrated says:  Our recipes often call for dry white wine. Its crisp acidity and lightly fruity flavor add depth to everything from pan sauces and pasta to risotto and steamed mussels. The problem? Standard wine bottles are 750 milliliters, and our recipes rarely call for more than 1 cup (roughly 235 milliliters) of wine. That leaves us with most of a bottle to finish in a matter of days. Dry vermouth, which can be substituted for white wine in equal amounts in recipes, is a convenient alternative. Like Marsala and sherry, vermouth is wine that’s been fortified with a high-proof alcohol (often brandy), which raises its alcohol content and allows to it be stored in the refrigerator for weeks or even months after opening.  I buy the dry vermouth recommended as the best buy by those same folks at Cook's Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen, which sells for $6-$8 in the liquor store that connects to the grocery store (barely more expensive than the hideous salt bomb on the grocery store shelf).  One of the Sherries recommended by the Cook's Illustrated taste test clocked in at under $6: "
How did replacing flour in muffins go so wrong?,"Muffins and cakes rise because of chemical leavening agents and the expansion of hot gasses, they stay risen because the flour and sugar forms a structure which traps the air, then solidifies enough to hold its shape once the expansion has stopped. Cocoa puffs are made in a process called extrusion, where batter is pressurized and shot out in little spurts. On the release of this pressure the little squirt of batter expands and almost crystallizes in the same way as a muffin or cake, in other words puffs are cooked by a different method, but the processes which make them hold their shape is the same. These processes aren't reversible, you can't turn a cake back into flour, milk, sugar and eggs. Grinding up cocoa puffs is essentially the same thing as grinding up dried cake, they may absorb some moisture but as the chemical and physical changes involved in crystallization have happened it won't happen again. What it looks like is that your batter expanded enough to go over the top of the muffin pockets and then outward, then collapsed because there was no structure to keep the shape."
Do magnets dull knives?,"The magnets themselves don't dull them; they're not nearly strong enough to deform a blade. But it is possible to damage your knives on those racks. It's very easy to drag the blade along the rack a bit as you pull it off, and easy for the magnet to snap it against the rack as you put it on. Both are avoidable, though. When removing the knife, you twist it so that the sharp side leaves the magnet first. When putting it on the rack, you let the blunt side touch first, so when it snaps the rest of the way on, it's only the flat side against the rack, never the blade. It also helps to get a version that's not just bare metal; there are plenty with the magnet underneath wood. It might not be ideal if you let the blade drag along it a lot, just as you probably don't want to drag it along your cutting board, but it's a lot better than metal. Also, since the knife isn't directly against the magnet, the force doesn't increase as sharply as you get to the rack, so there's less snap. So, if you're worried that you (or guests in your kitchen) may not always be too careful, a bare metal magnetic knife rack is definitely not a good idea. But unless you're really protective of your knives, the wooden kind is probably fine. Folks have also pointed out that in principle, long-term use of a magnetic rack could magnetize the blade, causing it to pick up tiny bits of metal, especially during sharpening, which would then wear and dull the blade. As far as I know, this is not a big deal: I've seen knives stored long-term on magnetic blocks without noticeable magnetization. You could always keep an eye out and demagnetize the blade if necessary."
Why is a roux necessary?,"You do not need to make a roux. While your proposed technique of adding flour directly to milk will almost certainly lead to clumps, there are other ways to incorporate flour, butter, and milk: namely, a beurre manié. First, let's explore why flour clumps in hot liquid. As explained in this Seattle Times cooking advice column, flour will immediately gelatinize when added -- forming a sort of gel-like barrier that encases clumps of flour. No amount of stirring will break up these clumps. A simple fix is to use Wondra or a similar product. This flour is specially formulated to avoid clumping; I am not familiar with the details of their process, but I know that the product can be directly whisked into a sauce without clumping. It is fairly popular in America for making gravies. But, with standard flour, the best fix is to work in fat: it works as a lubricant, keeping particles of flour separated for long enough to incorporate into the sauce. As you know, one method to accomplish this is to make a roux: flour is added to hot fat and stirred until incorporated. Only then is liquid slowly added. An alternative is to make a beurre manié: a mix of cold butter and flour that is added, uncooked, to the sauce. Both a roux and a beurre manié provide sufficient lubrication to prevent clumps; however, many chefs prefer roux for a variety of reasons. Making a roux requires less mechanical action. Working cold flour and butter requires a lot of stirring or kneading. A roux, on the other hand, can be quickly whisked together with less resistance. This is ultimately a personal preferences: you may find one or the other workflow easier. Some people think a beurre manié tastes ""floury"". The hot butter in a roux lets you ""cook out"" the floury taste, some say. Not everyone agrees: this cook tried both methods, and in a taste test, saw no discernible difference. If a sauce thickened with beurre manié tastes good to you, go for it. In the same vein, a roux lets you toast the flour. Dishes that use ""dark roux"" (like gumbos, etouffée, or Japanese curry) rely on this toasty flavor for depth, color, and balance. In this case, you cannot substitute a beurre manié without losing flavor. The beurre manié has a bit of a bad reputation as a ""shortcut"" or inferior option to the roux. But, if you are struggling with roux, or just want to try a different process, I encourage you to give it a shot. If you do get some clumps, you can always just strain the sauce through a fine sieve."

How to test that a knife is sharp enough?,"I usually notice when cutting onions and tomatoes. With a very sharp knife cutting an onion doesn't cause much tears at all. As it dulls though it does more crushing than slicing which releases more gas into the air, which makes you cry more. Ripe tomatoes help because they are so tender. If it becomes difficult to slice a tomato without crushing it, your knife is too dull. A well used, properly cared for knife should require sharpening every 6-18 months, depending on usage. Mine get sharpened yearly. You may find it beneficial to read these related questions, and their answers:"
"What is the difference between green, white and black tea?","White, green, oolong, and black tea are all products of Camellia sinensis leaves and buds, the only difference is how they are processed.  You can turn the plant matter into any of the varieties.  Different sources will give different accounts of the processing steps, but in rough order of least-to-most processed: White tea is minimally processed and not oxidized, meaning it retains the natural antioxidants, but does not develop as much flavor, color, or caffeine.  Sweet or flowery flavors are characteristic.
 (Chinese Silver needle white tea) Green tea has a minimal amount of oxidation, halted by additional pan-frying (Chinese teas) or steaming (Japanese) steps.  The additional processing brings out more flavor, and allows for caffeine to develop, at the cost of a reduction in antioxidants.  Characteristic flavors are grassy, vegetal, and earthy, with sweet notes.   (Japanese Sencha) Oolong tea gets partial fermentation, and often an additional shaking/bruising step that release additional flavors.  Oolong can range in color from dark green to black. The combination of bruising and partial fermentation give many oolongs distinct flowery & earthy flavors.  Darker oolongs may have buttery or smoky tastes to them.  It has somewhat more caffeine and less antioxidants than green tea.  Tieguanyin or Iron Goddess: (light oolong)
 Black Oolong: (Wu Yi)
 Black tea is fully fermented, which blackens the leaves and causes the formation of caffeine and tannins. It generally possesses the most robust flavor and highest level of caffeine, but the least antioxidants.   (Chinese keemun) Pu-erh is tea that is pressed into cakes and post-fermented, meaning that after processing and drying it undergoes an additional ripening/fermentation. Microorganisms work on the tea, changing it chemically in a similar fashion to aging cheeses.  Traditionally this is accomplished over years in controlled climate conditions (10-15 years being ideal), but in recent decades a several-month fast ripening process is sometimes used.  Pu-erh develops a richer, more complex flavor, and has the widest range of flavors of any of the varieties. Before post-fermentation, it may resemble a white, green, or oolong tea, but the ripening process can impart darker black-tea flavors, giving a unique character. Pu-er Cake
 Rooibos, sometimes called red tea, is made from another plant entirely, Aspalathus linearis.  It is a traditional South African infusion, prepared like a black tea but without caffeine. There are two varieties, green and red.  Green is un-oxidized, where red is oxidized.  Rooibos is characterized by a sweet, woody/malty flavor.  Health-wise, it is a source of anti-oxidants, may aid in digestion, and some say it may aid with nervous tension and allergies.  Yerba mate is from the South American plant Ilex paraguariensis, whose leaves are steeped like tea.  It is generally toasted in processing, and produces a brew with caffeine similar to coffee.  Despite its caffeine, mate is actually relaxing to smooth muscles, so you don't get jitters, and it also helps control appetite. The flavor is vegetal and herbal, and can be bitter if brewed hot. Although it contains antioxidants, this is balanced by traces of carcinogens from the toasting, and the jury is still out on whether mate overall increases or decreases cancer rates.  Tisanes or herbal infusions these are various blends of dried herbs, fruits, spices, and flowers which are steeped like teas, but do not contain tea leaves.  Generally, the ingredients are dried, although fresh ingredients can be used too.  To confuse matters further, black and green teas may also have flavorings added to them, giving a similar result."
What oil or fat to use for different purposes?,"""Commonly used"" depends mostly on the culture, I'd assume.  There's a lot of different oils, so I've organized by use rather than try for a complete list. Some of the ones that you might find in a ""typical American"" foodie's kitchen include: For frying: something with a high smoke point : peanut, sunflower, soy, extra light olive oil For baking (muffins & cakes): something with a mild flavor : corn, canola, ""vegetable"", soy For baking (biscuits & pastry, or greasing a pan) something solid at room temp : butter, shortening, lard For general pan cooking: olive oil (any kind), butter, anything from the ""baking (muffins)"" list.  update: this assumes sautéing heat or lower; see 'frying' for higher heat applications. For salad dressing: any nut oil, mild oil, or virgin / extra virgin olive oil For sauces: Butter. For finishing: something flavorful to drizzle over at the last second... odds are, it's extra virgin olive oil, but possibly sesame or a nut oil. Now, there's regional differences -- in the south, it's pretty common to save your bacon grease for cooking and to use shortening for frying.  Lard's still popular in hispanic (and likely other) cuisine, schmaltz (rendered poultry fat) is used in both Jewish and French cooking.  Ghee (similar to clarified butter), is used Indian cuisine ... and the list goes on. If you're looking for a 'must keep on hand' list -- a mild oil, extra virgin olive oil and butter will get you through most anything.  Add shortening if you like baking, and sesame oil if you like to cook asian food, and you'll be prepared for most anything."
How much juice is in a lemon?,"It can range on the size of the lemon and the time of year.  A medium lemon will give 2-3 Tablespoons of juice, where a larger lemon can give 1/4 cup (4 Tablespoons).   Just have to decide on much lemon flavor you want in your recipe as to which number you pick.  "
How can brown stains be removed from pots and pans?,"I too use barKeepers Friend...love it. However, use a piece of crumpled up aluminum foil to scrub off the stain. It comes right off!"
What is the purpose of creaming butter with sugar in cookie recipes?,"Creaming puts the air bubbles into the mixture. The baking powder only helps enlarge the bubbles, not make them.  In cookies the creaming plays another essential role, which is to help dissolve the sugar.  To cream the butter keep it cool and do it for a few minutes (at 65°F, harder in the summer). It has recently been discovered that cookie dough is different from cake batters. Sugar is part of the structure of the cookie and not just a sweetener, tenderizer, and browning agent.  It forms the base upon which the fats and the starch granules of the flour are embedded.  The sugar needs to dissolve for the matrix to form. If you beat the whole thing, it will be harder to get bubbles in and you may end up overworking the dough.  The cookies will end up flat and tough. "
Should I peel kiwifruit?,"It is perfectly safe to eat the peel in and of itself. You will need to make sure that you wash it properly, as it may be dirty. But beyond that, it's simply a matter of taste. A lot of people don't like the flavor / texture of the peel and so remove it.  From a site devoted to kiwis: Kiwi fruit skin is definitely edible,
  and there's a lot of different
  theories about eating it. Kiwi fruit skin contains high levels
  of flavonoids, insoluble fiber and
  antioxidants: these substances all
  have a beneficial effect on your
  body's metabolic functions (flavonoids
  and antioxidants) and on your
  digestive system and cardiovascular
  apparatus (insoluble fiber). Common sense, however, should be
  practiced in this respect: while raw
  kiwi fruit skin contains these
  beneficial substances, it also tends
  to contain more than 99,95% of of the
  pesticides in that particular fruit
  (if they have been used), which
  largely outweighs the benefits from
  flavonoids and antioxidants."
Fry onions and garlic before adding to the sauce?,"Sauteing onions: Sauteing garlic: garlic needs very little sauteing, far less than onion So you get more depth of flavor, better flavor and texture sauteing them."
Nonstick cookware or not?,"I'm with @Ward -- I like being able to scour my pans for those times when even deglazing doesn't work.  (although, I've found that if you ever forget about the stock that you're trying to reduce ... burning chicken bones is a nasty smell and will stain even stainless steel). I do have some non-stick, and even a non-stick flat-bottomed wok (from circulon, but then, I'm also using electric, so it's possible I don't get enough heat to ruin it; I also never pre-heat it without oil in it, as you should never heat a dry nonstick vessel). I'd say to look at replacing your set bit by bit -- which items do you cook that really need non-stick, and what pan do you cook it in?  Maybe replace your more beat-up items with something not non-stick, try cooking with it, and see how well you like cooking with them -- it's possible that you won't like it, and it'd be better to be out the cost of only a piece or two than a whole set.  You could even try out a few different materials -- cast iron, stainless, anodized aluminum, etc. It also might take a little time to get used to cooking with out the non-stick.  One mistake I've seen people make is not giving their pans enough time to pre-heat.  (I think it was the Frugal Gourmet who'd say ""Hot pan, cold food, food won't stick"" ... which isn't entirely true, but you'll have much less problems with a hot pan)."
What's (really) the difference between fruit and vegetables?,"There is no real black and white definition of that difference, because where the line is drawn varies from crowd to crowd. Botanically speaking, a fruit is a seed-bearing structure that develops from the ovary of a flowering plant, whereas vegetables are all other plant parts, such as roots, leaves and stems. By those standards, seedy outgrowths such as apples, squash and, yes, tomatoes are all fruits, while roots such as beets, potatoes and turnips, leaves such as spinach, kale and lettuce, and stems such as celery and broccoli are all vegetables. The outlook is quite different in culinary terms, however. A lot of foods that are (botanically speaking) fruits, but which are savory rather than sweet, are typically considered vegetables by chefs. This includes such botanical fruits as eggplants, bell peppers and tomatoes. You can find the whole article HERE, including this nice graph that I think nicely illustrates things. "
"When a recipe asks to add spices to the oil, can you add the spices directly to the sauce for the same effect?","The effect will be different for a few reasons. When you add spices to hot oil, they cook at a considerably higher temperature (up to around 200°C) than in a simmering sauce (100°C as it's likely to be mostly water).  Important cooking chemistry happens at this higher temperature, so the flavour is actually changed (just as with onions and garlic).   Whole or coarse spices sometimes pop and break up (I often add whole or lightly crushed cumin seeds to hot oil and fry,  but if you add them after adding watery liquids they get stuck in your teeth).  This can be mitigated by using finely crushed/ground spices. Even if the oil is cold, many major flavour compounds are much more soluble in oil than water, capsaicin being a significant example.  The flavour extraction will be affected.  Taking chilli flakes as an example, you can add them later, even at the table, but the heat will be concentrated in the flakes; adding them at the beginning of cooking allows the flavour to infuse the whole dish.  Again finer spices can help here by dispersing in the sauce. On the other hand it's perfectly sensible to add black pepper to a simmering sauce, to taste.  Turmeric is also often added towards the end of cooking as too much cooking removes some of the best elements of the flavour.  Paprika is also sometimes added late (or even to the oil and at the end). Bearing this in mind, experimenting is a good thing.  If you put a baseline level of spice in the oil, you can get away with topping up the flavour, with a little care."
Mint vs Peppermint,"Peppermint is a hybrid breed of two plants belonging to the mint genus, spearmint and watermint. In my experience, when 'mint' is referred to by itself without any other descriptors, it usually refers to the spearmint flavour people are used to (from things like green restaurant mint candies, toothpaste, etc). Peppermint will be denoted as peppermint. However, as mentioned in the comments, this may vary based on region. There is a significant difference in taste between peppermint and spearmint; I find peppermint to have a much more intense flavour. Scientifically, peppermint gets its flavour from its high menthol content, whereas as spearmint owes its flavour to the compound L-carvone. Substitution will not replicate the same flavour as the original. Source for science related parts:

Why does frozen food still have an expiration date?,"Frozen food does spoil over time. Much slower than even just thawed, sure, but don't expect that something that would spoil within few days at just above 0°C will last with unchanged quality for years at -18°C (even if it were always at that temperature). There are also physical and chemical effects contributing to spoiling of food. Freezing refers to water forming ice. The spoiling of the aqueous parts (water and the stuff dissolved in water) is extremely slowed down due to the phase change liquid -> frozen.   But food is not only water, and e.g. lipids (fatty, oily) parts are much less affected by the lower temperature. The lipids in food are are often mixtures of fats and oils that get slushy and finally more and more still in the temperature range we're talking about. E.g. squalene (which is fairly abundant in some fish oils) has a freezing point of -75 °C - having such components helps keeping the mixture from freezing (crystallizing). Lipids can go rancid by hydrolysis and/or oxidation. This is slower in cold temperatures (as a rule of thumb, for lipid oxidation I'd expect maybe an order of magnitude slower for 10 °C lower storage temp. So 3 weeks instead of 2 days. If you manage consistently -18 °C instead of +2 °C, maybe several months, but not years. Gas-tight containers help against oxidation by oxygen from the air - but it is extremely difficult to seal food really air-tight at a time scale of several months.
Hydrolysis would be hampered by forming of ice, so the prediction of the time scale isn't that straightforward. In particular glycerol (e.g. from hydrolysis of lipid) will act as anti-freeze and keep some tiny fraction of the water in a liquid phase where it can help hydrolyze further lipids. Fish need to have lipids that stay suitably liquid at water temperature (i.e. for some fish even around 0 °C). Thus, while tallow is more-or-less solid already at +20°C, fish oils are liquid at close to 0°C. Which means that at the same -18 °C both oxidation and hydrolysis will be faster in cold water fatty fish than in the meat of warm-blooded animals. Health considerations: hydrolysis is affects the sensory quality, but AFAIK does not have health concerns (triglycerides are anyways hydrolyzed in our lipid metabolism).
Oxidation of (unsaturated) fatty acids OTOH leads to so-called lipid oxidation products (duh!). They include mutagenic and carcinogenic substances. BUT: this is also something that happens inside our body during lipid metabolism, and sufficiently often that we do keep detoxification pathways up and running. We includes the animals of whom we're discussing the meat here. This detoxification uses antioxidants (that's why they are healthy), and in the cells they are stored together with antioxidants (e.g. vitamin E). Before lipid oxidation (and the formation of potentially unhealthy components) starts, the antioxidants are used up - that's their biochemical purpose. In terms of health effects, in this stage, we're not getting as much of the particularly healthy antioxidants out of this food as we'd have gotten by eating that meat earlier, but  also there aren't yet particularly unhealthy compounds in it.
All in all, I'd say also the oxidative rancidity is not very concering in this scenario:  Volatile substances (which are important for smell/""taste"") also have lower vapor pressure but it's still above zero. Getting a container gas tight at a time scale of months is difficult. In the end, after a year or so in the freezer is is quite possible that all the food acquires the average freezer smell/taste.   Health effects well, we don't know what substances float around in your freezer. But the total amount you eat probably doesn't differ much whether you let one piece of meat ""soak"" in that atmosphere for a years vs. 12 times eating a piece of meat that was in there for a month.  If you flash-freeze food, there will be tiny ice crystals, but given enough time they will grow (depending on temperature again, the colder the slower, and the more gas volume the more). This has two consequences for the food: the crystals can grow so that they damage the cell walls (in fish/meat or vegetables): the thawed meat is noticeably more tender, for vegetables we call the same effect mushy and often do not appreciate is as much. (Freezing in a home freezer is sufficiently slow to get this effect) The 2nd effect is that even at these low temperatures, water evaporates (that is part of how the re-crystallization processes work), and pure water crystals form. Over time and helped by temperature changes (due to opening, putting in new stuff, cooling cycles), pure water tends to crystallize outside the food at the wall of the container. This water comes from inside the food, which is dehydated (freezer burn).  Health effects none, or only indirect ones: destroyed cell walls may mean that microbial spoiling is faster once the food is thawed. But here again the time at -18 °C makes hardly any difference compared to the slowish process of freezing in a household freezer.
Dehydration/freezer burn also causes the protein to precipitate but that doesn't cause health concerns. And cooking/frying anyways leads to even irreversible protein denaturation (denaturation from drying may even be reversible). In terms of packaging, vaccum sealing (in a material that is has low permeability for oxygen - not all plastics are gas tight on the time scales we're talking about, and permeability varies for different gases) helps. Frozen fish is sold glazed with a protective ice coating that also helps, both against freeze burn and by adding another barrier for oxygen.  below 0C environment, no bacteria or fungi may grow I wouldn't bet on this as a general fact of life, see psychrophile microorganisms. 
But for the food-relevant microorganisms it is a good approximation. For your lobster, all that I explained about cold water fish will apply. It may not taste well any more. In terms of microbiological spoilage, months at -18 °C matter hardly at all compared to the time spent not or incompletely frozen. For the yeast (pizza) dough, while you can freeze yeast dough (dried yeast is usually produced by a freeze drying process), yeast can also die and your home freezing process may not be as nice to the yeast as an industrial process optimized to keep it ""alive"". But you'll notice if it doesn't rise when thawed - and as @GdD points out, you may not need it to rise after thawing.  If there are freeze burned spots, you may get away with thorough kneading like when  the surface of the resting dough accidentally dried a bit. Also, you can check the smell before putting any toppings."
Why does this entire carton of eggs have 2 yolks each?,"Double yolking tends to happen more often in spring and with young or very old birds.  As commercial egg producers do not tend to let their birds get old, unless you are getting farm eggs, they are likely young birds. Automatic candles may be set up to separate these as suspect so they had to be re-run to verify they were not bad, which will result in them being grouped. When I raised birds, it seemed like brown egg varieties have this occur more often than white eggs, but that is just my experience.  Some people actually try to breed for this and it is more common in some birds.  It also makes young birds a bit more profitable as the eggs are large than they would normally be for new layers.  There are considerable downsides as well for the birds though.  The eggs are not viable, almost always if incubated the egg will fail as if both are fertile, the egg cannot support twins, and one failing in the shell will lead to the demise of the other.  Also, the eggs are larger, so a young bird is laying eggs larger than it is physically ready to lay, and for an old bird the eggs can become monstrous.  This causes a much higher mortality rate in birds. I have very seldom had double yolks in commercial eggs, but there seems to be something in the water this year.  Just last week I had a dozen also that 10 of the 12 were double.  Just my luck, I was trying to make angel food cake and did not want them.  lol"
What is the use of this strange contraption on this serving fork?,"I found the answer with a good illustration (from https://www.925-1000.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=41243):  The idea is that when you have a large piece of meat (such as a large prime rib or so), it's difficult to balance the meat to be able to cut it vertically. Instead, you cut it horizontally from the right with your carving knife (assuming you are right-handed). To keep the meat from slipping away, you stick the fork in from the left, using your left hand. That puts the fork (and your left hand holding the fork) directly into the path of the knife when it exits the roast. The sudden lack of resistance could cause the knife to ""jump"" towards your hand. With this guard, the knife hits the guard rather than the hand."
"If one tomato had molded, is the rest of the pack safe to eat?","Yes - the mold is an indication that the spores have entered that tomato, but do not indicate any problems with others. Mold usually enters fruits like tomato through the stem site or damage to the skin. The bits you see outside the fruit are actually the fruiting bodies of the fungus (equivalent of the bit you eat on a mushroom - the rest is below the soil). These fruiting bodies produce tons of spores. You should use the others fairly quickly before any released spores have a chance to potentially start growing in them. Edited to add:
The general advice would be to discard any fruit that are attached to the main one by the fungal body, wash the others well to remove any potential spores off them, dry well (wetness promotes fungal growth) and use within a short time frame. The USDA has some good advice here - with thanks to SnakeDoc for finding this one."
How do I prevent an egg cracking while hard boiling it?,"I used the method here before with good success: http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_make_perfect_hard_boiled_eggs/ Basically you start with the eggs in the pan with cold water and bring the water to temperature, right when it reaches boiling you pull the heat back and let the eggs cook for 10 minutes. You don't need a full on boil to hard boil the eggs."
How to succeed with making omelette,"This depends on which type of omelet you want to make, I'll run through the three types I know how to make. The thick Waffle House style omelet (it's the kind that poofs up and is about an inch thick all the way around, IHOP also serves this omelet) is achieved by beating the eggs and incorporating a LOT of air in to the mixture.  Restaurants do this by using a milkshake machine to whip the eggs.  This type of omelet is easy to flip and cook, you just put enough butter to coat the pan, pour off any excess and then pour your egg mixture in to the pan (you are going to have to use an omelet pan for this).  Let the omelet cook while occasionally swirling the pan in a circular motion.  When the omelet has cooked most of the way through flip by either the toss in the air and catch in the pan method (not for beginners!) or the fork and spatula method (place spatula underneath and hold omelet onto the spatula with a fork on one corner). This will yield a thick fluffy omelet but it can be hard to work enough air into the eggs at home. The second type is the French omelet and it doesn't require flipping at all. The french omelet is what you see in fine dining brunches if you see it at all in the U.S.  This omelette is made by mixing your eggs and pouring the mixture into a medium low heat pan.  As it cooks you take a fork and pull the cooked egg off the bottom and into the center of the omelet. Here is a video that goes more in depth. The third type is what I call the grandma omelet.  It's made in a frying pan instead of an omelet pan and features a fairly flat egg wrapped around some cheese and other toppings.  For this omelet you need medium heat.  You should coat the pan with butter and pour in the egg mixture to a heated pan.  Let cook for a minute or two, then swirl the uncooked egg to the outside of the pan use a fork to lift the very edge to allow the uncooked egg to take the place of the cooked next to the pan.  Let the egg cook till desired doneness (side note: your omelet should and will have a small amount of uncooked but heated egg, it should be not runny, but still not be entirely set) and add toppings and fold over.  Then serve. To address your scrambled egg problem, you need to let the egg set more before attempting the flip and lowering the heat on your pan will take care of the burning. Just remember that eggs are extremely delicate and respond better to lower heat and close attention. Also the names are just the ones I use in my head, if somebody knows the correct terminology, let me know and I'll update to reflect it."
How do I pound chicken (or other meat) without making a mess?,"Clingwrap works fine for me -- but I don't use a meat tenderizer -- I just use a small but fairly heavy pan (but not my cast iron, as it's not smooth on the bottom). When I was in college, I tried a few things.  I can get pretty decent results just hitting it with my cutting board.  (with it between saran wrap). Part of it might be technique -- if I'm doing chicken breast I first slice is sort of following the taper of the breast, so it's neither with or across the grain, but kinda of diagonal.  You also don't want to hit straight down -- you want to angle the blows, so you're actually pushing the meat out, and not just trying to force it through the counter. And I should mention that I've only ever pounded out poultry and pork -- I assume beef would be the same, but I have no experience to confirm or deny it."
"Why should I ""rest"" meat after cooking?","There are a couple of reasons why 'resting' meat is a good idea. First, as the meat cooks the muscle fibres contract, which forces the juices out. Letting the meat rest helps the muscle fibres relax so the juices are re-incorporated into the meat and not lost on the chopping board, which would happen if carved immediately. The second reason to let meat rest is to provide an evenness. Basically as the meat rests it continues to cook slightly and it allows the meat to gain an overall 'doneness'"
What does a healthy cast iron skillet look like?,"Ideally it should be matte to just-slightly-shiny black and very smooth. This article has some terrific information on the ideal oil to use (flaxseed) and method for seasoning, with actual scientific grounding."
Why should one pre-heat an oven?,"It is not a problem to put whole potatoes for roasting in the oven while it heats up.  In fact, it's a good idea. However, if you are following instructions or cooking times written for a preheated oven, you will need to add about 10 minutes to the cooking time (depending on how fast your oven heats up).   The rule of thumb I use for this is to add 1/2 of the time my oven takes to heat up to the recommended cooking time.  Since my oven takes about 20 minutes to get to 400F, that's 10 minutes. However, regarding bell peppers it depends on why you are putting them in the oven.  If you're talking stuffed bell peppers, then it's fine to start with a cold oven.  However, if you are trying to char the peppers to remove the skins, you need to start with an oven that's as hot as possible, otherwise you will cook the peppers to mush before the skins are charred (and, ideally, use the broiler)."
Is there any cleaning utensil that is comparable to fingernails?,"Try searching for ""pan scrapers."" I have a pair from Lodge that has served me well, though you can find almost identical scrapers without the branding.  These are essentially equivalent to the scrapers mentioned by ChrisH, but with curves to make it easier to clean the edges of your pans"
Can a pizza stone be fixed after soap has been used to clean it?,"I would rinse well with clear water.  Allow to dry thoroughly, and then use as normal.  There is a small chance that your pizza stone will impart a soap flavor to your pizza, but I would say that it is worth a couple of pizza cooks to determine if there is a long term problem.  It's really not that much of a risk."
What did European/American historical cooks do with the egg whites?,"Another high-volume specialist use for egg white was mortar. Specifically, it was used very frequently in the Middle Ages, in the standard lime and sand mortar: a 2017 study suggests that 6% egg albumen (I assume by weight) provides the strongest mortar. It was not the only binding agent available to construction, but at least in the Middle East and in Europe, it was one of the most easily procured. Its role is to aerate the mortar, which is essential in preventing thermal contraction damage (ice or heat), and modify its hydration (usually by allowing a lower water-to-cement ratio, increasing strength and water resistance while still being workable). The use of egg white in construction persisted into the late 19th century in the colonial Philippines. According to one report, this use of egg white in the buildings transformed native Filipino desserts."
transfer pizza onto stone without sticking,"I've worked as a pizza cook, so I can give you a hard-earned answer. Cornmeal, and plenty of it. If you aren't putting cornmeal (or flour, but cornmeal works better) on the peel before you put the pizza on it, start. If you are putting it on, use more. Then put the pizza on it and give it a shake and make sure the pizza is loose before you try to shove it in the oven. If it isn't, lift up the edge that is stuck and sprinkle more cornmeal under it, then try again. The pizza should be completely free-moving on the peel before you try to transfer it to the oven."
What is a clove of garlic?,"Each ""wedge"" is a clove.  The entire garlic is called a ""head""."
How safe is steak tartare?,"Butchered meat is generally sterile except on its exterior.  (That doesn't mean parasite- or botulism-free, but it's a start.) Get the best quality you can from a source you trust.  Keep it at as low a temperature as possible, and don't expose it to warm air for more than the few minutes it takes to prepare. Cut with a clean knife on a clean surface. Put it right back into the fridge at a very low temp. Salt and acid, if you use them in your sauce, will provide some anti-bacterial benefits, but this is not foolproof. People all over the world eat raw meat, but it's best to start with small amounts and see how your system handles it.  If you're a child/pregnant/old/sick, it's much less of a good idea."
Can I boil pasta in a pasta sauce?,"For the best of both methods, cook the pasta most of the way in water, then strain and dump into the sauce to let it finish the last few minutes of cooking."
Why did my grandfather-in-law salt his beer?,"I can think of several reasons why you might salt beer: I've heard of it being done before, but never with good beer, only low quality swill.  But then, since there were more quality problems with cheap brews at the time, this was probably a lot more common."
Why do American supermarkets only carry lamb and not mutton?,"It's not just American supermarkets that rarely carry mutton, this situation is similar across the Anglosphere, and I suspect most Western countries too (or at least those without a strong mutton culture). The reason is largely economic. Mutton is expensive and not as tasty as lamb. First, the immediate reason is that nobody really eats mutton anymore. Yes, there are certain locales, cultures and movements still eating mutton or are trying to bring it back, but today, on aggregate, the demand for mutton is near zero. According to the USDA: The U.S. market for lamb and mutton has weakened throughout the decades. Since the 1960s, per capita consumption has dropped from nearly 5 pounds to just about 1 pound. This drop is due in part to declining acceptance of lamb from a growing segment of the population, as well as competition from other meats, such as poultry, pork, and beef. Most meat is sold as lamb and comes from animals under 14 months old. Here's a per-capita consumption graph:  If nobody buys mutton, supermarkets don't sell them. The supply chain for meats is pretty complex; it's not something that a store manager can just decide one day to order a batch and shelve to see if it sells. Meat needs to be slaughtered and deboned in an abattoir, butchered either in store butcheries or at centres (unless you fancy buying an entire, 50kg cut), and displayed in refrigerated sections. If there's enough local demand for mutton then maybe individual supermarkets can carry them, just as meats like rabbit, duck or kangaroo is sometimes sold at a few supermarkets. But why don't people eat mutton? People just don't like it. It is an inferior good. Mutton comes from older animals and is often less expensive but less desirable to consumers. (USDA) . As can be seen, the average income elasticities across the studies are 0.77 for
  beef, 0.24 for lamb, -0.65 for mutton, 0.47 for chicken and 0.48 for pork. (Negative income inelasticity = inferior good) That is, as incomes grow, as they have over this timeframe, people want to buy less of it. Lamb is a superior substitute for mutton. Anecdotally, compared to lamb, mutton is gamier, tougher, and harder to cook. Economically, lamb and mutton have high cross-price elasticity - if one's price grows, demand shifts to the other, indicating that they are substitutes. And the real killer is... Mutton prices have grown faster than lamb.  Mutton is still cheaper than lamb, but in relative terms it has become more economic to raise and sell lamb. There are multiple market forces at play: the cost of raising the sheep past lamb age, the efficiency of raising lambs (i.e. increased lamb weight), the growth of dairy leading to higher beef supply, the relative decline in wool reducing mutton supply and so on. You'll have to ask a farmer.

Is it safe to drink grain alcohol mixed with snake blood?,"According to Biological risks associated with consumption of reptile products International Journal of Food Microbiology, Volume 134, Issue 3, 15 September 2009, Pages 163-175: People are documented to have been infected with the following pathogens due to raw snake consumption: Spirometra (Vietnam is specifically mentioned) Gnathostoma doloresi Pentastomids See also Spirometra (Pseudophyllidea, Diphyllobothriidae) Severely Infecting Wild-Caught Snakes from Food Markets in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, Guangdong, China: Implications for Public Health The Scientific World Journal
Volume 2014, Article ID 874014: In China, there are a lot of cases of human sparganosis caused by eating raw meat of snakes and frogs, drinking snake blood, and swallowing snake gall bladder [16]. Improper cooking methods of snakes will also increase the risk of infection, such as snake skin salad and halfcooked snake meat. In addition, Spirometra may contaminate tableware and food in the process of cooking snake meat. In the year of 2011, a patient suffered from bronchial sparganosis because he had a history of ingesting raw frogs, snakes, and drinking raw snake blood [17]. Another case of cerebral sparganosis reported in 2012 was caused by eating frogs and snakes [18]. In a separate report in 2003, all of the 11 patients infected by Spirometra had the habit of eating raw meat and skin of animals and 6 of them ate snake meat, blood, or snake gall [19]. In 104 cases from 2000 to 2006, 53.9% were caused by eating snakes or frogs [16]. ... More than half (55.0%) of the snakes were infected by Spirometra Finally, concerning alcohol, see Effect of physicochemical factors on infectivity of Spirometra mansoni plerocercoid Zhongguo Ji Sheng Chong Xue Yu Ji Sheng Chong Bing Za Zhi. 2011 Oct;29(5):368-71 : None of the mice fed with plerocercoids soaked in 60% ethanol for 2 h was infected. All the mice fed with plerocercoids soaked in 60% ethanol for 1 h, or in 50% ethanol for 2 h or 3 h were infected. So even if the final concentration of alcohol after mixing was 60% (120 proof), and you wait 1 hour after mixing the blood and alcohol, it isn't necessarily sufficient to disinfect."
The secret to hash browns / home fries / breakfast potatoes,"It sounds to me like the issue may be that you're crowding the pan. Basically, to get everything nice and brown and crispy, you need enough space for all of the steam to escape.  That picture you showed has potatoes stacked on top of each other -- that means as the bottom items cook, they're going to end up steaming the items above them. At a diner, they have a large griddle to work with -- they can really spread things out.  You're not typically that lucky in a regular kitchen, as you don't have as much space, and you have a lip on the pans that'll hold the steam in. So, either work in smaller batches, or consider recipes that use an oven -- using sheet pans instead of a pan on the stove solves much of the problem. One other trick is that most diners don't start from raw potatoes -- maybe with hash browns, but not for home fries, you're not going to get the nice soft interior in a reasonable amount of time unless you start with a potato that's already been baked or boiled.  (If you're doing things in the oven, you might be able to, but not in a pan) Just for reference ... I have a 14"" cast iron skillet that I use for home fries ... and it's about the right size for cooking a single large potato, which might be two servings, maybe three for kids.  (I tend to cook carb-heavy meals). update : I probably should've stated this directly -- you want the chunks of potato to form a single layer in the pan, with space in between them."
Cooking Scrambled Eggs ends up with excess liquid,"You've already spotted two of the possible reasons for scrambled eggs to sit in a pool of water: condensation, and the other ingredients in the scramble seeping moisture.  The condensation you can deal with by leaving the eggs to sit (off heat) for 2-3 minutes before plating them.  You're already taking a stab at making the fillings not wet; aside from cooking them well (and making sure to cook off any moisture), some wet fillings (zucchini, tomatoes, etc.) can also benefit from salting and blotting with paper towels. However, there's another place for moisture to come from, and that's the eggs themselves.  This problem is called ""weeping"", and affects cooked eggs in all forms (scrambled eggs, quiche, meringues, even boiled eggs).  Over time, as cooked eggs sit, their protein structure squeezes out the water in them.  Various problems can cause that to happen within minutes, as it is in your case. Here's some tips for avoiding weepy scrambled eggs: Some additional references:"
Why are baking measurements such nice round numbers?,"I've always been taught that baking is a science when it is compared to cooking.  Cooking is very much 'to taste' and very individual.  There are not as many things that can go wrong with a standard recipe in cooking, and you have a lot more room for creativity.  You don't have to look at baking as that precise.  However, unlike cooking, where you can add or subtract from a recipe with no real harm to physical structure, that does not hold in baking.  For examlple, if you feel that there is too much salt in a recipe, cutting back can (and most likely will) have a cascading effect through the ingredient chain. You have to understand your ingredients and the effect they have on other ingredients.  That is what makes baking a more precise science.
And in terms of flour, it is often the most 'ranged' ingredient.  Depending on flour type, miller, altitude, water temp. etc., the amount of flour in a given recipe is always a guide.  Again, you have to know your ingredients.  You will never see 'one and an eight cup plus 2 TBSP hard flour' in a recipe, because it is so variable for many different reasons. Flour and water are the two most flexible ingredients, and are always variable.
Hopefully this helps, I am sure someone will come along with a more scientific explanation for all different ingredients, I am just offering an experience based answer to your question.
Also, you are right, do not mess around with baking soda and powder.  If you do, you are asking for trouble.
I would suppose that the rule of thumb would be that the more exacting an ingredient is (tsp, quarter tsp), you don't want to change much."
"Does ceramic non-stick cookware ""fail"", and if so, how?","I have a ceramic-coated pan too, and always treated it with care (plastic utensils, no overheating, etc.) It failed too, after some time (I think I've had it for 9 months now, and used frequently).  Unlike a failed Teflon pan, it does not look or feel any different. But while at the beginning it was superslick, with everything gliding right off it in a fluid motion, now it is only moderately non-stick. I can still use it as normal, including for such problematic cases as omelets. But if I fry without fat, I need a spatula to dislodge the omelet from the surface. In contrast, when I bought it it was like polished ice. It is still more non-stick than, say, enamelled or seasoned iron, and definitely better than stainless steel. But it isn't as good as a good-quality PTFE.  If the non-stickness keeps at this level, I still think that it makes sense to buy it, if you have the money. They are expensive, especially the brand-name ones, but can give you nice, even heating. While they will give you less non-stick performance, they are more robust than PTFE - metal utensils don't damage them, they don't overheat as easily - and I found the non-stickiness sufficient. The nice thing about them is that the quality ones aren't thin aluminium, mine has a 10 mm sandwiched steel bottom - you don't get this in PTFE. So they can be used for applications impossible with PTFE, and will give you a better heating in the cases where PTFE would have worked.  On the other hand, you can decide to go traditional, with a combination of PTFEs for the sticky applications and iron or steel for everything else. It will probably give you a better tool for the stickies, as long as the PTFE coating itself doesn't fail through accidental overheating. It is up to you which style you prefer, but the ceramics aren't the panacea they are touted as. "

How can vegans alleviate the effects of spicy food?,"I have done no testing of this at all but I was surprised to find on this site that they recommend trying a spoon full (or cube of) sugar. Perhaps the easiest way of calming down a flaming mouth is by sucking on a sugar cube or holding a teaspoon of sugar in your mouth. This helps by absorbing the spicy oil that is coating your mouth, as well as giving you a different, strong taste to concentrate on. A bit of mind-trickery and science combined! Other things I've eaten in the past include starches, like bread or rice. Here's a fun infographic and most of the items on it are vegan:

Why not put knives in the dishwasher?,"Expensive knives can survive a trip through the dishwasher, but like others have mentioned, they can bump into things, end up with coatings of detergents and such, suffer damage to wood, etc. Why would you do that to an investment? Cheaper knives will just straight out rust/corrode, even if you remove them and dry them right after the cycle. Yeah, you can scrub it off, but you're also losing metal from the blade, possibly starting rust in areas you can't dry, and generally degrading the knives."
Does chilli get milder with cooking?,"You'll sometimes hear television cooking show hosts describe what they're doing as ""cooking out"" the paste. What they're actually doing is altering the flavor of the chili itself, not manipulating the level of capsaicin that was introduced. If you take a typical chili paste which has been combined with garlic and other things and then saute it in a fat, you will lower the level of heat that's tasted (and possibly take some bitterness out, depending on the chili and what's in the paste), but not lower the level that's actually ingested. If you literally want to cook it out, put some sliced chili with nothing else in a searing hot pan, but make sure no one else is home or going to be home for a while, and wear a respirator. The capsaicin has nowhere to go and vaporizes as it burns (seriously, don't do that, if you did that in my kitchen I'd throw a live crab at you). Various kinds of fat bond well with the capsaicin, essentially creating a sort of encasement. To demonstrate how this works, grab some sriracha and some cream. Mix in about half a tablespoon of sriracha to about 300 ml of cream, taste it. Now, simmer the cream a bit (about 3 - 5 minutes), take it off the heat, let it rest a few minutes and taste it again. The level of sriracha didn't change, what happened is the cream got its hands on the capsaicin that it contained. It'll continue to get milder the longer it sits. That's why a glass of milk can rescue you from atomic hot wings and why water just broadens the pain as it makes sure your whole palate gets a chance to taste it :) Beer just makes you care less about it. Now, sugar has the remarkable quality of helping to hide heat with its mighty right of first refusal when it comes to your palate. The heat from the chili shows up and your palate says ""what? I'm too busy with this sweet, I can only listen to a little of you"". To see how that works, repeat the experiment again, but this time throw a teaspoon or so of confectioner's (or castor) sugar into the cream with the sriracha, along with an additional squirt or two (around 10 ml) of sriracha. That's why coconut milk works so perfectly in a curry.  The best bet for your recipe is finding a way to get some kind of fat into it. That could be coconut milk, fatty bacon, or whatever makes sense based on how you want to serve it. Then, optionally, sweeten it up a bit (also remember that citrus helps offset sweet, handy to keep that in mind when you're 'fixing' a dish) - some raisins sound like they'd work rather well with what you're doing. Maybe go with coconut milk and raisins, and thin it out with a bit of chicken stock if needed?  I really try to encourage people to take an hour and just experiment with ways you can alter and sort of control chili, because it is a lovely thing to cook with. Just remember, whatever you put in the pan initially ends up being eaten, you're just hiding a bit of that as you cook. "
Why did James Bond heat up the knife for his foie gras?,"From this link  The key to slicing and portioning foie is to treat it like a rich
  mousse-cake: Make sure to heat up your knife under running water in
  between every slice. A cold knife will catch and stick in the foie,
  causing it to tear or crumble. A hot knife will melt the fat as it
  goes through, leaving you with clean, smooth surfaces to sear."
What happened to my egg?,"Your egg whites were cooked by the alcohol in the extract. Cooked, in this case, means denaturing, which means unfolding the protein molecules. There are many ways to denature proteins. Acid, such as vinegar, will denature egg proteins, which is why some people suggest adding vinegar to the water to poach an egg (a practice I disagree with, but that's another subject).  Ceviche, as another example, is fish which is cooked (denatured) in acid (such as lime juice). Although heat is not used, the fish is still cooked. (Note: the acid will kill some bacteria but is not as effective as cooking with heat, so be sure to use fresh fish from a source you trust.) This is similar to how burning means combining with oxygen, so you can burn metal (rust) without heat (most easily by adding water)."
"Is ""until juices run clear"" a valid test for poultry doneness? Why or why not?","Chicken juices contain a soupy mix of proteins including haemoglobin (which gives blood its red colour when mixed with oxygen), and some myoglobin (which gives red meat its red colour when mixed with oxygen). Up to about 140F, they are unchanged, but heat them to between 140F and 160F and they lose their ability to bind oxygen and so their colours change. So if your juices are running clear, you know the temperature is at least higher then 140F and probably closer to 160F if they are indeed clear. The question of what is 'doneness' is an interesting one. For most foods, doneness is a question of taste. After years of eating my chicken at 'at least 140F', I really like that taste. We usually cook foods to improve their taste, texture, nutritional value; very few foods traditionally kill or harm us if they are not cooked (cassava, certain beans are notable exceptions). Heating to 165F is recommended not for taste but to kill organisms such as salmonella - a tricky blighter that lives inside the cells of some other creatures and so can't be washed or peeled off. I'm pretty sure that I'm the first generation cook in my family to own an instant-read probe digital food thermometer, so why is this now necessary? Well I may also be the first generation where salmonella in store-bought chicken is considered a saleable product and something to be cooked out by heat, rather than designed out by good farming and food handling practice. The 165F statement from food safety bodies was brought in to deal with such issues. In France, there are still plenty of people who like their chicken very pink. With my own grown chickens, I will cook them till a skewer pierced into the deepest part of the thigh (but not near the bone), shows clear juices and on deep-breasted old breeds that can leave a tinge of pink towards the bottom of a (deliciously juicy) breast. I'm personally comfortable with that particular risk/reward balance. But store-bought chicken? From an unattributed source? At $1:15/lb? Pass me the probe, please."
What is the difference between various types of flour?,"There are actually quite a few differences between the different types of flour. The number of different types you store will really depend on your particular requirements. All purpose (or plain) flour is a blend of different types of wheat and has a relatively low protein content. Bread flour is typically made from a single, high protein wheat. It also has a higher gluten strength. It may also contain ascorbic acid (vitamin C) Cake flour is also typically made from a single type of wheat (different from the wheat used in bread flour) and has a high starch content, it also has the lowest protein content. There are many other types of flour, all of which server specific purposes, for example; Self raising flour, Whole wheat flour, Chick pea flour, Rice flour, Semolina flour  And others. Essentially it's important to use the right type of flour for a give recipe."
Does it matter what kind of sugar is used in baking?,"Yes! Sugar is often used as a ""wet"" ingredient in baking.  That means it needs to be dissolved in the water in order to prevent too much gluten from being produced (making the result fluffy/flaky, and not chewy).  Different sugars hold different amounts of moisture (for example, brown sugar holds more than white) and using sugar with crystals that are too large (or too small) will make the texture come out completely wrong.  Too small and your cake will be rubber; too large and your biscuit will fall apart. Also, if you're using the sugar for creaming (with fat), you generally need to use a coarser sugar.  Superfine sugar will dissolve too quickly and won't allow enough air to be incorporated.  Confectioner's sugar is good for creaming but has completely different properties from crystal sugar - it's been ""processed"" and has cornstarch added, so you can't just substitute in equal quantities. Of course, it goes without saying that the taste is different as well.  But even more important than the taste are the solubility characteristics which, as explained above, will have noticeable effects on other parts of the recipe. It does depend what you're baking; if the sugar is being used purely for flavouring, then you can use whatever sugar you like.  Much of the time in baking though, sugar is used for more than just sweetening, and it's important to be aware of that.  If the sugar is being creamed or dissolved, don't substitute unless you're sure you know what you're doing."
Is there any truth to the idea that you shouldn't multiply seasonings when multiplying a recipe?,"The notion that salt or spices specifically don't scale linearly sounds like nonsense to me.  In any recipe involving salt and water, the salt is dissolved, so all that matters is the concentration, and that concentration is going to be the same with linear scaling. Scaling in general is problematic when scaling more than 2x or 4x.  When you take into account that: Recipes targeted at home cooks are imprecise to begin with and often use volumetric measurements that are sensitive to heat, humidity, and other environmental conditions, so the imprecision is magnified at larger scale; Larger portions of food may get cooked less evenly and/or at less consistent temperatures due to the volume/surface area ratio; that part is correct, but it has nothing to do with salt, it has to do with your equipment.  On the stovetop, most of the heat is coming from the bottom of the pan unless you use induction, and even in an oven you've got one or two heat sources radiating heat in a specific pattern. Cooking times are also going to vary due to changes in things like rates of evaporation.  The total amount of heat you're able to deliver at any given time generally does not increase as quickly as the amount of heat you need to deliver, so very often you need to increase cooking times. I'm sure you probably already know all this, but the reason I'm pointing it all out is that I'm pretty sure that this odd-sounding assertion about non-linear salt/spice scaling is due to some mutation or misunderstanding of general scaling issues. Probably, salt and spices are typically present in very small quantities in most recipes, and those quantities are already wild guesses much of the time, so the effect of compounding all this wild inaccuracy, especially with volumetric measurements, is actually pretty noticeable at large scale.  Scaling sucks with these ingredients because the initial quantities and scaling method are both nonsense. Assuming you have a precise recipe that gives weight measurements, and you scale by weight, then you're not going to have any problems as long as you either cook it in batches or adjust your cooking time/temp accordingly. I suppose I could be wrong, but I spent 20 minutes digging for some evidence to contradict my claims above and came up dry; you'd think that somebody would have presented some evidence if the claim were true."
"What is the value of the ""Texas Crutch""?","The primary benefit of crutching a large piece of meat on the smoker is to reduce evaporative cooling. When water is heated, it evaporates into vapor that we call steam. The state change from liquid water to gaseous steam is an endothermic process. That means that energy is consumed—as opposed to exothermic processes whereby energy is released. Evaporative cooling is the effect that this state change has on the meat itself. Liquid steaming off of the meat has a net effect of cooling the meat. This is the same process the human body uses to cool us down in warm weather. We produce sweat which then evaporates, thus cooling our body. When cooking a big cut of meat it is not uncommon to lose a quarter or more of the weight from the time it hits the smoker to the time you are ready to eat. Most of that lost weight is water. When a piece of meat reaches the temperature required for the surface to begin steaming aggressively, the evaporative cooling effect becomes significant enough to halt or significantly slow the overall warming trend of the meat. In barbecue parlance, this is called ""The Stall."" The stall can last several hours. By the nature of the variables at play, this stall often happens in what is essentially unproductive time on the smoker. Meaning, the meat is not yet hot enough to be fully into the process of breaking down tough connective tissues, and it's already past the point where it is gaining significant flavor from the smoke. Essentially, it is just sitting there. Using up fuel and time. Depending on your goals, you may also want that moisture to be inside your meat. 
In this graph you can see that the internal temperature of the meat actually dropped during the stall, in spite of the temperature in the smoker itself remaining consistent. It took about 5 hours to regain the heat lost to the stall. This graph was generated by a smoker temperature controller, emphasis mine. One could argue that the stall begins earlier than indicated. There exist more cut-and-dry examples, but I chose this one because of the significant internal temperature dip shown. In short, it saves time and fuel. Wrapping the meat reduces the evaporative cooling effect so you waste less time in the stall. You're essentially braising the meat in your humidity-controlled environment within the wrap. The steam cannot escape, so the cooling effect is reduced. Wrapping your meat to power through the stall will soften the bark (the highly desirable seasoned crust that this food is famous for). When you do or do not crutch is completely dependent on 1) how much time you have to perform your cook and 2) the goal end state of your food. If you're smoking a pork butt, for example, and you plan to pull the meat and mix it up with sauce to make sandwiches, the state of your bark may not be very important to you. Personally, I am a ""bark guy"" so I usually make sacrifices in favor of maintaining it. I want shards of chewy bark to contrast the tender texture of the rest of the meat. This usually means giving myself extra time. This is sometimes a more reasonable goal at home than it is in a commercial or competitive environment.  Note that the general principles at work here apply to roasting in an oven as well. Some smokers are indeed very similar to ovens."
Theoretical: why there's no gradient of doneness in bread?,"Essentially, the exterior crust and the interior evenness are both side effects of the distribution of water. The Maillard Reaction - the chemical reaction responsible for the brown crust - happens at about 150° C.  Generally you're baking at a much higher temperature than this - say 200° C. The first question one might ask is, why is the crust only on the outside?  And the answer is because only the outside gets dry enough; as the small amount of water on the surface evaporates, the temperature is allowed to rise to ambient oven temperature. The reason it doesn't happen on the inside is precisely the opposite; water boils at 100° C, so as long as there's still water in liquid form (and bread is, to a large extent, water), the temperature can't get any higher than that.  The interior of the bread is always regulated at approximately 100° C, and since the baking temperature is uniform, so is the finished product.  It's almost like poaching an egg or a piece of meat; no part of it is able to get any hotter than the liquid around it, so the longer you cook it, the more uniform the temperature gets. If you continued to bake the bread until all of the interior water evaporated into steam, then it would eventually start to undergo the same process as the steam slowly escaped.  But we usually don't bake bread that long, so it doesn't happen.  As commenter Ray points out, there are some types of darker bread such as pumpernickel which involve intentional ""overbaking"", but obviously not to the point of burning it. Note: There may also be a certain element of the process that is due to steam being trapped inside; the water vapor, like any gas, expands and distributes itself fairly uniformly throughout its container.  However, the bread is porous, so this steam eventually has to escape; if it didn't, you'd end up with a very damp interior after cooldown from all the condensation.  If you measure, you'll also notice that the weight of a fully-baked bread is about 10% less than the original dough weight.  So the steam doesn't stick around indefinitely, but the continuous evaporation coupled with the temperature self-regulation (due to the boiling point) keeps the temperature relatively constant."
"Why are salt and pepper the ""classic"" dinner table seasoning?","Salt is perhaps the most basic and effective flavour enhancer, and so it's fairly obvious why we have it on our dinner tables. The popularity of pepper is down to the Romans, who were crazy about it. Thanks to the longevity of the Roman Empire, pepper was imported for hundreds of years, helping to establish it as the most popular spice, and keeping the price high. Bill Bryson reports in At Home that: When the Goths threatened to sack Rome in 408, the Romans bought them off with three thousand pounds of pepper."
Shelf life of spices,"Dried herbs really do only last around six months, certainly no longer than a year. They're generally easy to get in small quantities, though. Spices are trickier. They'll generally last rather longer, but the time will vary. If the spice is used for the colour and/or heat (e.g. turmeric, chilli) it will generally last much, much longer than one used for its smell and/or taste. Whole spices last much, much longer than pre-ground; I generally buy whole spices from asian stores, they sell them in much larger amounts for the same prices as supermarkets; and use a coffee mill to grind the right amount just before cooking (and keep a separate one for coffee!). If kept in the dark, in a dry, clean, airtight glass container, spices and dried herbs will certainly not become health hazards, and should not pick up unpleasant tastes or odours. The strong-tasting / strong-smelling ones will, however, lose taste and smell, eventually almost completely; since that is the whole point of using them, you might as well not bother once they're off."
Cooling coffee rapidly without dilution,"If done right, you can use a combination of ice and hot beverage that will ensure that the ice cubes have melted almost completely once you have reached an equilibrium, i.e. a cold drink. For my go-to ice tea, I use one full tray of ice cubes in my jug and pour the freshly brewed tea plus some sugar syrup and lemon right over it. In ratios, I need two parts of ice per three parts hot tea (by weigh) and end up with small ice cubes floating around. A little less ice would still give me a cool drink, but not ice cold, so depending on your preference, work from there. This ratio also helps when calculating increased coffee strength - use 60-70% more coffee in your brew if your plan to dilute by pouring over ice. If you are using coffee ice cubes (hint: great way to not throw away leftover coffee), use your preferred ratio. Time to do it:
Under seven minutes fror my iced tea (boil water, brew tea, add ice, simple syrup and lemon to the jug while the tea is steeping, pour tea over the ice, stir vigorously until the ice is melted, done), under two for iced coffee with my espresso machine (heat up machine, grind coffee, tamp, lock portafilter, add a cube or two of ice to cup, draw a double shot, done). The difference to freezing coffee ice cubes is that it requires preparation (and they do get stale after a while) while I always have generic plain ice cubes in the freezer. I will however admit that coffee ice cubes in cold milk also makes for a nice summer drink."
Is it true that moldy jam/pickles are good to eat if you mix the mold into the rest of the mixture?,"Unless there is good reason to assume it is not mold/bacterial colonization, but some other precipitate as explained in other answers: There is no scientific reason at all to assume that such a method is safe, certainly not for any random pickle made by any random recipe spoiled by any random white mold found in any random environment. While some very acidic pickling liquids might kill the mold or bacteria, it will not deactivate existing aflatoxins or bacterial toxins."
"Confused about cayenne pepper, chili powder and paprika","Cayenne pepper powder comes from the cayenne pepper.  It is hot/spicy, registering 30,000 to 50,000 Scoville units.   Chilli powder, depending where you live, can mean anything between pure powdered chilli pepper (location would determine the specific type of pepper) to a spice blend of chillies with cumin, oregano, and/or other spices.  Depending on the brand (or if you make it yourself) the heat and flavor can vary. Paprika is the dried and ground pepper capsicum annuum, the species of pepper that includes a wide variety of shapes and sizes, such as sweet bell pepper, jalapeno, New Mexico chili and cayenne.  It appears that the tomato pepper is the most commonly used variety for the production of paprika.  Of course, there are also smoked varieties (sweet, bittersweet, and hot). I would say that they are generally not interchangeable.  Just a little bit of cayenne, for example, will bring quite a bit of heat to your final dish.  Chili powder will bring more flavor/spices than paprika. It really depends on the final result you are looking for, but simple substitutions will result in very different outcomes."
What should I cover bread dough with while it's rising?,"The goal is to keep the surface of the bread from drying out. A wet towel works fine but plastic wrap is cheaper and easier than constantly cleaning wet towels. I have used both methods and haven't noticed a difference in the bread produced. In very dry climates, when I made bread with multiple rises I sometimes had to redampen the towel which was an added inconvenience. Lately I have been proofing large batches of bread in a large stock pot and just use the lid of the pot as the only cover."
Can my freezer be too cold?,"One possible consideration is that some frozen desserts (most notably ice creams and sorbets) can be very difficult to scoop if your freezer is too cold.  Optimal serving temperature for ice cream is between about 5 & 10°F (-15°C & -12°C);  colder freezers may result in difficult scooping and/or needing to leave the ice cream out to thaw. The proposed advantage of ""colder ice cubes"" is relatively small, because the vast majority of heat absorption by ice (in a drink, say) is due to it thawing.  To put some numbers on it, every gram of frozen ice absorbs about 2.1 joules of heat energy when it warms up by 1°C.  In contrast, that same gram of ice absorbs 335 joules of heat energy when it thaws into liquid water.  If you run the numbers, this means that ice at -22°C will only absorb 2-3% more heat from your drinks than ice at -18°C."
What's the secret for Chinese fried rice?,"There are really only a few secrets to good fried rice: If it all seems complicated, it really isn't. Use day old rice & give it lots of heat. Here are a couple of recipes that give further detail and have great explanations:"
Is it safe to boil water in a microwave?,"There is one very different issue to be kept in mind - water in a microwave can overheat and ""explode"" once it is disturbed. Another poster had exactly this problem a short while ago: Water exploded in Microwave So follow the usual precautions, e.g. putting a  wooden toothpick or a small, very clean stone (chemists have them in their labs) in your vessel. In a pinch, a spoon will do, but not all microwaves handle metal objects well. If you are worried that heating your water in a microwave might not be sufficient to kill all ""nasties"", remember that killing bacteria is a function of time and temperature, so you might feel safer if you not only bring your water to a boil, but continue boiling it for another minute or so. I would assume that this is mostly for your psychological benefit, but it certainly won't hurt. The temperature reached is identical for different heating devices as physics dictates the boiling point of water and it can't exceed that as long as it's liquid."
Is it safe to eat a cooked steak that (briefly) touched the plate that was holding the raw meat?,"If you're at all like me, you are reassured by hard numbers and measurables. This should help. In this situation one of the likely pathogens would be one of the Salmonella species. Salmonella is killed by temperatures in excess of 130 F (55 C). However, it's not an instant death. The time to kill Salmonella decreases exponentially as the temperature increases. The following table represents all the temperature and duration to kill 99.9999% of the most heat-resistant strain Salmonella senftenberg. This species is as much as 30x more heat resistant than a ""normal"" S. typhimurium. For any given temperature the proportion of bacteria killed is constant. 1/6th the time kills 90%, 1/3rd kills 99%, 1/2 kills 99.9% etc. USDA guidelines to kill Salmonella and E. Coli are as follows: So, needless to say, re-searing your steak at a typically high stove top temperature (at least 300 F [149 C]) for even a fraction of a second will result in utter devastation to whatever beastie population you may have picked up in recontaminating your meat. Chances are, if the steak came hot out of the pan, and you removed it from the plate quickly, the residual heat alone would be enough to kill it. The re-sear certainly doesn't hurt though. A good rule of thumb is to wash plates as you go. If this is not possible or convenient you should minimally remove the plate from your vicinity by putting it in the sink or dishwasher as soon as you have taken the food off of it."
What is the temperature range for food not to burn your mouth?,"I made myself some spicy chicken and macaroni soup, and put it in a bowl while it was still boiling. I put a thermometer in it as it cooled and I started to eat. I figured the soup was a good thing to test as I could take big bites that included liquid and solids that required chewing. I took a bite every minute or so and noted the temperature, and I repeated with boiling soup after it had reached ""too cool to enjoy"". At temperatures over 190F (87.8C) I couldn't put it in my mouth without giving it time to cool on the spoon and ""blowing on it"". At 180F (82.2C) I was still ""blowing on it"", but not in an unpleasant way for the first bites of soup. I would consider that to be the optimum serving temperature for this kind of soup (see quote concerning Chinese noodle soup below). At 170F (76.7C) I could put the bite straight into my mouth without pausing or ""blowing on it"" but it was still a bit hot, if I were eating without paying attention to the temperature, I would have ""blown on it"" At 160F (71.1C) I can and did eat comfortably. It was just pleasantly hot. At 150F (65.5C) it was still pleasantly hot. At 145F (62.7C) It was still quite warm, pleasant for soup. At 140F (60C) it was still fine, but not hot at all. At 135F (57.2C) it was still OK, but definitely getting on the cool side for soup. At 130F (54.4C) I was glad to be almost done. At 125F (51.7C) I was thinking seriously about the microwave. At 120F (48.9C) It was too cool to enjoy this particular soup. Obviously, different foods are going to have different optimal temperatures. I wouldn't want steak to have ever hit over 130F (45.4C). Also, consider that I have been cooking for 35 years. I am accustomed to sticking a spoon into something boiling on the stove in order to taste it. Consider too that there is (at least there is for me) something fun and vaguely comforting about soup that's still a bit too hot to eat. Some of us blow on it, noodles are often slurped for that reason: Slurping is de rigueur among the Chinese, for practical reasons. “It’s a way of introducing cool air into your mouth to cool off the noodles and the broth if it’s a noodle soup. … Chinese food is generally served hot, often served piping hot.” -Chow.com So, I don't think there is really such a thing as too hot to serve soup to ""consenting adults"". Other types of food are cooled or rested before serving for other reasons. Meat should always be rested to allow the fibers to relax so that the juices stay in the meat instead of running all over the plate. Cheesy things like pizza are easier to cut and serve after they have cooled a bit. Some things are just (subjectively) better after cooling (I prefer fried chicken barely warm, for instance). So, that's my $.02 on the subject, the answer of ""best temperature"" is largely subjective."
How do I butter popcorn without making it soggy?,"Another option is to make your popcorn in a pot using butter as the oil for the bottom. I find that if you toast the unpopped popcorn kernels in the butter, it gives a bit of a butter flavor to the entire pot -- less than if you were to put butter on the top, but plenty for me. "

How warm must dough be in order to rise?,"Optimal yeast growth happens at around 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit), but dough will rise at any room temperature. As the temp rises, the yeast becomes more active, which is why you'll sometimes see recipes call over overnight rests in the fridge, where activity slows or stops. Yeast dies at anything above 50 C (122 F). The important thing is knowing the temperature and, if you're really particular, the humidity in the air around your proof. This information is used for the sake of timing consistency, more than anything else."
Is panko just pretentious breadcrumbs?,"The big difference between panko and ""regular"" breadcrumbs is that panko is more like flakes, so it creates a much different texture when used as a breading. It's more similar to using cracker or cereal crumbs than regular bread in terms of shape, but the texture is more bread-like. For a picture comparison, and explanation of how panko is made, see UpperCrustents's how panko is made. The difference is lost when using it as a binder in something like meatballs ... similar to using flake salt vs. other shapes of salt.  So in some cases, using it might be considered pretentious.  (or just using whatever's on hand)."
Does freezing butter or margarine change the properties?,"Butter and margarine freeze perfectly.  I generally stock up during sales and thaw it as needed. You just have to make sure it's wrapped tightly in the foil, to prevent oxidation.  It'll keep at least 6 months, probably more if you don't have a self-defrosting freezer. Thawing butter does take quite a while, however.  I usually give a package a few days to thaw fully. If you need butter in a hurry, you can always put it in a Ziploc bag and fast thaw it a bowl under running running water.  Or, just soften it in the microwave. "
How to rest meat but not let it get too cold?,"Straight after it comes out of the pan it will usually be too hot to eat.  Regardless of resting or not, you can't fully taste things which are too hot, they need to come down to a comfortable temperature before you eat them. Some things you can do to stop the meat being too cold when you serve it:  Although I think you are worrying too much about nothing IMHO.  Even once rested the meat will still be at a good temperature, especially as you have not cut it yet and most of the heat will be retained in the middle of the meat."
Can mold grow in vinegar?,"Normal vinegar concentration (usually around 5% acetic acid) is too acidic to grow mold in the vinegar itself. Mold can sometimes grow on the bottle or on the surface of the vinegar. It isn't dangerous and can be wiped/skimmed off. What you are seeing is called the mother.  Vinegar is produce when acetobacter bacteria consume alcohol and produce acetic acid. The bacteria form a culture as they work. In the case of filtered vinegar, this culture is removed before bottling but letting a bottle of unpasteurized vinegar sit for a while will allow the culture to reform. Unfiltered vinegar often already has some of the mother present. It is harmless and can be used to start your own vinegar if you have stale wine sitting around."
Is it safe to eat raw eggs?,"Bearing in mind the salmonella statistics given above., yes it is safe to eat raw eggs so long as you are not very young, very old, or immunocompromised in some way--e.g. HIV, chemotherapy, leukemia, etc."
Slow cooking without a slow cooker,"Your best bet would be a dutch oven on a low to medium low heat in the oven. You could use a regular pot in the oven, but you'd need to stir it regularly (maybe every hour) to stop everything from sticking to the sides and burning."
Why would you place potatoes on salt when baking in the oven?,"This is what America's Test Kitchen (sorry, paywalled) has to say about it: Sometimes baked potatoes can use a flavor boost. And instead of light and fluffy, most often they are dense and crumbly. We found that baking the potatoes on a bed of salt remedied these problems. Moisture that escaped the potatoes during baking was trapped in the enclosed pan, absorbed by the salt, and eventually reabsorbed by the potatoes, making their skins tender and their flesh light and fluffy. All we needed to do was fine-tune the variables. Using a hot oven and uncovering the potatoes toward the end of cooking ensured dry, crisp skin. A 13 by 9-inch baking dish provided plenty of space so that we didn’t have to crowd the potatoes, and 2 1/2 cups of salt allowed us to thoroughly cover the bottom of the pan. I have found that salt roasting potatoes makes the skin crispy, without it getting hard. Like the above says, the potato itself seems fluffier. The way the salt seasons the potato is particularly nice as well. Incidentally, you can reuse the salt over and over again, so it's not as wasteful as it might seem when you first consider the method. You'll want to keep separate salt for things like this, though, since it picks up potato flakes and discolors a bit. EDIT The ATK method calls for covering the 9X13 baking dish (for 4 potatoes and 2 1/2 cups of salt) tightly with aluminum foil and roasting at 450F (232C) for 1 1/4 hours. Remove foil, brush potatoes with oil, raise oven temp to 500F (260C) and continue roasting for 10-20 minutes, until potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife and the skins are glossy."
What is the correct water to pasta ratio?,"This question was answered to some extent in another Pasta cooking question by Roux. This answer, which is basically just a link to a series of experiments by an MIT grad / Chef, dispels a number of myths about cooking pasta. For instance: Some really interesting stuff in the article that debunks quite a lot of kitchen lore about cooking pasta. I have tried this at home with great success.  So in answer to your specific question: "
What difference does oxygen content of tea water make?,"This blog article (citing numerous sources) claims that re-boiling water doesn't have any significant effect on tea taste. Here are some key points from it: Heating water above 50˚C already removes most of the oxygen from it, so neither once-boiled nor twice-boiled water contain significant amounts of oxygen. Triangle tests such as this one prove that dissolved oxygen by itself doesn't affect water taste. While oxygen could theoretically reduce tannin's concentration in tea, this effect is dwarfed by other factors, notably steeping time, water temperature, and water/tea ratio. All this is not to say that water is unimportant. Water is important. Alkalinity is important. Salt content is important. Minimal iron content is super important. Dissolved oxygen is not important.
  [...] For brewing tea, coffee, or any other hot beverage, dissolved gases are irrelevant."
Can one bake a cake with a cooked egg instead of a raw one?,"I would say no. The function of the egg in the cake is to go in raw, mix with the other stuff, and once the raw egg has penetrated and coated the other ingredients thoroughly, bind it all together with that bouncy, sticky solidified eggy property which comes into existence as the egg cooks.  Cooking the egg first all by itself, then adding to a cake would be like drying some crazy glue, then grinding up that hardened crust and putting the resulting powder between two things you want to stick together. The gluing action is all over when the glue has dried."
How can I tell if this is baking soda or powder?,"Baking powder contains starch, which is insoluble. Baking soda is completely soluble Take a small bowl, and put 1/8 tsp of the substance in the bottom. Add water. If the substance is bicarbonate of soda, the solution will be completely clear. If it is baking powder, a cloudy/powdery residue will remain. (You can also use excess vinegar which gives the same result, and fizzes in a pleasingly sciencey fashion...) "
Is there such a thing as a dish being bland from too many flavors?,"With your longer description, I can understand where you are coming from and why you don't like this version of the dishes (and also why somebody else might prefer them). But the term ""bland"" you chose is unfortunate, and is predestined to create misunderstandings. ""Bland"" is a word with a rather well-circumscribed meaning, and means that there is an absence of taste and flavor. To use your color analogy, ""bland"" would be applied most directly to something that is ecru colored, and, less fitting but still understood, to something that has its own color tone but so little pigment that it is still nearly white. For food, imagine maybe a pudding made with starch and water, nothing else, that would be a quintessential experience of bland food. The experience you describe doesn't have a unique term, and the descriptive ones I can think of are non-technical. The most specific one I can come up with is ""mingled flavors"", although this one doesn't strongly evoke that the speaker disapproves of the extent of mingling. You can choose whatever you like and best reflects your own subjective experience. Some examples would be to call it ""conflicting"", ""chaotic"" or ""overwhelming"" taste combinations. Or, if you prefer to continue the metaphors from other senses, you can use ""cacaphonous taste"" or, more diplomatically, ""lack of contrast"". I would also like to mention that your experience here does not validate hers, she is also just as right as you are, and finding a term will not lead to an agreement between you as to what the perfect dish should be. Every one of you has a set point for enjoyable taste, expects to find it in the dish, and is dissatisfied when the dish misses that point. What overwhelms your experience is well-rounded for her, and what is nicely focused to you is boringly one-dimensional for her. In keeping with your color comparison, insisting that only one of the two positions is ""right"" would be like insisting that painting like Franz Marc is ""right"" and painting like Caspar David Friedrich is ""wrong"", or the other way round."
Can I make popcorn with any corn?,"The answer it seems is - no, you can't just use any variety of corn. It seems that you need in particular a hard shell around the kernel that is not present in sweetcorn varieties. I also suspect that it is harder to make than one might imagine, you need a specific percentage of water in the kernel to get it to pop - this is why you can't store unpopped popcorn in the open and once opened needs to be used within a few months, as the water will evaporate and eventually the percentage will become too low to effectively pop."
Why would I buy a rice cooker?,I come from a culture where rice is our staple and I have a rice cooker. Here are some of the advantages from my perspective:
Is butter ever the same after having been melted?,"Butter may look totally amorphous, but there's actually a fair amount of structure in the fat, in particular fat crystals that make it firmer. Melting it disrupts all that structure, and it can't regain it just by resolidifying, so the structure of previously melted butter really is different. You might notice that this is similar to chocolate: if you take smooth, snappy tempered chocolate, melt it, and let it resolidify, the texture will often be grainy, soft, or even crumbly. That's also thanks to fat crystals, in that case in the cocoa butter. To back up a bit, let's look at how butter is made. Churning is the most well-known step, but there's more: Aging (heating, cooling, and storing the cream). The cream is heated and cooled, with resting periods at various temperatures, which encourages formation of certain kinds of fat crystals. (The details of this process vary; for example different temperatures can be used depending on the hardness of the milkfat.) Churning. This damages the fat globules, causing them to release fat, which forms much of the mass of the butter and lets it collect into grains. Working/kneading. After draining off the buttermilk, the grains are kneaded together. This evens out small amounts of buttermilk trapped in the grains, and fat crystals can also come together into larger networks. So the final butter actually has three forms of fat in it: fat crystals, free fat, and fat globules. The fat crystals make it firmer, and the free fat and globules make it softer. This also explains why butter isn't all the same texture. For example, from On Food and Cooking: Feeds rich in polyunsaturated fats, especially fresh pasturage, produce softer butters; hay and grain harder ones. The butter maker also influences consistency by the rate and degree of cooling to which he subjects the cream during the aging period, and by how extensively he works the new butter. These conditions control the relative proportions of firming crystalline fat and softening globular and free fat. So when you melt and resolidify butter, it's not just a simple solid to liquid to solid thing. You're disrupting the crystals, and potentially even rupturing a few more fat globules. That means a couple things: There's likely more free fat and less crystals, which explains why previously melted butter can be much softer than the original butter. The crystals that do remain or reform won't have the same structure as the original ones, since you didn't follow the same heating/cooling/storing regimen. That explains the graininess you noticed. It's possible that working/kneading the butter might even that back out to some extent. The exact texture of your previously melted butter will probably vary, depending on how hot you melted it and how fast you cooled it afterwards."
Dissolving cocoa powder in milk,"You could do it the same way that you make chocolate syrup: Heat some water to boiling, dissovle the cocoa and sweetener and reduce down till it reaches the consistancy that you desire.  This will result in a syrup that will mix in to cold or hot drinks with no problem and can also be used to top ice cream and or other desserts."
"What is this green, bulbous, leafy vegetable?","As was mentioned, this is a kohlrabi. I felt more explanation should be given based on the fascinating nature of this plant. Kohlrabi is one of the handful of cultivars of brassica oleracea. Others include:  cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, savoy, kohlrabi, and gai lan. Brassica Oleracea (Wikipedia) Brassica oleracea has been cultivated in many different parts of the world to appear almost like entirely unique plants. However, each of the listed plants are, in fact, the same species with slightly varying traits. Kohlrabi, for example, has been bred to have lateral growth in the meristem while broccoli has been bred to have a large, flowering head. Kohlrabi can be eaten either cooked or raw. It's often used in salads and slaws, and can be interchanged with collard greens or kale."
What is the proper way to dispose of a kitchen knife?,"I agree that donating the knife to a thrift shop is a good idea. But it pains me to think of putting tape on a knife blade. Someone's going to have to clean it off, and that risks injuring them. Instead, find a piece of cardboard that's longer than the blade of the knife, and more than twice the depth of the blade with an inch (~3 cm) or more to spare. Fold the cardboard in half, so it's now roughly larger than the size of the blade, and then place the blade so the back of the knife is against the fold. (You can do it the other way, but you'll risk dulling the knife: cutting paper isn't good for knives.) Finally, tape it down. You want to make sure it's well compressed, so the knife is being held in by friction.  You could always sandwich something rubbery in there with it to provide more friction. (This is how I used to transport my knives when moving between apartments.) Another alternative, if you're really disposing of it, and don't mind dulling the blade, is to poke it into a piece of corrugated cardboard.  Just find a piece that's longer and wider than the blade, set it on the edge of your counter, put a hand on top to hold it steady, and then slowly push the blade in."
How can 100% peanut butter have more protein than 100% peanuts,"There's definitely some rounding going on because the peanut butter has 100.1g of nutrients per 100g of product.  This isn't enough to explain the discrepancy.  Adding up the nutrients on the roasted peanuts gives 95.4g.  I think we can assume the other 4.6% is water.  So perhaps more water has been driven off the peanut butter. What I think is more likely (though could be additional) is that there's significantly less fat in the peanut butter (48.1% vs 51.7%).  While this could be down to different varieties of peanut, I suspect some fat is removed in the processing, perhaps to avoid an oil slick on the surface.   Most likely of all is just different source data. Different peanuts may have been used in the calculations -- whether that is consistent with the actual ingredients used is another matter.  In fact if you look at nutrition information for raw peanuts online, you'll get a range of values.  There's nothing special about peanuts, the same is true for bananas.  I'm sure if you look at the scientific literature on any foodstuff, you'll find a range of values published, reflecting natural variation as well as measurement variabilility -- this will then propagate to the values published to the consumer."
How do Chinese restaurants tenderize their meat?,"One technique, but not the only, is velveting. Here the meat is tenderized in an egg-white/cornstarch mixture for 20+ minutes, then cooked briefly (a minute) in oil or simmering water with a small amount of oil prior to using in stir fries.  I've never velveted in straight oil but water/oil definitely gives the chicken that smoothness that Chinese Restaurants obtain and the shorter stir fry cooking time makes it much more tender.  Super thin slicing (you'll need to cut the meat semi-frozen to get such thin slices), plus cutting across the grain also lead to tenderness. "
Is it normal to see flames inside my self-cleaning oven?,"Smoke is normal in an electric oven, but flames are definitely not. In order to start a fire, you either need a spark, or you need to heat something beyond its autoignition temperature (AKA kindling point).  You might have had a short - or you might actually be using a gas oven with spark ignition - but I'm guessing your issue was the latter. Cooking oil or grease being heated beyond its autoignition point is one of the most common causes of kitchen fires (grease fires).  Supposedly, some oils have autoignition points as low as 550° F (or 288° C), though I'm not sure which oils those are.  Olive oil would be my guess as the lowest, but pepperoni grease could very well have ignited at self-cleaning temperatures (which, as you noticed, go up to nearly 1000° F). Fortunately for you, all modern ovens have a mechanical interlock which prevents them from being opened during a self-cleaning cycle.  If you'd opened it, you would have made the problem a lot worse by (a) supplying the fire with abundant oxygen, and (b) drawing all the hot air and flames out of the oven and into your kitchen, quite possibly setting your whole home on fire.  Heat wants to move to where it's cold; that's why you keep your doors and windows closed in the winter. There are a multitude of oven cleaners available for self-cleaning ovens - you are supposed to use these before you run a self-cleaning cycle.  Yes, I know it's odd, but ""self-cleaning"" doesn't really actually mean that it cleans itself, it just gives you a little extra help.  You need to try to clear out all the grease and big chunks of food first using one of these cleaners, then run the self-cleaning cycle to deal with anything you might have missed."
When is a cooking oil not appropriate to substitute for another?,"Actually, there are really only a few oils you can substitute for each other, at least without any significant side effects. The oils which generally are used interchangeably are peanut oil, canola/rapeseed oil, and sunflower oil.  These oils have similar smoke points, don't impart any really noticeable flavour, and tend to be used primarily for high-heat cooking (pan-frying, deep-frying), so if you're paranoid about saturated fat for instance, you can substitute sunflower oil for peanut oil.  Corn oil is in the same group, but I rarely see that used anymore.  You can also use the ""light"" olive oil, but that will change the flavour of the dish.  I believe walnut oil has similar properties, but it's considerably harder to find. But keep in mind that oils are used for far more than frying.  Many have highly-specialized uses: Extra virgin olive oil is most commonly used in sauces and salad dressings (""oil and vinegar"" almost always means olive oil, there really is no substitute); Chili oil is really more of a condiment than a cooking oil.  Even if you could cook with it, the result would be inedible due to the heat. Toasted sesame oil is used as a flavourings in Asian dishes.  It's useless as a cooking oil (and cooking with it would be a terrible waste).  Regular sesame oil, on the other hand, is often bought in a refined form and is generally used as a cooking oil. There are a lot of other more esoteric types of oil such as palm oil and coconut oil, which you really don't want to use unless you know what you're doing (you can ruin the flavour). I could go on, but for now I'll refer you to the Types of oils and their characteristics as a starting point.  Cooking oils really aren't freely interchangeable in all situations; even if you've accounted for smoke point and flavour, sometimes a significantly different fat content (i.e. grapeseed oil which is mostly polyunsaturated vs. canola oil which is mostly monounsaturated) can seriously mess up a delicate recipe. It's better to be asking which oils you can substitute in a specific situation than to assume everything goes and list the ""exceptional"" circumstances."
How is rare steak made safe to eat?,"First, 145 °F (63 °C) and higher is the temperature for a well done steak. So, with the addition of carry-over cooking, your results don't surprise me.  If you are shooting for rare, cook to an internal temperature of 125 °F (52 °C), and let your steak rest 10 minutes before slicing. While the USDA correctly and necessarily provides temperature guidelines, in fact the reduction of pathogens follows a logarithmic curve and includes the variables of temperature and time. That means, in general, that longer times at lower temperatures will reduce pathogens. This understanding is the basis of sous vide cooking, for example. Additionally, we generally assume that any potential pathogens are only present on the surface of whole muscle cuts.  So, again, in general, achieving the target temperature on the surface eliminates the threat. Finally, the quality and handling of the raw product is critical.  It is important that you have fresh products, kept refrigerated or frozen until use, and handled by people who are practicing safe handling procedures (washed hands or gloves, ...)."
What is the best flour to use for pizza dough?,"The best is the Italian Tipo 00 If you can't find that flour locally, there are sellers online.

"My tea bags are expired, can I still use them?","Tea bags will be fine for at least a year in the pantry, but even long after that, they're still safe to consume.  They just might change colour or flavour. If your tea has an expiration date then it's just for best quality, not safety.  I've personally found tea bags sitting at the back of the pantry that were more than 3 years old, the packaging had even started to fade, and the tea was still fine.  I just had to steep it for a little longer."
"Do pan ""pores"" exist, what are they, and what are their effects?","I work for a carbon steel cookware producer in China and just like Athanasius, I too have become interested in the question of ""Do pan “pores” exist, what are they, and what are their effects?"" I have also watched the RouxBe video about making a stainless steel pan more non-stick through pre-heating. To summarize the main point, it says to heat the pan until the peppercorns (the pores of the steel) stop opening and closing. The right time to add the oil is when the pan is hot enough and the peppercorns have closed, thus creating a flat steel surface on which to add the ingredients for cooking.
Although I think RouxBe is without doubt an excellent resource for learning about cooking, I was a bit doubtful about the peppercorns theory, because just like Athanesius, it appears to contradict the whole concept behind seasoning a pan. I have briefly discussed this with my boss, somebody who is very knowledgable about carbon steel (he has run a factory in it for nearly 25 years). He says that the first theory is wrong, and that the pores do not close, they in fact open up (as pointed out in the second theory for seasoning). But actually it is in fact these 'pores' opening up at a hotter temperature which does make the pan more non-stick. When the 'pores' of the steel open up they create more space for the cooking oil to seep into for a better non-stick. In this way the food particulces cannot get stuck into the irregulaties (pores) of the steel and the high heat dries the surface of the steel and cooks the proteins quickly, thus reducing the chance of them 'setting' themselves on and into the steel. This, along with the Leidenfrost effect, whereby any moisture on the ingredients will turn to water vapour and create a barrier between the proteins and the steel, is why a hotter pan has a better non-stick effect."
What is the purpose of oiling a wooden chopping board?,"The oil is not actually doing anything to protect the wood - the idea that it does so is a very widespread myth. This is the conclusion of the guy who wrote the book on wood finishing, and I can confirm it from personal experience. You can continue using it for cosmetic reasons, I am personally partial to the look given by flax oil - although there are people who prefer the opposite, because cuts are much less noticeable on unoiled wood. To get real protection on an wooden item, you have to apply a layer that actually seals the wood. The substances which do this well are shellac, nitro lacquers, acrylic finishes and alkydic finishes. While you could use a safe-in-trace-amounts finish on a chopping board, the mechanical action of a knife will soon damage such a layer to a point where it becomes useless. Most people are just not interested in refinishing their chopping board a couple of times per week. As for the source of the myth: Long before good finishes were discovered, people tried protecting wood. Since it was known that wood is most damaged by moisture, they used all kinds of water-repelling substances, such as different oils and waxes, sometimes also natural resins. The protection afforded by those is minimal, but it was all they had - and to the naked eye, it does look like a great protection, since oiled wood has an entirely different appearance, and water droplets pearl on it instead of visibly wetting it. This is a concept that is known in science as ""face validity"" - you look at an approach and your intuition tells you that it must be working, so you are likely to conclude that it works. Scientists try to prove that methods work independently of their face validity, but cooks and woodworkers rarely do so :) And since there is a tradition, which convincingly does something, people continue applying it and promoting it."
Does meat need to be washed before preparation?,"It's neither necessary nor a particularly good idea; it does little to remove bacteria from the surface of the meat (which you're about to cook, remember) and runs the risk of spraying/dripping bacteria all over the kitchen. The FSIS has an article on it here: Washing raw poultry, beef, pork, lamb, or veal before cooking it is not recommended. Bacteria in raw meat and poultry juices can be spread to other foods, utensils, and surfaces. The only exception would be something like vac-packed, wet-aged meat where you need to remove the salt, but that's a matter of preference. I have never washed a piece of meat in my life and I'm still here!"
Why doesn't Bailey's go bad?,"Here is a quote from the company that makes the registered trademark Baileys Irish Cream: Baileys® is the only cream liqueur that guarantees its taste for 2 years from the day it was made, opened or unopened, stored in the in the fridge or not when stored away from direct sunlight at a temperature range of 0-25 degrees centigrade. One of the keys to achieving this 2 year shelf-life is in our patented process of blending of fresh Irish cream with the spirits and the whiskey without the use of preservatives. The alcohol acts as a natural preservative for the product. Under normal conditions of storage Baileys has a shelf-life of 30 months. If you are concerned about a bottle of Baileys® please check the best consumed before date on the bottle - all bottles now carry a best before date. This number is located on the bottom left hand side of the back label. Example : Code 11 20XY would mean that we guarantee the product would taste perfect until that date (XY is the year 2 years from the date of manufacture) (source). The alcohol content is the sole preservative listed."
"What are the benefits of using a dedicated rice cooker, rather than just cooking rice in a pot?","Yes there are benefits! This is one of my most used pieces of kitchen equipments. Here is a list of benefits for a quality rice cooker: When I cook rice on my stove, even at the lowest of heats, I get a thin layer of rice that has overcooked stuck to the bottom of the pot. For the record I have the Zojirushi 5-1/2 cup induction rice cooker. Best thing ever."
"What does ""bring to a simmer"" mean?","Personally, I would argue that 2 and 3 are actually the same, and they are your answer. If you heat a pan of water you'll notice the bubbles forming before the water is actually boiling, hence the talk of between not bubbling and full on roiling. Also, when you're making your soup, it isn't pure water, so the boiling temp will not be a perfect 100 degrees C in any case. So, I would say, that simmering is when you keep it just under a full boil. Watch what you're cooking, there should be gentle movement, but not a full roiling pan of whatever it is you're cooking. To get something simmering away, you need to bring up to a full boil, then reduce the heat until you're getting movement, but not full bubbling. "
Why should a stock be simmered and not boiled?,"Well there's a few things. First, higher temperatures mean more volatile aroma and flavour compounds will be released, leaving a flatter-tasting stock. Second, boiling means more motion within the liquid, which makes it harder to skim off the protein scum which forms on the surface while a stock is cooking. In addition, some of the scum will just become reincorporated into the stock via a process similar to emulsion. Third, boiling induces faster breakdown of proteins and other particulate matter, leaving you with a cloudier end product. This is of course of very little concern for stocks which will end up incorporated into (opaque) soups or sauces. Of the three, only the first is of any real concern to home cooks. The other two issues aren't a huge deal at the restaurant level (modulo need for clarity in consomme etc), particularly if the restaurant uses Superbags or algae filtration for clarifying stocks. "
How long will uncooked chicken keep in the fridge?,"Sorry, USDA recommends 1-2 days of refrigerated storage (40°F). Beyond that and you're tempting fate a bit. You're gonna have to eat some humble pie for your wife on this one (just don't ask here for the recipe). Source"
Best meat replacements for a vegetarian/vegan?,"Pardon my rampant vegerianism, but the trick is not to substitue meat at all. I generally get my nutrition from other sources, without using meat substitutes at all.
Unless I really feel like a certain recipe that I used to like back in my meat-eating days. Use beans, lentils and whole grains for protein.
Use nuts, seeds and avocadoes (or any other fatty fruits and vegetables) for B-vitamins.
Use beans (again) and leafy greens for iron and calcium. So, it turns out my answer is a bit Zen.  Sorry."
Secret to takeaway curry,"If the English curry is similar to this, you are missing CREAM! "
"Why would plant-based cookie dough packaging say ""Do not consume raw dough""?","I was surprised at how difficult it was to find the answer, but I eventually found articles by the FDA and CDC. Consumers should be aware that there are additional risks associated
with the consumption of raw dough, such as particularly harmful
strains of E. coli in a product like flour. Flour is derived from a grain that comes directly from the field and
typically is not treated to kill bacteria[...] So if an animal heeds
the call of nature in the field, bacteria from the animal waste could
contaminate the grain, which is then harvested and milled into flour. Common “kill steps” applied during food preparation and/or processing
(so-called because they kill bacteria that cause infections) include
boiling, baking, roasting, microwaving, and frying. But with raw
dough, no kill step has been used. [...] Common symptoms for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli are diarrhea (often bloody) and abdominal cramps, although most people recover within a week. But some illnesses last longer and can be more severe, resulting in a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). That's pretty gross. But then this number of people reportedly infected is so small that I'm surprised at the prevalence of the warnings (such as on packaging): In recent years (2016 and 2019), two outbreaks of E. coli infections
linked to raw flour made more than 80 people sick. Flour and baking
mixes that contain flour have long shelf lives, so it’s a good idea to
check your pantry to see if you have any flour or baking mixes that
have been recalled in recent years."
How do I stop my fire alarm from going off when I cook?,"Many modern smoke/fire detectors have the ability to temporarily disable or decrease the sensitivity of the alarm for a short period of time, usually 15 or 20 minutes. At the end of the time period it returns to full sensitivity. You may want to look into replacing your smoke detector with one of these."
Tips for a small kitchen,"Do what professional chefs do: clean constantly.   Put all of your ingredients out in an organized place.  Use them.  Put them away.  Clean the station.   If you can, prepare.  Put stuff that is prepped back in the fridge until you need it. Try to use the same few tools for the whole meal--cutlery, mixing bowls, cutting board.  Quickly rinse and re-use rather than multiplying utensils. Aim for dishes that can be cooked in stages in the same pot rather than needing multiple pots or saucepans. Try out dishes with fewer ingredients.  Great chefs can do wonders with 3, 4, or 5.  Maybe you don't need more complicated? Put non-essentials away. Move the kettle and toaster to a shelf until you're done.  Use the sink as a repository for anything you're not using but might still need. Use another room, too.  A nearby table could become your staging area, a place to put ingredients that are prepped, finished, or waiting to be used (so your work area isn't cluttered with them). Just some ideas."
Why is putting hot milk in a thermos not recommended?,"It depends on the design.  Some can't be washed properly, and milky liquids are much harder to clean off by rinsing than water or most water-based drinks My genuine Thermos brand flask wouldn't be a problem because all the surfaces that come into contact with the food are accessible. My previous small cheap flask had a pouring system in the lid that meant the contents passed through a non-washable chamber (clipped together in a way that wasn't designed to be opened).  I eventually forced it open to find it full of hot chocolate residue. My flask is mainly used for kayaking, it has to be made up beforehand as fiddling about with powders when on a riverbank in the pouring rain doesn't tend to get you a hot drink when you need it.  At that point it would have gone in the bin even if I hadn't just broken it. A point mentioned in the comments is that the instructions for one particular Thermos say This product must NOT be used for keeping milk products or baby food warm or cool, to avoid the possibility of bacterial growth.  This is the only reference to warm contents in these instructions; the word used elsewhere is hot (excluding washing-up instructions). Warm implies attempting to maintain temperatures in the danger zone. (for completeness as comments don't always last) "
Why do my mini pizzas have microwave trays?,"The piece of cardboard is a microwave browning element. Ordinarily, most of the heating energy in a microwave is absorbed by water in the food. The result is similar to steaming. The material on the cardboard is designed to absorb microwave radiation and convert it into heat, attaining a higher temperature than boiling water would reach, to allow the bottom of the pizza to crisp up a little and keep it from getting soggy."
What's the numbering system for spaghetti and does it matter?,"They are just a ""product number"", and it may vary for the same kind of pasta from a manufacturer to another."
Can I learn to like wine?,"There's no point drinking wine and not enjoying it. The point of wine with food is that, if you enjoy the wine and enjoy the food, you'll enjoy both together even more. But if you don't enjoy the wine, you'll enjoy the food less if you force yourself to drink wine with it. Is there anything you do like about wine? If not, I suggest you ignore it for the time being. If you're curious, you'll come back to it in your own time, whenever you're ready. If you're not, it doesn't matter: there's nothing wrong with not liking wine. If there is something you like about wine, for example, the aroma or some component of the taste, I suggest you keep trying it but don't force yourself. Taste it every now and again and, if you still don't like it, wait until you want to try it again.  This is what I did with whisky.  As a teenager / young adult, I really liked the smell of whisky but didn't like the taste – in hindsight, it was probably the alcohol content that was the problem.  Every now and again I'd have a taste from my father's glass or from somebody I was drinking with at a bar.  For a long time, I didn't like it but I still liked the aroma so I kept trying a couple of times a year. Eventually, I started drinking it. A few things to bear in mind about wine. Avoid cheap wine and don't waste your money on expensive wine that you won't appreciate. Low price isn't a guarantee of low quality and high price isn't a guarantee of high quality but it's worth spending, say, twice the price of the cheapest bottle if you're at the supermarket. That's likely to lift you into wines that you're disliking because you dislike wine, rather than because they're bad. Red wine, poured straight from the bottle often tastes rather harsh. Open the bottle half an hour or so before you want to drink it and let it sit in the glass for a couple of minutes before you drink. Wines (especially red) with just one or two grape varieties named on the bottle usually have simpler, less challenging tastes. Sweeter white wines will probably be more appealing to you than drier ones. Try something like a sauvignon blanc or unoaked chardonnay, rather than, say, a pinot gris/pinot grigio. Riesling can be anywhere from super-sweet to mouth-puckeringly dry depending on what the winemaker did. Supermarkets in the UK sell quarter-bottles of decent-but-not-amazing wine. That's a good way to try lots of different styles without having to spend a lot of money or feeling that you're wasting a whole bottle if you don't like it. This suggestion is heresy but... consider chilling red wine. Chilling tends to make harsher flavours less noticeable. If you find you like it chilled, try chilling it less. Ask a wine merchant. Specialist wine merchants love to talk about wine. Don't be embarrassed to walk into one of their stores and say, ""Hi. I like the idea of wine but I've never found a wine I like drinking."" Their eyes will light up because this is a challenge to them to use their skills to make a customer really happy. If you buy a couple of bottles on their recommendations, you'll be their favourite customer of the day, I guarantee. Doubly so if you go back a week later after liking what you bought. Go for it!"
What can you surmise about coffee beans that have oil on them at the time of purchase?,"Coffee beans have a natural oil in them. Often beans that have been roasted longer will have more visible oil on the surface. Not really an indicator of quality, though, but a longer roast will be darker, have a stronger flavor, and (paradoxically to some) less caffeine. (At least, this is what I learned when slinging Cappuccinos at a Canadian coffee chain during my college years a long time ago. Someone correct me if I'm mistaken.)"
What should I use for old recipes that call for 'buttermilk'?,"Given the variabilities in ""buttermilk"" from place to place and time to time, you should get sufficiently equivalent results by substituting modern cultured buttermilk. That's the job it was designed to do. Recipes from the early 19th century and before are notoriously vague. They were generally written more as reminders of something you already knew through experience, rather than detailed instructions for creating it from scratch. Quantities and temperatures were much harder to control, and so recipes basically assumed you'd recognize a dough with enough liquid or a sufficiently-roasted quail. (One of my favorite instructions from an 18th century cookbook: ""Cook until it is enough"".) Given those wide margins, you should find that simply using cultured buttermilk will make the recipe work. It's true that it will lack the tiny bits of butter present in ""true"" buttermilk, but there isn't enough to have a radical effect on the result. The really important parts (dairy protein, water, acidity) are present, in about the same quantities they would be in true buttermilk. You'd certainly notice the difference if you were to just drink it straight. If that's what you want, you're just going to have to find somebody who makes it, or do it yourself. I've found it's often available at the kinds of farmers markets that insist on local producers. Personally, I find it nasty, but YMMV. So if you're trying to revive an old recipe, just start with commercial buttermilk. You're going to have to tweak it from there anyway. If it needs richness, add butter, but probably only a teaspoon per cup. "
Why do shrimp / lobster / crab turn pink or red when cooking?,"Crustaceans like shrimp, lobsters, crabs and crayfish have a pigment called astaxanthin in their shells.  Astaxanthin belongs to the terpines class of chemicals of which the carotenoid ¹ class is a subdivision and, in a marine environment, gets produced by an algae that is subsequently consumed by crustaceans (and other animals like  salmon, red trout, red sea bream and flamingos ² ) As Astaxanthin absorbs blue light, it will appear as its opposing additive colour: a deep red.  The more this deep red is diluted, it will subsequently become red, orange or yellow in colour.  While the crustaceans are alive, astaxanthin lies wrapped in the tight embrace of a protein called crustacyanin. The protein holds the pigment so tight, in fact, that it’s flattened and its light-absorption properties are changed. The astaxanthin-crustacyanin complex then winds up giving off a blue-green color. ³ This can be observed if you have aggressive live lobsters you want to cook: just put them in the sink full of water with a glass of white wine added for a few minutes and they will get drunk instantly as they've never had alcohol in their lives relax and the blue colouring can then be clearly seen at the fronds of their carapace. The astaxanthin-crustacyanin complex gets: separated when a crab or lobster is cooked. Crustacyanin is not heat-stable, so introducing it to a boiling pot of water or a grill causes it to relax its bonds with astaxanthin, unravel and let the pigment’s true bold red color shine through. ³ Note ¹: Carrots have given carotenoid its name
Note ²: Eating minuscule shrimp containing this carotenoid is what turns flamingos pink: pink flamingos will be more well-fed than pale flamingos...

Why stretch and fold vs traditional kneading of bread dough?,"The purpose of all kneading techniques is the same: as @rumtscho wrote, to stretch and align strands of gluten. The traditional kneading method is to fold the mass of dough on itself, press it together with the palm of the hand, turn, and repeat. With very high hydration doughs this is impossible because the dough will hopelessly adhere to the hands. The technique is, therefore, modified to reduce hand contact with the dough as much as possible. A dough scraper is used to gather and fold the dough which is laid over on itself instead of being pressed. The result is the same as normal kneading but only the fingertips come in contact with the dough. After just a few turns the gluten sheets will align and the dough will still be tender but much less sticky. As for why it seems more effective I can only conjecture. Gluten forms in the presence of water. Higher hydration doughs allow for faster gluten development. It is not that the folding is more effective but that kneading very wet doughs progresses faster."
Is there anything I can add to homemade bread to preserve it?,"My whole wheat bread takes 4x to go off than my white bread. Even a mixture of 50% whole wheat flour will make it last longer. But that will only help if the problem is the bread getting hard too soon. That can also be prevented by keeping it in a plastic bag. You'll get the mold before the bread goes stale. If you're keeping the bread in a plastic bag, try paper bags. To solve the mold problem, the traditional way is to add some acidity. For example, you can add a sourdough starter. If you don't like the taste of sourdough, a poolish starter should also help. The bacteria it grows will prevent the mold growing. I know it's not what you're asking, but freezing will also help. When you bake more bread than you eat, freeze it wrapped in a plastic bag and thaw it overnight and you will get a good, fresh bread."
How does a Miracle Thaw work?,"reference: http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/conductive-heat-transfer-d_428.html Let's take a moment to look at the heat transfer equation. Looking at it, we can see the ways to get more efficient heat transfer The way these thawers work should now be easy to understand. (1) They are made of a material that has a very high thermal conductivity constant, like copper. The higher a material's thermal conductivity, the faster it can equalize it's temperature with that of the surrounding material. Things that touch each other want to be the same temperature. When you put an ice cube on a sheet of room temperature copper, they are very different temperatures. But as soon as they touch, they want to be the same temperature, so heat transfer begins. Heat ""flows"" from the copper to the ice, increasing the temperature of the ice (melting it), and decreasing the temperature of the copper. Heat also flows throughout the copper itself, meaning that even the parts of the copper that are far away from the ice are losing heat. With the copper losing heat, it quickly falls out of temperature equilibrium with the surrounding air. But the air and copper also want to be the same temperature, and so heat from the air ""flows"" into the copper, bringing it back closer to room temperature, which in turn allows the copper to heat up the ice some more.... But of course there aren't distinct steps to this process: all of these heat transfers happen simultaneously and continuously. And as long as the air has some circulation, you can consider it to be an unlimited supply of room temperature heat. The top of the copper plate is probably flat, to increase the amount of surface area in contact with the ice. The bottom of the copper plate, however, is probably ribbed or finned, to increase the surface area with the surrounding air, but without (2) creating more thickness! We could also address (3) and heat the copper electrically, above room temperature, but then we run the risk of heating part of the food to that temperature as well. The benefit of using a passive copper heatsink is that the temperature will never rise above room temperature!"
What is the white dust on red grapes?,"This coating, which wipes right off and is indeed harmless, is called the ""bloom"" of the grape or sometime the ""blush"". As described here, (the wiki for Fermentation in winemaking), it contains trace amounts of natural yeast, though thought to be the result of ambient yeast rather than the result of growth process proper. Here we find a more thorough answer, It’s mostly harmless wax, says Kay Bogart, a winemaker who works in
  outreach for the University of California at Davis’s viticulture
  program. The grape plant produces it to protect the berries from
  moisture loss. It’s also often just plain old dust, adds Jim LaMar, a
  professor of wine sensory evaluation at California State University,
  Fresno. Until recently, winemakers believed the white stuff was
  yeasts, responsible for wine fermentation. Now they believe such
  yeasts are airborne. In any case, that white stuff isn’t pesticide
  residue. Which is not to say that there isn’t pesticide residue on the
  grape, so wash it anyway before you pop it into your mouth. In the book Caravaggio: A Life Sacred and Profane by Andrew Graham-Dixon, we find of Roman mythology the following statement regarding Bacchus, the ancient god of wine and intoxication, The bloom on the grapes, which dusts them with a layer of whiteness
  and dulls the reflected light caught in their opalescent skins, is
  echoed by the dry and whitish lips of the god himself. "
Why are there spikes growing out of my ice tray?,"They're often called ice spikes. Ten years ago these things were pretty mysterious, but now Wikipedia even has a video of them growing out of ice cube trays in a freezer. Basically, the ice surface freezes first, which slightly pressurizes the water underneath. That water breaks through the crust, and continues to flow, and freeze to equalize pressure within the cooling cube. Temperature conditions have to be just right for it to happen, so you don't see them all the time."
How long is it safe to marinate meat?,"I can't see any reason for the marinating itself to make any difference. If it's safe to leave the (un-marinated) meat in the same conditions for the same length of time, then it's safe to marinate it for that long. Five days in the refrigerator is definitely stretching it for chicken - usually no more than a few days is recommended, and that's assuming it was fresh when you bought it (not a day before the sell-by date).  Even if it's safe, it's not going to be very good.  I've accidentally left raw chicken in the refrigerator and forgotten about it before, and it started to smell ""off"" after about 4 days.  I hate to say it, but I wouldn't use it at this point. As for the steak, you're probably okay, because you only have surface bacteria, but I would cook it well and right away.  Again, most cooks I know will recommend no more than a few days in the fridge. P.S. I've heard people say that weak acids such as lime juice ""preserve"" the meat, but never from a reliable source; even if it worked, every marinade is different and it would be nearly impossible to predict the exact amount of time it preserves for.  You have no idea how much bacteria existed at the outset, and even if the marinade somehow helped to inhibit growth of new bacteria, the ""spoiled-ness"" of raw meat doesn't come from the bacteria itself but from the toxins they leave behind.  It's not a requirement for the bacteria to multiply in order for the food to spoil, if enough existed in the first place. Unless somebody has it on good authority that marinating makes any significant difference, I refuse to put any stock in that bit of folk wisdom and recommend that others be equally skeptical."
What is the difference between sea salt and regular table salt?,"I can say, as a salt snob, that sea salt is a far more flavorful product. I can't even use regular table salt anymore.  Sea salt is salt formed from evaporated sea water, is not iodized, and because it doesn't come from salt mines requires very little processing. Some people will say that because it's ""natural"", sea salt must be better for you. The mayo clinic seems to disagree: http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sea-salt/AN01142"
"Is there a Scoville scale for ""coldness"" (e.g. mint)?","There are thermal sensation scales, and they are applied in food research too, although their primary use tends to be focused on clothing or environment. They tend to be categorical rather than ratio scales, and don't depend on the presence of a single compound the way scoville does. Despite checking several likely sources (a book on neurogastronomy, a thesis on measuring the perception of food - mostly focused on texture, but also discussing thermoreceptors) I didn't find a mention of a specific culinary scale that measures menthol concentration.  Instead of a specialized scale, industrial users of menthol products seem to simply use the relative menthol content, such as selling an essential oil that with ""60% menthol"". And the general public doesn't seem to have created a cult around menthol content the way it has done for capsaicine content - personally, I know more people who care for the scoville number of the chilli they are eating than people who can tell the difference between spearmint and apple mint.  I suspect that, while creating such a scale is possible, nobody has bothered to. And even if some food scientist did do it, it doesn't seem to have caught on, especially outside of professional circles. "
Can I make a neverending Soup in an instantpot?,"I've actually tried it. It didn't work very well for me, but it might work better for you. The problem is, cookers like the Instant Pot are designed for quick pressure cooking first and foremost. While they have a ""slow cook"" or ""keep warm"" setting, the heating element is still driven at high power, just at a lower duty cycle. Over time, that encourages solids to settle to the bottom and dehydrate and burn. (In contrast, a slow cooker operates at a lower power and heats to a lower temperature.) However, the motion of the truck might actually help you out here by agitating the soup. If the soup doesn't have anything starchy (like beans or potatoes) that might be sufficient to prevent burning."
What are the different applications for differently shaped wooden spoons?,"Great question! Adding to the others: 4 and 5 appear to me home-made modifications of standard Chinese bamboo spatulas in order to use them for different purposes.   4 is probably intended to be a wooden fork, which would be useful for tossing pasta (together with another wooden fork or spatula).  However, the homemade slotting is too narrow, and the ""tines"" to wide, to be really useful.  You'd want something more like this:  5 is, as rumtscho mentioned, a folding spoon for dough.  This one seems to be improvised out of a spatula, though; the more common shapes of folding spoons are like either of the below:   I think I might disagree with rumtscho about spoon #1 though.  I use wooden spoons all the time for cooking and mixing, especially in non-stick pans.  If what she's saying, though is that particular wooden spoon is not very well shaped, then I agree with her.  The bowl of the spoon is too shallow, and you'd want a round handle rather than a flat one."
"How long do you let a steak from the fridge come up to temperature, and when do you salt it?","In this thread, Lorenzo notes that steaks may end up raw in the center if you only leave 'em out for 10-15 minutes to come up to temperature. I recommend 30 mins, but it will probably vary on what room temperature actually is for you. From Weber's Way To Grill, which recommends salting right when you take them out of the fridge, here's Mr. Purviance's take on why you should consider salting early: It's true that salt draws moisture toward itself, but over the course of 20 to 30 minutes that's a good thing, because the salt begins to dissolve into that little bit of moisture. When the steak hits the hot grate... [you] create a delicious crust. Any moisture you might lose is well worth the flavor of that crust."

How can I tell the difference between unmarked sugar and stevia?,"Don't throw it away.  Worst case you use up the mystery sweetener on yourself, and use a new pack of Stevia for your wife and anything you share. That's what I recommend if you're not convinced by my solution or don't have sensitive kitchen scales. At room temperature, sucrose (normal sugar) is very soluble in water: about 200 g of sugar will dissolve in 100 g of water. It's harder to get a figure for the solubility of Stevia as it's not a single compound but a mixture of related compounds.  However various patents claim ""high solubility"" stevia preparations of around 30 g per 100 g water, or around 1/7 as much.   This is enough of a difference to test: If (with plenty of stirring but no heat) the mystery sweetener will dissolve in an equal mass (weight) of water, it's sugar. If not it's stevia.  This only works if you weigh it.  You can't do this by volume. You can always compare to known sugar; a comparison to know stevia is less useful unless it's identical, and brands evolve. The conclusion holds for fructose too (that's even more soluble), but glucose, which you're unlikely to have as pure powder at home, needs slightly more than its own weight of water to dissolve it. Pure stevia is much sweeter than sugar, and when concentrated may have an aftertaste. It's also sold blended. When blended with other sweeteners the solubility test probably still applies (certainly in the case of erythritol, find in Truvia). Sometimes stevia is bulked out to make it a more direct substitute for sugar. The bulking agents may well be rather soluble and a source of carbohydrates (maltodextrin is sometimes used). "
What is this plant I saw for sale at a Romanian farmer's market?,"That actually are tips of trees, probably spruce1. It’s this year’s new growth and a very seasonal product. The tips are harvested when the are (about) fully grown, but still light green and soft.  I can’t say for sure what the local customers would use them for, but one of the common uses in my area of the world is to make “honey”, i.e. a syrup by either layering the tips with sugar and let the sugar draw out the aromatic compounds or alternatively make a “tea” that’s them preserved with plenty of sugar and boiled down to a syrup. It’s both a honey substitute (it does resemble fir honey) and a folk medicine against colds and coughing. Other extracts are made with alcohol instead (or in combination with) sugar to create a liqueur, again served both for medical and culinary purposes. 1  This is not a botanical id. Various members of the genus Picea (spruce) and Abies (fir) are used, usually whatever grows locally and has a pleasant taste. "
Why do Brussels sprouts only taste good when cut?,"I think you're on to something with regards to cut pieces cooking more evenly than whole sprouts. But I also think you might be seeing causation where you should just be seeing correlation. The ""classic"" way to cook Brussels sprouts is to leave them whole and steam them. That results in minimal flavor development. When overcooked, chemicals are produced with bitter, garlicky, and/or sulfurous overtones. Similar chemicals are produced when long-cooking many other other green vegetables, and are likely what you associated with overcooked fennel. Since no other ""interesting"" tastes are really produced by steaming, those tastes take center stage, no matter how much butter you put on the sprouts. Cooking the sprouts at high heat, as restaurants generally do these days, results in caramelization and Maillard browning. Those taste good, and dominate the flavor profile, covering up some of the unpleasant tastes which steaming (but also other cooking methods) produce. Getting a good sear when shallow-frying Brussels sprouts requires cutting them, so there's an association between how they're cut and how they're cooked. There's another aspect to ""modern"" Brussels sprouts. In the 1990s, agricultural botanists in the Netherlands bred Brussels sprouts with much lower bitterness than classic cultivars; over time, these new sprouts took over the market. So cooking processes aside, Brussels sprouts today are less bitter than the ones from your childhood. (For that matter: as you age, bitter tastes become less unpleasant.) As I mentioned, you may be on to something with regards to cut pieces cooking more quickly, not giving the outside a chance to overcook, but I suspect what you're primarily seeing is just the result of modern cooking methods compared to the frankly unpleasant results of classic ""steam 'em for a while"" treatment."
Why does diluted half & half not make a substitute for whole milk?,"The difference between whole milk (or any milk, really) and half-and-half is one of fat content, not overall concentration. Half-and-half gets its name from being a 50/50 blend of milk and cream, which normally separate because the less dense fats concentrated in cream float naturally to the top of the mostly-water milk. However, milk also contains a number of other proteins, sugars, etc. that give it flavor. When you dilute half-and-half with plain water, you're diluting the fat content (potentially down to a similar range as contained in whole milk) but you're also diluting all those other flavorful components. You wind up with something that has the right fat level but not enough of anything else, and which tastes somewhat flat and flabby by comparison with proper milk."
How should I keep the vegetables from flying off the board when I cut them?,"Use a sharp knife, dull knives don't slice, they split the same way an axe splits logs and that will generate that sideways force that throws carrot bits. Also learn to practice your slicing and chopping technique. You shouldn't be dropping the blade straight down like a axe or guillotine. You should be moving the blade in a orbital movement, so that you are slicing in a forward direction while the blade is on its way down to and through the carrot. By slicing properly much less of your veg will have that energy buildup because they won't ""snap"" apart but will be sliced apart neatly. Search YouTube for Basic Knife Skills and watch several videos, then practice, and start slowly. You will get faster with time and time only, don't rush it or you'll get sloppy and may hurt yourself."
How to chill beer quickly?,"Use a salted ice-water bath. The water increases the contact and heat dissipation, and adding salt allows the temperature to go below freezing. "
What are some good substitutes for salt for those on low sodium diets?,"There is no substitute for salt. Sorry. It has effects on the tastebuds and the body that cannot be replicated. However! They can be approached to a degree that most people will find interchangeable. Acids can mimic the flavour-enhancing qualities of salt in a big way. The more acid you have in a dish, the less salt you will need. Beware of going too far, of course, as too much acid is just unpleasant and will need salt to counterbalance. Heat--as in capsaicin, chili peppers--can produce much the same effect. Echoing papin's information above; NA and K (sodium and potassium) exist in balance in the body. Too far in one direction and you have a heart attack (too much K), too much in the other and (if memory serves; I could be wrong) you essentially drown (or is it edema? I can't remember). If avoiding sodium is related to a health concern, please speak to your primary healthcare provider before adjusting your diet in this way."
Will Cinnamon ever dissolve in a cocktail?,"Cinnamon is the bark of a tree. It is either sold as rolled strips of bark (=cinnamon sticks) or ground.  It will not dissolve, neither in water nor in alcohol.  What you want to do is basically the same as was done commercially with the vanilla extract you are already using:  Extract the taste, then discard the bark itself. Alcohol is a good choice for extracting volatile aromatics. You could try and soak a few cinnamon sticks or a few tablespoons of ground cinnamon in a ""neutral"" alcohol like vodka or - if you are using it exclusively for your signature drink - use the brandy. This process might take from a few days to a few weeks, so nothing you can do ""on the spur of the moment"".  Another good carrier for the cinnamon taste would be water. You can simmer a few cinnamon sticks in water, then sieve. This is the same method that is used for mulled wine or mulled cider. To extend the shelf life of the ""cinnamon water"", you might considering turning it into simple syrup by boiling it with an equal amount of sugar. Whether you use water or alcohol is a question of personal taste and planned other uses. The shelf life of an alcohol based extract might be longer, but with a sufficiently high sugar content, clean handling and refrigeration the syrup will last long, too. Time is a factor: The syrup can be ready and cooled in an hour or so, whereas the alcohol will take significantly more time. Both methods work for vanilla, too - you could even make a ""instant mix"" for your drink. Be warned, though: Filtering ground cinnamon from a liquid can be quite a hassle. It tends to clog coffe filters, but is too fine to be held back by a sieve. If you decide to use ground cinnamon because that's what you have at hand, consider letting it settle at the bottom of your container and carefully decanting the liquid from top. A coffe filter or a cloth-lined sieve can catch stray particles. You should get much better results by using whole or coarsely crushed cinnamon sticks. There has been an ongoing discussion on what kind of cinnamon to use, so a short wrap-up here: Cinnamon is derived from a group of plants, which vary in their properties and compounds. Especially coumarin, a substance also found in tonka bean, woodruff and other plants, has been widely discussed for its toxicity and is regulated in the EU.  From a culinary point, the cheaper cassia, which contains more bark and is usually sold ground or in pieces, is often considered inferior in taste to the true cinnamon, which often comes in sticks.  I will not venture a statement here, neither on health nor culinary claims. 
I am sure every reader of this post is capable of making an informed decision."
Why isn't it safe to eat raw chicken?,"You can have raw chicken in restaurants in Japan - it's delicious.  Depending on where you live there may be better or worse food safety standards, but there is nothing poisonous about raw chicken itself. By the way, sushi is a dish with vinegary rice.  The raw-meat dish is Sashimi. A picture of chicken sashimi:  You will note that in this photo the chicken is actually not raw but quite rare. The exterior of the chicken flesh is actually seared and cooked through several millimeters. "
How should I prepare Risotto,"One of my favorite recipes is Giada De Laurentis' Wild Mushroom with Peas. It's rather simple, but amazingly delicious.  The most common flubs when making a risotto are overcooking or dumping in all the liquid at once. I always use the wooden spoon test to determine when the risotto is finished. First, stir often! Periodically drag your spoon down the center of the pan as to part the risotto. If the path the spoon makes closes quickly then it isn't finished yet. If the part stays open, then you've overcooked it. Ideally it slowly oozes back together. You're looking for two important things in a perfect risotto:"
How do I make paneer firm and chewy like in the restaurant?,"If you are using UHT milk, that is your answer right there. It won't make proper ricotta or mozzarella, so I'm not surprised it won't make good paneer either. Something about the heat treatment makes it so that it will only produce grainy, tiny curds. I made this mistake myself once, in my excitement to try my new cheesemaking kit. Here is some reference info, including pictures, from cheesemaking.com."
How do cooks prepare risotto in a restaurant?,"It's actually hard to hold when it's almost all the way cooked - it'll start getting gluey if you let it cool off, but could start scorching on the bottom if it's not stirred, and get too runny if you keep adding stock. Mario Batali said that risotto isn't finicky in the middle - so you can cook it part way, cool it down (I think he said he spread it on sheet pans to cool quickly), then you can add hot stock and cook it from that point, so you've already got a 10 minute head start. I've also been to a restaurant where it was only served on the hour and half-hour."
Good ways to store coffee?,"You definitely want to keep beans whole as long as possible. Ideally, grind just the amount you need right before you brew the coffee. Keep the whole beans airtight, and freezing probably isn't necessary unless you buy a month of beans in advance."
What is the difference between pizza sauce and spaghetti sauce?,"Red pizza sauce is often (but not always) two things: Thicker.  Thinner sauce will tend to run in the oven and also steam the pizza crust as it cooks - if loaded with toppings, otherwise thin is fine.  Depending on the crust, the heat of the oven, the toppings above sauce, and how watery it is, this may not be needed.  If you've just got some crushed tomatoes and a few bits of cheese in a super hot oven - the sauce should be fine without reducing beforehand.  If you've loaded up a bucket of sauce and a pound of cheese, precook and reduce the sauce. It's often simpler.  Many pasta dishes like spaghetti highlight the sauce and hours of simmering happen for the sauce to bring it to perfection.  They're all about the sauce.  Pizza is really about the crust and what highlights it.  Many of the best pizzas are simply topped.  Crushed san marzano tomatoes (sometimes) reduced with a hint of salt is often all I do, and franky, it's enough. I'm not talking about the jarred varieties here, but what you might cook at home.  Jars in the store, the main difference is just how thick it is."
Can you candy salt?,"Thank you, all of you, who contributed by answers or comments to the thinking that leads now to this answer. I listened to all of you, and it worked. I can't describe how tickled I am. Your suggestions opened my mind to thinking that this could still ""work"" even if it didn't quite go as I had hoped. As it turned out, the end product exceeded my hopes. This is my soon-to-be-world-famous Dulce de Leche ice cream. Two nights ago I froze a batch with my new caramelized salt. It wasn't my intention to create a swirl-in, but once I had the candy, I had to try it that way.  Just before snapping the picture, I sprinkled some of the candy on top. Then I took a bite. HOLY COW! The candy hits the tongue as just sweet. Then it morphs. In less than a second you start to get the bitter notes of dark caramel, then BAM it hits with salt. It ends salty and sweet, with the bitterness just a memory. By then, you've already got your next bite ready, as in, ""What the hell just happened?"" Paired with the very one-note sweetness of the Dulce de Leche, the multitudinous flavor bursts of this little crunch are phenomenal.  Are you reading into this that I'm a little excited right about now? The candy that was swirled into the ice cream did NOT make the surrounding ice cream salty. It just swirled in, but kept its own character, albeit stickier and less (but still) crunchy. It's a great contrast to the creamy Dulce de Leche. I discussed this small triumph in chat before posting this answer. Logophobe immediately jumped to using the ""dust"" (I'll show you that in a bit) to rim margarita glasses. The ""margaritas"" would be made with this. Oh hell yeah. How about as a pork rub? Hell, HELL yeah! The possibilities for this stuff are endless.  I hope by now you're intrigued enough that you want your own caramelized salt to play with. Caramelized Salt I basically stuck with my original plan, but I didn't use Maldon; I used inexpensive large crystal (rock) sea salt, like you might put into a grinder. First, I just made a dry caramel as per David Lebovitz using 1/2 cup (100g) of plain granulated sugar. I took his advice and brought the caramel to a darker point (closer to burnt) than I might have otherwise. 

(Mr. Lebovitz' photos, not mine) At just the very last possible second, I stirred in 100g of rock salt and poured that onto a greased sheet pan. After it cooled, it looked like this:  I broke off a tiny bit and tasted it. Too salty. I could barely discern any caramel at all. Hmmph. Well, I didn't expect this to go that easily. What to do, what to do? What if I break this up into chunks and do it all over again? That might work... So I broke it up and put it into a heavy Ziploc. Then I alarmed my neighbor (he called in panic) by beating the crap out of it with the smooth side of a meat mallet.  Then I made the caramel again, this time I used 3/4 cup (150g) of sugar. At the last possible second I stirred in my salty sugar chunks and poured the mix onto the same greased sheet pan. I was hoping that this time would maintain the clumpy appearance of the last. It didn't; it immediately homogenized into a fairly smooth mass.  At this point I didn't have great hopes, but I figured I'd see if I could make anything useful out of this. I called my neighbor to warn him, then I proceeded again to beat the crap out of it.  At this point I tasted it and kind of liked it, but the sizes of the pieces were all over the map. I didn't like that. I also didn't like the way it looked; the dust marred the glassy appearance of the larger shards. So I grabbed three sieves of varying fineness and proceeded to work the candy through the holes. Anything that went through the fine sieve I called ""fairy dust"". By spending some time working out the ""dust"" I was left with larger, cleaner shards. I worked those through a pasta colander, then a big pasta colander. 
 The first time around, anything too big to make it through the the big holes of the big colander got put back in a Ziploc and beat up again. That gave me more ""fairy dust"" and more medium shards. The second time around, the shards that wouldn't go through were small enough that they might make a nice garnish - 2 or 3 pieces on top of the ice cream. So I kept them. It was a good call, they're fun. Swirled into the ice cream, I used the dust and medium shards. The dust dissolves, but it stays to itself. It doesn't make the ice cream next to it salty. The medium shards maintain their integrity, they don't completely dissolve, they provide some crunch. The big chunks look awesome as a garnish and since they stay in the mouth long enough to savor, you can really pick up their complexity. Pretty amazing stuff from 2 inexpensive ingredients. I didn't get the encapsulation effect I was looking for, but in the end, I couldn't be happier with how this turned out.  Next time I'm going to try just doing it in one step using regular kosher salt. It might work, but I'm guessing that it won't be the same. We'll see. "
Fish and cheese: An unbreakable rule?,"Disagree with the umami analysis from @Carmi, even if it was a good attempt.  You have some basic facts wrong though. But you are sort of on the right track.  Baked fish in Italy is not strong in flavor. It's delicate and calls for the following: fresh lemon.  That's it. Maybe some fresh parsley.  Usually cooked with no herbs and served with no sauce.  The fish should be extremely fresh and appreciated for it's delicate flavor.  Something like parmigiano would easily overpower the taste of the fresh fish and by putting it on fish you are telling the cook ""this is fish gone bad and I need to cover the taste with something"". Or if it was served that way, maybe better to avoid it because what is the cook trying to hide?  While there I never encountered a fish dish served with cheese. Being a curious foodie and having lived in Italy for 5 years, I can also add the following: The health angle from @Walter I think has a lot of validity in general.  Italians often complain of their liver hurting after eating especially 'heavy' meals. Heavy meaning something very specific in Italian: difficult to digest.  So a fresh salad with too much raw garlic could be considered heavy because garlic sometimes causes indigestion.  A huge chunk of parmigiano is not considered heavy because parmigiano is very digestable.  My guess is some of the rules come out of the particulars of the Italian digestive system.  Much like you will not find many Asians joining me when I chug my glass of milk."
What are some good ways to treat frozen vegetables such that they behave like fresh vegetables when stir frying them?,"The first thing is to do is thaw them properly before you cook them, half frozen vegetables will cool your pan too much. I often thaw frozen vegetables by soaking them in hot tap water, this is pretty quick and doesn't scorch them like microwaving them might. This might take a bit more time than microwaving but it's a much better result.  You will never get the same result as fresh using frozen vegetables, this is because freezing changes the structure. Water expands when it freezes, rupturing cell walls, which impacts some vegetables more than others. Peas, freeze very well, carrots pretty well. Green beans, broccoli, cauliflower freeze okay, they come out a bit more limp than fresh. Thin leafy vegetables like spinach don't freeze well at all, they come out very limp, almost as if they're cooked already. This isn't a deal-breaker, just something to be aware of. On the rare occasions I use frozen spinach I will squeeze the hell out of it after thawing as it's water-logged.  Cooking order will be important to sauteing them successfully. Water is the enemy of getting color on your vegetables, so you want to make sure they are relatively dry before you add them. Hardest vegetables go in first, like carrots, then medium ones like beans and broccoli, last you add the leaves because they take the shortest to cook and will give off a lot of water no matter how well you wrung them. You want the vegetables to be mostly cooked by the time you put the spinach in as the water will put an end to any browning. Peas go in last, they only need to be warmed through. "
Salad packaged with raw meat: is it safe?,"What you're looking at is called (in the US) ""cross contamination"". You have a food generally considered ""unsafe"" (beef) that is coming into contact with a food generally considered ""safe"" (salad greens). This contact makes the greens ""unsafe"" to consume raw. Cross-contamination is the transfer of harmful bacteria to food from other foods, cutting boards, utensils, etc., if they are not handled properly. This is especially true when handling raw meat, poultry, and seafood, so keep these foods and their juices away from already cooked or ready-to-eat foods and fresh produce. The rule in the US is to always keep these products away from each other so that the ""safe"" foods stay safe. The only way to make the greens safe to eat is to cook them, thereby killing off the bacteria that may have been transferred to them in the juices of the meat."
Why does the second bowl of popcorn pop better in the microwave? And how can I capitalize on that?,"You might need to experiment a bit, but my guess is your bowl [or lid] isn't perfectly transparent to microwaves & is itself heating. In effect that's 'wasting' the microwaves. Second time the bowl is hotter, giving the popcorn a better chance. You could test with just half an inch of water in the bottom of the bowl. If the rim gets hotter than the water, or even hot at all, reject the bowl for microwave use.
Personally, I won't use any bowl proven to absorb microwaves itself. It makes the process unpredictable… apart from the risk of trying to pick a bowl out that you expect to be cold at the top, to find it's skin-flayingly hot. Try something plastic & heat-resistant instead, or just a paper bag, like supermarket microwave popcorn. Comments below seem to be intent on inventing more & more weird & wacky ways to try avoid this simple two-minute elimination test, or alternatively propose ridiculous science-free theories.
I'm determined not to respond to any more of these ;)"
What are the names and purposes of these six kitchen knives?,"The first two are types of sabers.  They’re used for butchering or cutting down large hunks of meat. The next three are chef’s knives of different sizes. The last one is a slicer, used for when you want thin slices of cooked meat."
Are limes and lime juice more acidic than lemons and lemon juice?,"I'm culling a lot of information from one of my favorite cocktail books for this one. Yes, limes have a slightly higher acid content (on average) than lemons do - about 6% for limes, compared to 4.5% for lemons.  More importantly for their flavor, lemons have about 2% total sugar, while limes have somewhere between 0.5% and 0.75%.  Sugar/sweetness has quite a suppressive effect on the perception of sourness, so lemon juice will most likely taste a bit less sour than lime. The composition of acids in the two also differ.  The acid in lemon juice is almost entirely citric acid, which also makes up most of the acid in limes.  However, limes include about 10% each of succinic acid and malic acid which have an effect on their flavor.  Malic acid is most recognizable as the sour flavor from tart apples and rhubarb.  About succinic acid, Wikipedia states: It lends to fermented beverages such as wine and beer a common taste that is a combination of saltiness, bitterness and acidity. Personally, I think the difference is perceptible in beverages, but less so in cooking. Culturally, lime would most certainly be the traditional choice for Latin American cuisine.  Lime is much more readily available in Central and South America (three of the biggest producers in the world are located there).  How the difference in acid content would contribute to the browning of avocados is more questionable. EDIT: Here's an interesting paper, suggesting that ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is more effective at preventing avocado browning than citric acid.  Which is an interesting wrinkle, because lemons contain significantly more vitamin C than limes do... EDIT 2: And along comes Jolenealaska, with an experiment that seems to undermine the entire assumption that acid reduces browning of avocado at all!  Seems like the real secret may just be keeping your avocados either uncut, or refrigerated and tightly wrapped if you have to cut them ahead of service."
Why does my glaze soak into my doughnuts?,"Okay, I did some more thorough searching and found Beki Cook's donut frosting recipe. Apparently my mistake was that I was letting them (the doughnuts) cool off, and according to the article:  Glaze is the easiest way to sugar-up a donut. But there are a few things you need to remember. First and foremost... only glaze donuts when they're warm. If you do it when they've cooled the glaze just soaks in and get goopy."
"Botulism, Garlic, Cold pressed Olive oil and mason jars","As a health inspector for over 20 years, I am astounded by the lack of awareness that food safety controls are based on science and not on individual inspectors' personal fears and bad moods. Botulism control is based on some of the following facts: botulinum spores are commonly found in soil and on vegetable surfaces, botulinum grows in low or no oxygen envt., botulism has high virulence. (Virulence is a technical term for the fact that a high number of botulism victims end up dead (like Listeriosus of raw milk fame), in contrast to other food borne illnesses like Staph or Campyllobacter.) When considering the fact that botulinum grows slowly, and food borne illnesses whack people more often with weak immune systems, such as the elderly, the ill, and the very young, the food producer may have just been lucky that the product never created a problem, or the very real option that a problem was never narrowed down to the product.  As to the argument that old time recipes have been made for centuries, as in this case, (I am a bit of a foodie and Italian), the big difference is that many products were never made for mass production and or to stick around on shelves for long periods of time, and if so, any data, let alone food safety data, is unavailable for historic food products. In fact, the link between bacteria and illness was scientifically proven by Koch as late as the late 1800's. Another fact is that the CDC's data shows that outbreaks over the last 50 years are fewer, involve much higher number of victims and are more often associated with mass production and distribution of food.  My health dept. receives notices of food recalls at least once a week.  In the case of botulism and fresh garlic in oil, it's considered so risky that acidification is required nationwide.  In California, there is a state lab that specializes in evaluating botulism safety for commercial operations. (It's funded by taxes to keep cost to businesses low and is considered a public service.) I would recommend that producers contact their State health depts. and work with them to identify any and all options available for the canning and sale of any low acid food - including acidification, using dried ingredients, temperature control, flash heating (called a ""kill step""). The majority of us inspectors truly focus on how to sell food safely and do not approach their jobs as stopping people from making a living. And surprise surprise we don't always think alike, just don't get me started. However, I'll finish with the following consideration of the implication that ""life has it's many risks"" argument that we inspectors hear often.  When it comes to death, the public, the politicians and the members of responsible industry itself does not tolerate ""a little death."" "
Can meat spoil outside the fridge if it's baked into bread as a filling?,"There are two differences between your buns and a tin can. First, your buns were heated to a core temperature of under 100°C. Yes, your oven was probably set way higher, but the water content in your filling prevents it from getting hotter than boiling water. Commercial canning is done in the vicinity of 120-130°C, which is possible because the cans are cooked under pressure. So unlike in a can, most pathogens were destroyed, but not necessarily all of them. For human consumption, that’s perfectly fine as long as the remaining ones don’t get the time-temperature combo to regrow. Second, a bread dough may be dense (although the aim is usually something different), but by no means airtight. Interestingly, wrapping meat in dense dough was used as preservation method in medieval times - the “ancestor” of today’s pork pies and pastries. But while the hard flour crust (not intended to be eaten originally) did form a protective layer and usually extended the shelf life more or less, it was by no means food safe judged by modern standards - although some pies were stored for months. But your fluffy buns are truly not a protective layer. Which means you should refrigerate your buns, but also that you get to enjoy the whole dish."
Why use a kettle to heat water?,"Bear in mind that I'm using an electric kettle, rather than a stove-top one. First, the advantage of a kettle is that it is quite efficient, and turns itself off once the water is boiling.
This as opposed to the microwave, which only stops after a set time, rather than relying on the condition of the water.  Second, a microwave can cause water to superheat, particularly in a ceramic or glass container. This means that there is a certain risk that the water will ""jump out"" at you once you add something to it or put a spoon in. Additionally, most kettles have more power than the average microwave, so the kettle is probably faster to boil water."
Will spoiled food always make you sick?,"What most people don't get when it comes to food safety: Spoiled food has a chance of making you sick.  When food is visibly spoiled, it has large bacterial colonies growing in it. This means that it has been exposed to conditions which were promoting bacterial growth. Anything which was present on your food will have grown, unless outcompeted by something else.  The bacteria which make food gross are rarely the ones which make you sick. But if they had the chance to grow, the real pathogens had a chance to grow too. If they were present, then they grew, and you will consume them, together with whatever waste products their colony produced.  Assuming that there were infectious bacteria on your food, you will ingest them. From there on, it depends on a ton of factors whether you will get sick or not - the amount you ate, the acidity of your stomach contents, the state of your immune system. The last does not mean ""you'll only get sick if you're immunocompromised"" - it is like being around a person with the flu, even if your immune system is intact, you can still catch it.  There are pathogens which cannot infect you, but simply produce toxins. Botulinum is the poster child for these, but I think B. cereus also works through a toxin. In this case, eating the food poisons you. Depending on the type and amount of toxin ingested, as well as the current state of your body again (mostly liver function), the symptoms can run the entire spectrum from ""so weak you don't notice them"" to ""you die despite being correctly diagnosed and treated"".  Then there are a few more exotic possibilities, for example Hep C cannot cause liver cancer alone, but it does so (sometimes) in the presence of a type of toxin produced by moulds. But this is not actually considered foodborne illness any more, even though it's possible that eating mouldy food was the trigger. It falls outside of the scope of food safety, as the fault cannot be pinned on a specific dish you ate. Nevertheless, it's one more reason to not eat spoiled food.  There is also the possibility that your spoiled food has no pathogens at all, and the spoilage microbes outcompeted all the bad guys, and then of course nothing happens.  So, to sum it up: if you eat spoiled food, there are four possible outcomes:  There is no way to predict which one will occur. Actually, these outcomes are possible with any food you eat, including safe food, but eating unsafe food increases the probability of the first outcomes a lot, and eating spoiled food increases it even more.

Should I buy steel or ceramic knives?,"In general, ceramic knives are great for what they do, but too fragile to do everything.   They can shatter if dropped on a hard surface, and can easily get get notched on bone.  I use my ceramics exclusively for vegetables for that reason.   If you're strapped for funds, you really only need to by one expensive knife (a steel chef's knife or santoku), and one cheap one (a serrated knife for cutting bread).  After that, picking up knife skills is more important and will make your cooking better than any investment in more knives."
How do we escape the cycle of bad college eating?,"I'm in the same situation as you are, I'm a college student on a budget. What you need to do is convince yourself that it's better to cook your own food. I accomplish this by tracking how much I spend on food at the grocery store each week, and comparing it to buying fast food. I've been doing this since Summer of 2010 and trust me, cooking yourself is a lot cheaper. Per day, I spend about the same that I would on one meal (pizza, whatever), only that includes breakfast, dinner, snacks, etc. If you track it yourself, you will quickly find it's more expensive to eat out, although it is convenient.  I also make a list of meals I would like for the week (I shop a week at a time), and use this list when purchasing and stick to it. You'll find that when you follow recipes, you can make a lot of substitutions for what you have on hand instead of having to buy another ingredient.  To avoid losing ingredients, just stick them in the freezer! Meat, vegetables, whatever you're buying, most of it can be frozen. And frozen stuff lasts for weeks (minimum). Leftovers can be frozen too. When whole chickens are on sale for example, I buy them up (2-3 at a time) and freeze them until needed.  The worst thing I find is (as you've probably seen) the time commitment. It takes time, but you if you cook more you get better at it.  I also find that the less ""processed"" food is, the cheaper it is. For example, buy whole chicken or split chicken breasts instead of boneless/skinless/etc. and cut it up yourself. Look for the ""reduced price"" meats when their sell-by date is close to expiring, and freeze them. They are fine. Buy potatoes, canned vegetables, and avoid meals that come in a box! They seem cheap but they are more expensive than what you can do yourself.  ... and finally, the real motivation (for me at least) is that I got sick of the options available around campus. If you make your own food, you're not limited by a menu and eventually it will taste better!"
Why do Chinese grocers advise cutting and discarding flowers in Chinese vegetables?,"I would say there may be more insects in the flowers, but that is not a big deal.  The ones not removed by normal washing or possibly a saltwater rinse will mostly at least be tiny ones attracted by the flowers and will not affect quality and taste.  Some would even callously call it extra protein.  IMO, the real issue with these types of plants having flowers is that the plant is bolted.  Most if not all of these vegetables are best quality when harvested before they bloom.  Any bolting would normally mean the plant was beyond prime condition when harvested or was grown under stress, too hot, too cold, too crowded, not enough water are typical causes of early bolting.  The entire plant may be fine, but sometimes will be tougher or bitter and the flowers and stem on many are bitter and tough and not what you are looking for.  They often will have a very different taste than the rest of the plant.  In some cases, you might like that taste, but in most it is not what you were expecting.  For instance, in Pak Choi I have had it with flowering.  Not only was the stem to the flowers stringy, it had a latex like with liquid which was off-putting.  The flower itself had a strong mustard taste which was not at all like the leaf and stem which is what was intended."
"What is ""layering flavors""? What does it accomplish and how do I do it?","It is mostly a fancy way of saying that they are combining flavors. There are no solid, physical layers involved anywhere. Still, there is a reason why the ""layering"" metaphor is more apt than simply saying ""combining"". Flavor is mostly about aroma, which leads to two aspects of ""layering"". First, aroma is not perceived all at once when you bite off. You first notice the most volatile smell notes when the food enters your mouth, go through a kind of ""middle"" and only at the end, while swallowing, you notice the ""heavier"" flavor. So, when seasoning, you can work with food such that you don't mix up too many flavors in one of the three aroma ""layers"", but also to make sure that there is something noticeable in each of the three. Second, people are accustomed to some flavors being present as a metaphorical ""background"" taste. It can happen that, if the expected aroma is absent, you can add all the spices you want, and the eater will still experience it as underseasoned. This is what is happening in the example you cited: the ""base layer"" are the onion and garlic, which are probably the standard for the dish, and then you can take that dish in different directions by your choice of additional herbs and spices. In that case, you can see the metaphor as akin to clothing - once you have a basic shirt on, you can always make the outfit nicer by layering a scarf, jacket or jewelry on top of it. All in all, it is not ""all about layering flavors"". It is just an expression which helps some cooks go about creating harmonious flavor combinations. If it works for you, use it. If not, learn to think about your seasoning in other terms."
What happens when you mix whiskey and water?,"Whisk(e)y has some crazy chemistry going on inside of it, due to the complex interactions between water, alcohols, oils, esters and other compounds of various complexity. The profile of these chemicals will vary between different whiskey/whisky styles, but the overall chemistry is similar. Adding water, or serving on the rocks, has a number of simple effects, such as diluting the ethanol a bit (ethanol anesthetizes your taste buds a bit), and cooling it (making your taste buds slightly less sensitive to certain flavors), but the fascinating part is what happens to the oily flavor compounds during dilution. Oily hydrocarbons are somewhat soluble in high-proof whiskey. There are long-chain esters and short-chain esters of many varieties. As you add water, the whiskey becomes more polar, and the long-chain esters become supersaturated and start to precipitate in the form of micelles, microscopic ""droplets"" of esters that have clumped together. In some liquors like absinthe or ouzo, these droplets can get so large that they become visible, and visibly cloud the drink (an intended feature of absinthe preparation). In whiskey, these droplets are usually microscopic and don't visibly cloud the drink, because most of the oils have been removed during chill-filtration. However, these droplets do something important, in that short-chain esters, being more soluble in the droplet than they are in the diluted whiskey, enter the droplet and become trapped inside. These compounds are now less available for tasting or smelling. Fortunately, these compounds are the oily, grassy compounds that many people do not like in their whiskey, and masking them is considered an improvement. There is another type of micelle ""droplet"" that forms in whiskey. Ethanol, in high concentrations in water, forms it's own clusters, as ethanol molecules gather up with one another. Interestingly, warmer solutions cause more clustering of ethanol molecules, as do higher concentrations. Like before, these micelles trap compounds that are more soluble in ethanol than they are in water, volatile flavor compounds. However, unlike the oil droplets, these flavor compounds are desirable. Cooling the solution and diluting the solution both serve to ""pop"" these ethanol micelles, allowing them to release their trapped compounds for aroma and flavor. So cooling and adding water can have the effect of both masking certain flavors by forcing them out of solution, and enhancing others by promoting their release back into solution. In the end, the result of the changed flavors is a matter of taste, which is why some people prefer neat, with water, or on the rocks, but one cannot deny that real chemical changes are in play."
Why does a microwave rotate the food being cooked? And is there ever a time when it shouldn't rotate?,"Microwave ovens have a turntable because the microwaves themselves form what are known as 'standing waves'. This means there are essentially static columns of microwave energy inside the cabinet itself. You can see this for yourself - spread a tray or plate with grated cheese, take the turntable out (or press that button), and zap it for a couple of minutes. You should see bands of melted cheese interleaved with unmelted cheese. Thus, the food is rotated to ensure even heating."
"What's the difference between hollandaise, mayonnaise, and aïoli?","Mayo, at its most basic, is egg yolk and oil, with a little vinegar, whipped into an emulsion. Aioli starts with oil and garlic, and sometimes vinegar or lemon.  Some versions (French-Provençal, apparently) add egg yolk for an end result close to mayonnaise, but the yolk is not required. Hollandaise is a cooked sauce made from egg yolk and butter, sometimes flavored with lemon and pepper.  I think it must have a much larger ratio of egg yolk to other ingredients in it, since it remains brightly yellow and thick. Bearnaise is a variation of hollandaise, which uses white wine vinegar to emulsify the egg yolks and butter, and flavors the resulting sauce with shallot, chervil, and tarragon.  Like an aioli, it is not defined by the emulsion but by the flavoring agents.  Adding terragon and capers, or tarragon and shallots, to a hollandaise (or other egg-yolk emulsion sauce) will produce a 'faux-bearnaise'. The garlic defines the aioli, which is also the only one that can be made without egg yolk. The choice of butter rather than oil makes a hollandaise, and it is cooked as a sauce to set the yolks (which neither of the others require). The yolk and oil combination itself is the central concept of mayonnaise, while it can be flavored, it doesn't have to be. The sauces are quite similar, though, and an emulsion of egg yolk with seasonings might be called by any name.  The difference between a garlic mayo and a french-style aioli are likely to be pretty subtle.  Likewise, a mayo flavored with lemon and pepper will be hard to distinguish from a hollandaise which uses oil - although hollandaise is usually cooked to set it, so the texture may be different.  And a aioli with butter will be very similar to a hollandaise with garlic.  Adding tarragon and shallot to any of them is likely to produce a bearnaise type sauce. All three recipes are very loose and broadly defined, since they can be tweaked a lot depending on preferences - so it makes it hard to pin down other factors like ingredient ratios that might distinguish the recipes.  The sauces that add flavorings or substitute ingredients will tend to be named one or the other based more on recipe origin, familiarity, and marketing rather than any clearly defined difference."
Does searing meat lock in moisture?,"No. As you noted, searing beef performs what's called the Maillard Process (or Reaction) which is a specific form of caramelization. Nothing is ""sealed"" into the meat because the meat isn't sealed by the process. It's still porous and will therefore leech moisture during cooking. You can retain moisture in cooked beef by buying quality beef and not cooking it beyond medium-rare to medium."
Why do my silicone spatulas melt in frying oil?,"If the products are melting and falling apart in hot oil at cooking temperatures I think you have experimentally confirmed that they are not food grade silicone. Food-grade silicone should be completely functional in the range of frying temperatures. In a guide to food-grade silicone: Temperature resistance is one of the principal attributes of food-grade silicone. This is particularly crucial in food processing where temperatures can vary from boiling hot to freezing cold. Food grade silicone can generally function in temperatures varying between -60°C and +250°C (special grades up to +300°C). Source In a guide to safe deep-frying: If you have a food thermometer heat the oil to 160C for low, 180C for moderate and 190C for high. Source As for buying reliable products, my recommendation would be to buy branded products from reputable shops. With experience and common sense you can get a sense for what brands and products to trust."
How can I curate ingredients for my child to do foolproof self-directed sensory play + baking?,"The easiest way would be to make a very simple cookie dough that relies on a lot of dry ingredients. I personally like to make different seasoned and flavoured banana cookies for breakfast and think the recipe meets all the guidelines you asked for. As I personally prepare the ingredients also in jars and measure them by cup and teaspoon to make it easier for myself, I hope the recipe below works for you and your kid. Basic ingredients: Ideas for the dry ingredients and flavour/spices: Basically, everything you like, which is dry and could be measured pre-hand e.g. It’s completely up to you, what you would like to add to the cookies. Be creative and experience with the flavours that your daughter likes. If sweet or hearty - there are no limits! Just make sure to follow the steps in the order below and add a banana + baking powder + any kind of dry base. Steps: Mash your banana with a fork in a bowl until it’s banana puree - consistency like a smoothie. Add all the dry ingredients (except baking powder and spices) until you have got a stiff but sticky dough. If it runs off the fork it’s too liquidy, if you can knead it with your hands it’s too stiff. It should be somewhere in the middle. As dry ingredients you can use: Oats, (e.g. coconut or spelt) flour, pre-mixed granola, nuts, dried fruits, sesame, puffed rice, a bit of couscous or quinoa, cocoa nibs, espresso beans, chocolate drops etc. etc. If you add multiple ingredients, I would recommend starting with the smaller and finer ones and then adding whole nuts, etc. It’s easier to add only a bit of each, to begin with, and then more until the dough has got a nice, chewy consistency. I like to add organic turmeric powder or barley grass powder (the banana overpowers the flavour and the powder gives a nice colour), cinnamon, nutmeg or ginger. There are no limits to what you can or can’t add. For example, if you are more of a crisp and less of a cookie person, add as dry ingredient sesame seeds and seaweed sprinkles and as spices sea salt flakes, umami and hot sauce or pepper. You can adapt the recipe fully to your taste! If you like your cookies extra crunchy or caramelised, add some coconut flakes, puffed rice, a drizzle of honey, etc. on top. "
"What exactly is ""Japanese"" Salt and Pepper?","They may have been trying to describe ""salt and Japanese pepper"". Japanese pepper is unrelated to black pepper, but closely related to Sichuan pepper; its flavor has been described as ""lemony"" and it has a ""numbing"" quality. It's also known as ""sansho"". Mixtures of pre-ground sansho and salt are readily available in Asian grocery stores. This mixture is commonly sprinkled on grilled meats, so this would be my guess. Of course, it's also possible they meant black and/or white pepper. There's a number of varietals of peppercorn, and how they are roasted, stored, and ground will have a significant effect on the taste. "
Coca Cola's Secret Recipe,"It's no secret; here it is! Complete with the cocaine that was removed from Coke's production in 1903:   Picture and text from This American Life The radio broadcast recording on the above link makes a compelling case that the picture at the top of the page is the original formula for Coke. Of course, it has changed over the years; it's not exactly the same thing now as it was way back when. In addition to removing the cocaine, they've also cut the caffeine, switched from sugar to high fructose corn syrup, and use phosphoric acid now instead of citric acid. The proportions of the 7X ingredients had to have changed over time, as the ingredients themselves have changed. Extracting oils is a very different process now than over 100 years ago. The idea that the formula is ever-so-secret is a marketing gimmick. Sure, the actual formula is a trade secret, but the massive effort to keep the world's biggest secret thing is just a bunch of theater.  Photo and caption from NY Daily News The ""down to the gram"" specifics of the production recipe today are trade secrets, but no more so than just about every trademarked, brand-name food item sold today. No one person mixes and measures the whole batch (that's just practical, it's not even necessarily a security measure), so keeping the ""super-secret-recipe"" as it stands today from being published is no more difficult for Coke than it is for KFC. Nor are there highly-paid super-sleuths trying to steal the formula against whom Coke needs to take extraordinary measures. EDIT 9/20/15 This American Life has added the following to their story: Much of the press about our story takes at face value Coca-Cola's statements that we have not found the recipe for Coke, present or past. But when asked if the company has checked to see if this formula matches the original formula - which archivist Phil Mooney assured me they still have - company spokespeople always politely sidestep the question. So it seems entirely possible that no one at Coke has checked. If they'd checked to see if the formulas match, why not say so? Phil Mooney even admitted something interesting about the recipe in our interview: ""Could it be a precursor? Yeah, absolutely."" He then went on to express, as his opinion, not as fact: ""Is this the one that went to market? I don't think so."" They're just goofin. Addendum When I wrote this answer, I had no idea that it would get so ""big"" or that Skeptics.SE and Chemistry.SE had taken on the same issue. Had I known, I would have spent a little more time researching.  I have since done quite a bit more research and am now even more strongly of the opinion that the secret formula of Coke is just an ordinary trade secret, and the hype is just hype for the sake of marketing. Furthermore, the recipe for the 7X (that's even what Coke calls its ""ever so super-secret"" formula) in the old book pictured at the top of this answer is genuinely either the original formula or a precursor to it. At any rate, it's darn close. If you're interested in learning more about the handwritten recipe in the book, I strongly encourage you to follow this link: This American Life and listen to the recording of the radio broadcast about the book, the formula, and the hype. Early in the broadcast, they make a point I've been saying since I first got wind of this completely over-the-top marketing gimmick. One of the legends of ""the secret"" is that only two people know it, and they never fly on the same plane (like the President of the United States and the Vice President). ""The company has always said, and as far as I know, it's true, that at any given time only two people know how to mix the 7X flavoring ingredient,"" Mark Pendergrast, historian and author of For God, Country, and Coke told This American Life. ""Those two people never travel on the same plane in case it crashes; it's this carefully passed-on secret ritual, and the formula is kept in a bank vault."" Time Magazine Think about that for a second. If the vault contains ""the secret"" known to only the two men, and the two men died in the same plane crash, wouldn't someone at the company be able to open the vault? If the two men know something beyond that (or somethings, one version of the legend held that each man only knew half the secret), why wouldn't they also put that information in the vault? Furthermore, if you have a really big secret that you'll go to any lengths to keep, would you shout from every mountaintop, ""I know something YOU don't! Nee ner nee ner nee ner!""? So I say again, yes, it's a trade secret; it's just a regular trade secret. It's not the Manhattan Project. The hype is just hype; the fact that we're talking about it now emphasizes how effective the marketing is. Buying into the hype is just drinking the Kool-Aid."
Can I boil eggs in the same pot I'm boiling something else?,I personally reckon it's fine.  Couple of points I like to make here are:
How should I cook bacon in an oven?,"I've always cooked it on top of aluminum foil, at 350°F (~175°C) for 20 minutes. Flipping it once at about the half way point. If you prefer crispier, go for 25 minutes."
When is it necessary to cover food with aluminum foil during baking/roasting?,"If it calls for tightly wrapping it, they're trying for steam.  More than likely, they're just trying to shield the top from radiant energy, so the top doesn't brown before the whole thing is cooked through. If you're ever baking a cake, and it's starting to brown, but a toothpick is still coming out wet, I'll move it to a lower rack, and put a sheet pan on the rack above, to keep it from browning much further, but not seal it in such a way that it would steam the cake."
How much to reduce salt when using salted butter in place of unsalted butter,"Depending on brand, it is approximately 1 1/4 tsp per pound (US), or a little more than 1/4 tsp per stick (4 oz).    For most applications, yes it is fine to substitute and adjust; you can just adjust the ""salt to taste"" step of your recipe in many cases. There are a very few uses (such as yeast raised dough) where you want to be more precise.  I would not use salted butter for a yeast dough by preference, but if I had to, I would calculate the amount of salt to remove from the other ingredients based on this ratio: 1 1/4 tsp salt / 16 oz butter"
When to use convection/fan bake vs bake,"To clarify: forced-air (a/k/a ""convection"", a/k/a ""fan bake"") ovens rely on a fan to circulate the air in the oven.  The fast-moving air substantially enhances the rate at which heat is transferred to the food.  It is particularly good where you want the surface to brown, such as roasts and breads; it is not as good for more delicate items, such as custards and cakes, which can set too quickly or get dried out.  For cookies, it depends on what effect you want, but many standard types do well in forced-air ovens because the fan helps ensure that the whole oven stays at a uniform temperature despite the presence of several trays.  (Of course, the tray closest to the heating element will still cook faster than the one farthest away, so you will still have to swap them partway through.) The general rule for using the fan is to set the oven temperature 25 degrees F (15 C) lower than what the recipe calls for using in a regular oven.  Even then, don't go strictly by cooking time, as ovens vary; rather, be sure to check on your food regularly to see how fast it is cooking.  You may need to cover your food to prevent over-browning, or perhaps adjust the oven temperature."
Is it safe to eat freshwater fish raw?,"You should never eat freshwater fish in raw preparations. Freshwater fish are far more likely to have nasty parasites such as the lung fluke, that can only be killed by cooking. There is a slew of other nasty beasts that can be harmful if not killed. Unless you want to end up on an episode of Monsters Inside Me, stay away."

How does soaking liver in milk work?,"My knowledge about the phenomenon itself is limited but I did see it mentioned in ""Modernist Cuisine"" (Nathan Myhrvold, p. 147) Many recipes for foie gras, liver, sweetbreads, and other offal include a soaking step before cooking. For kidneys, 
  this step serves a very simple purpose: to remove any trace of the animal's bodily fluids. Recipes often call for 
  soaking foie gras, liver, and sweetbreads in milk. It is often said that milk improves the taste, purges blood, lightens 
  the color, or affects some other property of the meat. We were skeptical, so we tried several experiments. With 
  a mild-flavored organ meat like foie gras, we could taste a difference, but, frankly, in our tests, we prefer the taste 
  of water-soaked to milk-soaked foie gras. With stronger-flavored organ meats, there is even less of a difference than 
  with foie gras. So our suggestion is to simply soak the meat in water.  So, there you have it."
How to keep my (deep frying) oil usable as long as possible?,"I would not reuse that oil. The frying-oil reuse that occurs in fast food chains is reuse for the same day or over just a few days. They also store it properly and not just sitting exposed in the fryer. justkt is correct that more saturated fats are less sensitive to breakdown, this is why bacon grease can be kept for a rather long time. Three factors play a significant role in oil degradation: Any contact with air causes oxidation in oil. High temperatures, metal alloys, surface exposure, and even UV light act as catalysts to this reaction. When water interacts with oil it causes it to taste tainted or acidic. This is exacerbated by high temperatures, heating/cooling cycles, and oxidation products. When frying oil deteriorates, the resulting products form both volatile (or reactive) and non-volatile compounds. Non-volatile compounds remain within the frying oil, and can produce polymerization at frying oil temperatures above 200°C (390 F) or in isolated hot spots within the frying system. These molecules bond together to form large, different-sized clusters that accumulate on the oil’s surface. Since they don’t dissolve, they cause foaming; trapping air under the oil, and increase the possibility of hydrolysis. Given all these, the best environment for any oil is an cold, dark, airtight place. Cold temperatures may cause clouding, but this is not a cause for worry.

"How long is garlic butter safe, and why is it not a botulism risk like garlic in oil?","I suspected that @FuzzyChef's answer was essentially correct, but I felt that the question was not conclusively answered without sources, so I ended up never accepting an answer. Thankfully, Linda Harris published this very comprehensive summary (which I recommend you to read if you are a fan of garlic), from which these parts stand out: Garlic is a low-acid vegetable. The pH of a clove of garlic typically
  ranges from 5.3 to 6.3.
  [...]
  Adding wine or vinegar to garlic
  provides an acidic environment (less than pH 4.6) so that Clostridium
  botulinum cannot grow. A quick Google search reveals that butter has a pH of 6.1 - 6.4, so there is indeed no reason to believe that garlic butter is safer than garlic in oil.  As the summary says that garlic in oil is safe for up to 4 days in the refrigerator, it should be safe to assume that the same would hold for garlic butter. Most interestingly, however, the document explains a method to acidify garlic for long-term storage in oil, based on research that was published a year after this question was originally posted. The method should be just as valid for garlic butter. In short: Prepare 3 parts of 3% citric acid solution (about 15 g citric acid / 500 ml water) per part of garlic to be acidified (and don't change this ratio, obviously) Coarsely chop the garlic into pieces no longer than 6 mm (1/4 inch) in any direction Put the garlic in the solution, mix, cover and let soak for 24 h at room temperature, then drain/sieve. This acidified garlic is safe to use in oil (and presumably butter), according to science. Enjoy!"
How did people transport food before aluminium foil was invented?,"A complete answer to this question would require writing a primer on the history of food preservation and transport.  I'm not going to write one.  Instead, I'll focus on the most common methods of personal food transportation -- (that is, snacks, meals, and travel food) in the middle ages. Transporting foods across the village would have been a daily or weekly event in most medieval European villages, because frequently villages had a common shared oven.  This oven belonged to the baker or to the village council, and after the bread was done, the residual oven heat was used to bake beans, casseroles, pot roasts and other slow-cook dishes.  Generally, the ceramic vessels for such dishes had lids (which were sometimes sealed with flour paste to retain moisture), and transported unopened in a basket. For road food, one of the most common methods was as pies.  Contrary to modern hand-pies with flaky delicious crust, for many medieval pies the crust was thick, dense, and inedible.  The crust wasn't part of the food, it was a sealed wrapper to protect it (with indifferent success); you broke open the crust with a knife and ate the insides with a spoon, tossing the crust to the pigs or dogs (or the very poor). Another method of sealing food was ""potting"", which involved putting meat, seafood, or other foods in a small pot and covering the top with a thick layer of fat or (for expensive dishes) wax.  The potted food would be cooked with the sealing layer on top, and thus survive for a couple of days until bacteria penetrated the protective grease layer.

Grilling veggies & meat on same surface for vegetarian guests,"My response to this kind of question is always just ask, and if you absolutely can't, err on the side of caution. I'm assuming here that you're talking about a pretty thorough heating and brushing. If you're leaving a bunch of meat stuff on the grill, that someone could conceivably taste, that's not good - you certainly shouldn't be risking food that actually has meat in it. But if it's essentially clean, with pretty much everything burned and scraped off, you're in a much better state. I believe most of the vegetarians I know would be okay with that general plan. They're pretty pragmatic about their diets, they they know that some people eat meat and aren't going to have two grills, and they'll regard it as pretty similar to you using a pan that previously was used for meat but has since been washed. I would be sure I was doing everything that I could, thorough heating and brushing, separate (or washed) utensils, and so on, but I wouldn't be overly worried at that point. But there are also people who keep to much stricter diets for all kinds of reasons (see Journeyman Geek's answer, for example), who would not be okay with this. The only way you can tell the difference between the two is to ask, or to know someone well enough that you don't have to ask. This is really a pretty general principle when it comes to potentially strongly-held beliefs: if you want to do right by someone, don't expect to be able to use generalized categories to get the answer, assume you need their answer."
"What are things like Bread, Rice and Cereal collectively known as?","There are several terms which you can use, depending on the context of writing (or speaking).  A very simple one is ""the starch"". It is mostly used in the context of meal planning, such as ""What starch are we going to serve tonight"" or ""When planning a vegetarian meal, it is best to first decide on the starch and then select sides that complement it"".  ""Grains"" or, mostly interchangeably, ""cereals"" is what academic specialists for nutrition and diets use in their jargon. If you read a textbook on nutrition, that's where you will find breads, etc. There, the context makes it clear that the word doesn't mean simply uncooked kernels. The nonacademic literature on dieting is more likely to use ""carbs"" - see Chris H's answer for more detail on that usage.  In legal language, for example rules and regulations about food product labelling, or import and export regulations, you will frequently find phrases like ""grain products"".  Since none of these terms is unambiguous, outside of these genres of writing you will probably have to go for something more descriptive, for example ""foods made from grains"" in a colloquial conversation.

"Parmesan rind:  should I use it, or trash it?","Yes, you can save it and add it to soups such as Minestrone for additional flavor.  Once the soup is done, remove and discard the rind.  For extended storage, keep it in a bag in the freezer until you have need for it."
Can I deep fry food in butter instead of vegetable oil?,"You can certainly deep-fry foods in clarified butter (also known as ghee) and in lard.   In fact, there are many foods that are traditionally fried in these fats.  They both have very high smoke points and are excellent for making crisp fried foods. For example, Puri, Indian fried breads, are deep-fried in ghee (clarified butter).  And many Southern USA and many Mexican deep-fried foods are meant to be fried in lard, such as hand pies or sopes.  In fact, if you watch the videos of Cowboy Kent Rollins, you'll see that while many of his recipes say ""frying oil"", what he actually uses is lard. As for the flavor question: yes, using ghee or lard will affect the flavor of what you're frying, but in subtle ways.  Both of these fats are mild-flavored (at least, high-quality lard is).  Generally, the extra flavor you get from the butter or animal fat is considered desireable; they fell out of fashion in the use due to concerns about cholesterol, not taste.  Only foods that are meant to have a very light, airy batter (like tempura) are unsuitable for frying in animal fat. There are some other animal fats that can be used for frying and deep-frying, such as beef tallow, schmaltz, horse fat, or duck fat. These have a much stronger flavor that is recommended for specific foods (for example, there are many aficionados of duck fat french fries), but aren't a good general substitute for vegetable oil. One other caution: if you switch to frying with animal fats, you need to make special provisions to dispose of the used fat.  It can't be safely poured down the drain. This is actually true of all deep-frying oil, but animal fats are a greater problem: they may clog your pipes as well as hurting the sewer system. ADD: per @wjandrea below, clarified butter, ghee, and brown butter have different flavors based on the amount they were cooked while clarifying, which will affect the flavor of any fried foods made with them."
What could this utensil pair be used for?,"The handle of the round plastic object feels really distinctive to me. It would clearly work with a normal hammer-like grip, but it also has the thumb-print inviting the user to choke the grip up close and apply lots of force. I'm pretty sure it's for scraping.  The metal tool is a bit confusing; it looks like it could cut, but it's clearly not a knife.  After a minute's thought, I'm comfortable guessing that this is a child's pumpkin-carving kit. "
How to efficiently shred a lot of cabbage?,"There is a kraut cutter, a wooden board about 2 ft long with a diagonal blade.  We used all the time when I was a child. We laid it on a large pot.  You cut heads of cabbage in half and push it over the blade flat side down.  Try google or an old fashioned hard ware. "
"Does the fruit label get put on a bad spot, or does the bad spot develop as a result of the label?","A few years ago I had the rare chance to take a look behind the scenes of the largest manufacturer of fruit sorting, labeling and packaging equipment in the Pacific Northwest and it was impressive to see how much effort and planning goes into designing everything in a way that damage to fruit is avoided at all costs. We talked about how the business evolved and what the biggest challenges are.  And yes, the stickers are a crucial part. Developing a glue that is food-safe, will stick well and come off without damaging the fruit is a challenge and different manufacturers have solved it more or less well. If you observe carefully, you will notice that the stickers will behave differently. There are two main ways how stickers can lead to damage: The former will result in a soft spot or other blemish, the latter is visibly fresh. Soft-skinned fruit like peaches are much more prone to damage and a real challenge compared to e.g. apples. The damage is not unavoidable, a lot depends on the settings of the equipment and a good operating personnel. But I can assure you that no fruit packaging plant will “cover up” blemishes with a sticker - simply because they label way too many pieces per hour. Blemished fruit will be sorted out before packaging, damaged fruit in packs will typically mean the whole package is rejected by wholesalers - because they won’t travel and store well.  Knowing all this, one of my pet peeves is supermarket workers that think refilling displays is best done by upending boxes of apples, but that’s not part of your question."
Why is mustard irritating for me?,"As a straight answer to ""why"" it's the quantity of mustard oil in any given mustard type. There are many types of mustard, but the two you may find the most confusing visually are English & American. Though both are a fairly bright yellow in colour, that's about as far as the similarity goes. Mustard seeds themselves come in many different 'heats' - the mildest generally being pale yellow, almost white & the strongest are dark brown.
Additionally, mixing mustard with vinegar tempers the heat & lengthens the shelf-life.
Mixing instead with pure water increases the punch, but the flavours will dissipate over a much shorter period. American mustard is one of the mildest available. It starts with a mild seed, pale yellow/white in colour, but the colour is then boosted by using turmeric. The mixture is then diluted with vinegar.
This is your 'standard' mild American mustard, found in many places, including McDonald's. You can slather it in huge quantities on a hot dog with no ill-effects. Almost at the other end of the scale [Chinese mustard can be even hotter] is English. Made with a mixture of yellow & brown mustard seed, then mixed with water not vinegar, this will take the roof of your nose out if used in injudicious quantities. It can quite literally make your eyes water & your nose run - though if you did it by accident, take solace in the fact that the hit is very short-lived, not like eating a blindingly hot chilli pepper.
The full impact & flavour of English mustard is quite short-lived even in the jar, once made up from powdered mustard. Even ready-made, store-bought has quite a short shelf-life for a condiment.  Made at home & mixed with water it will lose its punch in just a few days, so the trick is to buy powder & mix it just 15 minutes before you eat it, for the full experience. If you're ever uncertain visually which you are about to add - taste it first. Personally I love English mustard on hot dogs! With ketchup too [one of the only things I will ever put ketchup on]. The balance between the sweet, vinegary ketchup & the hard hit of the mustard is really quite the feast. Bring on the junk food!

Oven management in restaurants,"I've never worked in a kitchen with only one oven. I'm sure they exist, but I've never been in one. That said, contrary to moscafj's answer, I've certainly used ovens heavily during service. These examples come from a kitchen that had two combi Rational ovens (i.e., an oven and steamer in one). Typically one was kept on steam, switching as needed, and the other on roast (for service). To give you a rough idea of what a daily rotation of oven usage was like: Breakfast (starting at 5:00 AM): one on steam, one held at 350 F. The roaster is primarily used to cook sheet pans of bacon/sausage/home fries which are then transferred to hot holding, either on the line or in a hotbox for the buffet (the steam is used for hot-holding for the line/buffet backup). During this time, other miscellaneous prep could also be cooked in the same oven (assuming 350 F is an appropriate temperature). Par-grilled chicken breast would frequently be roasted off and cooled during this time (either to be re-heated later, or further processed into chicken salad or the like). Lunch (starting at 11:00 AM): turned up to 450 F and held. Lunch service was typically too hectic to get any sort of significant prep done, so it would be used primarily for service (personal pizzas, heating crab cakes, the odd person ordering a steak or roast chicken off the dinner menu, parbaked rolls for the table, etc). The cold line might be able to sneak a tray or two of croutons in the oven at this time, but it wouldn't be a sure thing. The ""spare"" oven/steamer might be switched over to a slow-roasted prep item - say, roasted garlic or braised meat - depending on prep/service needs. Mid afternoon/bar service: (2:30 PM - 5:00 PM): still held at 450 F, although with the lull in orders, you could switch one up if you really needed to (most dinner items would be prepped at 450 anyway). This time was largely used as a mad dash for the dinner crew to set up and get as much prep done as possible. Usage at this time is highly dependent on hot line prep/service needs. Dinner (5:00 PM - 11:00 PM): held at 500 F and kept there. God help you if you changed an oven without explicit permission from the line. Primary usage is for service - pan roasted fish/chicken, heating/reheating various apps, finishing grilled steaks, etc. The oven is constantly being opened and closed as orders come in and out, but never cooled. Overnight (11:00 PM - 2:30 AM): a deep self-cleaning cycle is run on the service oven. The ""spare""/steamer is switched over to roast for service orders and miscellaneous prep. Late night (2:30 AM - 5:00 AM) - hot food isn't served. A ""quick"" clean cycle is run on the steamer/overnight oven, and the main service oven is set up for breakfast. From the comments: How do the staff know which item in the oven belongs to which order? The answer is a combination of ""just remember"", ""it doesn't matter"", and whatever personal system the cook has to keep track of things. To explain: the system I used was essentially ""ascending temperatures"". I would use this system for the oven, the grill/range, and resting tray: from left to right/bottom to top, rare -> well done. As a random example: an order comes in for a mid-rare tenderloin and medium well sirloin, followed by a second order for a mid-well tenderloin and medium seared salmon. I'd put a tenderloin on the center left section of the grill (mid rare), a tenderloin and a sirloin on the center right (both mid well), and start heating a sizzle platter in the center burner of the range. At this point I can effectively forget about the ticket for the time being - all of the order information that I need to know at moment is embedded in the location of the food. Once the steaks were sufficiently marked to count as ""grilled"", I'd move the center-left tenderloin to the bottom rack in the oven (rares wouldn't make it into the oven, so the racks went mid-rare / medium / mid-well / well done), the two center right steaks to the second from the top rack. Ditto the salmon, once the sizzle platter was hot, I'd add the fish and move it to the second rack. Now it's a question of monitoring what's in the oven/waiting for my internal timer to go off. Once the [item] in the oven reaches the temperature the it's position tells me it should be, I move it to the resting tray (which is just a sheet pan with a rack on it), again in the appropriate [rare | mr | med | mw | well] position. At this point I can check the tickets to see if anything's ready to sell from my station, if so, I call to the expediter ""ready to sell [table number]"". The expediter will either tell me to hold off (either the table's not ready or the server isn't ready or we're still waiting on food from other stations) or sell it. If we're holding, I forget about it and move on. If a solo MR tenderloin walks in, I can immediately sell the one I have on the resting tray to clear that order and start working a new one for the holding table. If we're selling, I move the relevant proteins from the resting tray to the salamander (still following the left->right placement rule) to bring them back up to an appropriate plating temp and start laying out plates (any guesses as to how I'm going to arrange the plates?) The ""just remember"" part comes into play with special orders or just juggling random ticket information in my head so I don't have to go back and refer to the hanging ticket - but 95% of the information I need at give time is in front of my face and it usually doesn't matter which table this particular item is going to - a medium steak is a medium steak is a medium steak, all I need to know if how many I have working, how long they have left, and what's ready to sell."
Israeli soda type drink,"What you're describing sounds like jallab. From Will Travel For Food: Jallab is a very popular drink in the Middle East. It’s made by diluting the syrup made of grape molasses, dates and rose water with water and serving it in a tall glass with crushed ice. It’s always topped with nuts, most of the time pine nuts and golden raisins, because a jallab without nuts is not really a jallab. There is also a recipe on the linked page. Also, from Wikipedia: Jallab (Arabic: جلاب / ALA-LC: jallāb) is a type of fruit syrup popular in the Middle East made from carob, dates, grape molasses and rose water.[1] Jallab is very popular in Jordan, Syria, Palestine and Lebanon. It is made mainly of grape molasses, grenadine syrup, and rose water, then smoked with Arabic incense. It is usually sold with crushed ice and floating pine nuts and raisins. Jallab, the syrup used to make this drink seems to be quite easy to find on the internet. It is also sold in Middle Eastern grocery markets."
Food safety when tasting from dish,"I'm interested in the common practice in commercial settings (I have a small home-cooking business, and I want to align myself with the norm in restaurants etc..) Since this hasn't specifically been addressed yet, I'll throw in my experience in industrial kitchens/restaurants. Plastic spoons. Hundreds of them. Thousands of them. Literally. We had a bain marie at every station. At the beginning of every shift, it was re-filled with plastic spoons. Each station had their own box of spoons to refill throughout the shift. Every single dish was tasted at every single stage with a plastic spoon, which was then thrown out. I would say that I went through ~150 spoons on an average shift, god only knows how many when we were busy. Purchased in bulk, the cost wasn't prohibitive. I would hazard a guess that a box of 2500 plastic spoons cost us about 30 USD. While it might seem wasteful, the cleanliness/health payoff was worth it. I don't want to name names, but this was a multi-national, multi-billion dollar hotel chain (4 star/4 Diamond) and we had a third party come in and audit us 1-2 times a year, in addition to the Health Department. Both the third party and the Health Department had the authority to shut everything down at a moments notice if they didn't like what they saw. I don't know the statistics for the Health Department, but the third party rated our kitchens (we had three) in the top 10 cleanest operations in North America (within our company) more than once. We also recycled the spoons, so there's that as well."
How might I roast coffee at home without investing in an expensive roasting machine?,"Hot Air Popper The cheapest and simplest is to use a (cheap) electric hot air popper. The old favorite is the West Bend Poppery, but you can use anything as long as the vent holes (where the hot air comes in) are on the sides rather than the bottom. I've roasted a lot of coffee this way. It works, but there are a few downsides. The biggest problems:  [source: Chris g Collision, Flickr Creative Commons] I've read about modifications you can make that will improve these: changing out resistors, modifying the airflow, and even hooking up an Arduino to control the heat a lot more closely, but it seems like more work than I've wanted to invest in the process. Heat gun / metal dog bowl method My brother's moved on to this approach, and I'm soon to follow. The benefit of a heat gun is that the temperature is high enough to get a good roast, and the airflow is high enough that you can roast a few cups of coffee at a time.  [source: Ocell, Flickr Creative Commons] More Insanity
Sweet Maria's sells green coffee beans, and lists a huge amount of home roasting methods, including Weber Kettle conversions. The sky's the limit, but I'd start small with the air popper or the heat gun first. I'd do this outside
Some methods have you roasting the coffee in your kitchen - in the oven, on the stove, etc. I wouldn't want to do this myself, for two reasons. The beans have thin husks on them, which come off as the beans are roasted. They're messy, and I wouldn't want them flying around my kitchen. Also, roasting coffee doesn't smell as good as you'd think it would. Sources of more info:"
What are the tiny white self-moving objects on pasta?,"Assuming these are open packets that have been open for a while - you probably have a mite infestation, probably the flour mite (Acarus siro), or a closely related mite. These are tiny almost-invisible-to-the-naked-eye members of the Acari, which is an animal order including the ticks and mites. They are very small - between 0.33 and 0.66 mm (0.013-0.026 in), with translucent/whitish bodies and pink legs. They are, as the name suggests, most commonly found in flour, but are also seen living on a range of grains, cereal products, dried fruit and nuts. They can promote allergic reactions upon consumption of food contaminated with the mites. Because they are so small, detection is difficult and usually not noticed until fairly heavily infested - if you are seeing the dust/flour/whatever move, then you most likely have a heavy infestation. You may be able to find them on the food or in your cupboards with a magnifying glass or using a piece of sticky tape to press down on cupboard surfaces, then examining it under bright light. Severely infested foods should be discarded, but the mites can be killed by freezing the affected food-stuffs for 7 days. Just be aware that this will not kill off any antigens from the mites - they can still cause an allergic reaction upon consumption. They are difficult to eliminate because they are so small, but you can thoroughly clean your cupboards and any food storage containers with regular house-hold cleaners to get rid of food residues that they use as a food source. There's a more detailed version of the above advice on wikihow."
Why is it faster to reheat something than it is to cook it?,"""Cooking"" is often a chemical process.  Denaturing proteins, gelatinization, causing chemical reactions like browning, or even causing state changes like evaporation. In many cases for these reactions to happen, we need to overheat the food.  (Cook it and let it rest to cool off back down to undo some of the changes that were made and/or bring it back down to a reasonable temperature to eat).  This is true when grilling meats, frying, baking bread, and lots of other types of cooking. Other times, we need to bring something to temperature and hold it there for some period of time.  This holds for extracting collagen, starch gelatinization (eg, cooking pasta, potatoes, etc.) but also just waiting for flavors to transfer in soups and similar dishes. With warming, you're just adding enough heat to it to move it a few degrees, but you're not typically trying to change the state of the food, so less total energy is needed. Now, it is always faster to reheat vs. cook things?  For the most part it's true, but I suspect that there would be an edge case out there.  Something that's cooked from room temperature, but then stored chilled and the chilling causes issues (like retrogradation in starches, maybe?) that make them more resist than reheating."

What are these tiny kidney bean sized things in my rotisserie chicken,"Your chicken was a rooster and what you found are his testicles. If you are not queasy, this forum entry gives you a picture and some more anatomical details. While animal testicles are typically edible and often a speciality/delicacy, many westerners are not necessarily familiar with them, especially in animals as comparatively small as roosters. Asian (e.g. Chinese) cuisine knows various dishes based on chicken testicles, and there‘s also a Hungarian dish that’s basically a stew/goulash.  On the other hand, they have confused unwitting consumers as readily reported by the kind of media that favors sensationalism. So don’t worry, you can simply eat them, if you want.

Induction range vs gas,We have recently remodelled our kitchen and moved from a gas hob to an induction hob. In general it cooks much the same as gas and you get similar levels of control over the temperature. One style of cooking that is not recommended is 'slide' cooking as this will likely scratch your hob surface - this can be mitigated by putting a piece of parchment paper under the pan or lifting the pan off the hob. we don't use a wok and can't see how we could with our hob. The surface of the hob gets hot but not as hot as it would it it were gas or electric this means that spilt / spattered food doesn't generally burn on to the hob surface and it is much easier to clean.  The hob is touch control and so far we've not had any problems with this. If you lift a pan off the heating zone it will switch itself off automagically after a certain amount of time. Before this happens if you put a pan back on the zone it carries on cooking. If there are no pans on any active zones then the whole thing switches off after 2 minutes. We chose a NEFF Flushline hob that sits in a natural black granite work surface and the whole thing is positively beautiful and a pleasure to work with.
What kind of pickle was this?,"It sounds like you may be describing a caper berry. Most folks are familiar with capers, which are the pickled or salted flower bud from the caper plant. However, if the buds are left to mature into fruit, it becomes a caper berry. Caper berries (like capers) are usually pickled or salted, are about the size of a grape (and vary in size, like grapes), and often packaged with stems intact.

How can I make a chocolate cup that looks like the seaweed on a sushi roll?,"""Plastic chocolate"" is a form of chocolate used for modeling and shaping decorative elements such as chocolate roses, ribbons and other elements for cakes and desserts. Take about 1 lb. of bittersweet chocolate and melt over a double boiler.  When chocolate is melted, stir in 2/3 cup of light corn syrup. Mix until evenly blended and then set aside to cool.  When it firms up, wrap tightly in a heavy gauge plastic bag or wrap tightly in plastic wrap.  Let sit for several hours or overnight.  No need to refrigerate it, ambient temperature is fine. Cut the plastic chocolate into smaller size chunks that will be easy to knead.  Begin kneading to soften it.  If it gets sticky, use a little cocoa powder but be careful not to dry it out.  Knead until pliable and then roll out to desired thickness and cut as desired to shape your sushi rolls, decorative elements, etc.  You can roll it through the roller of a pasta machine to help get it to an even thickness. If you're wanting the rough look of nori then press some crumpled foil into it after rolling as previously suggested."
Cues to a reliable or unreliable recipe?,"I look for notes that give subsitutions. If the recipe creator can't be arsed to either provide subs or say ""you really can't substitute,"" then it seems to me they aren't so much interested in cooking as they are in must provide dogmatic formula. This doesn't work for me. Notes along the way--""you are looking for a texture like..."" ""the colour should be... but don't worry if it looks like...""--are essential. A complete lack of ""Oh by the way you should have done X an hour before you did Y"" is non-negotiable. Anytime I cook through a recipe like that without reading first (caveat emptor, I know) I tend to end up swearing and throwing things. Timelines are key.

Blowtorch - hardware store vs kitchen store. Is there a difference?,"Yes, there is no real difference. Be aware that if you one from the hardware store, it should be one where the flame does not fluctuate when you tilt the torch. This usually happens with the very cheap ones.

How to remove bits of egg shell from a cracked egg?,"Use part of the shell you just cracked to scoop it up; it will attract the broken bit.

How do you open a coconut?,"The best way to open a brown hairy coconut, not a fresh green one (assuming you are right handed, I imagine that sinister people can reverse the instructions, but I've not tried it).   First image the coconut is a head, everything is related to this, so the visualization is important.  The three holes are the eyes and mouth of the face.  They naturally form an eyes/mouth thing.  you'll see that it only really looks like a eyes/mouth one way up.  stare into its eyes (this bit is not so important, but I like to do it).   Now hold it in your left palm, under its chin/where the neck would be, with the 3 holes in the coconut arranged like the eyes and mouth of a face looking out to the right, mouth below the eyes, with the hair pointing up.  There will be a slight 'seam' running between the eyes and back over the top of the head. Then take a large, heavy knife and using the FLAT side of the knife (not the sharp edge), a meat cleaver works best, strike the coconut hard across the coconut's 'forehead', where its hair line would be, aiming to impact exactly on the 'seam'.  You might need a few goes to get the crack right open, but sometimes it can be done in a single strike. Get this right and it will crack in a straight line from ear to ear along the hair line.  Works a treat.  And usually you can use the shell for something as you get a clean break. Once you have the first crack you can either prise apart or rotate the coconut in your hand and hit it a couple more times on the uncracked parts, following the same line as the first crack, to completely separate the two pieces. Alternatively you can stick it into the oven for 15 mins, @400F, after which the shell should have started to crack.  Then you can use the tool of choice to finish the cracking, rolling pin, hammer, wrench, flat of knife another coconut, whatever.  But where is the fun in that? "
What meats can I serve medium rare and why?,"Beef (and Lamb): The surface of beef is often contaminated with pathogens such as e-coli. However, the meat is very dense and the bacteria cannot migrate from the surface into the flesh. Therefore, beef is safe to consume once the external temperature exceeds, 160 degrees F. The internal uncontaminated meat is safe to eat raw. Pork: Like beef the surface of pork needs to be fully cooked.  Unlike beef, pigs harbor a parasitic roundworm called Trichinella spiralis. Infection with the worm is called trichinosis and can be fatal. This worm is killed when the flesh reaches 150 degrees F and is held there for several minutes. Therefore pork is safe to consume when cooked to medium. (Commercial pork in North America almost never has the roundworm present. Almost  every case (all?) of trichinosis in the last 15-20 years have come from undercooked wild boar or bear meat). Trichinella spiralis can also be killed by freezing (time and temperature dependent). Chicken: Almost all chickens have Salmonella or Campylobacter present on the surface (at 
least). However, chickens have a less dense flesh than pigs, sheep or cows. Therefore, the bacteria can migrate deep into the flesh. Also, the processing of chickens is much more invasive than the previously mentioned animals which also means the interior meat can get contaminated. This means the meat must be cooked to well done throughout. Duck: With duck it seems to come down to a matter of processing verses chicken. Also, they are raised in a much less confined manor, which helps prevent the spread of pathogens. There is still a chance of getting a salmonella infection from undercooked duck but cooking the breast well done basically ruins it, so people take the (small) risk. Ground meat: Grinding meat, by its nature, implies the surface and the interior is mixed. Therefore, one must assume the meat is fully contaminated and must be entirely cooked to well done."
"Why must fermenting meat be kept cold, but not vegetables?","It is a good thing that you wrote up your assumptions, this helps greatly with explanations. To look at each: Looking at these assumptions, it looks as if you are equating the absence of botulism bacteria with food safety. This is certainly not the case! There are dozens of different kinds of bacteria which can cause food poisoning, most of which are more difficult to guard against than botulism bacteria. Whenever you leave some food sitting out, you create a new microenvironment which gets colonized by its own ecosystem of microorganisms. Which type of organism will grow and displace all others is dependent on the conditions you offer it, just like in your assumption 2. It just so happens that, if you leave out vegetables at room temperature with the right amount of salt, it is the benign lactobacilii which proliferate best and occupy all the ecological niches in your fermentation jar. By the way, your fermentation can go wrong and create the wrong microorganisms, but they will not be c.b., that is usually seen under much stricter anaerobic conditions, such as in canned food and sometimes under oil. But meat is not a vegetable; it is a different source of food, on which lactobacilii cannot thrive. Instead, you get other types of bacteria on meat, usually ones which cause food poisoning. To prevent that, you have to preserve meat by making it inedible for any kind of bacteria, before they have overtaken it. This creates different curing methods for it, which require very tight control and multiple bacteria-controlling methods at once (e.g. cold temperature plus the right amount of salt) to get a safe cured meat. If you were to just leave your meat out in the conditions for a vegetable lacto-fermentation, you would get neither a lacto-fermentation, nor botulism, but just a crock full of spoiled meat, ready to give you some kind of non-botulinic food poisoning. Update To the point in your edit: It is absolutely not safe to just add meat to properly fermenting vegetables. Actually food safety is much more cautious than that, and any kind of self-experimented recipe is not safe by definition, but this is one of the rare cases which are not just unsafe, but decidedly dangerous. Probably not because of botulism, but the other types of food poisoning are no joke either."
What parasites are problematic in sous vide?,"All information that gives safe cooking temperatures without reference to time at that temperature is wrong. The FDA guidelines, and state and local health dept. guidelines not only confict with each other, they are flat out wrong! They all represent efforts to simplify molecular biology to two or three mindless rules. In the process, they guarantee that you will either overcook your food, or (if you care about good food) ignore the rules. Or possibly both. For a summary of the actual bacteriocidal data, take a look at Douglas Baldwin's site: http://www.douglasbaldwin.com/sous-vide.html#Safety
He has compiled information based on the actual growth and death curves for the pathogens that concern us most in the kitchen: salmonella, e.coli, lysteria, clostridium perfringes. Taking care of these will also get you out of the woods with protists, parasitic worms, norovirus, and everything else besides bacterial spores (another subject ... more relevant to canning). For an even more thorough examination of the issue, take a look at the Microbiology for Cooks chapter in Vol. 1 of the Modernist Cuisine series. Both Baldwin and Myhrvold have arrived at the same conclusion by consulting the actual science. The official guidelines are irrelevant.  The original question is ""what is the shortest temperature and time to kill all parasites."" By ""parasite"" I'm assuming the OP means pathogen, since parasites are technically just one type, and not usually the most important.  There's no good answer if we take this question literally, because killing all of anything is almost impossible. Autoclaving in a pressure cooker at 250°F / 121°C for 30 minutes still leaves about one in a trillion botulinum spores alive. Pasteurization leaves about 1 in 300 million pathogens alive (by definition, actually).  Cooking guidelines aren't about trying to kill everything; we just try to bring pathogens down to a safe level. A safe level is one where if you eat the food that's been refrigerated properly, in a reasonable amount of time, and you have a reasonably good immune system, it will be very unlikely that you'll get sick. I know that's a lot of disclaimers, but it's a messy world. Here are some basic guidelines. You'll get much more thorough versions looking at the above (or similar) sources. This stuff is best expressed as a graph. I'm padding it a bit for simplicity and safety: 126°F / 52°C for 6 hours 130°F / 54.5°C for 2 hours 135°F / 57°C for 40 minutes 140°F / 60°C for 12 minutes 150°F / 65.5°C for for 1 minute 15 seconds 160°F / 71°C for 8 seconds This is the time for killing salmonella (the most heat resistant of the pathogens we care about) to pasteurization standards.  Please note that these are not cooking times: these are times the food needs to be held at the temperature after reaching it. Normal minimum cooking times just reflect how long it will take for the center of the food to reach a given temperature. The above times are additional. You may have noticed that the first three temperatures above are well within the FDA's ""danger zone."" It's curious that the official guidelines consider your food in danger when it's actually in the process of being pasteurized. But it's not necessarily that complicated. We don't really have to pasteurize food most of the time. If you eat conventionally cooked medium-rare steak, fish that doesn't taste like rubber, or chicken that still has some juice left in it, then you eat un-pasteurized food. It's not a problem, because with the exception of ground meat, virtually all pathogens reside on the outer surfaces of the food. And they get more than hot enough when you sear the food, whether the main part of the cooking was sous-vide or some other way. Pasteurization is mostly an issue with cook-chill sous-vide, which is where you prepare food for reheating many days (even weeks) later.  Botulism is not a concern unless you're doing cook-chill and trying to keep the food for way, way too long (or in a much too warm fridge). The bacteria does indeed like the airtight bag, but it doesn't like the cold. "
What does al dente really mean?,"""Al dente"" is used to refer to food cooked so it is still ""firm to bite"" but not soft This is very important to pasta which should be removed from the cooking liquid just before it has fully cooked through, as like most foods, it will continue to cook after being removed from the heat source Always gently stir your pasta every minute or so while cooking to ensure it cooks evenly. Then near the end of the cooking time, bite into a piece of paste every 15 seconds or so to see if it has nearly cooked through. It should be firm to bite, and not soft all the way through. It should not resist biting though With some pasta types like Penne etc. you can sometimes actually see the uncooked inner layer (a thin white line) if you carefully slice it in half which a knife, or just bite cleanly with your teeth  If the pasta is going to be mixed into a hot liquid sauce before serving, take the pasta out of the cooking liquid at an even firmer point The term ""al dente"" can be used for all cooked foods that should be cooked to just before soft, and then served (fresh greens, thin meat cuts etc.) The reason for all of this is that there have been many flavour and nutrition benefits noted when cooking to this point. Also for pasta it tends to fall apart if cooked past ""al dente"""
I want to make my own cheese. How do I get started?,"Making Mozzarella is not fantastically difficult, but certain things during the process are critical, probably the most important is temperature.  If it's your first time making cheese, you might find the buying a 'starter kit' the easiest way to get up and running. These will provide you with all the important items you needm such as rennet. If you feel brave, then you forego the kit and dive right in.    For Mozzarella try to find Buffalo milk, which is what 'proper' Mozzarella is made from. It's lower in cholesterol than cows milk, has more protein and makes a much richer cheese. If you can't get Buffalo milk use the best full fat, non-homogenized milk you can find.   Here's a recipe I've used before MOZZARELLA Here's a link with the differences between Buffalo milk and cows milk Cow Milk vs Buffalo Milk Whilst it's quite possible to make virtually any variety of cheese at home, some cheeses, such as blue cheese, require a place to develop at the correct temperature and for quite long periods of time.  ideally, this would be a temperature around 10c with a humidity around 70% and a time for maturing at around 2 to 3 months. Here's a good place to start: http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/cheese/blue_cheese/blue_cheese.htm"
Which vegetables to use for stock?,"Typically veggies are onions, carrots, celery, leeks, garlic, shallots, etc. Throw in some peppercorns, also, and a Bouquet garni. You can add most other veggies, too, and mushrooms, but avoid adding things that give a strong (bad) flavour after cooked for a long time (broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, etc.)."
How do you make General Tso's chicken as generally found in the Eastern USA?,"Many restaurants actually serve a ""light"" version of the Tso sauce, and I have a pretty strong feeling that's what you're used to. To make the light version, you use 3x the corn starch and add 1/2 cup of the base liquid (usually chicken broth). The hint of sesame almost certainly came from toasted sesame oil, my favourite ""secret ingredient"" that goes into just about every Asian stir-fry. To get a more consistent flavour for the sauce, instead of using ""minced"" garlic, you might want to grate it using a fine rasp, if you have one.  This will definitely help to bring out the flavour of the garlic and subsequently the spiciness of the sauce. Grated orange zest is another common additive, and although it's traditionally labeled as a different recipe (""General Tso's Chicken with Orange""), some restaurants sneak it into the regular recipe.  If you remember any hint of orange, try adding about 1 tsp of this. Finally, if we're trying to recreate a recipe from an American Chinese restaurant, it's very likely they used some MSG.  You can leave it out, but we all know how much of a flavour enhancer it is. I don't actually have an exact recipe kicking around, but adapting these changes to the ""traditional"" recipe, it should look something like this: I'm going to skip the ingredients and preparation for the fried chicken itself, since that's pretty straightforward and no different from any of the ""normal"" Tso recipes.  So let's assume that part has already been done.  Here's how I'd make the sauce and finish it off: Combine the chicken broth, soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil, sugar, [MSG], and rice vinegar.  Make sure that the sugar is completely dissolved. Add tapioca to the soy sauce mix and dissolve. Heat a few tbsp of oil in your wok and start frying up the chilies.  The longer you fry them, the hotter the final dish will be, so adjust the timing to taste.  Many restaurants skimp here, and either don't use enough chilies or don't fry for anywhere near long enough.  You're looking for a deep, dark red, almost black colour for optimum heat. Add the soy sauce / tapioca mix, garlic and ginger, and stir. Once thickened, add the chicken and serve with the broccoli.  (You most likely got it steamed, that's how it looks in the picture, although my choice would be to stir-fry it with some red pepper flakes.) I can't promise you that this will be identical to what you got in the restaurants, as I haven't been to those restaurants, but hopefully this sounds a lot closer to what you had than the garbage you traditionally find in lower-end restaurants and on recipe sites. Update: After reading some of the results of this experiment, I would add the following (better late than never, right?): The above ratio of starch to water will result in a very thick, almost paste-like consistency.  That's intentional, but if you want something more ""saucy"", i.e. to put on rice, then don't triple the starch, especially if you're using tapioca.  2 tbsp should be sufficient.  At the same time, keep in mind that it's always easier to dilute a sauce that's too thick than it is to thicken it in the wok once it's already hot. If you're finding that it's still not spicy enough (I, too, like my spicy dishes blazing hot), then try including any or all of the following in the sauce:"
Should I use salted or unsalted butter if the recipe doesn't specify?,"Generally, you should use unsalted butter. You can always add salt to your unsalted butter, but you can't take it out if you want it less salty! If it's just being melted on some vegetables, then salted butter is probably fine. However, different brands of salted butter have different amounts of salt added, which makes it difficult to know how much total salt is going into your food. This is more problematic in baking. It's possible to easily oversalt or undersalt just by using a different brand — leading to unpredictable results. By using unsalted butter, the only salt remaining in the recipe is what you have added, and you have more careful control over the outcome. If you need to substitute one for another, you can estimate how much salt is in salted butter and adjust your recipe accordingly. If you are not sure whether a particular recipe calls for salted or unsalted, look for clues. If you have the time, interest, and money, you can try making the recipe twice (once with salted, once with unsalted butter) and see which tastes better. This is a bigger investment, though, so only worth doing if you really want to get the recipe as good as possible."
Is there a trick for softening butter quickly?,"Use a grater If your butter is too stiff, try using a cheese grater on it. The mechanical action will warm the butter slightly and soften it, and the huge increase in surface area will allow the room's ambient warmth to soften the butter much faster. Spread the butter shavings in a single layer to maximize surface area, and they should soften in a few minutes. You'll be unlikely to over-soften the butter with this method, so you won't run a risk of winding up with melted butter instead of softened butter."
How Can Cooked Meat Still Have Protein Value?,"Structural proteins in foods, i.e. albumin in eggs, myosin in muscle meats, gluten in wheat, are formed by amino acids in complex structures. Proteins are folded and clumped chains of peptides, and peptides are chains of amino acids. Your body uses stomach acid and proteases (enzymes) to break down proteins in digestion, but this requires time and energy (stomach churning, body heat). The amino acids are what your body requires. They're used to build more complex proteins. Cooking gives a head start in un-clumping/unfolding proteins, and in some conditions into peptides and amino acids, that are easier for your body to digest making them more 'bioavailable'. Some of these amino acids can be produced by your body using nitrogen compounds from breaking down other amino acids and nutrients. The ones your body can't produce on its own have to be obtained in the proteins you eat. These are called 'essential amino acids'. Different protein sources have different amino acid compositions, giving them different 'protein values' in how complete the range of essential amino acids are available; i.e. collagen/gelatin is a common structural protein that provides great texture for sensory applications, but the protein value is 0 for regulatory labelling requirements in some countries since it is missing an essential amino acid."
Is my microwave damaged if I can smell the food inside it?,"Microwave doors don't have an airtight seal; the window between the electronics and the cooking compartment is also not airtight, and the electronics are cooled by a fan. It would be surprising if some cooking smells didn't escape. In practice, every microwave I've ever had allows me to smell the cooking, from the very cheapest to some rather fancy ones with grill and convection.  This means that being able to smell the food cooking says nothing about the safety of the microwave, and you have no need to worry (unless there are other indications such as damage) "
What can be done with accidentaly oversalted beef?,"Oversalting is best dealt with by serious dilution.  I'd make a large, not very meaty dish from it, with lots of vegetables, cooked for a while. Fry onions and other veg, add liquid, and stir in the cooked beef. But soaking the meat should help as well. Either soak in plain water and discard the water, or soak in something you might add to the sauce (wine, beer, diluted citrus juice... ). I'd also cut it small before soaking/cooking. Most of the salt will be on the surface but you want to expose add much as possible of the meat to the liquid. Soaking should be done in the fridge, for a few hours. You could go for a tomato-based sauce, a curry using coconut milk, or a sticky orange and chilli sauce, so long as the ratio of beef to everything else (and beef to initial liquid) is small. The initial liquid shouldn't bring any more salt with it, which rules out most cmmercial stock preparations, and possbile home-made stock. These are just ideas, many beef in sauce dishes would adapt. I wouldn't add more meat, but many people would. "
How to keep onions from sinking in a salad,"This is physics. There's an effect called: ""Granular convection""
It's a phenomenon where if you have materials of different sizes in a container and vibrate or shake them, that the largest objects will move to the top and the smallest to the bottom. To keep the onion from sinking, you should make the chopped onion pieces bigger relative to the other ingredients in the salad. As you can see in JBentley's answer, in a salad where all ingredients are evenly chopped you won't get the sinking effect."
Is ground beef that was in the refrigerator for two weeks and has turned brown still usable?,"I'm not going to comment on whether or not it is safe, because that could be any number of issues other than the brown coloring of the meat. However, the brown in and of itself is not an issue. When meat is exposed to air it turns a brown color. This does not effect the falvor of the meat, but the color turns a lot of people off. Grocery stores will actually throw this meat away, not because it is bad but just because people won't buy it. Terribly wasteful.  From the USDA: Optimum surface color of fresh meat (i.e., cherry-red for beef; dark cherry-red for lamb; grayish-pink for pork; and pale pink for veal) is highly unstable and short-lived. When meat is fresh and protected from contact with air (such as in vacuum packages), it has the purple-red color that comes from myoglobin, one of the two key pigments responsible for the color of meat. When exposed to air, myoglobin forms the pigment, oxymyoglobin, which gives meat a pleasingly cherry-red color. The use of a plastic wrap that allows oxygen to pass through it helps ensure that the cut meats will retain this bright red color. However, exposure to store lighting as well as the continued contact of myoglobin and oxymyoglobin with oxygen leads to the formation of metmyoglobin, a pigment that turns meat brownish-red. This color change alone does not mean the product is spoiled"
How long can eggs be unrefrigerated before becoming unsafe to eat?,"The USDA, generally on the very safe but a bit paranoid end of the spectrum, says: After eggs are refrigerated, they need to stay that way. A cold egg left out at room temperature can sweat, facilitating the movement of bacteria into the egg and increasing the growth of bacteria. Refrigerated eggs should not be left out more than 2 hours. (They also say some very sad things about Easter egg hunts.) So if you're being strict, three days would be way too long. In reality, you'd probably be okay. The chances of getting salmonella are definitely higher, but are presumably still small (though I can't say exactly how small, of course). Personally, given the price of a dozen eggs, I'd probably play it safe. Another answer mentions that in the UK eggs are stored at room temperature. That's true in quite a lot of places, but I'm guessing that they've avoided the large temperature swing issue mentioned by the FDA, so if your friend's eggs were refrigerated in the store, the situation's not quite the same as in the UK."
"Why doesn't Greek cuisine use a lot of spices, compared to neighbors?","The question of ""why not"" is difficult to answer definitively, or really at all.  We can't ask folks 2000 years ago why they didn't care about cumin.  However, there are some historical impacts on Greek cuisine that bear on this, so let's explore them: You mention Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon as Greek neighbors.  But consider that Greece is also historically next to Austria, and currently next to Romania and Bulgaria, and is closer to Slovakia than it is to Lebanon.  So if you look at Greece as being midway between Syria and Kosovo, the frequency of spice use also puts it midway. Greek cuisine doesn't rely heavily on spices partly because it does rely heavily on herbs and alliums. Because of the climate, onions, garlic, leeks, parsley, dill, oregano, thyme, and others grow readily and plentifully all over the islands and peninsulas. So do citrus, also used for seasoning Greek dishes. Many Greek dishes will have onions, garlic, lemon, and as much as 2 cups of minced herbs in them.  Given this, one can see why Greek cooks didn't feel the need to add two teaspoons of cumin and dried peppers as well.  Italy, having a similar climate, largely takes a similar approach. One place where Greek spice usage is on a parallel with Syria is  in sweets.  The palette of spices used for Greek pastries, cookies, and cakes is as great as -- and extremely similar to -- the ones used in the Middle East.  This is undoubtedly because most places in the region got their sweet recipes from the Persian and Ottoman empires, so they're really the same recipes. Greece, like other ancient regions, includes multiple cuisines. Some of these use more spices than others, particularly Thrace. Note that above I'm using the term ""spices"" to refer to its accepted use, of ""aromatic seeds, stems, and bark""."
Should french fries be fried two times?,"The lower (first) temperature actually cooks the potato so that it is tender, the hotter temperature (second) is what gives the crispy golden coating. If you just did the lower temperature, your fries might be too soft. If you just did the hotter temperature they would be too too tough. "
What are the benefits and drawbacks of washing dishes in hot water?,"Before we proceed, we should note that not all dirty dishes are created equal. There are a few ""groups"" with different chemical and physical properties. Now unless you serve a very restricted breakfast, your dishes will likely contain something of each group above, so you need an adjusted approach: Those dishes that have starchy and protein-rich components may benefit from a cool rinse first. Then your dishes can go in the sink with quite warm water - hotter speeds up the ""loosening"" of fats and other crusts, but you need not ""boil"" your hands, gloved or not. Yet we still have to consider our nasty hitchhikers: 1 To be precise, it's a function over time and temperature, but that doesn't make much of a difference here."
Is there a substitute for tahini in hummus?,"Sort of. If you have sesame seeds on hand, grind some up. You could also use toasted sesame oil, and even combine it with the ground seeds. You can also use all-natural peanut butter. Don't use mass market crap with sugar and other additives. The ingredients should list only: peanuts, salt. Obviously, this will taste like peanuts. It will still taste good in a hummus, but it will be a distinctly different hummus than with tahini."
Why did my Turkey Stock turn into gelatin?,"If your stock turns to jelly in the fridge, it means you did it right! Simmering the bones breaks down the collagen and turns it into gelatin; that's the very essence of stock-making.  The gelatin is exactly what you want from the stock; at low temperatures it has a very jelly-like consistency, but at higher temperatures it melts and provides a very rich texture. The more you reduce the stock, the more gelatinous it will become, so if it turned out stiffer than you expected, it's probably because you let a lot of water evaporate.  Typically, when making stock, you use a very low simmer; just a few bubbles per minute.  Any more than that and your stock will reduce. But reducing is perfectly OK, and many cooks will reduce an entire pot of stock down to a few tablespoons; it's like bullion, only without all the salt and preservatives.  Heavily-reduced stock is called glace de viande and is often used to give a sauce or dish a little bit of extra kick, imparting a powerful meat flavour.  But you probably didn't reduce it that much. If you're finding it to be too concentrated or gelatinous, even at higher temperatures, you can feel free to dilute it.  For soups or sauces you can probably dilute it 1 for 1, but taste as you go along just to make sure you're not watering it down too much. When only the top layer of a stock solidifies in the refrigerator, it is probably fat, which you should skim off and discard (or reserve).  The rest is your actual stock, and in your case it sounds delicious. Also, since you mention vacuum-sealing - I prefer to use covered ice cube trays for freezing stock.  That lets you portion it out much more easily than a big solid blob."
Potato for a purpose,"If the potatoes are the same in different packages, it's just marketing. Some potatoes are better for baking, some for frying, some for mashing... It mostly depends on the starch content. See. https://www.thekitchn.com/know-your-potato-which-variety-is-best-for-mashing-roasting-baking-178265 or ""Potatoes fall into two important categories that impact the outcome of your dish: starchy and waxy (plus a category that lies somewhere in between those two)."" https://www.huffpost.com/entry/types-of-potatoes_n_4877050"
How do I get better at tasting?,"You get better through concentration and lack of distractions. Just as you shouldn't eat while watching TV. You'll miss all the flavors. Sit back. Take small samples. Let it lay or slosh around in your mouth for a while--several seconds at least. Think about what you taste and feel. Soon you will find those one-tone flavors have a background to them or a subtle second or third flavor coming out of nowhere. After a while, you'll start noticing those underlying flavors every time you use that ingredient and notice it missing when you have a not-so-good variety."
How much caffeine would there be if I reuse tea leaves in a second brewing?,"In general it looks like 65-75% of the total caffeine comes out in the first steeping, while 20-25% comes out in the second steeping.

Does kimchi go bad?,"A great resource for how long foods can be kept is Stilltasty.com.  According to them, commercially bottled pickles (and kimchee would fall into this category) can be kept after opening for one year in the refrigerator. "
Why is it important to add salt during cooking?,"A few general reasons: As soegaard says, the salt is often better distributed through the food if it's added during cooking. This is especially true for foods which have been carefully assembled; you can't always just stir things up! Some foods also take a while for flavors to soak through; think about potatoes in a chunky soup. If you add salt only at the table, the liquid will benefit, but the potatoes will generally taste bland, like they were unsalted. Then there are things where it really needs to be cooked in - I doubt many people want to sprinkle salt on a chocolate chip cookie. Sometimes the quantities need to be pretty small, so mixing a small amount into the whole recipe is doable, while if you tried to add it at the table, even a little sprinkle would be too much. Baked goods are a good example here too. Virtually everyone likes at least a little salt, so it's usually quite safe to add at least a little. The food will end up tasting good to many people, and then some can add more. Often the groups of people that we eat with have similar enough tastes that it's a non-issue. Sometimes salt actually affects the cooking process, not just the flavor. It can help draw moisture out of sweating vegetables, softening them faster. It's abrasive (before dissolving, of course), and can help denature proteins. But of course, if you're eating with people who don't like much salt at all, and salt can easily be added at the table (a pureed soup, for example), then there's nothing wrong with waiting until then."
How to caramelise onions?,"Low and slow is the only way to go, I'm afraid. You can add some broth and simmer them down (as opposed to just cooking them in oil) but make sure you add little enough that it will all evaporate...Don't want to be pouring off flavor."
How can I get my bread to be more fluffy and less dense?,"A big factor besides the dough is the temperature at which you bake the bread. If you are not baking it at some recipe specified temperature you are probably playing on the safe side and your breads won't raise much. You have to heat the CO2 pockets quickly so that they expand before the dough hardens. The more temperature you can give it the better. Another possible factor may be the yeast. Are you waiting enough? Are you using enough? Like temperature, more yeast and longer fermentation times can't go wrong."
What are the pros and cons of Convection Microwave Ovens?,"It is a combination of a regular convection oven with a microwave, so you have both hot air and microwaves cooking your food. So the advantage is you get the quick interior heating of the microwaves combined with the surface browning from the hot air; convection just makes that hot air cooking faster and more even."
What are the differences between types of soy sauce?,"This is a complex question, because there are several different ways to categorize soy sauces:  To muddy the waters further, add into the mix the fact that flavor is most deeply influenced by the proportion of soybeans to grains -- yet this crucial factor is not typically used directly as a categorization tool. To focus my research, I tried to find a site that felt as though the writer was speaking directly to you: one that would encourage, and not overwhelm or confuse, as you decide whether to become a soy sauce affectionado.  Specifically, I wanted a resource that clearly addressed FLAVOR PROFILE and USAGE.  Surprisingly, a blogger named Barbara came to rest as my #1 recommendation:  Tigers and Strawberries. I like the simplicity and clarity of her writing style, as well as her experiential platform (complete with honest explanation of her biases).  The endless comments after her post provide additional insights that might be helpful, as well. Of course, Harold McGee always provides wonderful more scientifically-based, yet still somehow understandable, explanations.  He takes 5 full pages (496-500) in his book On Food and Cooking to discuss soy sauce in all its layered glory.   "
Is the yellow skin of a raw chicken indicating that it has been dyed?,"In the EU to call a chicken ""corn chicken"" you need to tick some boxes while growing it: And European corn chicken have a yellowish tint to it, not so bright like in your photo.
Here you can see a photo of typical one https://edlesfleisch.de/produkt/kikok-maishaehnchen/
Notice that the end of wings and middle of breast are pink. Those places should be like that, the color should not be uniform. From all the things you listed everything is (and can be) true. They don't need to occur at once (because there is no reason for that) but one of them is enough (apart maybe from that grass thing that's BS, grass would be around 20-30% of range free chicken diet, assuming they have enough grass to feed all the chickens and they don't stampede it). But, again, the amount of yellow is crucial. Scalding chicken with boiling water will give very, very light yellow tint to the skin. But again, only if the chicken is raised properly before. So I wouldn't say those things on your list are misinformation. I would say you would need to know how to check your chicken. For example, look at the feet against the women apron. One of them is very not yellow. That should give you a clue that those are not natural pigment in the skin.
Corn feed chicken is also usually smaller than regular chickens so just by comparing the size can clue you if the color is due to fodder (and that also contradict that it's caused by bird feed to make them puffier) To answer question in the title: Yellow color is a clue of dye only if occurs with other things. Color by itself is not an indication."
Shiny side or not for foil?,"I've been told that the shiny side should go on the inside for cooking, and the outside for freezing.  In other words, do you want to reflect the heat into the food, or away from the food? However, common sense (which fails very often) tells me that with the temperature ranges involved, any benefit is marginal, if it exists at all.   The only time it might matter, is if you were trying to warm something up in the sun.  Then it might make a difference. EDIT:  From The Straight Dope: The truth is that the shiny side is
  not treated with a dangerous chemical.
  Mineral oil is used as a lubricant
  during the rolling process, some trace
  of which may remain on the finished
  foil--but it's not dangerous. The
  shiny side is shiny because of the way
  foil is made. During the last pass
  through the rolling mill, a double
  thickness of foil is run between the
  rollers. The side of each sheet that
  comes in contact with the polished
  steel rollers comes out shiny. The
  other side has a matte finish. http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1135/should-a-baking-potato-be-wrapped-in-foil-shiny-side-in-or-shiny-side-out ALSO The official word from the Reynolds
  aluminum people is as follows: ""It
  makes little difference which side of
  the Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil you
  use--both sides do the same fine job
  of cooking, freezing, and storing
  food. There is a slight difference in
  the reflectivity of the two sides, but
  it is so slight that laboratory

  it."""
Why do some recipes recommend Kosher salt?,"As Kosher salt goes there is also a difference in the types.  Many chefs (myself included) recommend and prefer Diamond Crystal brand Kosher salt.  Diamond Crystal (owned by Cargill) uses a patented process of producing salt known as the Alberger Process.  In in the interest of keeping the explanation simple, essentially it creates flat salt crystals with a hollow diamond shape and jagged edges.  The hollow shape provides for quicker dissolution and the jagged edges help it stick to food better rather than bouncing off as is the nature of the cubic structure of basic table salt.  For this reason many seasoning and food manufacturers use Alberger salt as a ""dry emulsifier"".  I was on a tour with Paul Prudhomme at his seasoning plant near New Orleans and he explained that the jagged edges help to keep it suspended and blended with other seasonings and dry ingredients.  Morton's kosher salt is composed of large crystals that are rolled to flatten them.  They are flat but not hollow so take a bit longer than Diamond Crystal to dissolve.   Morton's Kosher salt also has Yellow Prussiate of Soda added to it as an anti-caking agent (""when it rains it pours"") which tends to leave a slight bitter (not as bad as iodine) taste in the back of the throat.  Diamond Crystal brand is simply salt. Alberger salt has a lighter bulk weight than granulated salt so 1 teaspoon of Diamond Crystal salt is going to be less salt than either table or Morton's kosher salt.  Look at the two packages side by side in the store sometime.  They are both 3# boxes but the Diamond Crystal box is much taller due to the increased volume of the hollow crystals.  Looking at the nutritional information panels you'll also notice the serving size for each is 1/4 teaspoon but the Morton's has 418 gr. sodium per serving vs. about 200 for Diamond crystal (again, due to hollow crystals).  Some people recommend increasing salt by 25% when using Diamond Crystal in recipes.  In cooking you can easily salt to taste and know that since it dissolves more readily you should be able to determine seasoning by taste without oversalting.  In baking I typically use it measure for measure and haven't had any major issues yet.  In yeast doughs however you must be cautious to make sure that the crystals do dissolve in the liquid so as not to cut through the gluten strands during the kneading process (as well as to evenly disperse)."

How long is it safe to drink coffee after brewed?,"If it's refrigerated, it'll last for at least a week, as long as you didn't pre-dairy it.  Unrefrigerated, I wouldn't trust it for more than a day. Coffee is a crappy growth medium and it should start out the next best thing to sterile, but, even covered, its going to start to get moldy. Obviously if you add dairy, then you're dealing with that dairy shelf-life, and that isn't very long at all."
