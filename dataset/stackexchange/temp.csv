Do different beer glass shapes really make a difference in taste?,"Yes.  Taste is really smell, and different glasses can capture aromas differently.  Furthermore, different aromas may be more or less present dependent upon temperature, and a glass may be crafted to be held a particular way (gathering more or less heat from your hand).  The same is true for wine glasses. That said, how much of a difference it makes to you is what's important.  Going back to the wine comparison, I can sometimes tell the difference between different glasses, but not consistently.  So it's not the most important thing. Now that that's said, there has been some informal, perhaps less than perfectly scientific studies, including a blind test.  Beer advocate provides some more detailed information.  Some of my local bars carry stemware for specific European beers, and I know of one stateside brewery, Black Shirt Brewing in Denver, which really wants you to stick your nose up in it (to good effect, in my experience)."
Do cans change the taste of beer?,"First, I love this question because it is actually interesting. I researched this when I noticed that bottled coke tasted so much better than canned coke. Cans keep out all light so the contents actually never become tainted. The reason that most like bottled over canned is because they like the taste with those impurities. 
Some complain that they can taste aluminum with cans, but this is more than likely in their head since cans are lined with a thin layer of plastic.  I like certain beers better in cans and certain ones better in bottles. I would try both :)"
Where can I find open APIs about beer?,"There are a number of beer-related APIs available.  RateBeer does have a JSON API, but it's apparently currently unavailable and I don't know if they intend on making it available again or not.    Here are several that I've found: Brewery DB has an API that can return JSON, XML, or PHP, and from their API documentation, it appear that they have quite a bit of info available about both breweries and beers.  Open Beer Database is a beer API, but it appears that it's still under development and may be unstable, so YMMV. The Beer Spot offers an API that includes some social aspects, such as what people are drinking, and ratings, but not as much in the way of rich data about the beers themselves.    Untappd is another social/beer app that offers an API, but you need an account on the site to view the documentation and they seem to be a bit more strict in that they have to actually review and approve your app idea before they'll give you an API key.  Open Food Facts while not limited to beers, has 1500 of them and an API with barcodes, nutrition, ingredients… It's fully opendata and collaborative, meaning you can upload new beers from their mobile apps. There are others, but those are a few of the most common and/or promising from what I've seen. "
How can I tell whether a beer will improve with age?,"There are a couple of considerations, although this is far from a complete answer. First, a stronger (higher ABV) beer will tend to cellar better, as the alcohol can act to help prevent oxidization. Second, a beer with less emphasis on hops, and more on malt, yeast, or other characteristics, will be a better candidate, because the qualities that hops impart will fade in a fairly short time.  This is why your IPAs and such should be consumed sooner than later -- the character is primarily in the hops. The purpose of cellaring a beer is to see its improvement over time.  Some may stay exactly the same, which others will change.  I think the answer there lies in whether there is still active yeast or bacteria in the bottle, and whether there is anything for them to chew on.  Some styles (lambics, for example) are far more prone to this, but I don't think there's a hard and fast rule that one couple follow."
What is the difference between an ale and a lager?,"Ale yeast strains are best used at temperatures ranging from 10 to 25°C, though some strains will not actively ferment below 12°C (33). Ale yeasts are generally regarded as top-fermenting yeasts since they rise to the surface during fermentation, creating a very thick, rich yeast head. That is why the term ""top-fermenting"" is associated with ale yeasts. Fermentation by ale yeasts at these relatively warmer temperatures produces a beer high in esters, which many regard as a distinctive character of ale beers.  Top-fermenting yeasts are used for brewing ales, porters, stouts, Altbier, Kölsch, and wheat beers. * Lager yeast strains are best used at temperatures ranging from 7 to 15°C. At these temperatures, lager yeasts grow less rapidly than ale yeasts, and with less surface foam they tend to settle out to the bottom of the fermenter as fermentation nears completion. This is why they are often referred to as ""bottom"" yeasts. The final flavour of the beer will depend a great deal on the strain of lager yeast and the temperatures at which it was fermented.  Some of the lager styles made from bottom-fermenting yeasts are Pilsners, Dortmunders, Märzen, Bocks, and American malt liquors.*  (All information from BeerAdvocate.)"
Does beer really go bad after the 'best before'-date?,"The beer will not be bad in the sense of unsafe to drink, since no harmful pathogens grow once the beer is fully fermented. So you can certainly drink the beer. However, the beer may not taste good! Over time, the beer will oxidize, both from oxygen introduced during packaging, but also through the release of oxygen from compounds previously oxidized in the beer. The oxygen causes the beer to stale, producing tones of sherry, paper, cardboard. Hop aromas are muted, and hop beta acids oxidize to produce an unrefined bitterness. Other forms of staling can lead to a soap taste. Generally, the higher the alcohol content of the beer the less you need to be concerned with the use by date. "
Does beer suffer from being warmed and then rechilled?,"TL DR; No. Beer flavor changes over time (hops fade away, oxidation takes hold, etc.), and this process happens more quickly at warmer temperatures than colder ones. But there are no additional chemical reactions caused by temperature changes, so warming to room temperature and re-chilling multiple times is not going to have any added effects on the beer. Assuming you are drinking it within a few weeks, you won't notice the difference with bottled or canned beer. I think this myth took hold from left-over kegs after parties: A half-empty keg that was dispensed by pumping air into it will start to oxidize much more quickly since oxygen is being added to it. When it warms the oxidation speeds up and it tastes stale within a day or two. Keeping it cold slows that down a bit, but even cold it won't last very long. A keg being dispensed using CO2 is a different story: that will last as long as bottled beer and can be warmed and rechilled without ill effects. In all of this, I am referring to room temperature. Beer left in a car in the sun for hours will start to stale much more quickly, even if bottles are protected from the sunlight. You won't get the skunky flavor caused by the light, but it will taste stale."
What's the difference between a porter and a stout?,"Beer Connoisseur Online answers this pretty thoroughly in an article.   The TLDR: is that ""...originally a stout was a strong version of a porter.  Today, the difference is whatever you want it to be."" For an interesting history on the term Stout and the style of beer, you can check out this history of stout article provided by Eric Deloak.  Similarly you can read a history of porter article written by the same author: Gregg Smith"
Difference between Whiskey and Bourbon?,"Bourbon is a type of whiskey, whereas not all whiskies are bourbons! Bourbon is a type of whiskey that gets its name from Bourbon County, Kentucky, where it originated. Bourbon tends to be amber-colored, and a little sweeter and heavier in texture than other whiskeys.  What make a bourbon a bourbon and not just an ordinary whiskey? The following is from Men's Journal: What, Exactly, Is the Difference Between Bourbon and Whiskey? The most popular form of American whiskey is bourbon, which has its own specific definition.  ""Bourbon needs to be produced in America and made from 51 percent corn, and whisky does not,"" says Maker's Mark Master Distiller Greg Davis. Bourbon also needs to be stored in new charred-oak barrels, whereas whiskey barrels do need to be oak but not new or charred. ""Lastly, to be called bourbon, the liquid needs to be distilled to no more than 160 proof and entered into the barrel at 125."" For other whiskies the liquid must be distilled to no more than 190 proof. David notes that this isn't just common practice — ""it's actual bourbon law.""   What Makes a Bourbon: A Cheat Sheet •Must be made in the United States. •Must contain 51 percent corn. •Must be aged in new oak charred barrels. •Must be distilled to no more than 160 proof and entered into the barrel at 125 proof. •Must be bottled at no less than 80 proof. •Must not contain any added flavoring, coloring or other additives. The following is taken from Bourbon vs. Whiskey:  Somewhat like champagne isn't champagne unless it's made in Champagne, France, Bourbon is not actually ""Bourbon"" if it is made outside the USA, even though other whiskeys may adhere to the same recipe and distillation guidelines.  Tennessee Whiskey The legal requirements for whiskey to be called Tennessee Whiskey are that the whiskey should be:  -distilled in Tennessee  -made from at least 51% corn  -filtered through maple charcoal, and  -aged in new, charred oak barrels. This is the process by which Jack Daniel's is manufactured. The company is the largest whiskey producer in Tennessee and wields an outsize influence on liquor laws in the state; they lobbied the state legislature to create such stringent requirements for labeling Tennessee Whiskey. Other whiskey producers in the state, including UK-based Diageo that owns Tennessee's No. 2 whiskey distiller George Dickel, oppose these criteria and are lobbying to have them loosened.  Some consider Tennessee Whiskey a Bourbon, while most do not. The fact remains that both Tennessee Whiskey and Jack Daniel's are filtered through maple charcoal making them a different product.  Addendum What is scotch? The main difference between scotch and whisky is geographic, but also ingredients and spellings. Scotch is whisky made in Scotland, while bourbon is whiskey made in the U.S.A, generally Kentucky. Scotch is made mostly from malted barley, while bourbon is distilled from corn. If you’re in England and ask for a whisky, you’ll get Scotch. But in Ireland, you’ll get Irish whiskey (yep, they spell it differently for a little colour). How long should Scotch Whisky be aged? It is not possible to lay down any precise age as being the best for a particular whisky. Generally speaking, Malt Whiskies require longer to mature fully than Grain Whiskies. UK and EU law insist that Scotch Whisky should be at least three years old. However, it is the practice of the trade to mature for substantially longer than the legal minimum. What is rye? Rye whisky, like its name suggests, is a whiskey that is distilled from at least 51% rye. What is rye? Rye is a type of grass that is a member of the wheat tribe and closely related to barley.  Canadian whisky is simply a rye whisky."
Why is it important to have foam on a beer?,"Most importantly, a good head helps release the aromas of the beer, especially the hops. Aroma is everything for enjoyment of a good brew. When enjoying a super-hoppy IPA, you should always use a glass that provides a large surface area for aromatics to rise from. It can also provide the a pleasant mouth feel. Stouts definitely benefit from a thick, silky head. And lastly, it's eye candy. As for the right amount of head, it varies. Generally in an average pint glass you want 1-2 finger-widths of head. Some hefeweizens and wit beers are best with a bit more."
