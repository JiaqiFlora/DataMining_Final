Reading PDFs on Kindle device,"It is possible, but will need prior processing for optimal results. You can use the free tool k2pdfopt to optimize PDFs for your reader's display size. It can handle up to four columns, works with ""normal"" (using actual stings in the PDF) as well as scanned text and will turn your input PDF into a PDF with more pages optimized for your screen's size. Newer versions of the program can even text. Text reflow preserves images and even mathematical formulas -- which is something that Sony's built-in text reflow cannot do. Download the program, set the options for your reader on a Windows/Mac/Linux machine and generate a new PDF with only one column, cropped margins and possibly larger letters. The conversion progress is largely automatic, just give it a try. If you do not mind jailbreaking your reader, there are also PDF viewers that include k2pdfopt and so you can change font size and other parameters on the fly. These also have the advantage that you can use the PDF's table of contents (something the official PDF viewer does not support). The readers are all forked from the same project and only differ in how you input your data. They are KOReader (for Kobos, Pocketbooks, reMarkable and Kindles with a touch screens), KindlePDFViewer (for Kindles with keyboard) and Librerator (for Kindles with neither touch nor keyboard). A clear disadvantage is that these programs seem to drain more battery than the official PDF viewer, but on the other hand reading is more convenient, because you can still read in portrait mode and your pages are preprocessed in the background (turning pages feels faster in large PDFs with many images). And battery life is still several weeks. Other than this you can of course read in landscape mode. This can be quite annoying with multicolumn documents or if you want to go back just one page to look something up (may feel slow). It is fine for texts you read without going back and it's still the way to go e.g. if you have large tables in your document. I used it for text books as well for years, so it is not too annoying. Another option is converting the PDF to Mobi using Calibre or Amazon's mailing service. This will usually fail completely in multicolumn documents, will remove images and destroy mathematical formulas. It will also often lead to page numbers or chapter names (if it is written on top of every page) in between the text."
How can I convert an HTML site into an ebook?,"Of course you can. The easiest method is  Here's the official Amazon page documenting this feature. If it's not what you want, you can use Calibre to convert HTML to various ebook formats, here is the official documentation. And even more, you can download the official Kindlegen Linux CLI tool from Amazon and hand tailor the downloaded HTML with your favourite editor then convert it. (And you can download the official Python docs in EPUB format which Amazon happily convert for you (the mailing method), and every other conversion option I had mentioned above will work with the EPUB too.)"
Any way to find a lost Kindle inside a house?,"The OP's solution is below. Adding as a community wiki Answer and removing the solution edits from the Question. Found the Kindle using the sniffing technique described below. However I'd still like to know if there's a way to find it that's less overkill. I discovered that the Kindle updates its contents daily while in deep sleep around 5:30-6:30AM. So I set up the delivery of a biggish pdf file through the kindle email so I'd ensure a long enough connection, end set up three laptops with a Kali Linux running live with airodump sniffing packages (modified from here: http://www.androidauthority.com/capture-data-open-wi-fi-726356/  ) The following procedure can be used to physically find any active wifi device connected to a network: Three lines of code in the terminal in at least three Kali Linux running devices (2D location, at least 4 receivers out of plane for 3D): To start monitor mode on a wifi card (in this case wlan0, check on iwconfig if needed):   Airmon usually changes the card name to wlan[n]mon after this. Check the wifi interface name on iwconfig and modify accordingly if the next line returns a related error. Then run airodump to find your wifi network and its channel: Enter Ctrl-C to end the capture once you note the desired network's channel Run the following line to run airodump again only at the specified channel and record the data to the ""allthedata.csv"" file in the terminal directory (usually the root for a live cd/usb if you didn't change it). Replace the square brackets by the channel number: I started the pcs before going to sleep and as I woke up a bit past the usual update time, I hit ctrl-C to stop the capture and looked up the device on the allthedata.csv files by its MAC number which can be obtained at the router logs. There are in fact 4 allthedata files with different extensions per capture, and on the xml you can find the manufacturer of the device in the logs, so even if you don't know the mac address by looking up an Amazon branded device connected to your router you may find the Kindle entry. At the Kindle entry, find the signal strength value and note it for all the receiver computers.
Then convert the values from dbm to mW using the following formula: mW=10^(dBm/10)*1000. To triangulate the signal (for a 2D location), draw a chart with the position of the laptop wifi receivers and for every pair of receivers, draw a line perpendicular to the line going through the points in a point inversely proportional to the square root of the mW power values, as the signal drops of proportionally to the square of the distance (for 3D use at least 4 receivers and a surface between the points). The lines should cross at the source of the emission - the Kindle was at a closet in this case. The margin of error was about 1m/3ft even with several concrete/brick walls in between the receivers and the emission. Notes: This simplified location approach is only possible if the emitter is located in between the receivers, that is, a three-set of receivers (2D) form a triangle that has the emitter inside it. Different receivers might have different antenna gains and correcting for it will greatly increase accuracy. A quick and dirty way of doing so is positioning the receivers at the same position from a constant power emitter (wifi router, for example) and using the signal strength value difference between them as a calibration factor to be subtracted it from the signals received afterwards."
Is Markdown a viable source format for writing ebooks?,The answer is yes. You can use John MacFarlane's Pandoc to directly generate EPUB 2 or EPUB 3 from markdown.
Is there any software that facilitates scanning of a paper book into an ebook?,Tesseract is an open source OCR engine that gives fairly good results. It's my understanding that Google use it for Google Books. OCRFeeder is a project for document layout analysis that works as a nice GUI for Tesseract. Ocropus is another known open source OCR system.
How to create clickable table of contents in a PDF?,"Well, you could always buy a copy of Adobe Acrobat, which is actually designed solely for the purpose of creating and editing PDF files. Or you could import the file into Calibre, convert it to ePub format, edit the ePub to add the table of contents, then convert it back to PDF. There are other free tools for working with PDF directly. If you do a Google search, you would find this page which lists several free tools for editing or modifying PDF in various ways."
Clean up converted ebook,"Calibre has a feature that allows you to unpack an ePub file into the component parts (usually chapters), which you can then edit. When you have finished your edits, Calibre will repackage them back into an ePub file. From the main Calibre view, right click on the book listing. You should get a popup menu with an option to ""Edit book"". Selecting this will give you a book editing window where you can edit the individual parts of the book."
Are there any ebook search engines?,"The one I use is Luzme It queries several stores including Kobo, Amazon, B&N and in several countries. It then for each book shows the price that it last saw for each source and country. It is searchable by book name and author and series, although the series data is not complete as it comes from the stores. You can set up a wishlist of books and emails can be sent when they change price. This site does provide DRM status if the store makes that data available. The format is not shown however Amazon sites provide Kindle format and others at least ePub - I would be interested in any exceptions"
What information does my Kindle share with Amazon?,"Hard to guess what information sends or what the device can do when connected via WiFi when this information is not open and probable it will not be.  Take as an example this incident( article excerpt/ my emphasis): Amazon Erases Orwell Books From Kindle ... Digital books bought for the Kindle are sent to it over a wireless
  network. Amazon can also use that network to synchronize electronic
  books between devices — and apparently to make them vanish. ... and also this incident where the account was also closed(excerpt/my emphasis): Why did amazon close a woman’s account and delete all her kindle books? ... According to Amazon’s terms of use, “Kindle Content is licensed, not
  sold, to you by the Content Provider.” It states that “Risk of loss
  for Kindle Content transfers when you download or access the Kindle
  Content.” ... This are by no means isolated, and are a far cry from the Privacy Notice you mentioned, and made me keep always the Wi-Fi off and backup my documents."
If I buy a Kindle Paperwhite do I have to get books from Amazon?,"Kindle devices allow you to load non-Amazon files onto them; you can copy them directly to your device using a micro-USB cable, or have them sent to your device wirelessly, through Amazon's Kindle Personal Documents service. You are limited to the types of files supported on the Kindle: at present, these are .azw, .azw1, .txt, .mobi, and .prc. In addition, Kindle can read .pdf files (but these keep the pre-formatted paging and layout of the original file, rather than the dynamic/flowing text of an ebook.) It is extremely easy to convert files into Kindle-supported formats from other popular formats -- such as .epub files, Word documents, and web pages. Amazon's Personal Documents Service can help you with transfer and conversion, and Calibre is an extremely popular tool for ebook-management which provides such conversions easily. PDF files which are mostly text are also quite easy to convert to a supported ebook format. The one big wrinkle in the all-around compatibility I'm describing here is that books protected by DRM (a Digital Rights Management scheme), the DRM prevents it from being converted into different formats. So an ebook you buy at barnesandnoble.com, which is formatted and protected exclusively for the B&N Nook e-reader, cannot be easily converted for the Kindle.  Many major ebook retailers rely on DRM to help ""lock you in"" to their specific device, platform, and store. So basically, ebooks you get at non-Amazon stores are unlikely to be compatible with the Kindle (unless they specifically note that the ebook has no DRM), whereas ebooks from other sources (e.g. the out-of-copyright classics at Project Gutenberg, or ebooks you create yourself using a service like Instapaper) should present no difficulty."
How does the Kindle's reading rate algorithm work?,"I realize this is quite an old question, but I can provide some more detailed information.  My source of this information is a combination of Kindle log files and de-compiled Java classes for the ReadingTimer package. There is a lot of detail behind the statistical methods they use to avoid incorporating outliers into their calculations that I have uncovered - but I won't go into that detail here. Basically, every time that you turn a ""page"" on a kindle, they capture the time you spent on the page (in milliseconds), and the number of words on each page.  They call this an ""Interval"". They calculate an Interval words per minute (WPM), and if that calculated WPM is > 900, they exclude that observation from the sampling methodology they use.  If the WPM value is < 900 - well then it gets complicated. It's nowhere near as simple as just averaging together all of the IntervalWPM observations.  There are outlier discovery, normal distribution, z-score testing and other statistical methods utilized. But, from a drastically oversimplified perspective, those Interval WPM's are used to construct a statistically robust TotalWPM.  That TotalWPM is, roughly, the average (but not really the average) WPM for the specific book you are reading. So, bottom line, they do actually have a limit on how fast someone could read: 900 WPM - which is about 3.5 times more than the commonly recognized average reading rate of a random individual (native English speaker reading English). And on the flipside, they do not technically have a limit on how slow someone could read.  What they have is a limit on how much slower someone reads any specific page relative to their normal reading rate (which is tracked across books by using something called the GlobalWPM).  So - if you start with a fresh kindle and only read 2 words per minute, that will be your acceptable baseline rate. I have, of course, drastically oversimplified what's going on behind the scenes.  The ReadingTimer code is fairly complex, and with how much information is lost between a decompiled Java class and the original Java code - figuring out what its doing is quite time consuming. Hope that helps."
Are there any WYSIWYG editors for EPUB books?,"When someone asks me what GUI to use I suggest Sigil. I find that Sigil, unlike it's alternatives, does not add unneeded code to your ePubs which cause bloating, errors, and slower viewing.  Its code is also on github."
What are the differences between EPUB2 and EPUB3?,"According to this page, EPUB3 adds, changes or improves: Things that have been removed:"
Does a “one-fits-all” file format exist or should I offer multiple ebook formats?,"Virtually all e-book readers can display PDF files. Unfortunately, PDF documents are ""pre-rendered"" - the text is positioned on the page in absolute coordinates and text cannot reflow on smaller / larger devices (without hacks or trickery that rarely work well). TXT files are a good option if formatting isn't a concern. Most e-book readers can display TXT files (I just double-checked that they work out-of-the-box on my Kindle Touch). The downside, of course, is that you cannot use any formatting. This leaves you with two common formats: This page displays a table of devices and their supported formats. I would actually suggest a completely different approach - produce content using a markup language (like Markdown or HTML) and then use a tool to convert the files to the e-book formats you wish to support. Tools like Calibre support nearly every format under the sun, so you can choose as many formats as you want."
Updating EPUB book author and title metadata,"As you are on Linux, the way to do this is to change to the directory at the base of your library and do: This way you polish them all in one go."
How do I publish a book permanently free on Amazon,"Amazon does still do the price matching, and that is the only way to get your book listed as free on their site. The advantage of Smashwords is in distributing to Apple and Sony. If you go to your e-book's details page on Amazon, you will see a link that says ""tell us about a lower price"". You can click that link and provide them a link to the product page for your free book at one of the other sites, and eventually they will match it. Again, this seems to be more effective with Apple and Sony. The process may take a week or two, so if you can get others to click that link and share the news, it will help speed things up. If you want to make your book free for a limited time or on a specific date, I would definitely NOT recommend this approach. There is no way to control how quickly or when Amazon will respond, so you won't be able to determine the specific date(s). Also, if you think you may want to raise the price back up after a while, I would not recommend doing this. I have one title that I published under a pseudonym that has been free for months, in spite of the fact that I have raised the price on all other sites and tried repeatedly to get Amazon to raise the price. "
If a book doesn't have DRM does that mean it is OK to give a copy to my friend to read?,"NO! Every eBook is released under a licence.  Even if there is no licence specifically identified then it is covered under the general copyright law.  If you purchased the book and it was not released under a licence that permits redistribution then you should assume that giving away copies to friends is forbidden. Generally you can find the licence that the book was released under listed in the first few pages of the book, usually before any of the main content.  There are some licences that permit redistribution either for a fee or not.  Most licencing restricts distribution to those people who have a specific distribution licence and pay the appropriate royalties and fees to the publisher and author. There is some question about older books that are public domain.  The content of the book(the text) is the only thing that is public domain.  The Ebook has added markup and is covered under copyright laws as a new creation.  You can still use the public domain content as permitted, but the markup and any images included that are not public domain images are covered.  Also just because you are in a country that may not enforce copyright and licencing from the country of origin, does not mean that the copyright does not exist. In real world terms, think of it as an analogy to walking down a street and seeing a house that has no door lock. Is it OK to enter the house and take anything in it, just because there's no door lock preventing you from doing so? No.  And even if the police will not arrest you that does not mean that it is acceptable to do so."
"How to synchronize Kindle collections across all devices, including older Kindles?","I am guessing you have already found Amazon's Organizing Your Kindle Content.  If every book on your devices is from Amazon, then you can do some organizing at 'Your Account' > 'Manage Your Device' > 'Your Kindle Library' or by using the cloud.  If you have works from anyplace else, then the prospects get worse. I personally have some OCD issues that require my books be in some kind of order that is not primary based on who I bought it from and when.  I was trying to keep track organized with an Excel book.  I searched for solutions and read many articles & blogs, I strongly desired an Amazon/Kindle solution, the majority pointed to a single solution which I eventually adopted.  Calibre is that solution.  The only disadvantage the Calibre has it is a bit more difficult to connect wirelessly to your collection. I won't go into all it's advantages but, essentially it is your own personal library, that you can organize and store you books on, regardless of where it comes from.  My 1263 (current count) works are stored on Calibre, I download from Amazon, Smashword, Baen, Project Gutenberg, etc. directly to Calibre (on my pc).  Once a week or so, I sit down at the PC, remove some books from my Kindles, mark them as read on Calibre (tag 'read'), add some new books to the appropriate kindle ('paperwhite' for reading in bed, 'keyboard' for text to speech while commuting) and tag the books I am currently reading in Calibre by the device they are on. I believe there is at least one wireless solution for connecting your Kindle to your Calibre, but in the end I stuck with using the USB connection, as by the time I need to move some books around, I need a recharge, so i get a two for one deal (load and charge)."
What commands can be given in the Kindle's search box?,"At least the following are supposed to work, although I haven't verified them: As @Tim pointed out in the comments, ~usbNetwork is non-standard, and some of the other ""searches"" on here may be hacks that require installation of additional software. The following may be Touch-only; I can't verify this: The following are apparently Paperwhite-only, but I can't verify this: Source Here is an interesting tutorial on how to root your Kindle (not directly relevant to the question, in that it's not just a list of search commands, but relevant to Kindle hacking generally)."

Are there good ebook management tools available for free?,"Calibre is a free and open source e-book library management application available. You can download from here which is available for all operating systems. Adobe Digital Editions is also one of the e-book manager by Adobe. You can access it from here. Alfa Ebooks Manager features a lot of templates and options for library vizualization. Besides, it allows to update book data from multiple web sources (like Amazon, Google Books, Barnes & Nobel, etc). It's also good at file management and metadata extraction. You can download it from here. Delicious Library's a bit different. Actually it's a software not just for books but for managing all stuff at your home. It's greates feature - entering books via webcam shot (it recognizes ISBN code). This feature makes Delicious Library the best software for collecting paper books. You can see the details from here. And if you are a mac user Delicious Library is the best e-book manager but unfortunately it's not free. Second priority I will give to Alfa eBooks Manager. Hope it will help!"

How can I reduce the resolution of images in an epub or mobi file?,I had a similar situation: a 134 MB .mobi that I wanted to shrink. Here's how I reduced the file size to 26 MB.  The key to this approach is that an .epub is actually just a zipped web page with image files in it.

What is the minimum required content for a valid ePub?,"Here's an epub 3.0 file that validates with epubcheck 3.0.1 (the current version at the time of writing). There's plenty more info that can (and should) go in there, of course, but you asked for minimums. We'll start with file structure:  in the root directory, there's one mimetype file and two folders--the OEBPS and the META-INF. Here's the mimetype file contents: be sure not to have any return/line break characters in there.
In the META-INF folder, there's one file, the container.xml: In the OEBPS folder, things get slightly more complex. First is the content.opf file: Then comes the toc.xhtml file: And finally we have the content of the ebook itself, in this case 1_hello.xhtml: As a bonus, there's a toc.ncx file. This is not required to be valid, but it's required if you want the book to have a working Table of Contents on epub 2.0.1 devices (which is pretty much all of them): And there's also the template.css in there, which is just a CSS stylesheet.

Anonymous publishing,"If your work is going to be successful enough to make it cost effective to set up all the legal niceties of staying hidden.  There is no possible way to guarantee you will keep your anonymity.  The recent article JK Rowling lawyer fined over Robert Galbraith leak(BBC 2 January 2014) is but one example of failure. If you are already an established author, your risk of exposure increases.  If you are not already an established author, your potential for recouping expenses is doubtful at best.   If anonymity is a significant concern, do not publish.   If anonymity is passing concern, then money is probably not a significant concern.  Publish all your works for free, or direct all incoming funds to a charitable concern without ever coming to you. There is no anonymity on the internet, there is only presence or lack of common knowledge (assuming anyone cares enough to look).  As of this minute there are 277,316 published works on Smashwords Many of them published with pseudonyms.  The majority of them make such a little splash, that no one is drawn to search out the authors.  But if the right people, care enough to look hard enough, there no possibility of sure anonymity."
How can I put footnotes in an ebook?,"I don't think there is an official way to put footnotes, at least in EPUB2.

Can the sleep timeout be adjusted on Kindle devices?,"From the tags on this questions, I'll guess that you're talking about a Kindle Paperwhite. I know it's possible to do this on a Kindle Fire as well; it's in Settings > More > Display > Screen Timeout there (screenshots here). On the paperwhite, and apparently many of the other Touch devices, there are commands that you can input in the search bar to do all kinds of interesting things. Entering ~ds will cause the screensaver to never show. A full list of commands is available at http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle_Touch_Hacking#Search_Bar_Shortcuts EDIT: According to this forum post (same thread you linked in the comment, actually), it sounds like restarting the device is required to get the screensaver working again; the ~ds switch is apparently not a toggle. As far as power consumption goes, eInk only uses power to change the image, not to display it. This means that removing the screensaver may in fact extend the battery life, rather than draining it more quickly."
"Are there studies that show whether reading ebooks on e-Ink, LCD, SLCD or AMOLED displays are better for eyes?","This is not exactly an answer which describes a single study (but studies are part of what I searched through).

Light is light, so that would be exactly the same for you, you couldn't say that it is reflected or emitted light. But now look on your lcd display fullfilling the above points (we call it ""L."").

Where is my Ebook that I just bought from Amazon Kindle to my PC?,"Amazon's Kindle for PC reader saves a copy of your books to your hard drive, once you download them.

How can I display 'word count' in Calibre while browsing my Library?,"This is not straightforward but there is a Calibre extension that you can install : Count Pages (it counts pages but it also counts words). It works only for MOBI and EPUB files so it won't be able to show the word count of books you have only in Amazon Kindle format for instance. First you need to install Count Pages : You also have to create a custom column : Finally, use Count Pages to populate your new column : Each time you add a new book in the library you will need to use that Count Pages button to fill in the column for this book. Calibre will need to be restarted several times in the process. My Calibre is in French so the words I used in my answer might not exactly be the ones used in the English interface, sorry."
Tracking time spent reading on a kindle?,"I discovered an answer to this in this quora thread: The only way I've found to do this is to get the latest firmware for the Kindle Paperwhite and enroll yourself in ""Kindle FreeTime"".

But if you don't mind occasionally entering a parental control password (I just set mine to a single letter) and jumping through a few hoops, I'd checkout FreeTime. I verified the solution, and wrote up a guide. Using Freetime, you can definitely track these metrics. "
Are there any free open-source custom firmwares for e-ink devices?,"It depends on specific device and its architecture.

Sony PRST 1 was hacked to expose full underlying rooted Android but I'm not sure if AOSP based ROM is available for it - this might be it. I'm not sure if there are any non-Android-based mainstream eInk readers - most of the ones I heard of (which is not a lot) seem to be Android under the covers and thus can be opened up (e.g. see Kobe Glo)."

How can I translate my ebook?,"You can upload your PDF to Google Drive, convert it to Google Docs (open with Docs), and apply tool Translate to... English. It will make a copy of the PDF in editable format and also keep the original. Visit drive.google.com, sign into it with your username and password Click on NEW > File Upload, select the file from your computer..  After uploading the file, click on ‘Recent’ on left and and select the uploaded file, right click on it and select Open with >’Google Docs’ When the document will open in another tab, click on Tools > Select ‘Translate document’   Source"
Is there an easier way to edit a .mobi file?,"As far as I know .mobi files can't be edited directly, they have to be converted first to another editable format. So, no, you can't directly edit .mobi files in just one step. See this thread on MobileRead forums for further reference. Anyway, I think that there is an easy a solution to your problem. Please note that in providing the following informations I have assumed that you are interested in using your eBook files with a Kindle device. If it is not the case, maybe not eveything will apply to tour particular situation. Maybe you are already aware of this since you are a Calibre user, but it now has an integrated ebook editor that can work not only with .epub files but also with .azw3 ones (also known as KF8), which are used on Kindle devices. Here is a link to the Calibre manual page about this feature, where you can check if this is a tool that will do for you. It is rather similar to Sigil both in appearance and in functionalities, so you will have no problem to sort it out.  I know that strictly speaking an .azw3 is not a .mobi, but both these formats are mainly used on Kindle devices; moreover, as far as I know, for practical reasons (even if not for technical ones) the .azw3 format is considered to be a successor to .mobi; so, if you need to retouch your ebooks and have a rather recent Kindle device (or app), it should not make any great difference which one of these formats you will use on it. Here are also some links to various resources that you may find useful:  "
How to build an epub starting from a bunch of HTML files?,"I assume you don't write the HTML directly, but use something like MarkDown or reST. But even if you do, you should look at Pandoc. The program can read HTML and generate EPUB 2 or EPUB 3 (among others)."
Is there a way to sync reading progress across multiple devices and platforms?,"As a general principle, no.  But most software vendors provide compatible apps for PC/Mac/Android. So if you will be happy using their reader app, you just install their apps and get synchronization across all platforms.  For instance, I don't own a Kindle, but I buy ebooks from Amazon and read them on both Kindle for PC and Kindle for Android The same is true of Kobo. What this doesn't do is let you sync sideloaded books, or any book not purchased from that particular vendor."
How can I validate an epub file?,"IDPF, the consortium that promotes the .epub standard, has released a tool named epubcheck.
It is available both via an online web-app here, or as a stand-alone program here. There is also another tool called FlightCrew, available here; this is also integrated within Sigil, a full fledged epub editor (available here). All these tools are free and cross-platform."
Using eReader to display maps,"Since I find scrolling and zooming on an ebook cumbersome, what I would do with a large image/map is divide it in smaller pieces, slightly smaller than my screen resolution (30 or so pixel less -> 15 on each side). After that generate separate HTML pages, for each image part, and put in hyper-links from page to page on the sides (alternatively I would investigate if I could make the image selectable using image maps). If the map was divided in 9 pieces: Displaying number 5 would look like: Selecting the numbers would get you to that piece of the map. You could extend this with numbers near the corners to go the diagonally linked image pieces. As with maps printed in books (with numbers to the top and bottom of a page with the page numbers connecting map pieces), you could have a range of pixels overlap between the map-parts. If you have many pieces, or this is not a one off, you should probably write a program that takes care of the division of the image, the HTML generation and combining in an EPUB."
What is a good software for reading ebooks out loud?,"There are several screen readers available, these are high end products used by totally blind and visually impaired user to operator a computer.  JAWS is preferred by all the blind computer users I know.  According to this there is a version designed specifically for tablets.   Be aware, the creators of PDF documents, often do so without consideration for screen readers.  PDF is used to create fixed format document for the a sighted reader to look at.  Even if there is text for a screen reader to read it is often difficult for a screen reader to translate it in to a helpful format. If the PDF file is actually a scanned image of a printed page, Jaws will not be able to read it.  There is software called OCR that is able to ""read"" pictures of words and convert them to a text layer that JAWS, or MS word, etc can consume.   Lastly if the PDF is laid out with lots of columns, boxes, images, cute little conversation bubbles, etc, it will be extremely difficult for any program to translated it into something meaningful to you.  Calibre has an option that will convert PDF to most ebook formats, there is a listing here of some of the issue you may encounter."
Are there ways to automatically detect what book an e-text is?,"I am not aware if it is such a tool/service/API, and generally publishers don't offer APIs IMHO mainly because copyright infringement sites or concurrent businesses might use them. So you need to take a custom approach, using URL because most of the sites use GET method to do their queries and do some data-mining using scripts (wget/selenium etc). You could do like this: Search for exact text in google ex search: ""Numerical boundaries take many forms but are always applied in finite games. Persons are selected for finite play."" Look for ISBN in resulted pages or for title and author using regular expressions or CSS selectors, XPATH etc. Search using advanced query on amazon or other site:
http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_adv_b/?search-alias=stripbooks&unfiltered=1&field-isbn=1476731713 notice &field-isbn=1476731713 same could be used for &field-author= or &field-title=  Use regular expressions to extract all the book data. This would be my approach."
Command line extraction of metadata (title. author) from epub file,"Here's a quick bash script (with no error-checking whatsoever) to do what you want: This uses unzip -l to find out where the .opf file is in the .epub (normally OEBPS\content.opf, but it can be named anything as long as it has the .opf extension).  Then it uses zipgrep to find occurrences of the desired metadata type in that file. Finally, strip off the tags to leave just the metadata. And here's a test run: That last line is blank because the metadata entry for subject in the opf file is:"

How to erase data before selling a Kindle?,"Every Kindle has a menu option ""Reset to Factory Defaults"", which does exactly what you want: It removes all user specific data from the device. Step by step instructions for factory resets on various Kindle devices For the paranoid: Most devices will not actually erase your data, but just mark it as ""erased"". For the user both are the same thing - if you sell your device, the new owner will not see your stuff. For anybody with sufficient knowledge and interest in that piece of information - such as crime scene investigators etc. - it usually is possible to restore data. I have not checked if a Kindle will actually overwrite your data or leave traces behind."
Can I create my own ebook cloud with Calibre?,"Yes, it is possible and rather easy to do so. You start it with the connect/share button on the main toolbar, then selecting start content server; it can be configured from preferences > sharing. It should be a simple task, if you need more help just ask. With this method calibre must be running because basically what you are doing is setting up a web interface to connect to it. This way it will be accessible from any web browser. See also calibre manual on this topic. I also suggest you to read this guide from mobileread. Be sure to protect your content server with a password, so you must be required to login to be able to access it. You don't want to let everyone access your copyrighted ebooks and have to do with piracy."

How do I get an ISBN?,"The national official bodies that you mention are the only ways to get an ISBN in your name for your manuscript. If you go through, say, Smashwords to get your ISBN, then Smashwords will be on file at the ISBN agency as the publisher of the manuscript. When you get an ISBN from anywhere else, they are basically buying them from Bowker (or whoever) in bulk and reselling them for a markup.

Is it possible to self-publish ebooks with DRM?,"Per your comments I have read on EditionGuard that offers an extension for WordPress sites.  There is a fee associated with content but my understanding is you upload your content to them, you can sell through your CMS and they will send a DRM ePub.  I have not tested this yet, but I had planned to in the future when I had time.  Also, note this is for only .epub and .pdf files NOT .mobi files yet.  "
What is the most readable font for an ebook?,"Generally speaking serif fonts are considered easier to read in long bodies of text, even if there are no definitive studies about why they should be preferred over sans-serif fonts.    Usually it is considered that serifs help the eye to go from a letter to another, creating something like a natural flow between words, but I personally think that this is a somewhat personal preference. In printed paper (books, newspapers, and so on) I have always seen serif fonts, while for web content (blog posts, forums, articles) sans serif seem to have the largest share.
Despite this, ebooks seem to largely follow the standards of printed paper, not of digital content: maybe because of something like a tradition, maybe because eink devices try to offer a look and feel resembling printed paper. Anyway, any ereading device has at least some basic font customizing options, so in the end it is all in the hand of the single end users and their personal preferences."
"Kindle vs Kindle paperwhite, is the resolution really important for eyes?","Here's a comparison of 300 ppi (Voyage, Oasis, 2015 Paperwhite) vs 221 ppi (2014 and earlier Paperwhite) vs 167 ppi (Classic Kindle).  Actual dimensions seem to be The 300 ppi can legitimately claim to be nearly indistiguishable from paper to my eye, once you factor in the natural fuzziness of eInk and the 16 shades of grey."
Is there a way to read DjVu files on a 4th gen Kindle?,"There is no out of the box possibility. The easiest way would be to convert the file to pdf, of course this would make the DjVu advantages disappear. The alternative is to modify your Kindle by installing a compatible reader. One possibility that is still actively developed is Librerator (which is also a superior for viewing larger pdfs). You will however have to jailbreak your Kindle and install KUAL, which will possibly void warranty."
What is the correct term for eBook?,"Donald Knuth, inventor of TeX, writes on a related word: Newly coined nonce words of English are often spelled with a hyphen, but the hyphen disappears when the words become widely used. For example, people used to write ""non-zero"" and ""soft-ware"" instead of ""nonzero"" and ""software""; the same trend has occurred for hundreds of other words. Thus it's high time for everybody to stop using the archaic spelling ""e-mail'"". Think of how many keystrokes you will save in your lifetime if you stop now! The form ""email"" has been well established in England for several years, so I am amazed to see Americans being overly conservative in this regard. (Of course, ""email"" has been a familiar word in France, Germany, and the Netherlands much longer than in England—but for an entirely different reason.) Extending the principle, there is no question that ""e-book"" (and also ""Ebook"" and ""eBook"") will go out of style shortly.  The only real question is if ""ebook"" will stick or if we will end up on just ""book"".  It's instructive to note that if someone tells me to mail them a document, I will reach for my computer and not for a paper envelope."
How can I automate the creation of EPUB files from series of existing JPEG photos?,"Part of the program I wrote for scanning and EPUB-ing scanned images can be reused for this purpose. I tried to make a minimal version, the output was tested with calibre book reader and a BookEen reading device and passed
EpubCheck version 3.0.1 without errors. The program requires you to provide a Title (--title) and one or more JPEG files, which are taken as is (not scaled or rotated). Some extra options allow for specifying an output file name (otherwise constructed from the title), author/creator and series/series-index (as used by Calibre): will create a file My_Photo_Album.epub in the current directory. The program works with Python 2.7 and standard libraries, but will not work without modification on Python 3.X. All processing is done in memory, the computers memory limits the size of your EPUB, but no intermediate files are written."
Are there any rugged ebook readers out there?,"Take a look at the earl, it is an android device with a 6” Flexible, sunlight viewable, E-ink screen (1024x758) with front light. It also comes with a solar panel, so you might want to put it on the outside of your pack (as long as you don't go hiking in the UK). It has not been released yet, but it should be available this summer (I certainly hope I have mine by then). Price starts at $299 if you pre-order (the crowd funding campaign is over).  Being Android based you should be able to install an ePub reader like the one from Graphilos Studio on it. At the bottom of the meetearl.com page it says ePub, MOBI and PDF are supported, but to me it is not clear if that software is pre-installed or isn't."
"How well is SVG (being a ""pixel image"" alternative) supported?","As Donald points out in his answer, (new) devices would have to support SVG 'images' as support for SVG is specified in the EPUB 3.0 standard. For line drawings, but also for zoomable images (maps come to mind), this is a vastly superior format over any pixel based file format. How soon that adaptation will happen will be influenced by how easy it is to adapt the various rendering engines used in the devices. Some of the features of 3.0 require more processing power, potentially reducing battery life even if not actively used.  Conversion to non-EPUB formats of EPUB 3.0 with SVG is going to be more difficult, some will not support it at all (which would require rendering in some pixel based format at some resolution), conversion to others formats (PDF) would become more complex than the current text and image conversion."
What rights do I have to eBooks I purchase in the U.S.A. as a U.S. citizen?,"Ebooks are protected by the Digital Milenium Copyright Act (DMCA), so you are only legally able to do what the DRM allows. Most of it depends upon the company who sells the ebook, and the publisher. There is one exception: if you are legally unable to read books (blind), you can remove the DRM if it prevents screen reader use. NOTICE: I am not a DMCA expert, nor a legal consultant. I found this information through internet research, so make sure to confirm it."
How should you include illustrations in Kindle ebooks?,"DPI/PPI settings aren't used in the web and are based by pixel dimensions and several web images .png, .jpg, and .gif files sometimes do not include the settings in the internal data.   You also didnt mention how you are including the illustrations in the ebook.  Are these vector or scanned images? If you have built your illustration in either Illustrator or Inkscape I would use an .svg file format but that is a personal preference.  From my understanding, .svg format can be a less file size than exporting the illustration as .jpg or .png. I would use .png files because they can be compressed and help reduce your file size.  A good compression tool is Tinypng.  If you're wanting a command line compression tool there is pngquant but I havent tested it yet. To request what type of method is most effective would depend on how you tend for the ebook to be viewed.  It is common for illustrators to use fixed layout to control how the illustration is viewed.  This is common with children's books.  "
Is there any open standard for ebook notes format?,"The short answer, no. Kindle uses what is called a My Clippings.txt file using standard text formatted in a particular way.

  ========== Sony Reader provides .note files. These are just wrapped .svg files (scalable vector graphics, an XML based image format). I believe this is because the Sony Reader notes can be annotations, doodles via a stylus and text highlights. You can find out more information about extracting them here. Kobo, according to this thread, stores annotations in [epub-filename].annot, which is a standard XML file. I'm not sure if this differs for other eBook formats. You get the point. There is no single standard format or way to handle annotations. That being said, perhaps someone could take various open source tools and create a single utility for exporting and/or importing annotations to various devices (sounds like an interesting side project...)."
Do e-ink devices suffer from burn-in?,No they don't. Otherwise Kindle screen pictures/ and similar picture on other e-ink devices would have been discouraged and the screen would had been blank on shutdown.
How well do ereaders typeset?,"Long story short: Poorly. The user control that you mention is one of the great strengths of ebooks, but the problem that it brings with it is that really precise control of the look of the page gets thrown out the window. Many (myself included) would argue that this is a worthwhile sacrifice. As I mentioned in an answer to a question about embedding fonts in ebooks, many devices will automatically override publisher styles. Even without that, though, the simple ability of users to change fonts on the fly means throwing kerning out the window--text that looks too tightly spaced in Times New Roman may be a little spread out in Bulmer. Ligatures are another tricky area--one ebook I prepared recently had a font that used ligatures, and while it showed up fine on most of Amazon's devices, on Kindle for PC there were empty rectangles in place of the ""fl"" and ""fi"" ligatures. Without getting into the justification vs. ragged right argument, Kindle at least will automatically justify your text, and further will take down your book if it receives word that you have forced the body text to display left-aligned. Hyphenation rules are by and large terrible as well. Most reading systems will at least honor some of the various ways to turn off auto-hyphenation for things like headers, but not all of them do. Discretionary hyphens will usually produce a line break where you put them, but will not always leave a hyphen at the line break, which is decidedly suboptimal. My business partner and I covered a number of these issues at Tools of Change 2013 a year ago. The slides are available at SlideShare. The bits on hyphenation in particular start on slide 38. The best solution at the moment is to keep styling as simple as possible. Reading systems are in a state very similar to the Browser Wars of the late 90's, so we're in a lowest-common-denominator situation--complex formatting is almost guaranteed to look bad somewhere."
epubcheck error: mimetype entry missing or not the first in archive,"This error can occur when the mimetype is compressed inside the epub zip file. What can be done is to create a zip file with only the mimetype file inside but with no compression.  You can do that with 7-Zip setting the Compression level to Store.  In Linux, you can also do that with the terminal command: Then drag and drop the META-INF and OEBPS folders to the file.zip and change the extension to .epub, as usual. With the Linux terminal you can use this command line instead:"
Can I get an ebook from the library in the United States?,"I can answer in regards to the Los Angeles City public libraries, and I suspect that many libraries in the United States use the same system. They have a dedicated page explaining the e-media options available to their members. From this page it seems that there are quite a few companies/subcontracters that they use to handle the transfer of ebooks from the library to a subscriber's account/ereader  - Axis360, Overdrive and Hoopla, for example. There are more options listed on their e-media page, as well as links to other free, public resources like Project Gutenberg, Bartleby, and the Alex catalog of public texts that don't require LAPL membership."
How to tell if a book from Kobo Store has DRM?,"If you look at the bottom of the page you linked:
http://store.kobobooks.com/it-IT/ebook/tutto-sherlock-holmes
you'll see:  As you can see, this book is listed as ""Senza DRM"" (DRM-Free on the English language site).   You'll also see books with Adobe DRM such as ""Mitologia classica""
https://store.kobobooks.com/it-IT/ebook/mitologia-classica  Bonus tip:
To the right of the Product Information you'll see the heading ""Read This On"" (""Leggilo su""):  If the device list includes Blackberry, you can download the file directly to your computer rather than loading it through the Kobo Desktop. If there is Adobe DRM, you'll still need to use ADE to get the file to your Kobo. There's a link to the device list directly under the ""Add to cart"" button."
How can I left justify text on my Kindle?,"The justification is normally specified in the CSS included in your ebook. 
Commercial ebooks often come 'justified', just like most traditional books (which generate less of a problem of large white space, through the combination of hyphenation and wider lines). It might be that the Kindle overrides the ebooks default, but I doubt it. What you should try is change the CSS in an ebook, e.g. by convert the ebook with Calibre, while specifying Text Justification: Left Alignin the Look & Feel tab of the book conversion page."
How can I merge multiple ebooks in a single file?,"Is it possible to use a full fledged editor like Sigil. It works with .epub files, but if needed, before the editing, it's possible to use Calibre to convert the source ebook into .epub, then reconvert it after the job.  Anyway, for a faster and easier solution, Calibre has a very useful additional plugin called EpubMerge, that, as the name imply, can merge multiple epubs into a single one, also letting create a new table of contents and edit all relevant metadata of the new output file, while leaving unaltered the source ones. Also in this case, if another ebook format is needed, a conversion is required after the editing since the plugin only works with .epub files. "
what does the v5.0 in the name of an e-book file stand for?,"This is an indication of the quality of the ebook. (v5.0)  should be
close to retail quality: Minor version numbers are normally used for committed/uploaded changes. I have not come across any (semi-)official website for these indications. I pulled these from my notes that I made while doing book scans myself. I think they came from some Usenet post.  Some v5 material still has a lot of errors (especially older publications where the fonts are not easily recognised by the OCR)."
Conversion of djvu file into pdf file without increasing file size,"The short answer is: PDF is not a good format for storing image data. The only reason that it is often used for doing so, is that it is one of the few formats (the other more well known ones are DjVu and TIFF), that allow you to store multiple (scanned) images in a single file.  The longer answer is that the possible storage of image data in PDF files is done in a less efficient way than is possible in the way DjVu does. So in general, unless the DjVu file is compressed inefficiently to start with, you will always get a bigger PDF file, or you get a much worse quality image.  The primary difference, apart from algorithms used for compression, is that an image in a DjVu file consists of multiple layers, each compressed separately, with optimized algorithms for the layer's data (monotone, color etc.), and recombined for display/printing. Especially on a page with characters (not selectable text associated with the characters) combined with images DjVu easily gets 20x smaller files at similar lossy quality. "

While most (all?) of the ebook are available without cost the majority are public domain works, there are also many Create Commons & fair-use works. There is not a good way to search for only PD works, but due to the type of results returned that should not be an issue for most users.  The works that are not PD, are mostly appropriate for attribution sharing, which mostly allowed. (There are not any absolutes here)  Selecting texts will return everything that is mostly written words. From single page documents to books. This is approximately equal to 'ebooks'. "

"Without ebook creation software, can I fix formatting issues on an epub?",Depending on what you mean by ebook creation software. You can always: The above steps does not involve any specific ebook creation software... But you should give a try to Calibre's heuristics fixing capabilities too. And Calibre also has a GUI to refine ebook contents...
"How can I keep a large number of EPUB files, managed in calibre, ""polished""","The short answer is yes, and I have ranted about this in parallelizing EPUB polishing. The problem with some Linux systems (Ubuntu) is that there is a limit to the message popup queue. Since ebook polishing (using calibre) is done quicker than the time a message is displayed, this queue overflows and calibre cannot write messages to it any more, and (on last try at least) calibre did lock up. If you look in any directory where calibre stores the EPUB, you can see that there is a metadata.opf file that contains the metadata for the corresponding ebook. You have to specify this file as argument for the ebook-polish program together (-o option), together with the corresponding EPUB file. What you therefore need to do is make list of 'outdated' EPUB files (outdated compared to the metadata.opf files in the same directory), and then call: and rename the output (path/to/book_polished.epub) to path/to/book.epub. The script referred to in the above rant does exactly that. As prerequisite you need to have GNU parallel installed¹. With the script I was able to process 1329 polishes in 3m25. Searching and updating 4 changed files in 2400+ item database with 1600+ books now takes less than 2 seconds². Of course files in the calibre database that are not supported by ebook-publish (such as PDF) are completely skipped. ¹ In case you wonder, yes the script, via parallel, calls itself for each file to callebook-polish and rename the output
² Fast enought to always try and polish the EPUB files before I synchronise the selected files with the reader devices"
Is there a good size comparison of which of different e-book formats is smaller?,"This is something I find interesting. I'm going to post an answer with some findings. As I discover more, I'll expand on my answer. Old, But Still Useful Comparisons This document is fairly old (warning, link is a zip file containing a pdf) and the information may not accurately reflect how things are today. It also does not contain many of the popular formats of today (there is none of the epub formats listed and mobipocket (prc) I believe as a predecessor to .mobi). I'll list the details for historical purposes though. Excerpt from the report (Copyright 2002 by ePMA -- ePublishing Marketing Associates -- www.epmaasoc.com): To make this comparison, we took the Project Gutenberg plain text file
  of the book The Metal Monster by Abraham Merritt, stripped it of the
  PG legal Disclaimer and such. Next we removed the linefeed/carriage
  returns from the end of each line, so paragraphs would flow for
  different formatting, and then added basic markup with HTML, to
  provide paragraph breaks and chapter headings. Except where noted,
  this HTML file was then used to create the eBook in other formats. no
  cover or other images were included. NOTE: This was done for a non-illustrated volume. There was talk of doing another test in the future with an illustrated volume, but I was not able to find it. Here were the findings: Format                               Kbytes% Txt

I did not create or convert the formats personally and I am unsure of the exact versions (e.g. epub2 vs epub3). I still thought this might be useful information since all books were generated by the same company (manning). These are all programming books, and as such, they have some images in them and embedded markup language. This should provide a decent comparison vs. something that is only text or mostly images. The following list of books are compared in epub, mobi and pdf (sizes are in KiloBytes, smallest bolded). Findings Average Sizes In almost all cases, the epub was the smallest file. Mobi was slightly larger and pdf was the largest. However, the average size of the mobi files were actually smaller overall. This was due to one very large epub file for the HTML5 for .Net Developers book. This book skewed the results since the file was nearly twice the size of the other formats. My best guess is because this file contains many HTML code examples, which may cause problems for the epub format (basically XHTML). Perhaps this is an epub3 format, which supports HTML5 (the book title is a good hint). Again, I did not generate these files, so I am not certain of the reason. To combat this single anomaly, I decided to remove that book from the averages. When removing the book, the averages of the remaining books looks like so: Average Sizes (removing HTML5 for .Net Developers - i.e. the anomaly) Take it for what it is worth, but in these findings it suggests that the epub and mobi formats are quite close in size, while the pdf format is nearly double. Answer to be continued with newer formats and more research."
Format for ebook that contains code,Embedding code in EPUB can be accomplished with pure HTML and CSS. The <code> tag and monospace attribute will bring you most of the way. See https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook for a lot of detail.
How do I export Wikipedia article collections to epub?,"This feature was removed as the result of changes of the mwlib that was used for export to ocg that has better support for non-latin scripts for PDF files. In the process EPUB export was disabled, probably because the ocg library renders to images via LaTeX (that is a guess, I have not looked at the details). The announcement for the change was made on the wikitech mailing list,  As part of this change, we will disable ZIM and EPUB export for the
  time being. If you're interested in working on ZIM or EPUB support for
  the new offline content generator, or other export formats, please let
  us know via the above channels. and it looks like it has not come back yet. What that ""weird"" page does is take the source of the wikipedia page, which has the page description, and tries to render it to ePub. That should give  better results than e.g. starting with the HTML version or the rendered PDF.   I normally caution to not use such cloud based rendering services, but since the input you feed it is public anyway, you won't have to fear that the data you upload there gets stored for further use by the website owner."
How to create DjVu format with selectable text?,"DjVu files are normally image only. From these file sections can be selected as images but not as text¹. If OCR was applied during, or after, the conversion to DjVu. Extra information is stored in the files that associate image areas with text. Only if that was done you can select text from such a file². Applying OCR to a DjVu file can be done online. If you don't like that you could try this script, that uses Tesseract. Or you can go for commercial software such as Document Express. ¹  e.g. using  the djview program.
² In theory one could do OCR on the fly in the DjVu viewer, but I don't think any of the currently available viewers can do that."
How to discover/work around a limited number of devices for Kindle ebooks?,"To keep within the limit, you may want to deregister an old device that you no longer read on (for instance, you may have put the Kindle reading app on a laptop that you've since replaced). To do this, simply log into your Amazon account and choose Manage Your Kindle (the link is located in the Digital Content section of Your Account page). You'll find Manage Your Devices in the options listed under Your Kindle Account_. When you select any of the devices you've read from, a ""Deregister"" link is available that removed the device from your list."
"Is reading ebooks in ""Night"" mode better for eye health?","I found this article which explains how our body reacts to these LED devices (including ereaders). Near the end of the article, it says that programs that reduce the amount of blue light do actually aid you in getting a better nights sleep.  So, to summarize the article; blue light is what causes you to have a bad nights sleep after using a LED device (including ereaders). So, in order to reduce the blue light, you need to get rid of the bright colours. Programs for your computer, and night mode for your tablet do this effectively. Of course, this isn't a 100% solution, but it does help. "
Do non-Windows devices have equivalent of ClearType for ebook font rendering?,"On devices that use eInk, there are no subpixels like the Red, Green and Blue subpixels that can be separately addressed on color screens. Hence there is no subpixel rendering as such on eInk devices (as stated by Sriram Peruvemba (chief Marketing Officer at  E-Ink Holdings). 3rd generation iPAD has subpixel rendering according to the same article, but it is not supported by every application."
How can I add custom fonts to my Kobo ereader?,"Yes, custom fonts are easily added to any ereader of the Kobo family. An article on MobileRead fully explain how. Fonts can be be very easily added to the Kobo family of eReaders. With
  the Kobo attached to your computer, create a new directory called
  fonts in the root directory of the device (the same location as the
  .kobo, .adobe-digital-editions and Digital Editions directories. Once this directory has been created, simply copy entire font families
  into it. A font family consists of four files; one each for Regular, Italic,
  Bold and BoldItalic. The font should be
  named the same as the system sees the font, so in the case of Linux
  Libertine, it's exactly that. You'll have 4 different font file, and
  you want to name each one in the style <Font Name>-<Font Weight>, so
  for Linux Libertine, you should have 4 files: Linux Libertine.ttf (or Linux Libertine-Regular.ttf)
Linux Libertine-Italic.ttf
Linux Libertine-Bold.ttf
Linux Libertine-BoldItalic.ttf For many fonts, the name can simply be what you'd expect it to be, but
  for some, the actual font name is different than what seems obvious.
  And you are correct, all these files go into a folder called ""fonts""
  on your Kobo."
Converting RTL epub to mobi,According to Kovid Goyal ( creator of Calibre) you need to convert to azw3 instead of mobi.
Can I legally remove DRM from ebooks I have purchased if I live in Canada?,"Well, according to this blog, it says Bill C-11 (Copyright Modernization Act, which amends the existing provisions of the Copyright Act) has made it illegal to break DRM in Canada.

Deliver Emailed or Converted Books to Amazon Cloud Reader and PC Reader,"Now you can open them in Kindle for PC, and also Kindle for Mac I believe. Cloud reader is probably a lost cause. As you have discovered, Amazon frustratingly considers any book not purchased through them as a ""personal document"" with many limitations, including that they do not sync annotations nor highlights, and you cannot deliver them to PC or Cloud Kindle.  I also use iFunBox to back up my annotations/highlights, contained in the file ""AnnotationStorage"" located also at ""User Applications/Kindle/Library"".

How practical is it to learn to develop apps for e-ink Kindles?,"Learning to develop apps for eBook readers is very practical: The reason being, the same technology that applies to creating ebooks; also applies to developing websites, software, etc. Meaning that the skills you learn from developing apps for eBook readers improves your overall skills as a Web or App Developer in general.  These skills in turn can allow you to start developing more complex skills for becoming a Programmer, Software or Application Developer. Now that we know the type of jobs related and the career path that follows, we can look at the skills and technology required and used by those in the related industry; to learn how to do the same development. Basic Skills Required by Web and App Developers: An ePub is a zipped up package of content, containing items such as the above, for the purpose of creating the ePub Book/App: If we learn the above technology then we will have the core skills needed to develop applications for eBook readers. Learning Priority Order: Where to Learn Online: http://www.lynda.com/  courses such as:  Learning Offline: Comparison Chart of eReader Features and Supporting Platforms: However, learning to develop apps for the e-ink kindle devices specifically is a bit too narrow for me to personally consider it ""practical"".  For example the Kindle Fire has much better support for epub3 formats, app like content, etc. That being said, what is practical may depend on your use or application as it is a matter of opinion. What you DO NOT need to know for eBook App Development: Good to be Familiar with but may not Need: Above Skills related to Web Developers more so than having practical use for eBook app development Final Thoughts: I've worked for a major Distribution Book Publishing company for the last two and a half years as a digital content engineer managing the QA of our eBooks and can say without doubt, that if you use the above information, it will lead you into the correct direction. That being said, there are many vendors that provide a service for ebook conversions and ebook app development. At some point you may consider or decide to look into what is available if you have the time or resources."
What text format is least likely to clash with ebook formats?,"TL;DR; In order not to worry about the output, you have to be sure of the input and the translation process into an ebook. The input has to show you everything that is there and hide nothing, and the translation process must be deterministic. If you only need basic formatting and want it to be consistently converted, the best you can do is use a mark-up language like reStructured Text, markdown or DocBook. The reason for this is that common word processors like Word¹ are what-you-see-is-all-you've-got: you often have no idea what the internal structure of a document is even though it shows ""right"" on the screen.  This happens e.g. when you have three words in italics, and select the middle one and set italics again. Is the internal structure such that italics ends after the first word and begins at the third; or does it end at the beginning of the second word (after the space) and start at the end of the second before the space; or is the second word just italics and does italics within italics mean: display non-italics? And what happens to this structure when you then deleted the second word?² With a mark-up language the mark-up is explicit and you see what you do: where things start, where things end. The translation of mark-up gets you the same result every time, and that makes it predictable. And predictable means you know what you get as an end-result and you don't have to check it. At least it should not be a result after the first time using some construct ;-). The preceeding isn't necessarily true for two documents that look the same in Word: they might have different internal structures, which translate to different output in an ebook. For many people this is not a problem, as to how this differs depends on the the target ebook format. Formats that do less rendering of structure (such as image based ebook formats like DjVu, or typesetting oriented formats like PDF and DVI (LaTeX output)) are similar to output to a printer. Word has control over this, and makes it look the same whether it renders to screen, to the printer or to PDF. That is why you normally have no visual difference directly printing from Word, or generating a PDF and printing that. This can be different  if your input text is translated in another mark-up, as in ebooks in EPUB, MOBI, etc. format. In that case knowing exactly what structure you started with is important as that may influence the output rendering. And that is where Word could get a different output for similar looking input, because there might be hidden elements, but something in a mark-up language will be the same if it looks the same, because there is nothing that is hidden. The aforementioned example, which looks the same in Word could translate in one of the following HTML pieces (there are more possibilities, and this might be an oversimplification, but the I hope it conveys the principle): <i>abc</i> def <i>ghi</i> → abc def ghi
<i>abc </i>def<i> ghi</i> → abc def ghi
<i>abc <i>def</i> ghi</i> → abc def ghi If the output was to be LaTeX instead of HTML (where italics in italics switches back to non-italics) the third would look the same as the first two, and the inter-word spacing would differ after italics ends (it might be different in HTML rendering by Firefox as well, I just can't see it). The conversion process should be deterministic, and it probably is for your purposes. However Knuth did do the calculation in TeX in integers because he argued that the floating point units in computers (at that time) where not deterministic enough because of rounding differences. IIRC this was to get the same result on different computers, so this is—hopefully—only an example of to what extremes people go to control the repeatability of their output. For conversion of mark-up, have a look at Sphinx or pandoc. The former can generate output in PDF without having to install LaTeX, the latter has more in- and output formats. Both can generate HTML which you might use as a basis for MOBI as I have not seen any direct generation towards that of mark-up languages (but since I don't have a MOBI device, I have not really looked for that). ¹ I use Word here, but this applies to OpenOffice writer and similar editors as well ² I fear too many of us have edited documents only to have new text at the cursor have some font or formatting that we did not expect and is a result of some program internal formatting lurking invisible."
What kinds of DRM are used in eBooks? Is it possible to purchase DRM free eBooks?,"According to Wikipedia, there are four main ebook DRM schemes in common use today, one each from Amazon, Adobe, Apple, and the Marlin Trust Management Organization (MTMO). To answer your second question. Yes, you can purchase DRM free ebooks (Wikipedia lists a few places here.). Whether or not a book is DRM free will depend on the publisher/seller. It is also possible to remove DRM from some books, as there is opposition to DRM."
How much of the power does the screen of e-Ink device consume?,"I beleive you are asking ""can the power usage of an eink screen be quantified?"" As long as you don't change the page/image it is not using anypower.  E Ink's technology is commonly referred to as ""bistable"". What does this mean? Bistable means that the image on an E Ink screen will be retained even when all power sources are removed. In practice, this means that the display is consuming power only when something is changing. For example, when reading on an eReader, power is only needed when turning to a new page but no power is consumed by the display while reading the page. - See more at: http://www.eink.com/technology.html To quantify a value for usage while reading you would need to define; "
What are the benefits of Amazon Kindle device over Amazon Kindle app for a power user?,"Lending only works on Kindle devices, not the apps. Specifically, there are two things that Amazon lets you do only with Kindle devices. First, Amazon Prime members can ""borrow"" books from the Kindle Library, which includes lots of bestsellers and older books, but only on Kindle devices. Second, users can lend many (but not all) books to other Amazon users. But, the recipient can only accept and read the loaned book using a Kindle device. Other than that, I don't think there are any advantages to the Kindle 3G over reading in other contexts. I do 80% of my Kindle reading on the iOS apps, about 19% on the PC app, and the remaining 1% on my actual Kindle. With a Fire, this is less of an issue, since it is much faster, prettier, and more full-featured than the older Kindles."
"Two kindles bricked, can there be a common cause?","You can try and convert all of your Calibre managed files, to any format and see if any of the books show a problem. If you don't want to polute your book database, make a copy first and work on that. No guarantee to find the culprit, but not a lot of effort either."
How to simulate an epub ereader and inspect its DOM?,"For editing an EPub, I would look into sigil. It has the ability of WYSIWYG editing and comes recommended by other users on this forum. It's free and open-source. An alternative is Calibre. Editing EPubs is a bit more code-centric in contrast to sigil. It's also free and open-source. For some comparisons between the two programs, check out this blog. As far as an actual hardware emulator for specific eReader devices, I'm not aware of any."
How can I personalize each copy of a PDF to add the reader's name or email address to each page?,"Create a watermark pdf which contains the footer using imagemagick: It creates a simple pdf ( size: A4 ) with the text From the library of... at the bottom left corner. You might change the font, the position of the text, the size of the text... This watermark.pdf can be added to ( all pages of ) a pdf file using pdftk: I've used stamp instead of watermark because it overlays on top of the input pdf."
Why are there so few color e-ink devices on the market in 2014?,"I guess it is because having colors reduces resolution. The Triton eink that is used in the JetBook referred to is basically a black and white eink display with a color filter on top. So for each 2x2 square of pixels there is one pixel each tinted red, green and blue and one staying in black and white. So effectively you have a resolution of 800x600 with the costs of a 1600x1200 display (plus the costs for the filter). I think most people use eink devices to read pure text (without many images) and therefore prefer sharper text over colors. Of course this may change if there are more colored ebook devices and subsequently more colorful ebooks offered. It will be a recursive process. So far it only makes sense to read colored textbooks on colored ink devices. I guess this is why it the new JetBook is manufactured with a 9.7"" display. This may be too large for people who just want a reasonably small device for reading their novels. But the time of colored ebooks will surely come at some point in the future -- probably when the resolution improves further and the colors become more brilliant."
Screen protection for eReader,"Eink devices usually don't have screens with a smooth surface, they have a slight roughness, in order to simulate the look and feel of printed paper and to prevent unwanted light reflections on the surface during reading. Applying a protective film over it will remove this feature; I don't know if such films with a non-smooth surface are in existance, but even in this case I suppose it won't adhere well to the ereader surface, causing unwanted blurriness. The best option to protect an eink device, in my opinion, would be to use something like a sleeve or a full cover."
How to remove hard hyphens?,"If the book has not a DRM and you are free to edit/convert it, you can use Calibre to convert to the same format (i.e. you can use an .epub as a source file and still convert to an .epub output. In the Heuristic processing tab make sure to enable both the processing and Remove unnecessary hyphenation; if you want you can also enable other options here if you need to.  This method use the source document as a dictionary to verify if the hyphenated word is also spelled as a single word. Of course, if a given hyphenated word has a single occurrence it won't be corrected. From Calibre user manual: calibre will analyze all hyphenated content in the document when this
  option is enabled. The document itself is used as a dictionary for
  analysis. This allows calibre to accurately remove hyphens for any
  words in the document in any language, along with made-up and obscure
  scientific words. The primary drawback is words appearing only a
  single time in the document will not be changed. Analysis happens in
  two passes, the first pass analyzes line endings. Lines are only
  unwrapped if the word exists with or without a hyphen in the document.
  The second pass analyzes all hyphenated words throughout the document,
  hyphens are removed if the word exists elsewhere in the document
  without a match. If you happen to have the the source .pdf, where all hyphenated words are placed at the end of their respective lines, you can use the Search & Replace tab to add another tweak (I've personally tested and used it many times).  You must enter -<br> in the Search box and leave completely blank the Replacement one, and be sure to click Add to, well, add the rule to the conversion. This only works, as I've stated, if the hyphens are correctly placed at the end of their lines, so, in most cases, you need to have access to the source file. You can also click on the Wizard button to open a preview of the file, where you can preview what your source regex code (in this case -<br>) will select and delete (because we left blank the replacement box)."
What was the average income from ebooks for independent authors in 2013?,"Statista (The Statistics Portal) looks like it has some relevant ebooks revenue information (though not exactly what you are looking for). Unfortunately, you are forced to sign up for a premium account to access most of the reports. A sample report that they actually show you some of the information for is here (Global e-book revenue from 2009 to 2016*, by region (in million U.S. dollars), obviously some is projection). I did manage to find an informal survey done by Marie Force about independent publishers here (covers total unit sales broken down between 2010, 2011, 2012 and some of 2013) . Here is an excerpt: The conversation on the loop led to me post an informal survey to get
  an idea of how our members and their self-publishing friends are
  really doing. I didn't ask people to give dollar amounts, but rather
  just their number of sales in 2010, 2011, 2012 and so far in 2013. I
  asked them to list their most successful book in 2012 and how many
  copies it sold. At the outset, I want to say that this survey was
  informal. There is nothing scientific about it, but it does provide an
  interesting snapshot of how self-published authors are really doing. To give context to the numbers, I wanted to also provide a guide to
  what the most popular price points translate to in actual dollars.
  Using Amazon's conversion chart, here it is: 0.99 (35 percent royalty): $0.35 per sale
  1.99 (35 percent royalty): $0.70 per sale
  2.99 (70 percent royalty): $2.04 per sale
  3.99 (70 percent royalty): $2.74 per sale
  4.99 (70 percent royalty): $3.44 per sale While I didn't ask authors to list their most common price point
  (which I will add to the survey next time), I thought the breakdown
  above would be enlightening to the authors out there who might be
  waffling about whether they ought to try their hand at
  self-publishing. If you are thinking about whether or not you should
  dip your toe into the revolutionary waters, ask yourself these
  questions: When was the last time I made $3.44 on the sale of one
  book? When was the last time I made even $2.04 on the sale of one
  book? She then goes on to post a bunch of survey results broken down by author. Here is a sample of one of the survey results: Elisabeth Naughton Romantic Suspense and Paranormal Total number of
  self-published titles: 12 Total number of self-published sales in
  2010: 0 Total number of self-published sales in 2011: 0 Total number
  of self-published sales in 2012: 102,179 Total number of
  self-published sales so far in 2013: Jan-March 2013: 370,059 Most
  successful book in 2012 and how many sold: MARKED - 30,673 copies I've been traditionally published for four years and my income comes
  primarily from my self-published titles, NOT my traditionally
  published titles."
Does deleting a book from a Kindle account delete it from Kindle devices?,"By deleting an ebook I assume that it is a matter of a book that you have purchased and finished reading. In this case if you delete your book from the online library all Kindle synced devices that had the book will also delete it. In case you are talking about a book that you have published, and then unpublished for editing, the previous version of the book that was published and bought by a reader will continue to survive on their Kindle devices. When you finish editing and upload the changes the new version of the book will then be synced to the kindle devices."
What does the extremely fragile glass do in Kindle3's pearl e-ink display?,"E-ink displays have to be mounted on a surface. In this case I assume that was done on the glass. This keeps the E-ink nice and flat (good for equal visibility of all pixels) and for extra reflectiveness of ambient light, if the glass is part of a mirror (as it seems to be). The display is actually a thin film transistor array and my guess is that if the supporting glass breaks, some of the circuitry of the thin film get ripped. A single rip across the width or height would make addressing the film as an array impossible."
"Is there a standardized or recommended image format, size, and resolution when embedding images?","The short answer is no, and I don't expect there to be anything like that with a single recommendation. The reason is that different input material is better rendered in different image file formats. All material handles well in non-lossy formats (among others most of the TIFF formats, PNG), however such format produce large files. When you look at space saving compressed formats, photos handle well in JPEG, and images of scanned text are best represented in DjVu. My own experience from scanning mangas drawn on paper (so my daughter can take them on her ebook) are that for that, JPEG is a good format and that I best convert the scan to the physical dimensions of her reader. This gives optimal size of the files. And because of the interpolation that is done on the computer vs the one on the device is of better quality, it looks better and is faster in displaying.
I noticed this when I had generated her drawings in EPUB form for my reader (with a higher resolution) and then read the same EPUB on hers. The images are combined in a simple EPUB file with the stylesheets setting borders to 0. (I do all calculations for that in pixels, not bothering with physical sizes and resolution, which in the end resolves to the same)."
"What software should I use to write books, which can be exported to Lulu and CreateSpace?","For CreateSpace you essentially need to provide a PDF and do the layout by combining your output with images in the form of PDF output. To conform to their formats, you would still need a template for the editing software that you use, that generates a PDF that can be merged with such templates (and not come into the margins as they warn you not to). The CreateSpace forums give some, but IMHO not very much more helpful tips (e.g. here) It looks like CreateSpace is more reader-customer oriented and not so much bookwriter-customer, I had more help from the publisher for the single book that I helped typeset that made the shelves, and I was the first generating electronic input (from LaTex) for them."
Did any other publisher follow Baen's approach of freely releasing older e-books (especially for series)?,It has become very common for publishers to provide free copies of the first book in a series. So common that the ebook deal site BookBub has pages of links to free ebooks - some deals are ongoing and some just for a limited time.
How can I extract all the pictures from an ebook?,"Any non-DRM'ed epub ebook is just a renamed zipped folder. All you'll need to do is rename the file from <filename>.epub to <filename>.zip and unzip the folder. At that point, you should be able to navigate within the folders to find the images and do whatever you like with them. Hope that helps!"
How to use the e-ink Kindle readers to display photos?,"On older generation Kindles (with keyboard) it is actually possible out of the box. You just have to store them in a very specific way. You can then use the following shortcuts: I tested this some time ago on a Kindle3 keyboard and it worked. I found a post on the Amazon forums. It claims that a similar approach still works on the Kindle Paperwhite. I do not know how to select the collections, but I assume that they are listed along with normal ebooks. Feel free to add information on whether this works for the K4NT."
How do I add an ISBN to Calibre ebook?,"The field for the ISBN is labeled ""Ids:"" and is located between ""Tags"" and ""Dates"". It allows you to enter ID types other than ISBNs."
Epub reader limitations,"The answer to that can largely be broken down into two parts for EPUB2 and EPUB3.  First, for EPUB2 as it is currently the most common EPUB format: The most important thing to understand with regards to EPUB compatibility is that there are actually only a few readers available for commercial (i.e. DRM'd) EPUB content. As you might expect, Amazon and Apple made their own readers, but the vast majority of other commercially DRM'd readers are based off of Adobe's RMSDK, and as such they are mostly subject to similar limitations and quirks.  Now since there are literally hundreds of known and fixed issues with RMSDK, there is no possible way that I can list them all, but I can point you at the best publically available resource I know of, Datalogic's Release Notes.  These are issues that Datalogics finds and fixes itself with regards to RMSDK rendering bugs, and these issues are often then fixed by Adobe in future versions of RMSDK, so at any given time you have to be on the lookout for any of these issues with regards to whatever RMSDK renderer you are looking at (including for example any of the Bluefire Reader Branded Readers.) The last I knew, Kindle was still using RMSDK to render EPUBs, so this would apply to Kindle as well unless something has changed recently. The second biggest place that I know of for rendering EPUBs is Apple's iBooks, and a quick google search will turn up copious numbers of frustrated authors trying to get their books rendering correctly, but unfortunately I don't have any kind of ""current issues"" source for them.  (If anyone else does, I would love to see it).  They do regularly improve their rendering engine as well, but their release notes tend to mention solely the user interface changes.   Then of course, the there is the issue of the EPUB3 Spec. This might be where I have the best news of all, which is that there is an on-going, regularly updated support grid put out by BISG that tracks which renderers support which features.  That extremely helpful document can be found here."
Are Tor Ebooks DRM Free?,"Go to the original statement. This includes Tom Doherty Associates, publishers of Tor and Forge, is pleased to announce that all of their ebooks are now available DRM-free from Amazon, B&N, Apple, Kobo, Google, and most other major ebook retailers. and The new DRM-free editions are available from the same retailers that have sold Tor e-books in the past. In addition, the company expects to begin selling titles through retailers that sell only DRM-free books. I think I have seen comments on web sites etc where a book was not DRM-free and Tor then contacted the supplier to change it. So, yes, they are DRM-free. As for shop websites telling whether books have DRM see other questions here."
Can custom fonts be embedded in mobi or epub books targeting eink readers?,"You can definitely embed fonts, yes. There are a few issues to watch out for when doing so, however:"
How can I extract some chapters or sections from an ebook into a new one?,"Besides using a real ebook editor like Sigil, there is an easier way to do it. Calibre has a very useful additional plugin called EpubSplit, that with a simple interface let's you select the single .html files inside the .epub and create a new ebook just from them; after the process is also possible to edit the metadata of the newly created ebook. These tools only work with .epub files, to perform this kind of editing on other formats a conversion with Calibre should be made. "
How do I prevent Calibre from modifying EPUB files when I read them?,"I hadn't looked before so I did a little investigating. With Calibre 4.23 on Linux, I found that it's not exactly Calibre, it's the Reader. I don't know why this Reader (it's a newly re-written reader, but I don't know if the old one did this) is modifying the epub meta-data. There is no reason to do so that I'm aware of as bookmarks and other reading information is kept in the database. With that in mind, I changed the EPUB file permission to remove write permission. As a Read-Only file, everything seems to continue working normally and the Reader is no longer capable of changing it. So at this point I can only suggest: I did a little more investigation and found that ""ebook-viewer"" is writing meta-data under ""Miscellaneous"" ""calibre_bookmarks.txt"" even though bookmarks are controlled via the database. Deleting this entire entry via ""edit book"" has no effect and the book marks are still present because they are in the DB. The content written also includes: access time stamps, Book Title, and my User ID. It's written as JSON Base64. This should not be happening! I posted Bug #1894442 Calibre says it's not a bug because most users prefer it this way. Nevertheless, it can be turned off by: LTrun {sic} it off under the miscellaneous section of the viewer
preferences. I verified that it worked (at least for one in a row). Apparently the checkbox to disable directly annotating the ebook file was removed in recent updates. I don't know why they are working so hard to force a hidden write function into a READER. However only the GUI presentation was removed, the actual option still exists, at least as of the current 6.19.1. In the file .config/calibre/viewer-webengine.json an entry of: will still disable directly annotating the ebook file. If the entry is missing, Calibre defaults to true."
Is there any e-ink technology that can display colors?,"E-ink have had their Triton technology for a few years, which has been available in several commercial products: Hanvon color eReader, JetBook Color and PocketBook Color Lux. I cannot find the reference, but IIRC there are multiple layers through which the light needs to reflect. Therefore the lighting conditions need to be better than for monochrome eInk displays."

Are there any ebook libraries in Germany,"Most libraries in Germany are in my opinion joined with Onleihe. They have a website where you can see which library is connected by clicking on a map to select your Bundesland (Hessen, Bayern, etc.) http://www.onleihe.net/ihre-onleihe-finden/onleihen-in-deutschland.html"
How can I reset the reading speed data on a Kindle?,"According to a Kindle forum thread the command to reset this data is: On a touchscreen Kindle, tap the top of the screen to bring up the search box.  After you type the command and get no results, return to the book.  The status line will show Learning reading speed...  Since the search string is saved, you won't have to laboriously type the command again in order to reset again.  That ought to make testing a lot easier."
Ebooks file naming scheme -- Books in a series,"If you are using Calibre, its database is already set to have each piece of information about a book in its proper field (i.e., there will be a field for the title, another for the author, another one for the series and series numbering, and so on), but I'm sure that you already know this. So, within Calibre, you don't need (and you are not supposed) to change the title by including the series information; you can let Calibre rename those files on-the-fly when you export them to a given ereader by using its tool called Plugboard, that relies on the calibre template language. Here is, in short, the recipe to use, pasted from MobileRead forums: I have been playing around with the Metadata plugboards to get the
  titles on a Kindle 3 to show series information. I used the following
  template:  format: mobi
  device: kindle2
  template: {series}{series_index:0>2s| - | - }{title}
  destination: title This works very nicely for books that are part of a series e.g.:   A Song of Ice & Fire - 01 - A Game of Thrones
  A Song of Ice & Fire - 02 - A Clash of Kings
  A Song of Ice & Fire - 03 - A Storm of Swords
  A Song of Ice & Fire - 04 - A Feast for Crows   The process is very easy to do but if you are not used to its workings it is a bit long to explain, so I'm linking some of articles that show you step by step how to do it."
Are ebooks licensed only to a certain email address?,"I do disagree with idiotprogrammer's answer because this question does dive into DRM which plays a large part in ebooks. You could try changing the authorization of your Adobe Digital Editions account, reference: ""How do I change the authorization on my laptop"" with a re-install. If that doesn't work you would need to contact ebooks.com. Since you're getting a .acsm file I would 99% think they are using Adobe Content Server.   First, it's ridiculous to think that a DRMed ebook is tied to an
  email. Instead, it is tied to a user account created for a specific
  vendor. Every website under the sun allows you to change the email for
  the account. Even if the sign on you use is the email I suspect you
  will be able to change the email associated with it from account
  management on the user's site. Actually not..  ebooks.com might treat the email address as the ID and use it for validation to prevent transfer. Your issue will need to be addressed at the vendor if a re-install of ADE is unsuccessful.  To my recollection DRM is scoped to what they have identified as the ID.  In this case your ID is your email address.  You might be allowed to change your email address in the account settings of ebooks.com but I do not have an account there so I wouldn't know. I did run across this in research: ""I figured out the .acsm problem!""."
Is it a good idea to minify code when coding ePubs?,"Personally, I never minify code in ebooks. A big part of the reason for that is that unlike many here, I don't use Sigil or Calibre to edit my epub files—I use either Notepad++ or Geany depending on the OS I'm working in. Because I'm always working with the code, it does nothing but make my life harder if I've minified the whole thing and the client comes back to us with two or three rounds of proofing corrections. On top of that, many in the publishing world are starting to talk about using HTML5 as a base format for all their books. Since epub 3.0 content files are HTML 5, you're pretty much working directly with the source files when you're working with the epub, and the source files should be human-readable so that any problems that come up with them can be easily fixed. Finally, the point of minifying code is to let files transfer across networks more quickly, which is a non-issue for ebooks where everything is local."
Can I donate an ebook to my library's Overdrive collection?,"No.  If your library uses overdrive you can not give them ebooks to be loaned via Overdrive.  According to the Overdrive FAQ only titles purchased from overdrive are available for library loans. Can I add the titles I purchased from another vendor to my OverDrive collection? Only titles purchased from OverDrive are licensed to be included in your OverDrive collection. You may upload proprietary content (e.g., lesson plans, podcasts, audio or video recordings, etc.) to your collection. Overdrive is a subscription based service.  Each library creates it's own  custom digital collection, which is managed by the library staff.  Overdrive does not offer any services directly to library patrons so purchasing on behalf of the library is not an option. You would need to contact your local library, you may be able to make a direct monetary donation in combination with a request to include a title in your library's collection. Does my digital library allow patrons to access OverDrive’s entire catalog of titles? OverDrive allows your library to create its own custom digital collection. Your team will be able to browse OverDrive’s extensive catalog of eBooks, audiobooks, music, and video and select titles based on your library’s collection development goals. Patrons will also have the opportunity to “recommend to library” the titles they would like to read that the library has not yet purchased. Ability to recommend titles varies by geographical location."
Syncing kindle book annotations (non Amazon books) across kindle apps,"Here is my chat: ► Amazon: I'm sorry, currently there is no option to see the highlights made in the personal documents. ► Me: Ok, you are saying that Amazon deleted the website that allowed viewing highlights made in personal documents. Then I still have the other 2 questions:
1) Should Whispersync work to keep my reading ""location"" up to date between devices when reading personal documents (or is that not supported anymore either)? 2) Should Whispersync work to keep my highlights identical between devices when reading personal documents (or is that not supported anymore either)? ► Amazon: I can understand your concern. Please allow me a moment to check this.
Thanks for waiting.
I'm sorry, the highlights will not sync through all the devices which are made on personal documents. ► Me: And I guess the current reading ""location"" / progress won't either? ► Amazon: Yes, exactly."
How to remove white margins from ePub in Google Play Books,"You can use Sigil to change the margins and border by changing the style file. 
If you have many files to change, you might be better of using Calibre's EPUB to EPUB conversion and setting the margins for the output file to your liking. If you don't have access to these tools and know about CSS, you can also unzip the EPUB files, change the style sheet by hand and rezip the files back into an EPUB. (This sounds more complicated than it is.)"
How can I read notes alongside with text in Kindle readers?,"The short answer is no. The only way to make notes easier to read is to find a book that has been properly formatted to have hyperlinked inline notes. If a book doesn't have that, then you could either request it from the publisher or fix it yourself."
"When an Amazon account contains more than 1023 purchased Kindle books, how do you access the books beyond the 1023rd book?","This sounds like a limitation of the software, so you probably won't be able to get around it from the device. First, I recommend reporting this as a bug to Amazon. Don't expect them to fix it right away or anything, but it's always good to let the devs know when something doesn't behave as you as a user want. ;) If your final goal is to get all your books to the Kindle somehow, the solution would be to download them from Amazon (""Your Content and Devices"") and sideload them over the USB cable. (It's good to download the files as backups anyway and de-DRM them while you do that, IMO, but that's a different topic...) EDIT - how to report a bug: I forgot that Amazon is one of those ""don't bother us dirty mortal!"" companies. The only way to report a Kindle bug I found is to use the form at /gp/help/support/contact-us (choose ""Devices"" from the buttons above) - and whow, that is one very well-buried page!"
Are there any solutions available for managing a corporate library of ebooks?,"There aren’t many choices. The most simple is to have a cloud-like space/service or simply a shared intranet directory. The need for controlling readers requires much more and is typically dependent on a special app or DRM. This issue is typically a thing for bigger companies like publishers or libraries (Adobe Content Server, Azardi Online). If it is simple, small library it would need simple and strict rules. Otherwise the solution would be expensive, complex and annoying for you. You could also try: Personal Book Space but I have no experiences with it."
How do I modify the connection habits of my Kindle Keyboard 3G?,"I've looked into this since you posted this and it's just not possible. Well, if you want to completely replace the existing OS and software, you could, but that doesn't really address your use case."
"How does the kindle define how many ""book size dots"" to display?","it is accurate. i found at least 10 sizes for 15 plain text book's (azw3 with no  pictures or complicating formatting), according to there reading time. ""approximation of how long the book is."" means: how big is the file. not how many syllables characters or words there are (that's why it says ""approximation""). book's with pictures charts or other formatting, or PDF's will have more dots."
How to sync my Kindle with my Kindle library without using WiFi?,"Using Calibre you could try : Of course this requires some initial configuration (telling Calibre how to send email, ...) and I can not guarantee it will work having no 3G Kindle to test it myself. But it seems to be worth a try as it would most likely make sure that the file that gets copied on your kindle has the right format/information to be identified correctly."
Can you use a Kindle without an Amazon account?,"I just got a new paperwhite, and am reading my own books on it without registering. It nags you to register, but if you open Calibre, and then connect via USB, you can put books on, and it all works just as normal. The only thing you can't do if you don't register is to ""buy"" Amazon's drm books, or access the ones you've already ""bought.""  Although it is possible you may be able to transfer said books through your kindle desktop app, I haven't tried,don't really care. "
"Can I copy or publish, text from a website.","I am not a lawyer, but: If the text is in the public domain, then yes, you can use it. Be sure that it really is in the public domain, though—copyright lasts for a very long time. Also bear in mind that if the text is annotated, translated, or altered in any other way, or if it's a collection of public domain works, there may be further complications. If you have any doubts, you'd be best advised to contact an IP/Copyright lawyer."
High resolution small-size pdf,"The size of a PDF file is dependent on the content of that file. A PDF file is a bundle of streams, with mostly compressed data. If you generate a PDF file from e.g. a Word or OpenOffice document, these file tend to be relatively small, especially if you do not include Font information and rely on the system provided fonts or font substitutions.
Adding images to your text will make the files much larger. Since PDF is one of the minority of image file formats that support multiple images, it is often (mis-)used to store multiple images, that e.g. come from a scan. Those scans are often already compressed JPEG images and for those the PDF file works only as a container (no, or little further compression  is possible). For those kinds of PDF files, the size can be very large, depending on the pixel size of the images (scan resolution x paper format) and in case of lossy compression (JPEG) the quality of the compression.  If you extract such lossy image files to a lossless format like PNG immediately blows up each of the images often by an order of magnitude. So your results are not surprising.  It would be much better to just extract the individual pages of the file into separate PDF files and recombine only the pages that you need. This can be done without  having to decompress the streams containing the imagery e.g. by a program like pdftk. If you pick half of the pages of a book, you can expect to have halve the size document in the end (on average)."

Under what conditions should I apply for ISBN numbers for digital works?,Note the following - Source: http://www.sellbox.com/isbn-essentials-an-faq-for-ebook-publishers/ & Internet
When it is better to use plain HTML instead of CSS?,"In general, formatting with HTML (though regarded as outdated by many, including W3C) tends to work more reliably than formatting with CSS. Support to CSS varies and can be disabled (though this is rare and mainly applies to web browsers). However, HTML formatting is very limited. You can use <i> for italic, <sup> for superscript, and a little else, but you cannot e.g. specify the size or vertical position of superscripts (which depend on user agent and vary considerably). In e-books, however, we can expect CSS work well for the simple formatting that would be possible in CSS, too. I tested your example, with an ebook created with Sigil and then converted to .mobi format with Calibre, and viewed with Kindle for PC, the exponents worked OK, the same way with HTML only, when I used the obvious CSS rules So if the exponents didn’t work, probably either the e-book is missing a CSS rule that makes .apicecorsivo appear as a superscript, or that rule was somehow lost when generating the .mobi version. For stylistic reasons, it is best to avoid mixing HTML and CSS formatting so that e.g. some exponents are marked with <sup>, some just styled with CSS (set on <span> elements for example). The reason is that generally you cannot guarantee that the style applied is really the same. Your example has <span class=""apicecorsivo"">n</span><sup>-1</sup>, which is meant to produce “n−1” as superscript, but it may happen that they will be differently subscripted, i.e. in different font size or in different vertical position. There are considerable styling problems with <sup> in web browsers; they tend to produce uneven line spacing as well as qualitatively questionable superscripts. Such issues might not be that relevant in e-book readers, but it might still be safest to use a combined strategy, using <i> for italic (it’s rather safe) but CSS for superscripting. This would mean, in the example case, HTML markup like with CSS like"
Can I change the cover of a mobi/epub book?,"Yes we can do that using opensource software like Calibre. The cover will be updated in your Kindle device. If its not updated try restarting the device. It will work after some time. The steps for epub files are similar, you will just need to copy the file to a different directory. (There are other programs like Cigil to edit epub files but Calibre can be used for both formats.)"
How do I add a cover (and other pictures) to my ePub?,"Images in general should be added just as they would be in HTML, with an <img> tag. The image files themselves should then be included in the OEBPS folder or a subfolder (I generally use a subfolder, personally). Each image file will need to be declared in the <manifest> section of the content.opf file. As mentioned in the epub 3.0 specifications, the cover image in particular should also have the cover-image property assigned to it in the <manifest>, like so: The <manifest> entry for non-cover images is the same, just without the properties=""cover-image"" bit. That's it for plain epub, but some retailers will also ask for a <meta> element in the <metadata> section of the content.opf file declaring the cover, like so (from Amazon's Kindle Publishing Guidelines): Note that Amazon in particular no longer requires the <meta> bit as long as the properties=""cover-image"" is correctly declared."
Convert Blog to book,"I used to convert web pages to PDF, but on the Kindle it is much nicer to read mobi documents. To convert web pages to mobi, I highly recommend the GrabMyBooks firefox extension. It is the one piece of software that has dramatically improved my experience on my Kindle this year (and I already use great software such as Briss, Librerator and Kranf's Kindle Collection Manager). GrabMyBooks lets you gradually build an ebook in a separate Firefox tab by selecting web pages or content as you go. You can add pages one by one by right-clicking on the page and selecting ""Grab this Page"". If you only want part of a page, you can also select text and grab it. And you can also select multiple links and grab them, which is very convenient if you are interested in multiple blog posts. Usually, when you grab a web page for your ebook, there are many components of the page you do not want: the sidebars, the comments and so on. GrabMyBooks is pretty good at guessing which content you want, but it sometimes gets it wrong. In these cases, it's very useful to be able to select the text you want, right-click and choose ""Grab selected text"". By default, GrabMyBooks creates an Epub. But in the Settings, you can tell it to create a mobi file. For GrabMyBooks to create mobi files, you must have Calibre installed. You then tell GrabMyBooks where Calibre is installed. This may sound like a lot of work, but configuring GrabMyBooks properly is well worth it if you want a luxury experience of creating ebooks from web content on the fly. For instance, there is a setting where you specify the default save directory. Well, I have it save my ebooks directly to my Kindle's ""documents"" folder. Also, there is an option where GrabMyBooks saves an Epub file in addition to the mobi file. This allows you to later load the Epub book in GrabMyBooks and edit it again, adding or deleting web pages. In the settings, you can set a directory where the software will save Epubs, since your default format will be mobi.  I recommend always editing the Metadata setting before grabbing your book so that it displays with a nice title and author name. Hope you like it as much as I do."
EPUB 3.0 <dc:identifier>,"The dc:identifier is commonly an ISBN, though any sort of URN will do. Further information about using  in epub can be found on the IDPF's site, but as a quick example, you could use something like: As long as the identifier is unique, it should be fine. At the above link, the IDPF says: Every metadata section must include at least one identifier element
  containing an unambiguous identifier for the Publication. Multiple
  identifier elements are permitted, but only one can be marked as the
  Unique Identifier via the package element unique-identifier attribute."
What is the formula for converting a 10 digit ISBN to a 13 digit ISBN?,"Wikipedia gives it as The check digit is calculated as per Wikipedia This is the result as a number between 1 and 10, unless the figure is 10 then the result is 0 x_13 = (10 - (x_1 + 3x_2 + x_3 + 3x_4 + ... + x_11 + 3x_12) mod10 ) mod 10 "
Is it advisable to add sound excerpts to an ebook?,"It's great to hear about a project where the audio would actually add substantively to the content of the book--that's too often not the case. In your case, I'd say yes, it does definitely make sense to add the audio, as it is directly relevant and helpful to understanding the subject. It is also perfectly allowable in the epub 3.0 specification, though support is optional rather than mandatory--not all reading systems will have support, but there is a standardized method for those that do support it. Outside of the epub world, things are a little less rosy: Amazon sells files with audio built in, but only supports multimedia on their iOS apps. In addition, last I checked they weren't accepting multimedia-enabled files through KDP (their self-publishing program), even though the instructions for making such files are clearly available in the Kindle Publishing Guidelines. In order to sell a multimedia file through Amazon, you'll need to be able to talk directly to Amazon--if you're a mid size or larger publisher, you probably have a contact you can speak with about that."
How can I optimize an epub file?,"Limiting compatibility issues Making it faster to load Keeping it consistent Keep the visual look as simple as possible; if you want to include some fancy layout (i.e. for chapter titles or other particular portions of text like quotes and so on) try to define it as properly and accurately as possible with CSS styles, and test the outcome with the greater number of reading devices and software that you can. If you want to use any specific font, be sure to include it in the epub file and to define its @font-face and styles in the CSS file."
Is it possible to convert Pocket articles into epub format?,There are several different possible solutions for your task. The approaches differ in terms of used tools and level of automation.
"Start Calibre, update feeds, transfer files and close","You can do it easily from cron (if you are on *nix) and most probably it can be done on Windows too. Calubre includes several command line tools, but for you the most important is ebook-convert(.exe). With that you can create a mobi ebook from the RSS recipe like: Mailing can then be done like: And set up a cron/scheduler job to automail it to you. I'd recommend to read the fine manual. (Note: this wont add the created mobi to your library! But you can do it with the calibredb command as documented here)"
What page size maximizes readability across common ebook readers?,"This would be extremely difficult since the broad range of devices out there have vastly different physical screen sizes and aspect ratios. Your best bet would be to use a small page size (perhaps 4"" x 3"") so that users with e-book apps on their smartphones would still be able to comfortably read the text. This comes at a price: e-book readers or tables with large screens will display very large text - although some might allow you to zoom out or display multiple pages at a time. I would suggest a slightly different route based on this similar question. Instead of exporting from LaTeX to PDF, export to HTML. Then use a tool such as Calibre to convert the HTML files produced to a MOBI or EPUB file."
Is there an ebook format that stores annotations in the ebook file itself?,Simple answer: NO To annotate inside an ebook would require the file to be altered on the device side and some sites will not allow this due to the DRM they add.  That said this is why Kindle creates a secondary file instead of in the ebook itself.  This would also depend on the app you are using to view the ebook on.   Some apps that allow Annotation for books:
When should I completely poweroff an eink device rather than putting it in stand-by?,"The biggest issue is likely to be background network use.

"Does Microsoft allow official readers of ""lit"" format other than MS Reader?","There is at least one reader available for Android now which supports reading lit formatted (non-DRM) books, Cool Reader.

Alternatively, you could follow this recommendation from the developers of Aldiko, another popular eBook reader for Android (quote from www.aldiko.com): If you have non-DRMed books in the following formats: lit, pdf, mobi, rtf, txt, html, fb2, prc**, odt, cbr and cbz, you can use a free software called Calibre to convert any of the above formats to ePub and then import your books into Aldiko. You can get Calibre from here http://calibre.kovidgoyal.net/. If need assistance for doing that, please feel free to let us know.

How can I make mathematics look good in ebooks?,"For my ebook experiment, I use PNG, via Formula Sheet."
Publishing e-book,"That would depend on if you are publishing the ebook yourself or going through a publisher.  Sometimes a publisher provides an ISBN because they buy it in bulk. Having an ISBN is suggested to help identify your book and you can go to Bowker to obtain one.   If you plan to self publish to Amazon, known as Amazon Kindle Direct, you are not required to provide an ISBN:   If you plan to publish to Barnes and Noble, known as Nook Press, you are not required to, and it's optional:  If you go through Apple, my understanding you are not required to provide an ISBN if the title is FREE.  Past experience: if the title is FREE at one point when you self publish you have to go through a lot of hurdles to attach a price to it later down the road.

"Epub OPF 'spine' element: how to exclude an html file from linear reading order, while allowing it to be accessed from a link","<itemref> has linear=""no"" attribute exactly for this purpose. Edit: From the epub 2 specification All OPS Content Documents that are part of the publication (i.e. are
  listed in the manifest) which are potentially reachable by any
  reference mechanism allowed in this specification must be included in
  the spine. Such reference mechanisms include, as a partial list,
  hypertext links within OPS Content Documents, and references by the
  NCX, Tours and Guide. and  For each itemref, the publication author may specify the optional
  linear attribute to designate whether the associated OPS Content
  Document is primary (linear=""yes"", which is the default when linear is
  not present) or auxiliary (linear=""no"".) It is important that the
  publication author include some kind of internal reference, such as a
  hypertext link, to any OPS Content Document that is declared to be
  auxiliary; it is recommended that references be added to NCX for all
  auxiliary content. At least one itemref in spine must be declared
  primary.  Specifying whether an OPS Content Document is primary or
  auxiliary is useful for Reading Systems which opt to present auxiliary
  content differently than primary content. For example, a Reading
  System might opt to render auxiliary content in a popup window apart
  from the main window which presents the primary content. (For an
  example of the types of content that may be considered auxiliary,
  refer to the example below and the subsequent discussion.)  Reading Systems are not required to differentiate between primary and
  auxiliary content, and for the requirements and recommendations given
  in this section may consider all OPS Content Documents in spine to be
  primary, regardless of the value of the linear attribute. This means, all items which are referenced, as footnotes in your case, must be included
in the spine. They can be declared as auxilary, with linear=no, but it is up to reading
system, how it deals with that. More advanced readers, like Azardi or Readium, works correctly and display auxilary items only on request (link click). Others, like ADE, or Calibre in your case, work in the other way.  As I think you use tex4ht for conversion from LaTeX to html, you may try to generate inline footnotes, which doesn't make new file for each footnote, but are collected at the end the html file with:"

Is it possible to share annotations between a Kobo Glo and Calibre Viewer?,"Apparently Calibre does already have the capability to capture the annotations from Kobo. When Kobo is attached to your computer, the ""Send to Device"" logo appears as a menu option in Calibre.  If you right click on that logo, the bottom menu option is ""Fetch annotations (experimental)"".  One caution however is that Calibre seems to fetch the annotations for ALL books that are on Kobo (rather than just the book that is currently highlighted), and then copies the annotations for each book on KOBO and appends it to the comments metadata of the corresponding book in Calibre.

You will need to do this for each of the devices you would like to send the book to - there is no option to send it to all of them. Also, keep in mind that most books limit the number of devices that they may be downloaded to - therefore sending a book to more Kindles than the book allows would be impossible anyway."
Body Text Formatting and Text Indentation for Kindle eBooks,"You can certainly specify custom fonts for Kindle books; that's what section 3.1.9 is all about. Section 3.1.1 is only talking about the things that it mentions: The last point is the only thing that talks about choice of typeface, and it's purely advisory. Note also that  ""body text"" refers to the main text styling of the document, not any text that appears in the <body> of the document (which would obviously be everything). As far as p.body {text-indent: 1.2em;} not working (that's my preferred value, anyway): I've not had that problem. If you can provide some of the relevant xhtml and css, I'd be happy to see if there are any errors I can spot. Using a CSS validator is also a great option."
Can I use a third party software as a full OS replacement on a Kindle Keyboard?,"I do not think that there is any measure to stop you. Maybe except for the fear that you end up bricking the device by not being able to connect to it from your PC.  I do however not see a reason to do this. The only alternative firmware that I know of is Duokan, which works fine in dualboot. So there is no need to remove the original system. Also since the Kindle is already running a Linux (without an X server though). So you could just install the programs you want without having the trouble of missing drivers etc. So all in all it should be possible and I do not think anything would stop you. But lacking any alternative options, I do not see why one should do it."
Calibre ignoring font settings?,"If the ebook contains some definitions about the fonts to use, it takes the precedence over the default Calibre settings. Maybe the ebook you are reading has some CSS rules that define the default font to use on the book itself (and probably the ebook even includes the said fonts). You can try this yourself: this version of Treasure Island from MobileRead include font definitions for the text, and it keep using it even if you change the standard one on the Calibre settings.
This version of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, always from MobileRead, doesn't contain any font definition in its CSS and it uses the default one as defined by Calibre. It just works like that. You should look at the default settings in Calibre as a fall-back in case the book doesn't provide any information in this sense. If you really want to change the font used during reading, you should edit the CSS file(s) inside the epub and remove all references to any defined font. Calibre also has a plugin called Modify Epub that, amongst other things, let you remove internal font settings from an epub file. Once you have installed it, select the epub files you want to modify this way, click the Modify Epub icon on the toolbar, and select the corresponding option, as shown on the picture. It will remove both the custom fonts inside the book and the references to them on the CSS. Please note that if you process many ebooks at once it may require some time to complete this task. "
I have a printed version of a book does it allow me to possess an electronic copy?,"Just like buying a hardcover version doesn't let you also take a paperback from the store, no, having a print version does not entitle you to a complimentary ebook version, though some publishers will offer that when you buy from their websites."
How to add external epub to Kobo Desktop?,"Please note that if you simply need to transfer .epub files to the reader, you can simply connect it to your computer with an USB cable, it will be treated like an external USB storage drive; you can simply copy your books on the reader (maybe on a new sub-directory to keep things clean and neat) and when you disconnect it, it will update the database and recognize your new books. There isn't anything easier than this ;-) Anyway for a more complete management, I suggest you to try Calibre, it is a superb ebook manager itself with a ton of features; also, it is free and opensource and it is available for Linux systems too, if these are things that are relevant for you. One of its strengths is the opportunity to add plugins to extend its functionalities. It works perfectly with any ereader device, without the need to add anything, but I suggest to you a couple of plugins that are specifically aimed at Kobo users, that can be useful to have: Please note that you don't have to download these plugins from the MobileRead forum, the easiest way is to install them directly from inside Calibre, where this task can be performed from a nice and handy graphical interface."
Some classic literature is available for free - but where? [closed],"The best-known resource is Project Gutenberg, which exists for precisely this purpose."
Is epub 3 meant to replace epub 2?,"EPUB 2 will probably not remain an active standard, in the sense that it would evolve over time. The EPUB 2 standard is of course there and stays there and there will be files and devices that follow that standard. Looking at the differences between EPUB 3 and EPUB 2 it seems entirely feasible to make an EPUB 3 device (with or without multimedia) that also properly supports EPUB 2 files. This is little extra work and much more interesting for device manufacturers than asking for and implementing EPUB 2 extensions. There is probably also going to be a subset of devices that don't support the EPUB 3 multimedia extensions, but are based on a rendering engine that supports EPUB 3. Whether you depict such a device as EPUB 2 with some EPUB 3 support or EPUB 3 with backwards compatibility is probably a marketing decision. From a file generation point of view, you can include EPUB 2 compatible info in an EPUB 3 file. I expect publishers to do that. And if they don't it is feasible to add that information later on to such EPUB 3 file. I expect e.g. Calibre to do get such a feature, if it not already can do so. Of course that will not give you multimedia, but for normal books (with the same info as EPUB 2 files have now) that will work."
How does Kindle know my login at first boot?,"From the manual, it tells you that if you purchased the device through Amazon then they use your Amazon account information and register the product to you before they ship the device.  Definitely not mining your wireless AP :) Registering your Kindle
  If you bought your Kindle online using your Amazon account, it is already registered to you.
  To verify, tap the Home button and look for your Amazon user name in the upper left corner
  of the Home screen. If it says My Kindle or shows the name of a previous owner instead of
  your own Amazon account name, you'll need to register it. See Setting up your Kindle

What is the most efficient and safest way to remove fingerprints from my Sony PRS-650 Touchscreen Reader?,"After a little research, I came across this post. It details two different ways to clean eReader screens. One for E-Ink screens and one for LCD screens.  The Coles notes version for E-Ink screens: The Coles notes version for LCD screens: So one recommends water and one recommends against water. PRS-650 is a touch screen, but is E-Ink display. So which way is better? It turns out the PRS-650 does not have a special layer on top of the E-Ink display like it's predecessor (it uses light sources firing over the surface to tell when there is something touching it, or just over it). More info here. So this leads me to believe it should be treated like an E-Ink display and cleaned accordingly."
Security risks when the Kindle(Paperwhite) is plugged into a PC,"TL;DR: Yes, there are some risks. The ereader could transmit a virus from the PC to another PC, if you plug it into another PC. It could receive an infected file from the PC, then reinfect the PC the next time you plug it in, even after you clean up the PC. Or a virus on the computer could damage the ereader somehow. I have never heard of any of these things happening so far. But it's only a matter of time; there is malware for platforms like iOS and Android already, so there's no reason to think ereaders are not also targets. Theoretically, connecting any device to any other device always poses some risks. For example, the United States National Security Agency (NSA) has developed various tracking devices, keystroke loggers, and so on that can be hidden inside an otherwise normal USB cable. Unless you build the computer, ereader, and cable from raw metals and plastics, wrote all of the software yourself, and so on, there are always unknown risks in using any electronic device. That's life, and you can't reinvent the wheel just so you can read a book, so the question is: what's the safest bet? The safe bet here is: never plug any of your devices into a device you can't trust 100%. If you have control over the computer, disinfect it thoroughly with a good virus scanner before plugging in any other devices. If you don't control the computer and don't have confidence that the owner has a good antivirus scanner and maintains the computer properly, don't plug in your device."
Is there a compelling reason to distribute both '.azw' and '.mobi' files?,".azw is basically .mobi with the possibility to add DRM. According to the wikipedia article you cited it even has less instead of more features. Since using DRM is kind of pointless if you also offer a DRM free .mobi version, there is no advantage. .kf8 supports some HTML5 and CSS3 features which the other formats don't. This allows creating more advanced layouts which may be an advantage if you have more than just plain text with chapter marks and headings."
Centering images and text in ePUB and Kindle ebooks,"You will probably run into problems doing it that way, particularly on iBooks. The most reliable method I've found for centering is: With css like this: On a very few reading systems (notably the nook), this can cause problems on some images due (I'm guessing) to rounding errors, so you may have to set the margins just a hair smaller (like 19% in the above example)."
Read Kindle books without Kindle or Kindle app?,"Yes, you can in theory read Kindle books on almost any other ebook reader or tablet.  However, this requires you to convert your mobi or azw file to other formats, such as epub. There is software for this, but, as you can imagine, you will be breaking the DRM. It is therefore not legal, at least in the United States and presumably other countries where the Kindle is sold. Not a great option! If you dislike Amazon devices and software, a better option is to buy books in the epub format. These are not sold by Amazon, but you can find them in online stores such as Barnes & Noble. The epub format give you legal access to a far greater range of devices."
How to change Kindle Windows 8 into a 'normal app',"I have found 2 solutions to this.  The first is to download the Windows 7 version of the Reader from here.  When I installed that particular version on W8.1, the popup said it was going to ""expire soon"" (which likely speaks to the fact that the company will be dropping XP support from the next version, not that they'll be discontinuing the non-Metro version completely). The second is to use the Kindle Cloud Reader.  While it is designed to be used ""in the cloud"" you can download your books to have local copies.  Using this method, you can open the app in a dedicated browser window and resize it as needed."
Is it better to shut down my Kindle Fire or just put it to sleep?,"In most cases, you will not need to shut down your Kindle Fire. The Fire uses a lithium-ion battery, which means you should be connecting it to your charger quite often. (Shallow discharges and frequent recharges are better for your battery in the long run than deep discharges.) The only time you would gain anything from shutting down your Fire would be if you were sure you would not be using the device for an extended period of time (more than a couple days). In that case, the recommended charge for storing a lithium-ion battery is around 40%* - so you should discharge the device until it comes close to that amount and then shut it down. * source"
Converting raw text to Epub,"Epub is actually a collection of files in ZIP format. You can create an epub without any specialize tool, for example taking a book's content from https://github.com/Gluejar/open_access_ebooks_ebook and running Pandoc is an easy to use command line tool to generate epubs, and a lot more markup formats such as LaTeX, Markdown, HTML5, Word docx and ODT are supported. Here is an example: Read more about epub creation examples. I have used it to conveniently generate epub from a Git repositories' documentation to easier reading. A GUI alternative is Sigil, with the benefit of in-place editors as well as extensive styling tools. If you cannot/do not want to install applications, there are online tools that can generate epubs, such as http://ebook.online-convert.com/convert-to-epub"
Will the ads on the Kindle with Special Offers affect my battery life?,"For Kindles that use E Ink displays: E Ink's technology is commonly referred to as ""bistable"". What does this mean? Bistable means that the image on an E Ink screen will be retained even when all power sources are removed. In practice, this means that the display is consuming power only when something is changing. For example, when reading on an eReader, power is only needed when turning to a new page but no power is consumed by the display while reading the page. This is most noticeable when an eReader goes into sleep mode yet there is still an image being displayed. By contrast, with a traditional LCD, the display is needs to be refreshed around 30X per second, regardless of the whether anything new is being displayed. Bistability significantly reduces the power consumption of displays using E Ink and is a key reason eReaders have such long battery life. The ""Special Offers"" do change the screen and therefore cost a small amount of battery when the Kindle goes to sleep.  But Kindles without the ads also change the screen when going to the lock screen.  Depending on the exact nature of the image, it might be more or less expensive in terms of battery than whatever ad you might have received. For Kindle Fires, the ads are run on the lock screen and not when in sleep mode.  Again, the difference is just which image is displayed so the energy cost differential should be negligible. New ads for both platforms must be downloaded occasionally to replace the outdated ones stored somewhere on the device.  But the device only checks for new ads when you sync up, so there's no extra network connections being made.  I've left my WiFi connection off for weeks at a time and the ads just age out and go to a generic screensaver.  As soon as I sync, I start seeing new ads.  The device does not turn on a wireless connection unless you command it to. In sum, battery life shouldn't be a concern one way or another when deciding which configuration to buy."
"Calibre: Author with the word ""and"" in the name?","I use Calibre 2.20 and I find, that if you forego using the ""Edit metadata"" button and just click on the Author field in the main window and edit the name there, you get to keep the ""and"".  If you click on ""Edit metadata"" afterwards you will notice that the ""Author sort"" field has a red marking, however, it should work fine regardless. When you do sort, it will sort using the word ""The"" as far as I can see. In  other words it does not think any of the other words is the last name. The folder will also be named correctly as you can see here in the screen shot. "

How can I cut down on superfluous Instapaper files on my Kindle?,"While Instapaper does not have the full capabilities you desire at this point in time, there is a way to cut down on the mess to get over 1/3 of what you want, mainly by eliminating any possibility for duplicate articles on your Kindle. Here's how: Note that regular Instapaper users always get 10 articles sent to Kindle. On Instapaper's Kindle settings page of the web site, you may select how many new articles triggers sending to Kindle. Choose 10. If you do all your reading on your Kindle and nowhere else (and you never archive any of the most recent 10 articles), then each Kindle digest will have exactly 10 new articles you've never seen before. I personally do 5 because I only clip to Instapaper once every few days and I'd rather get a digest twice per month rather than once per month. So in my case, I know that I can read the 10 most recent articles, and if I want to go back further I'll have to skip the previous Kindle digest which will have 5 duplicate articles. By skipping one digest, I get to a digest which has no repeats."
Would extracting the Kindle highlights from the 'my clippings' file break some usage policy?,"I am not aware of any Amazon or other usage policy regulating the use of this file. The highlights are excerpts (quotes) from the book's content, so the copyright to those excerpts belongs to whoever owns the copyright of the content of the book. However, in most jurisdictions there are exceptions to copyright law that let you do a lot with quotes/excerpts without breaking the law  (e.g. fair use in the USA, fair dealing in the Commonwealth area, private use exception in the EU, etc.). This means that while the contents of the clippings file does not belong to you, you can do almost anything you can imagine with it for your own personal use.  However, you do not have the right to republish your clippings (e.g.: ""Clippings from XYZ selected by magicbirth"") as an ebook or physical book."
Any opensource or free css stylesheets for books?,"Paul Salvette wrote an ebook formatting guide which I recommend. He wrote boilerplate css which you can view/download here: http://bbebooksthailand.com/bb-CSS-boilerplate.html His company has produced some epub3 files which you can download for free. http://bbebooksthailand.com/samples.html (You can inspect them by changing the .epub file extension to .zip and then unzipping). I haven't looked at them yet (I just found them when I started to answer your question), but they should be good guides -- especially because the code epub3 compliant.  Here are some other things to think about:  Most publishers use the epub file as input to generate a kindle file, so there are usually  conditional Kindle adjustments to make. Some use a separate kindle css file, while others just combine everything into one generic file.  You can open and inspect css any epub file which is not protected from DRM. That means you can view code from Oreilly Books or Smashwords. Another option is to download any recent Project Gutenberg title. I recently published a title Soldier Boys by Jack Matthews on smashwords which has some up-to-date templates.  I just uploaded my css for Soldier Boys:  http://www.imaginaryplanet.net/private/general-kindle.css Some notes about my file: Last update was April 2016 not 2013 as I said on the top. I used some default values from a docbook style sheet at the top which would not be relevant to anyone. Also, I did some hocus pocus to make images into chapter titles, so you can ignore the any css classes marked ""image-replace-title"" or p.pseudo-title. (Also I  figured out some Kindle-friendly image css  which I detailed here). 
The cool stuff about my css is my list of breakpoints (which take into account different devices but don't use any kindle-specific media queries). There's no footnotes, boxes or references, but my ebook did have a bibliography. Important: I included a reference to an embedded font -- which you must  delete (I think epubcheck won't validate with a bad font reference). "
Can I suppress Wikipedia lookup on a Kindle Paperwhite?,"I share your pain and although I don't have a solution (almost in 2020...) I do have a viable explanation why they keep it this way. Two factors, based on my thinking:
- They don't want to show an empty card, so they switch to another source when a dictionary definition is not found. (to Wikipedia)
- They have to pay for translations over a certain quota, so they avoid doing unnecessary queries, and therefore will never show the online translation card first. In addition, it seems likely that they don't pay for Wikipedia searches and don't care about the unnecessary, pointless, mindless load that they make on Wikipedia servers. In my opinion they should show the dictionary card first, regardless of whether a definition was found. Show the online translation second, and the Wikipedia one third. (Assuming that they would never pay extra and show the online translation first... which would actually be best for users). So I suggest that they ALWAYS show: Dictionary-Translation-Wikipedia Current behavior, as of Dec 2019:
Regardless of whether the WiFi is turned on, they show:
- Dictionary-Wikipedia-Translation when the term is found in the dictionary.
- Wikipedia-Translation-Dictionary when the term is NOT found in the dictionary."
custom bullets html ebook kindle,"There are a few things going on here. The spacing issue is likely being caused by the presence of block elements inside list elements—the headers are probably getting bumped onto their own line, apart from the start of the list item. If you're starting with the toc.xhtml of an epub file, you'll need to lose any elements inside the Table of Contents list (which must be in a <nav>) other than <span>, <a>, or <ol>. You've got a couple other minor problems that are probably from typing stuff in here, but to hit them quickly: Try out the following: You could as easily give the class definition to each <ol>, and then have the CSS point to ol.tier3 li { color: blue; } or whatever styling you want— might be easier to read the code that way. Hope that's useful!"
Disabling Ads on a Kindle with Special Offers,"From Amazon's help on Special Offers: You can unsubscribe from Special Offers on your Kindle if you do not want to receive Sponsored Screensavers and Special Offers. Amazon is able to offer Kindle models at a subsidized price by delivering Special Offers and Sponsored Screensavers. If you originally purchased a Kindle Special Offer Device you will be charged a one-time payment to unsubscribe from this service. Last I checked, the one-time payment that was listed for me was the same as the original amount I saved by buying a With-Special-Offers device."
How to handle footnotes when working with epub files,"Remember that you are trying to apply the expectations for a print book onto an ebook. That may be a mistake. You don't need to re-create everything; you just want something that approximates what you want.   A simple hyperlink to an End Notes section at the end of the book would satisfy the functional need even if it's not the same thing. Fast and easy to implement, and fast and easy to use.  For your specific page of text, a popup from an   might be the best solution. ibooks implements a fairly good solution here. http://sketchytech.blogspot.com/2014/03/practical-notes-on-using-pop-up-notes.html Here's a long discussion of how to implement it in Kindle. 
http://www.mobileread.mobi/forums/showthread.php?t=249033
(This thread is 3 pages long, and basically offers a way to have it work in e-ink devices as well as kf8). It does look pretty messy though.  By the way, from that thread is the interesting remark that the editing part of Calibre seems to support making footnotes.  Having a list of notes at the end of the book which you can link to directly from the text which will then point back to the text itself is probably the safest method you need.  I personally would wait until the Kindle Formatting Guide provides a specific supported mechanism for footnotes before you start messing around with popups.  But if you can easily manage one epub for ibooks and another epub for the current stable of Kindle devices, that should last you a while. I guess you would also need a simple epub where all the notes go to a final end notes chapter. The semantics for all three ebooks seem to be different, so maintaining three separate ebooks seems to be a pretty amount of work. If it were merely a matter of changing CSS between versions, that would be more manageable (although I guess you could make the text for asides hidden via css for non-ibooks epubs).  I suspect that PDF's output from InDesign can be configured to show footnotes on the bottom of printed pages.  If the ebook deliverable can be a PDF, then you wouldn't even need to worry about that.

Do book prices tend to fluctuate with seasonality,"Do prices tend to increase, decrease, or stay the same during the
  holiday season (i.e. Christmas, Hanukkah, etc.)? From my experience, book prices tend to be reduced around the holiday season, September-January, to drive sales when some people buy tablets or mobile devices as gifts or even on Black Friday.  Depending on the e-retailer there are some programs you can sign-up for that will help drive a sell, such as package deals.  I've seen some publishers drive prices lower than usual when they have a feature series they are trying to push. Is there a most expensive season for book prices? I wouldn't consider it a ""most expensive"" I would look at it as less discounts or specials in the transition from spring to summer but that's my experience.  Do eBook prices have different trends than paperback book prices? The only trend I would consider is the pricing model with printed books VS ebooks.  Some people think that it's OK to price retail for print when some people refuse to pay the same price for a physical item compared to a digital copy.  One of my dislikes with ebooks compared to print is the design around them. Some people think that as long as I take my well designed print book and copy all the text and drop it into a .doc file I can generate an .epub or .mobi file out of it then charge a bloated fee when you don't get the same quality as a printed or even own the rights to it. For geographical context, this question is about books sales in the
  northeastern areas of the United States.  I mostly shop for books at
  Barnes & Noble, so I'd be most interested to know how their prices
  fluctuate. In regards to pricing e-retailer VS e-retailer you actually sign away your pricing rights, such as: Amazon mentions in their contract that if they find a cheaper price for your title they are allowed up to a 10% option for less and I believe Apple does it, too.  The downfall with many stores is the gouge to sell your title and that will play a factor on where you buy your book and the price."
How to export (or share) a highlighted PDF from Kindle Reader?,"Kindles' have USB Drive Mode. which allows you to export all of your notes (except pictures): Note: My Clippings is a txt file, which is quite hard to read.

Where can I find custom dictionaries for my Kobo Glo?,"Apologies for replying as an answer, I have no sufficient reputation to comment. I am the creator of Penelope. I thought about this for a bit, but the main problem is that I am continuously asked to ""convert"" materials that are clearly pirated from copyrighted, commercial dictionaries --- which I always refuse --- and hosting them onto a public web site would yield to legal issues. Probably the best option would be creating a thread in MobileRead, but clearly only for public domain or CC-licensed materials. EDIT: I created such thread: http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=2755188 EDIT 2: I posted directions on how to install custom dictionaries on Kobo devices in the Penelope GitHub README: https://github.com/pettarin/penelope"
"Paperwhite error on open book, how do I get the error log?","I don't think they make an app for the PaperWhite since it would appear it is Amazon content dedicated and not based of Android because I recall being able to install error logging apps from Android on my Kindle.   Since this is a DRM free book I would omit the usage of Calibre.  That said I would download Kindle Previewer and browse the book for any possibly display issues and see if you can duplicate the error.   If you have found no display issues or get any errors when viewing the book through Kindle Previewer I would install KindleGen and unpack the .mobi file back to .epub format.  Then run the .epub file through IDPF validation.  If you want you could edit the .epub file in Calibre but I would do it manually, that's just me, and then you can use KindleGen to convert back to .mobi format. If you find any issues and have paid for the book I would contact the buyer and inform them you have an issue with the .mobi file and would like a refund if you cant correct the issue."
Should a title have two ISBNs if one is fixed ePub and one is free flowing ePub,"Yes, you should. The point of ISBNs is to identify distinct formats--in the world of print, a paperback and a hardcover would have different ISBNs. As Bowker (the US ISBN authority) says on their site: The ISBN identifies a specific title, edition, and format being made
  available for sale. You will need an ISBN for each unique version of
  your book. For example, if you plan to release a hardback edition,
  softbound edition, EPUB edition, MOBI edition, and PDF edition, then
  you will have 5 unique versions of your book. One of the most important things that an ISBN will do for an ebook is ensure that the right version gets sold to people with the right devices, so that nobody ends up with a format that they can't use. Because fixed layout is not something that all reading systems support, you'll want a different ISBN for fixed layout than for reflowable."
How beneficial was the Baen Free Library to Baen publishing?,"Karen Woodward wrote a blog on How To Use Permanently Free Books To Increase Sales. ONe topic her blog entry focuses on is how Lindsay Buroker used the power of perma-free and how it can increase awareness of your books to increase sales. What ended up working for Lindsay was making one of her books
  permanently free and distributing it as widely as possible. People
  loved her work, went looking for more, and when they found her other
  books they were happy to pay for them. According to the Karen, Lindsay herself said (Lindsay's original blog entry here): What did make a difference for me, especially with Amazon UK and the
  international Apple stores, was having a book permanently free on
  those sites. I’ve talked a lot about this before, but I made my first
  Emperor’s Edge book (and eventually my first Flash Gold novella as
  well) free at Smashwords about a year ago. I had the freebies
  distributed through their partner sites, and Amazon eventually matched
  the price. What took longer, but did eventually happen, is that Amazon UK (and
  DE, ES, IT, etc.) price-matched the ebook to free as well. That’s when
  I started seeing sales of my other books in those stores. It was a
  similar process for iTunes. It’s taken a while for the free ebooks to
  percolate through, showing up in the international Apple stores, but
  I’m now selling books every month in Apple AUD, DKK, GBR, etc. and am
  making between $1,500 and $2,000/mo overall in overseas sales. After this blog entry, she posted a follow-up blog entry. It covers the following: Quick Summary: In this post I want to look, first, at a variation on the idea of
  using permanently free electronic books to increase sales of your
  other work: make the ebook version of a book free and use it as
  advertising for the paper version. Then we'll look at another indie
  author--Robert J. Crane--who uses the technique of perma-free to sell
  books AND he has been so kind as to share his sales figures. Here is the blurb about Robert J. Crane and using perma-free works to push sales: Indie author Robert J. Crane left a comment on my first post where he
  generously shared some of his sales figures. I have Robert's kind his
  permission to reproduce his comment here: I have two books set to perma-free, the results are thus: Released my first book [Defender] in June 2011. Between then and June
  2012 I never sold more than low double digits (best month was
  something like 25 sales across 3 novels and 2 short stories).  Set my first series book free in my high fantasy series in July 2012,
  my urban fantasy series first book [Alone] permafree in September
  2012. July 2012: 169 sales Aug 2012: 319 sales Sep 2012: 1759 sales Oct
  2012: 2727 sales Nov 1st to 20th: 3008 sales Most of these are at $4.99 or their foreign equivalent. Hope this
  helps give a little inspiration or data to make a decision off of, at
  least.  Needless to say, I highly recommend perma-free.  Wow! Look at that
  jump between August and September in terms of sales: 1,590 units more.
  That's over 5 times better than any of the previous months. And at 70%
  of $4.99 that's over $5,000.* So evidence (though it may not be hard facts) does suggest that using free books/ebooks can increase revenue. NOTE: I have sent Karen a message to ensure she is ok with excerpts from her blog post to be copied here."

Kindle Paperwhite Repair Code 2,"Yes, see the discussion on: http://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/2xojx2/how_to_fix_your_paperwhite_if_it_says_your_kindle/ It is happening IMHO due to Over The Air (pushed) software updates failing, either due to bugs in the new release or the update process not behaving. The biggest issue is that Amazon won't admit it and if your unit is out of warranty they want to sell you a new one instead of telling you the simple method of doing a factory reset, i.e. adding a DO_FACTORY_RESTORE file to your root directory! This is utter fraud by Amazon and I spent hours on calls to Amazon trying to get my unit fixed/replaced to no avail. The biggest conspiracy is why this simply fix seems to be widely discussed on Chinese and Russian web site but not on any english sites (hence my propencity to add the magic file name in posts on this topic)."
Scaling all pages in a PDF or DJVU file to the same size,"There is a program called jPdftweak which will let you scale pdf pages to whatever size you would want. You can set the parameters for the conversion to the larger page size and jPdftweak will scale all the pages in the file in accordance with the settings you have made. jPdftweak is a cross-platform, free Java program. "
Kindle Book published old version,"To answer your last question, no it should not be necessary to contact support to receive an updated version of an ebook. If a kindle account has chosen to enable automatic updates, these updates should just show up.  Whether the Kindle device does this reliably is a separate question of course. Let's try to troubleshoot the obvious things. Let me say that I use KDP a lot and have never had problems like you have suggested.  Has your dad's account turned off automatic updating?  Possibly the problem is one with your dad's device; can you verify that it has Internet and can download other titles? Most devices have a SYNC button which can force a sync.  You should also try to test this for other accounts/devices. You can do this by making an insignificant update on the title page. (maybe add an extra word or letter). Update that version and then you can download a sample of the ebook on another device and see what happens.  The key thing is to establish whether it is happening to all accounts and all devices, or only your dad's account or only to one device of your dad's. That would seem relatively easy to do.  You should also check to see if there are more than one versions of the same ebook on the same device. This has happened to me before. I will upload one version for testing, and then have alongside it a version available for sale. It may appear that the ebook has not been updated when all I have been doing is viewing an older version of a file which I uploaded earlier.  One other thing. This may not apply to you, but often while testing ebooks I upload ebooks to a specific device using the Manage Personal Documents feature. If you are uploading a no DRM ebook (as opposed to downloading an ebook you have paid for), the device will process the ebook somewhat differently. Also, it can be easy to accidentally specifically a wrong device if the account had multiple devices associated with it. So for uploading Personal Documents (in this case ebooks), you should doublecheck whether you have chosen to send the updated file to the right device.  (Hey, please let SE know what happens. I'm in the middle of updating 3 ebooks right now, and remain curious about where things messed up). "
"Kindle - single gesture / action to go ""back""","No.  I have found no way of doing this with my Paperwhite (and I have tried quite a few things).  This would be very useful to have; perhaps if we suggest it to Amazon, it may become a feature?"
What is the native pixel resolution of the viewable area on a Kindle Paperwhite 2 when displaying a .pdf file?,"To prevent the images from scaling you should set the width of the image in pixels rather than in, eg, 100%. It appears that the Kindle Paperwhite is 4.6 inches wide at 212 ppi (source), which comes to an unlikely 975.2 pixels wide—but it's a place to start. I would suggest setting image width (or width of containing div) to 970 px for starters. If it's distorted, then there is probably a hard-coded margin for the page of greater than 2 pixels, so reduce a small amount and try again. Note that specifying the pixel size will mean that on other Amazon devices, the image will not resize to fit the screen—iPad and iPhone Kindle app users may not be happy with the end result."
How to avoid ebook image distortion,"This sounds like a problem with the CSS that Calibre is generating for the epub file. Without seeing the code, it's impossible to say for sure, but my guess is that it's got the width and height for images both set to 100%, which would distort the images in the way you're describing. The answer is to simply remove the height declaration, which will make the images full width of whatever height is appropriate given their aspect ratio. I don't use Calire, so I can't tell you how to use that tool to do this, but if you're comfortable editing HTML and CSS, all you'll need to do is crack open the epub file (rename it from .epub to .zip, then unzip it), find the images being affected in the HTML, figure out which selectors the CSS is targeting them with, and go change the relevant CSS declarations."
Generating Previews,"The ePub file does not contain any information about the InDesign pagination -- that information is all left behind when the ePub file is generated. So your only possible way to do that is inside InDesign. Inside InDesign it will be either point-click-clic-click ...a few thousand times or you script it with an additional tool like AutoHotkey or AutoIt that can open, select the first 10 pages and then save the selection to ePub and re-do-it in the next file... If your files have a lot of consistency -- almost the same structure -- and you can live with separating the first chapter, for example, then you can open them up (unzip), and edit with ""sed"" or ""awk"" to have a smaller set containing only a certain specific part. "
How can non-US customers buy Kindle Active Content,"You got me curious, so I started digging through the terms of service. Keep in mind that I am not a lawyer, so anything I say is just my own personal interpretation of the terms. After reading through who-knows-how-many documents, this is all I could come up with. The Kindle Store Terms state: ""In addition, you may not bypass, modify, defeat, or circumvent security features that protect the Kindle Content."" (emphasis mine) This is a little vague, but using an address that isn't yours to access Kindle content could possibly be seen as ""bypassing"" security features."
Where is the best place to get Calibre?,The calibre home page is at https://calibre-ebook.com As this is open source you can see what is included in the download. The source is on Github In general for all downloads never download from a place that lists downloads always look for the author's home page. Or you can trust places you know about by other means than a simple search.
printing an ePub,"Instead of converting with Calibre, you can directly print from the Calibre book viewer¹ and use a (virtual) printer driver that supports booklets construction on the fly.  On Windows and OSX these are more common. If you are on Linux you can easily create by installing CUPS, impose+, psutils and a few lines of code for the backend  ¹ At least from the viewer included in Calibre version 1.17, probably earlier"
What's the correct way for developers to edit PDF?,"The ""problem"" is that PDF does not know anything about its contents and the structure of the document (unless structure has been added — maybe in order to make it accessible). That means that you will have to find other ways to recognize (in the case of a TOC) titles etc.  One possibility (and I think PDFpen is doing it that way) is enumerating all text elements, comparing them with the properties you defined to be ""Title"", stitching them together (note that a word in PDF may not correspond to what we see as ""word""), making a list of titles, creating another page, and create the TOC, and finally establish links between the TOC and the corresponding targets. Another thing to know is that it is way more complex to read a PDF than to write one. This is the reason why there are more libraries (and applications) to just write PDF than being able to read and write (and even fewer to understand PDF…). Now, because creating a TOC is something which does not happen that frequently, and requires a visual check anyway, it would be reasonable instead of trying to create an application to do it, to seriously consider a plug-in for Acrobat. Acrobat's API for plug-ins is rather extensive, and reasonably well documented, and there is a community which provides support. AFAIK, this API is free to use, unless you want the plug-in work with Reader (in that case, you will need a license from Adobe). The advantage of this approach is that you can rely on Acrobat's capabilities to write a proper, good quality PDF. To answer your (rather rhetoric) question why editing tools are so rare… Well, PDF is much more than a simple text file…"
Can a Sony 700 cover be repaired?,"Before bending, warm the ""clam"" with an electric paint stripper (maybe a hairdryer is enough). I used a heat focusing cone for the stripper. Apply short shots from a short distance until the plastic is warm and stays in shape when moved. Keep in place until cooled. I did this more than one year ago and it still works. Be very careful with bending when inserting PRS-700 back in. Do not overstretch the plastic again. Also, use tools to prevent burning your fingers. Mine was broken at top, so not much strain on the plastic while reading."
Is there a detailed guide for creating an ebook for Kindle in HTML/CSS,"Your best bet is to start with a solid epub file and run that through either KindleGen or Kindle Previewer. Other tools such as Sigil and Calibre are convenient, but often cause problems down the road by inserting their own bits of code. If you want to be certain that you know what is causing your problems, it's always best to do it yourself. The single best resource for creating a solid, valid epub file is the IDPF's epub 3.0 specification. Once you feel like you've gotten it pretty close, use epubcheck to find and iron out the kinks. A valid epub 3.0 file should transform seamlessly into a valid mobi/KF8. Once you have the valid epub, you can begin your Kindle-specific styling. Make sure you pay attention to the specific requirements of the Kindle Publishing Guidelines when you are doing so. For basic getting started guides, you might check out Harrison Ainsworth's ""EPUB Format Construction Guide."" It's a bit dated by now, and only deals with epub 2.0.1, but it will cover the basics pretty well. O'Reilly has a book on EPUB 3 Best Practices that's not too shabby, but it might go into more detail than you need to get started. Do a bit of reading, but not too much, and then find a non-DRM'ed epub file and tear it apart (just change the filename from .epub to .zip and unzip it) to see what makes it tick. Change stuff, re-zip is (how you do that will depend on the operating system you use) run it through epubcheck, and see what error messages you get. Getting a valid book is quite doable with minimal experience. As far as styling goes: there are lots of quirks in reading systems and devices. If you want to only do Kindle, you're cutting out a lot of potential issues, but each of Amazon's devices has its own quirks as well, so be prepared to test a lot, and ask lots of questions when problems come up. Best of luck!"
How do I delete a book off of my Kindle account?,"NOTE: Though your Kindle Library will list Audible audiobooks, as well as Kindle ebooks, you cannot use this method to delete Audible audiobooks from your Library. Audible currently does not provide users this option. If you insist, you can contact Audible customer support and they will do it for you, or if the book is eligible for refund, you can initiate a so-called 'book return' (and receive a refund) on the Account Details page of Audible.com, where you will see an 'eligible' link in the 'Return' column of the row corresponding to the audiobook you wish to return to Audible."
How to run EpubCheck on Windows?,"I use a GUI version, that conforms to the standard. It checks all the same places, and the references. All you would need to do is open the file and drag and drop the EPUB file, you can even verify multiple EPUBs by folder.  The download page at pagina has an English description below the German.
Downloads available for Windows, OSX and Linux."
Can books be transferred from Nooks to Kindles and back?,"The most effective way to manage your Nook books on your Kindle (without removing the DRM) is to obtain the Nook for Android app and sideload it on to the Kindle (you'll need a Fire or later model to do this).   If you don't have another Android device handy, you will need to find a means to download the Nook APK file to your computer."
Are there any specific features that I should look for in an eBook reading application?,"To add to already good answers: NOTEs:  ""[Phone]"" marks features that have more impact and usefulness on a smartphone and may be less important on a tablet. I won't delve into content management/library organization features (e.g. dealing with multiple books), as that warrants its own Q&A in my opinion, and was also mentioned as a bullet in Jason Down's answer. If Jason doesn't mind, I can expand in my answer. Readability/UI. Night reading mode [Phone] Optionally hideable UI elements to free up screen (menus, navigation, buttons, Android notification bar). [Phone] Support for locking the reader in a landscape/portrait mode for when you accidentally flip your phone sideways - or vise versa, ability to choose the orientation of reading independent of OS. (already noted in another answer, but so critical I have to mention here as well): Support for customized fonts, and if possible, colors. Disable CSS (seems like a small deal, till you meet an ebooks where the publisher evidently fell in love with Geocities style of content design :) Support for reading books aloud (Text-to-Speech) Ability to select text, and copy it or share it to another Android app. Navigation: Ability to advance through the text by tapping large areas of the screen (typical good design does page up on clicking left 1/3 of the screen, page down on right 1/3 of the screen) Easy random jumping (go to page #N, go to table of contents in single clicks) Full text search! Book progress indicator, ideally with 2 features: clicking on it in the middle lets you actually advance into the book to where you pointed; and being able to hide. Bookmarks! [Phone] Ability to page up/down by using volume up/down hardware keys. Critical for single-handed reading on a phone. Autoscroll if you like that feature (personally, I never use it) Supported content - probably most important!: Support for varying e-book formats.  Your main reader app should at the very least support the major ones (ideally, most of: txt, html, epub, prc/Mobi, pdf). Support for your main e-book format (e.g. if 90% of your ebooks are in Amazon Kindle format, it's important Support for DRM on books you freqently use may be important for some. If it's important for you, support for your preferred ebook vendor (Google Play Books; Kindle/Amazon book store, Apple, Samsung). If you read ebooks in other languages, support for popular encodings for them (nothing more annoying than trying to read a Russian ebook and finding the app doesn't support KOI-8). Support for network- or cloud-based libraries  Related to the last one: ability to sync up the book positions/bookmarks between different devices running the same app (I know FBReader does that via a helper app, not sure if Kindle reader or Google Books does). Ability to share a book via Android share menu, from within the reader. Ability to manage book collections/libraries, if that's important to you Reality check features Price (and if the app has a free/paid version, which features are important and in the non-free version). For example, Calibre for Android is a paid app (Windows one is free) Last but not the least speed of loading and speed of reading. On my old phone, Kindle App was absolutely horrendously slow, to the point of being unusable. Less popular but occasionally cool: Amazon X-Ray On the fly translation. I know Google Books and FBReader support it, but seems more of a gimmic, IMHO. If you don't plan on editing your eBooks on a PC, you may want to consider editing abilities of the app Editing metadata Editing content."
Big screen dimensions or high DPI for vision impaired users?,"I would suggest going with an iPad with Retina Display not because: BUT because Apple requires their typeset to be adjustable and coded in to accommodate for visually impaired and not a fixed font size.  So what this means is if your dad buys a book on iTunes, he tries to adjust the font size and fails, he can request a refund on the book and Apple will require the publisher to correct the issue to re-activate their content to be sold. My experience with Amazon is across the board and is generally a ""How many users have complained base"" and their support is across the board.  If he does have an issue with the book he can get a refund but the smaller device would be harder for your dad to read perhaps.  This may be an extension on your question but the quality of the content is as much important as the device you are getting."
Kindle paperwhite loses the Wifi connection all the time,"This appears to be a known issue with the Kindle Fire. I'm assuming it is also an issue for your model. I would suggest that you just broadcast your SSID. Most people report this is fixes the issue. If you are not broadcasting it for security reasons, that is what encryption and password are for. If someone wants to break into your network, hiding the SSID is not going to what stops them from getting in. There are many freely available programs that can detect non-broadcasting networks."
Setting up margins in ePUB and Kindle ebooks and @page rule,"Quite a few rendering engines are actually taking @page into account. Others like iBooks or Kindle are ignoring it and overriding the margins' values set for body with default values. I can confirm @page works well in Adobe Digital Editions -- and some but not all apps + devices using Adobe's RMSDK.  To sum things up, you can use it to set a margin for each page/window/screen while top and bottom margins set for body are just applied to the first (top) and the last (bottom) page of every new (x)HTML file. As regarding values, don't set them in em in this reflowable world of ours. The more you will increase the font-size, the more those margins will increase as well.  Px and pt will remain the same, whatever you do.  % will remain the same and be interpreted as % of screen, which is the most ""reflowable-compliant"" choice in theory. 3% of a phone screen < 3% of a tablet screen < 3% of a computer screen."
PRS-T2 very slow with some PDFs,"You should consider converting these to EPUB files instead of PDF. My experience with Sony is that the EPUB files are handled much better (and faster). You can use Calibre to convert DOCX, ODT and RTF formats directly, if you have the files in some other format you can use LibreOffice to convert them first to DOCX (make sure you have an up-to-date version of Calibre, older versions only supported RTF). Another alternative is to use pandoc for conversion from DOCX or ODT, but you would have to try to make sure if images are correctly converted."
How to manage my e-book library across my devices,"Ok, so here is my current solution, which is not perfect but that corresponds more or less with my current need. PC with windows are using the portable version of Calibre. The library and the metadata are stored in a specific dir in  my filesystem that is synchronized with my local onedrive directory. Android devices are using the Calibre Companion app ($4) and are configured to use my onedrive cloud account.
I'll probably change that in order to use a cloud synchroniser tool to mirror my cloud storage to the SDCard and point Calibre Companion to my local storage instead ! IOs: don't need it at the moment. What needs to be improved: possible conflict between metadata of pc version: I need to investigate if I can have a centralized version of calibre that can received updates from secondary devices. But right now I use the same machine for adding new stuff, so is is fine. Need to find a way to push my ebooks with DRM to calibre. No really needed, because Kindle app is ubiquitous, but I would like to have one central place to organize my ebooks collection."
"The content of ""My Clippings"" file are not shown when in the book","When you make a highlight or note, a copy is written to the My Clippings file. This is a one-time, one-way operation. Think of it as a record of the notes and highlights that you've made in the past. The file is only a text file, and you can open it on your computer and modify it any way you like, or even delete it, and it will have no effect on what you see when you read the book on your Kindle. Likewise, removing or changing a highlight or note in the Kindle book will not affect the original entry in My Clippings, although it may create a new entry. The notes and highlights that are displayed in Kindle books are stored in a companion file on the Kindle. It used to have a .mbp suffix, but it may be different with the newer formats. What may have happened in your case is that you downloaded the book file but not the companion file. This can happen if you downloaded it to your computer and transfered to the Kindle with a USB cable, or if you just did not allow enough time for all the ""extras"" to be downloaded before turning off wireless.  One more possibility is that you deleted the book and/or deregistered it from the original account before the Kindle was able to back them up on Amazon's servers. Normally this happens in the background, but if you do not use wireless very often, it may not have happened. If that is the case, your notes may actually be gone, but as Debra said, you do at least still have the copy in the My Clippings file, and that can also be your guide if you want to put them back in the book as well."
How does Adobe Digital Editions work with Kobo's DRM?,"According to the Kobo website: When do I need to use Adobe Digital Editions? If you use any of Kobo's free reading apps or a Kobo eReader, you may
  never need to use Digital Editions at all. Kobo's reading apps and
  eReader can automatically download most books from the Kobo Store, and
  update your library with them. The exceptions are when: You want to read eBooks from another store or from a library on a Kobo eReader; You buy Adobe DRM PDFs from the Kobo Store and want to read them on a Kobo eReader; You want to read books from the Kobo Store on an eReader from another company. In these cases you will need to use Digital Editions to open your
  books and transfer them to your eReader. The reason for this is that most eBooks from online booksellers and
  libraries are protected by Digital Rights Management (DRM). DRM
  prevents the unauthorized copying or redistribution of eBooks, to
  protect the rights of authors and publishers. There are different
  types of DRM, but Kobo supports a version by Adobe. This is why you
  may need to use Adobe's software, Digital Editions, to open and
  transfer some eBooks to your eReader. Also, when you buy a book from the Kobo store, you often receive an ACSM file (I have received this type of file often when buying ebooks from the Kobo store for my Sony Reader PRS-650). An ACSM file is a license file that Adobe Digital Editions will first verify and then download the appropriate ebook.  UPDATE (I should have read further down... they mention the ACSM files on the same page as linked above): Why did I get an ACSM file when I downloaded my book from the Kobo
  Store? Your Kobo eReader can read books in EPUB and PDF format. (A file
  format is how books are stored on your computer.) If you downloaded a
  book and received an ACSM file, don't worry – this isn't a problem.
  The ACSM file is the license for the PDF or EPUB book you bought. To
  get the book itself you just need to open the ACSM file in Adobe
  Digital Editions. Digital Editions will verify your license and then
  download your eBook in either EPUB or PDF format. You can then
  transfer your book to your Kobo eReader (or another compatible
  eReader). You will get a license file if you download a book that is protected
  by Adobe Digital Rights Management (DRM). DRM prevents the
  unauthorized copying or distribution of books, to protect the rights
  of authors and publishers. Most books in the Kobo Store are protected
  by DRM."
Kindle Touch Battery Replacement,"While changing your battery is an option.  I would recommend contacting Kindle support first. Even if the warranty has expired, free or low cost replacement devices can be had.  In my experience, there are multiple levels of support.  When I first called, someone speaking English as a second language was giving answers from helpdesk answer book, (not so helpful).  They offered, or I asked to talk to kindle support (don't recall exactly) and I was transferred to a person who seemed to have language and kindle familiarity in common with me.  I received an refurbished kindle keyboard in the mail a couple days later. Had a few days grace to transfer non-amazon content from the old to the new. I mailed it back (postage paid by amazon I think) and all is well.   I have heard of others who had an older device be offered great deals on refurbished device and been happy with the outcome.  It's a free call, so nothing to loose.  Put 'kindle support' in the search window at Amazon.com and go from there."
Online ebooks management system that can be hosted on a server,"I am not sure why you would need to run this on a web server; if it is just for backup reasons and distributed access I would just push the folder in one of the common online storage solutions like Dropbox or similar. Calibre can be run as a server itself and offer the files in its library via a web interface. You can then access the files via the web browser of your reader. It works, but if you have access to a computer where you can use Calibre directly I think it is much more practical by several orders of magnitude. But your specifications are not specific enough to tell if this solution fits your needs. Google Play Books allows you to upload your own books so you could use this for synchronisation and distributed access also."
Does Amazon accept fixed layout ePubs?,"If you have a fixed layout epub 3.0 file, it's not much of a jump to prepare it for conversion to KF8 fixed layout. KF8 is, of course, the newest version of Amazon's proprietary ebook format.  KindleGen or Kindle Previewer are the two options for creating a KF8 file from an epub file. Kindle Previewer is essentially a graphical interface for KindleGen that comes packaged with a previewer for the various Kindle devices. Personally, I prefer it over KindleGen; the previewing functionality is really handy. That said, don't trust the previewer too far--it will not always accurately represent what the devices will show. It's always best to test on an actual device, if you can. The guidelines for preparing an epub file for KindleGen/Previewer are found here: https://kindlegen.s3.amazonaws.com/AmazonKindlePublishingGuidelines.pdf (PDF format) In general, having a validating epub 3.0 fixed layout file will get you 95% of the way there, though KF8 introduces some extra functionality like being able to define verso and recto (left and right) pages in a two-page spread, and also region magnification to allow zooming on particular areas of text. There is a sample KF8 fixed layout file available at http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000729511. Again, be certain that the Fixed Layout epub that you have is the epub 3.0 variety, rather than Apple's iBooks-only fixed layout format. The Apple format came out before the IDPF developed Fixed Layout for epub 3.0, and while Apple's format seems to have served as the basis for the IDPF format, it doesn't necessarily make a valid epub 3.0 file. You can use the online validator here (http://validator.idpf.org/) to test your file to be sure that it's valid. So, long story short: Amazon does not sell or support epub files of any type, but they do have tools and information available for converting valid epub files to mobi/KF8, including for Fixed Layout books. Hope that helps!"
Is there online eBook authoring tool which can produce ePub and PDF formats?,I have heard of 2epub but I have never used it nor would I believe you would get a good quality ebook.  I would suggest doing this with InDesign that will allow you to create .epub or .pdf files. You can export as an .epub file:  Export to .pdf file: 
Is there any way to address encoding errors in purchased ebooks,There is not a way you can correct an ebook without removing the DRM and adjusting the code.  Depending on where you purchased your ebook you should contact their customer service and they will require that the publisher/author correct the issue and issue you a refund.  
Convert PNG to DJVU,"PNG and DjVu are complementary formats as PNG is lossless and DjVu is lossy. DjVu's effectiveness in storing information is the result of using high quality compression and splitting a single image into multiple layers which essentially employ different compression algorithms. As you indicate, you already know how to convert JPEG or PPM to DjVu, so the simple answer is convert your PNG to either JPEG or PPM and use that as an input for you known conversion. These can be considered different routes to obtaining a DjVu file because they store data in different layers, and they don't generate the same output (in quality and compression). Hazzit's answer is correct for monochrome images, as it first converts the PNG to a bitonal (black & white) image that is then, using cjb2, stored in the bitonal layer of a DjVu file. With the --clean option cjb2 does only minimal lossy compression, but if you start out with a multicolor PNG (such as a photo), you will have lost most of the information in the conversion to a bitonal image. Low color PNG images can be converted first to .ppm (you can do this with the ImageMagick as in Hazzit's answer as well by specifying a .ppm output file name instead of a .pbm) and then use cpaldjvu. This program does simple quantization, and stores this information into multiple layers. If your PNG has many colors (like in a photo) you will have better results converting the PNG file to JPEG (again with convert and a .jpg output file) and then use that to convert to DjVu. You can e.g. print/convert the PNG to PostScript and use that as input to pdf2djvu that is part of DjVuLibre. The resulting image data is compressed using Wavelet compression and stored in a different layer from the bitonal one mentioned in the previous example. What route to take depends on the contents of the input file format and the required result, far more than it does on being a PNG file. Especially with the DjVuLibre tools no boilerplate answer can be given, as they do not help you determine what compression is best for the image you provide. You implicitly do that by selecting the conversion program (cjb2, cpaldjvu etc). In my experience the DjVuLibre—as a reference implementation—generates correct DjVu files, but it doesn't employ the best compression techniques to generate the output. You might want to look at a  converter that is not based on DjVuLibre, if resulting compression ratio and/or image quality is important. You can use any2djvu to do an online conversion, or one of the other online conversion tools. They do a better analysis of the images to determine what is the best way to compress your image (i.e. what goes in what layer). You can freely experiment with those, but of course you don't know what happens with your data. The commercial Document Express Editor also does a better job, (originally from LizardTech, who also released the DjVuLibre as open source), which was for some time available from Caminova and now possible from Cuminas "
What is the easiest workflow to publish ePub files from highly structured database content?,"I have done projects like this. I am assuming that you know how to select the data you need from your database. I would suggest you develop a template based on pandoc's extended markdown (to get the cross-referencing), merge the data with the template and then script pandoc to convert that to EPUB2 and PDF. If you want to offer a Kindle-compatible ebook (and you are giving it away), you could then script Kindlegen (available from Amazon) to turn the EPUB2 into a MOBI file. This isn't a trivial undertaking, but it should be doable."
Is the file size limit for Nook epub files still 600MB?,"I appears that the limit is now 20MB Your manuscript file must be less than 20MB in size and in one of the
  following formats: .doc, .docx, .txt, .rtf, .htm, .html, or .epub.
  Many manuscript files that are larger than 20 megabytes don't need to
  be.  If your manuscript file is larger than 20MB, try reducing the
  image size, decreasing the dots per inch (dpi), and/or increasing the
  JPEG compression on the images in your eBook.  After applying JPEG
  compression to the images, you should be able to get the individual
  image files under 100 kilobytes each. See also The Nook Press Publishing FAQ"
This title is not currently available for purchase?,"It looks like this is an Amazon based issue. This book is currently unavailable because there is an issue with its description, content, or formatting. We are working with the publisher to fix the issue. As always, we value customer feedback. Note that is book is avaiable at Wikisource & PG "
How widely used is Social DRM?,"Most of my experience with social DRM has been through smaller tech publishers like The Pragmatic Bookshelf, where they embed the purchaser's name into the title of the book, like <dc:title>Programming Ruby 1.9 &amp; 2.0 (for [name])</dc:title>. Probably the biggest titles to use social DRM, though, are the Harry Potter books through Pottermore. Here's a link to an article that goes into detail about it: http://copyrightandtechnology.com/2012/04/08/the-harry-potter-watermarking-experiment/ and a relevant chunk: The EPUB version that I downloaded is not DRM-protected; instead it
  contains two things: “This book is watermarked and was acquired by
  user ec107c00b9577436d6354e54cd9da5c9 on 31 March 2012″ on the
  copyright page, and various bits of data inserted invisibly into
  images and other places inside the book. As far as pros and cons of social DRM vs. more traditional DRM: there's lots of info out there that suggests that DRM in general is not terribly useful, but there are strong feelings on both sides of the issue. I'd suggest checking out what tech publisher Tim O'Reilly has to say: http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0411/focus-tim-oreilly-media-e-book-antipiracy-steal-this.html."
Can Kindle's dictionary be disabled?,"I think the only option you have is to delete the dictionary completely, thus disabling it. (Search for the dictionary on your device and remove it like any other book. You can re-download it later if there is the need.)"
How do I override the power cycling when the battery gets below 5%?,Unfortunately this is not possible. The exact explanation for this actually comes from Android. Buried deep within the Android source code is this little gem: BatteryService.java:239 This basically forces the system to shutdown if the battery level reaches 0%. The isPoweredLocked function determines whether any of the following are true: It should also be noted (as Jason mentioned in his comment) that lithium-ion batteries typically power off when they reach a predetermined low voltage to prevent further discharge and consequent damage.
Share book uploaded to my Google Play Books account with other account,"As long as you uploaded that specific book to google play books (in contrast to buying it on that platform) you can simply download it as a epub/pdf file using Adobe Digital Editions.
A detailed tutorial on this procedure can be found at Google Play Help."
"Is there a way to publish an eBook, distribute it and the push updates to the distributed eBooks?","Most online publishers have a method to allow for updates to published ebooks. The user generally is given way to identify that a book has an update, then the user is given the option to re-download the work.  I don't think any publisher has ""push"" to reader.   So yes there is way to redistribute the book, but it is dependent on user to perform some action to receive the update."
Is it more difficult to sideload books on to a Kindle Fire than other devices?,"The Kindle Fire is not difficult to sideload to--at any rate, the 1st generation version that I have is trivially easy: just plug the Fire into the computer with a micro USB cable, it shows up as a drive, and drag .mobi files into the relevant folder on the Fire. Easy!"
Internet access on the 3G Amazon Kindles?,"I have various Kindles including: 
My Kindle Fire first model, second edition, WiFi - it can access any web site over wifi
My Kindle 4 WiFi and Kindle 5 WiFi can also access any site over wifi My Kindle Paperwhite 3G can access Wikipedia.com over 3G. It asks for a WiFi connection to visit sites such as google.com This concurs with Nathan Osman's comment on your question.  So in answer to your question, all the kindle models I have include a web browser. They can access most sites using WiFi, however the newer 3G models are restricted to wikipedia and amazon by Amazon. PS: Even on the older Kindle Keyboard 3G models I found they sometimes asked for WiFi when I tried to visit sites after a while. However if I first visited the Amazon store then the 3G connection worked correctly for other web sites. I tried this approach on the Paperwhite 3G however I was still asked for a WiFi connection when visiting sites such as Google so there seems to be a policy-based restriction on newer models (possibly to save Amazon from data charges?)"
How to change the images displayed when my Kindle Touch is put to sleep?,"This is possible. However, you must jailbreak your Kindle first. Basically you:"
Calibre ebook viewer - Apply User Stylesheet to Full Screen Mode,"Paste the following in the 'User stylesheet', click ok. Then go to 'Theming' and save the style with whatever name you like. The e-book will display nicely in any screen mode and there are a couple of neat little extras you won't see with other user themes. As with all CSS it can be further altered and tweaked to suit."
How do I make the images larger for Paperwhite?,"I can only speak generally about how images are converted in Kindle. I have not used MS Word to do it (I make my ebooks in HTML), but I have lots of insights about images in kindle and have done a lot of testing.   Kindlegen will autoconvert images to the size/resolution appropriate for the device. BUT you need to make sure you start with a source image which is high resolution enough for it to be resized.  I realize that the HTML --> EPUB --> MOBI might be different from MSWORD --> MOBI, but according to the Amazon Kindle Publishing Guidelines PDF they should be 300 dpi, RGB and should be able to display at 2x magnification across devices. Therefore, you really need to have the width be at least 1600 or 3200pixels at 300 dpi.  I suspect that the source image you used was a crappy web image at 72dpi, and then even though you think it's resizing to acceptable quality levels, the low resolution computer monitor is not showing what it really looks like. That's why it looks small. I'm guessing that the  cloud previewer sees that it's a low quality image and it keeping it small because that will prevent pixilated rendering of images on some of its devices.  You don't need to have graphics good enough to print, but it needs to be significantly better than a 72 dpi web graphic.  (I Have cheated one time and increased a 300 dpi 600px wide graphic by opening it up in a separate graphics program and scaling it up to 1600, but that was a special case; the image detail was dense enough that it could be expanded without losing quality).  MS WOrd may not let you see properties of images. If so, You may need to remove it from MS Word and then edit it in a graphics editor (which allows you to bump up the dpi and scale the resolution up) I would guess that you need an image width 1600px at 300 dpi.  Part of the problem is that the MS WORD to MOBI method does not give you much freedom to tweak it. Amazon's instructions for these conversions are fairly superficial and lead to such issues as you have.  From the standpoint of production, you might want to consider using Calibre (free software) to do conversions from MS Word to .mobi and then open things up in the Kindle Beta Previewer 3
http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/?docId=1003018611 You're viewing the alleged ebook  in the cloud viewer. It's unlikely that what you are seeing in cloud viewer bears any resemblance to what you might see on a Kindle e-ink or Kindle tablet (especially on images).  I do things in HTML/EPUB, and I spend most of my time trying to troubleshoot Kindle's use of images. It's hard -- especially because things might look fine on one device and crappy on another. (Kindle for IOS is its separate kind of hell).  I test ebook images on  all my kindle files on Kindle previewer, Kindle app for Android, Kindle e-ink device and Kindle app for ios. (I don't have access to a kindle device -- though I have good reason to believe that Kindle app for android renders things similar to Kindle devices).  The key thing (to summarize) is to make the graphic as high quality as possible. "
"Epub -> Mobi/Azw3 conversion (calibre) , Kindle App doesn't show cover no matter what","Everything works fine except the book covers don't show up in kindle app.  Unfortunately, that's the default behavior, because the Kindle for PC/OSX app will only display covers for ""personal documents,"" i.e. ePubs converted with Kindle Previewer/KindleGen, or books bought from Amazon. AFAIK, Calibre adds a fake ASIN and changes other metadata items so that books no longer appear in the Personal Documents folder. However, this change also causes the book to be displayed without a cover in the Kindle for PC/OSX apps. Everything works fine except the book covers don't show up in kindle app. There's no description also, so it's impossible to recognise which book I'm opening. To display the book titles, click the hamburger icon (≡) in the Kindle app toolbar."
"Is there any ebook reader that can synchronize the bookmarks across PC(windows, osx), iOS, android devices?","Google Play Books is probably what you are looking for. It synchronizes data between all your devices, allows you to upload your own ebooks and it supports epub format. "
More than one chapter div in one epub file?,"Kobo ereader devices have two different internal reading software. Ebooks downloaded from the Kobo bookstore are a modified epub format with the particular extension .kepub.epub, while if you sideload a standard epub from your PC it retains its original extension (.epub). By checking the extension of the files, the software automatically select the relative reading software (you don't normally notice many differences, they have some different internal features though). I had the same issue with page break html code and experimented a bit, and it seems that the .kepub.epub engine (the one used with books from the Kobo store) doesn't support it, so I think that there is not much you can do about it. A possible solution, like you have been suggested, could be to split the html file in multiple ones, exactly where you would have put the page break code. If you use Sigil or the Calibre internal editor you won't have to manually edit toc.ncx, contents.opf and all other files/references, because they will do automatically; it's an easy task, really. Please note that books bought from the Kobo bookstore are stored inside the device database and not as individual files."
Is there a way within the UI of the Kindle (Fire) to search only for books that can be borrowed?,"Yes, there is a way. Note, of course, that this feature is only available from an actual Kindle device, not from a reading app on a computer, phone or tablet not sold by Amazon. (Fwiw: I have a Kindle2, so your screen may differ from mine.) Take the action to ""Shop in Kindle Store"" on your device. (On the K2, that is located in the menu that appears when you press the ""menu"" button.) Under ""Browse / Books"" choose, ""see all categories ..."" The last option on the list is ""Kindle Owners' Lending Library"" Currently 494,389 titles are offered for lending (only one per month); a number of filters are available to reduce this deluge, which you can choose by selecting ""View Subcategories within Owners' Lending Library"". If you search or otherwise leave the confines of the Lending Library listings, any book lacking a ""Prime"" designation in the listings shown on your Kindle is not available for lending. Btw, once you've borrowed a book, you can read it in any Kindle reading app, not just the device you used when you borrowed it."
Are there any open e-book file formats that support statistics gathering?,"Note that companies controlling both the devices/apps and the store (e.g., Amazon or Kobo) perform analytics routinely, exactly because they can gather info from the reading system (app or device firmware). They even share their findings with the publishers (to make them ""optimize"" their eBooks, so that they can sell more) EDIT: see ""/data lessons/"", presentation by Tamblyn (Kobo) given at BiB12: http://youtu.be/eQfJ3NWiPmU Some guys tried to build a company (Hiptype) around the concept of ""google analytics"" for eBooks, but they did not succeed and went out of money. Their solution was basically embedding JS code into EPUB eBooks. This type of solution is quite doomed, because if the reading system disallows network communication (e.g., iBooks does), the ebook cannot ""phone home"" the reading statistics. The same holds true for remotely-hosted images (like those used to log the visitors of a web page). Finally, no ebook standard that I am aware of has explicit mechanisms to collect such statistics. And, even if they had, the actual availability of such a feature would be depending on the reading system implementer."
How to build ebooks from O'Reilly Atlas Projects?,"First, kudos to learning about a new tool. (I never heard of it).  The content creation environment is in closed beta, so I wouldn't expect there to be any way to access the source code.  But the reading portal lets you view the full HTML which is generated by the HTMLBook source. I'm guessing that they have a tool to import asciidoc into HTMLbook, but I'm not sure if it only imports a subset of ASCIIDOC elements.  I think the whole point of Atlas is to make it unnecessary to have access to the source code, and to provide readymade templates and styles. Building for epub, pdf and mobi is complex, and it would be hard to recreate their toolchain on your own production environment.  Based on the video I've seen, it looks very impressive and hopefully will be a single source competitor to Adobe Indesign. It's unclear whether storing the source on the cloud will allow you to download an offline copy of the source. I'm struck by the similarities between Docbook XML and the elements created through the editor. (Indeed, I suspect HTMLBook is based upon it). Even if you downloaded an offline copy on source, I'm unsure how you would build it yourself; (for example, it seems that Atlas uses a commercial  PDF processor from AntennaHouse, which most people wouldn't have a license for). One thing is clear though. If you have access to the HTML output, you could probably import it into some desktop ebook creation tool and change the styles as necessary. The generated HTML is very clean, so I would expect it not to be that painful.  One example of a down-and-dirty export is to paste the HTML output into a MS Word doc, make sure the images are all there and then convert it into a PDF. "
Is there a kindle with a light up screen but NOT a touchscreen?,"No
All the  currently available Kindles have a touchscreen.

Auto-adding to a Collection when using a Send-to-Kindle email,"Only thing you can control via email subject is whether to use Amazon's convert feature From https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/email PDFs can be converted to the Kindle format so you can take advantage of functionality such as variable font size, annotations, and Whispersync. To have a document converted to Kindle format, the subject line should be ""convert"" when e-mailing a personal document to your Send-to-Kindle address."
Embed JavaScript in an e-book using an e-reader,"JavaScript is an optional part of the epub 3.0 specification: EPUB Content Documents may contain scripting using the facilities
  defined for this in the respective underlying specifications ([HTML5]
  and [SVG]). What this means is that even a fully-compliant epub 3.0 device doesn't need to implement JavaScript support. The ones that do will generally be the ""more bells and whistles"" devices; the iPad, for example, supports JavaScript. The IDPF's epub Chrome extension Readium does as well. Note that according to the epub 3.0 specification, the following criteria for reading systems that support JavaScript must be met: › It must support container-constrained scripting and may support
  spine-level scripting. › It may render Scripted Content Documents as an interactive, scripted
  User Agent according to [HTML5]. › It must not allow a container-constrained script to modify the DOM
  of the parent Content Document or other contents in the EPUB
  Publication, and must not allow it to manipulate the size of its
  containing rectangle. (Note: Even if a script is not
  container-constrained, the Reading System may impose restrictions on
  modifications (see also the dom-manipulation feature).) › It may place additional limitations on the capabilities provided to
  scripts during execution (e.g., limiting networking). › It must implement the JavaScript navigator extension object
  epubReadingSystem defined in Appendix A, JavaScript epubReadingSystem
  Object . It also must support the dom-manipulation and layout-change
  features defined in Features in container-constrained scripting
  contexts. › It must regard the scripted [Publications301] property of the
  Package Document manifest item element as the authoritative definition
  of whether an EPUB Content Document includes scripting. EDIT: Popup text and images are definitely possible using JavaScript in iBooks. For an example, check out Beneath The Ink."
Is there an Android reading app that synchronizes across devices?,"Moon+ Reader can do this, storing the data in Dropbox or in Google Drive. (Note: I have not actually tried this functionality myself as I can't bear to use Moon+ due to its horrible UI and poor support for the ePub standard. But the feature is there in the settings, if you can find the right settings page...) Google Play Books does so too - but it does not directly open files stored on the device (you have to let it upload them to Google's servers and then download them again...)"
How can I set my Kindle Paperwhite to ignore font color settings?,"In the case you have bought pure ePub and later converted it to Mobi, you could delete the color attribute at all (Kindle will treat this with it’s built in color spec.). This needs unpacking of ePub, deleting the css part you have mentioned and proper packing into ePub again."
"I can't find the mobi format ebooks I copied from my computer to my kindle via usb, what should I do?","File size can be an issue. I've found that if the book's file size is greater than 50MB, the file will transfer to the documents folder on disk, but not appear on the kindle. In my case, I used Calibre to convert mobi to azw3, which reduced the file size, and the book then appeared on my kindle."
Keeping lines together in ePub,"You can use page-break-inside: avoid; in your CSS to keep information from breaking across pages where possible in a reflowable epub file, though not all reading systems will honor it. Another option would be using page-break-before: always; to force a page break before the content that you want to keep together. This is somewhat more widely supported, but still not universal. In the end, pagination is a relic of print and not something native to digital, so trying to force it might not be the most efficient way to go. Are there other ways you can accomplish the same end, perhaps with hyperlinks?"
Sort/Select chapters/paragraphs by POV,"Calibre's EpubSplit plugin should be able to do what you need, but as far as I know you have to manually select which chapters you want to extract."
How can I listen to non-Audible audiobooks on my Kindle?,"According to their FAQ section: Is Audiobooks.com mobile friendly?  It sure is! You can stream or
  download your favorite books from Audiobooks.com on your iPhone or
  iPad (iOS4.0 or higher), or Android smartphone (running version 2.3 or
  higher), via our native apps.  Thanks to our HTML5 web app, you can
  also listen to audio books using almost any other internet-enabled
  device, like laptops and tablets. We recommend that you check with
  your mobile provider to make sure you have a data plan. So if your Kindle supports web browsing (and has an HTML5 compatible browser), then yes you can. Otherwise, you are forced to use one of their native apps for the devices mentioned. Or another option as mentioned by DVK in the comments, you can turn your Kindle into a generic Android device. It's possible to do this because Kindle devices (and Nook for that matter) are using Android under the hood. Amazon (or Barnes and Knoble for the Nook) just design the stuff on top of Google's open-source operating system. Once you convert your device to a generic Android device, you can run the native Android app provided by audiobooks.com. As for how to change your device, if you choose that route, there are many tutorials out there. Here is one to get you started."
Are there ways to easily convert chapter-split books from popular fan-fiction sites into single e-book?,"You can use the GrabMyBooks Firefox extension. It can grab single web-pages and convert them to epub, or adding multiple pages as distinct chapters. There is also a Calibre plugin called FanFictionDownloader, but I've never used it."
Kindle paperwhite and sharing quotes with goodreads for side-loaded books,"This is a good, common question that seems to have an answer here: Trouble hooking up Goodreads with sideloaded ebook on Kindle Paperwhite  I have found the best way to get it 100 percent working is this: Alternatively, try using the Quality Check tool: Get the Quality
  Check
  plugin for Calibre and then use it's ""Fix -> Fix ASIN for Kindle Fire""
  feature. It expects that you have the Amazon ID in the book's metadata
  somewhere, which should be there if you download the metadata using
  Calibre. This inserts the ASIN and allows goodreads integration to
  work. I tested it myself. One annoying thing is that it seems that if the Kindle notices that
  there's a mobi-asin field (which the above introduces in order to
  fix Goodreads integration), then it seems to download and use the
  cover art that Amazon has for that book, instead of the one you set in
  Calibre. I'm not sure if there's a way to circumvent that."
"self-hosted, self-updating book repository","At this time, I'd say ""no"".  When you read an epub in Calibre's internal reader it sets a bookmark in a file inside the epub, but most readers set that bookmark in a related (usually sqlite) database. And there's no standard for the bookmark format (well, there is, in epub3, but I haven't found anybody using it yet...). But if you're willing to settle for using a particular set of devices, you could probably fairly simply extract the bookmarks from those, and translate them to be useful by the other devices. Notes, otoh, are much more complicated. Calibre does have a ""universal"" notes plugin--unfortunately, it requires support to be written for each device driver, and I think there are only one or two drivers that have it."
"What does it mean that a pdf is ""paginated""?","I have never heard it used to mean either of those things. In my experience, if someone says a PDF is paginated, they simply mean that there are page numbers on the PDF's pages. They may or may not correspond to some other publication, like a physical book. The point is simply that the pages have numbers on the pages themselves."
How do I copy and paste text from Windows 8 Kindle app book to Microsoft Word,"You can't do it directly from the desktop reader app for Windows 8. You can, however, do one of the following things instead: Of course, use this within the limits of copyright, etc. See this related question about essentially the same thing. If you can stand the non-Metro layout, you can run the Windows 7 app on Windows 8 (see this discussion.  The Windows 7 app allows copying: when you highlight text and right click, ""Copy"" is one of the options: "
How can I toggle text reliably across all ereaders in an epub file?,"Javascript would be the best way to do this, but as you note, not all ebook reading systems support Javascript—in fact, very few of them beyond iBooks do. Without Javascript, this isn't really possible, unfortunately. The doppletext site that you link to uses Javascript, for example. Ebook reading systems support a fairly limited subset of HTML and CSS. Of particular relevance, most of them do not support the advanced CSS selectors like the type being used in the checkbox hack that you link—there's no selecting the adjacent sibling. The only other option that I can think of is epub 3.0's epub:trigger. Unfortunately, at present that only allows you to toggle visibility:hidden and not display:none, which means the space the invisible paragraphs take up will still be there, so you'll have giant translation-sized holes in your text. Even if the IDPF adds a display control to epub:trigger, epub 3 support in reading systems is sadly lacking (despite it being the approved standard for two and a half years now), so that probably won't get you any farther than using Javascript. Sorry for being the bearer of bad news! I'd love to be proven wrong on this—I've worked on several ebook projects that could benefit from this type of thing, and have never been able to find a way to do this acceptably other than with Javascript."
How do I permanently change the font size in HAN Software's ePub Reader?,"Are you using the latest version, as I can see that there is a new release on the 6th of January. You shouldn't have to change the size of the text when you open the eBook back up, as many eReaders save it as a preference. The original size of the text is marked in the CSS. May I also suggest using different ePub readers, such as Calibre as it is used more widely by the eBook community, and no reports of the issue with having to modify your size settings.  If you are thinking of purchasing DRM eBooks in the future, I suggest using Adobe Digital Editions, as you can still read non DRM eBooks in the software, and it too is more widely known to the community.

"What are the advantages, risks and possible disadvantages of buying ebooks with DRM?","The premise in your question's title does not seem to be accurate. E.g. Amazon's terms and conditions state that you don't own the ebook, you buy the right to view it on your Kindle.  All content included in or made available through any Amazon Service, such as text, graphics, logos, button icons, images, audio clips, digital downloads, and data compilations is the property of Amazon or its content suppliers and protected by United States and international copyright laws. The compilation of all content included in or made available through any Amazon Service is the exclusive property of Amazon and protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. Similar conditions apply to DRM-ed material from other suppliers (it probably has to—but don't quote me on that, I am no lawyer—as ownership would imply that you can do what you want with something (within legal bounds)) This forms no risk at all, as long as you are aware of this restriction. Unfortunately most people are not, and they speak about buying a DRM-ed ebook and are surprised if an ebook is removed from their device, even if that has happened to many before them (e.g. the erasure of books by George Orwell in 2009; a Kindle being wiped with no explanation). The disadvantage, IMHO, compared to actually buying a non DRM-ed book is that you are dependent on some software setup to allow you to view material on a specific device. If that device breaks, you might not be able to ""activate""
the content on a newly acquired device if the original provider is not available any more to allow this. "
Part of the screen on my reader is stuck,"This looks like broken eInk display and I'm afraid that only display replacement can help here.
eInk displays are rather fragile and not only dropping, but something that looks not so dangerous, like putting reader without inflexible cover with paper books in same bag, can mechanically damage display (even if glass is not broken). And display is rather expensive part of reader so if ereader with eInk display is not covered by warranty (good one) replacement may be not cost effective."
Kindle for PDF only,"Kindle - but also the other ebook readers - have a small screen: since a PDF is not a liquid format, either you'll end up with tiny characters or you'll have to move the virtual page on the physical screen. 
In my opinion, a larger tablet in such cases is much better."
Can I use a TV or Monitor for a larger screen with my Kindle?,"Although you cannot stream from any Kindle directly (except for the Kindle Fire HD), you can download any of your Kindle books to a PC or laptop and read them using the PC Kindle App, and you would be able to stream that."
What are the different file formats that eBooks are available in and which of these is most widely supported?,"The intent of your question seems to be, ""Which e-books formats are safe to buy (or obtain legally for free) - such that they will never go obsolete on any future device I use?"" There are actually several approaches to this issue, but you first need to understand a little about DRM (Digital Rights Management): DRM attempts to prevent illegal copying of books you purchase. DRM creates the following problem for honest consumers: Let's say you buy books protected by DRM from one marketplace. How can you read a book you purchased if you switch to a competitor's device that uses a different DRM scheme for the same or different format? With that question in mind, here are several approaches you can take to preserving books you obtain for the long haul: I personally do a combination of all three. When possible to obtain books for free (legally), I do so, and store it in my dropbox ""ebooks"" folder. When possible to buy books in multiple formats, I do so. But in instances when I can't do either of these (or book price is so low I don't really care), I purchase from Amazon's book store."
"What is ""text to speech""?","Text to speech is an ability of some computing devices to run a special program that will ""speak aloud"" a given text to you. That is, they process the text, and generate the sounds that resembles a person speaking that text aloud using speech synthesis algorithm. A lot of different software supports text to speech; among them, Microsoft Reader as well as Kindle - at least the latter software running on Kindle 2d-gen or DX - here are instructions. The difference from an audio book is that the latter is just an audio file; a recording of an actual human reading the book aloud, not the program producing the sounds.  Think of it as analogous to the difference between a video file from a movie depicting an actor doing things; and a computer game demo where a rendered video game character does those things on-screen. ""text-to-speech: Enabled"" means that the book supports the ability of supporting book reader to render its text into speech, both from technical and licensing perspective. In case of Kindle Amazon books, since the technical capability is always there (same format), it's merely a question of licensing - see discussions of this (somewhat controversial and unpopular) feature here and here."
Why I can't buy books from Kindle Store using Kindle app on iPad?,Because otherwise Amazon would have to give Apple a cut of the 'in-app purchases'. One article on the subject.
Can I make custom fonts show up in iBooks?,"It is certainly possible to embed custom fonts and have them be used in iBooks, as well as on other EPUB reading systems. The process is known as embedding. Embedded fonts are simply included in the .zip archive that comprises the EPUB file, and then referenced properly in all the relevant content files. Places you will need to reference them include: This is just like using fonts on the web: the first thing you need to do is define @font-face: and then use that declaration in for whichever styles you'd like to use that font: Just like all the other files in your EPUB, you'll need to include any font files you're embedding in the <manifest> of your .opf file: The above steps are sufficient for most reading systems, but iBooks has one more hoop to jump through: This is a file that goes in the META-INF folder of the EPUB, rather than the OEBPS folder, and as the name suggests it's iBooks-specific. Neither this file nor the container.xml file need to be declared in the <manifest>, so don't worry about that. Here is the file in its entirety: A more in-depth writeup can be found on Liz Castro's excellent blog. As noted elsewhere, be aware that there are some potential hurdles, both legal and practical, to embedding fonts."

Are back-of-the-book indexes useful?,"You essentially already answer your own question: indexes are more than just a reference to the words in a text. Apart from creating relationships an index
can hide non-essential use of a word, and have definitions be different from normal use of a word. This requires interpretation by the author, something a search does not do. I used LaTeX and its index generating capabilities when writing my thesis and the references to defining occurrences showed differently (italics) from the normal entries. Of course the software also helped by showing ranges of pages where a word was marked for indexing, which is also something a search engine seldom indicates (it might highlight all occurrences on a page, but that is not the same as knowing that a term is used in 10 consecutive pages)."

Software recommendation for writing ebook and exporting to multiple formats,"Pandoc is your friend here.   Pandoc can take your input file (LaTeX, markdown, other) and transform it to PDF, EPUB, HTML (and many more). Pandoc is cross-platform and free under the GPL, although donations are appreciated. With regards to formatting your code, both LaTeX and markdown have components that will help.  LaTeX has many more layout options. I've used both LaTeX and markdown to produce ebook (ePub) files.  An example of using pandoc with LaTeX is shown in another ebooks.stackexchange.com question I posted.    It's great to have a range of options."
What is the technology behind e-Ink and why is it mostly used in e-readers?,"e-Ink is, generally, a synonym of electronic paper. The form used in most e-readers is E Ink (proprietary and trademarked), produced by the E Ink Corporation. The technology basically uses microcapsules filled with white and black charged particles. The charged particles are manipulated by electrodes at the top and bottom of the capsule. When the top contains only white particles, the pixel is white. As more black particles are added, the pixel becomes darker until it becomes completely black. The main advantage of eInk displays are that they offer superb contrast even in bright light (try reading a cell phone on the beach while wearing sunglasses). The primary disadvantage is that these displays are very slow relative to LCD, which makes them unsuitable for high frame rate applications such as video and many games. e-readers are one application where high contrast is useful and high frame rates are not necessary, and so they have become the primary use of electronic paper technologies."
Getting a separate page count per chapter,"Kobo ereaders have two different reading engines, one for .epub files, another for .kepub.epub files.
These two engines have some little differences, one is the way page count is displayed: for the entire book with .epub, for a single chapter with .kepub.epub.
If you want to use this feature the simplest way is to rename the file extension, but it is advisable to use Calibre instead. If you install the Advanced Kobo Driver plugin it will automatically convert .epub files in .kepub.epub when you send them to the device, while performing some optimizations that you won't have if you simply change the extension.
And, this is a feature of the reading device, not of the file itself: it's not coded in your ebook, it's the ereader that has it and use it when detects the file type: you won't get it in other devices even if you change the extension."

"Screen between 6"" and 9.7""",Here are four:
footnote as popup in epub,"There are two possibilities here, and without seeing more of the book's code, it's not really possible to tell. The first is that this is extra functionality offered by the reading system rather than something built into the epub file itself. As noted by Liz Castro in the spec, this is similar to Apple's example of supporting symantically marked footnotes, and then ""associating specialized behaviors"" as the spec directs. If that's the case, Moon+ and Calibre don't seem to be supporting the epub 3 spec as directly as Apple does, though—according to the Structural Semantics Vocabulary for epub 3, footnotes should be contained in <aside> tags marked with epub:type=footnote"" and then corresponding epub:type=""noteref""s for the superscripted symbols in the body. The other possibility is that there is some JavaScript in the ebook file that is somehow accessing content in a different file. Since JavaScript is generally constrained by the DOM, though, this doesn't seem likely. if you'd like to replicate the behavior yourself in an epub 3 file, the relevant code (heavily cribbed from the spec) to try out would be: Note that this behavior is purely optional—epub 3 has the ability for publishers to tell the reading system what kind of content a particular section is, and it is up to the reading systems to decide what they want to do with that information. EDIT: Based on your comment, it sounds like since there is no JavaScript and the book is epub 2.0, there is either something hack-y going on or the reading systems you're using are looking for particular classes and associating special behavior with them. Based on this blog post, I'm guessing the former—it sounds like you can include the correct namespacing in an epub 2 file to allow epub:type to work, and change the <aside> tag to a <p> with display: none on its CSS to get this to work in iBooks, which Moon+ and Calibre might be copying. Note that according to that blog post, this gives you a working ebook that fails epubCheck, which means that many retailers will reject it. Making an epub 3 file might be the way to go for you."
Only select from files on SD card in BookEen Odyssey,"In the Folder View, you can select the folder view, which probably gives you Cybook/.../ etc. at the top.

(If you happen to switch on folder view while reading a book from your SD card, you will already 'be' in a directory on your SD card, and you will  not have Cybook at the beginning of your directory path).

Are there technical advantages of one common format over another?,"Many of the ebook readers either have or have had their own format. Sony had the LRF format (more properly known as Broadband eBook), for example. Proprietary formats are designed for two reasons: Currently, there are at least five commonly used formats that are specifically designed for eBooks (as opposed to PDF which has broader aspirations and use). All of these formats are based on HTML, but with special wrappers, extensions, and/or Digital Rights Management (DRM). Of the five, ePub is the most open, and therefore preferred by technical consumers who don't like to be locked in to a particular company's hardware and/or software. This has lead most eBook hardware and software vendors to support ePub, as least for books acquired from other sources. A detailed comparison of eBook formats is available on Wikipedia."
Can I use Kindle to read research papers?,"Hello and welcome to forum. I am also mainly using kindle to read research papers. PDF files with two columns are running smoothly and fast on kindle (from the performance point of view). The problem is that, in 100% zoom level, the text is very small and somehow impossible to read. (If you want to simulate the real size of text on 100% zoom level in kindle, try to zoom out the PDF in your PC screen until it is approximately 6 inches.) Possible solutions: Don't forget you can make pinch and zoom to make text bigger. Zoom levels are predefined and you need to use your finder to navigate manually. View the pdf in vertical(landscape) mode. Now the text is almost twice big and easy to read and navigate.  If you can view the full article in your browser, then you can use amazon extension, namely send to Chrome. Now you can read the text and have any deliberate zoom level. The only downside is Latex math formulas are not appearing sometimes.  Almost all academic papers are written in Latex format. You can convert the PDF to Latex then modify it to have better zoom level or even change the number of columns for kindle and then convert it back to PDF and finally send it to Kindle. For similar solutions and approaches, take a look here.  You can use wide range of other devices available with additional functionalities. I suggest to take a look at this great review.  If you can jailbreak the kindle, then you can use any sort of viewer. Finally, if you want, send me an example and I can test it in my kindle."

This is done on a Mac laptop and will also work on Unix hosts.  The overview of the process: Here's an example of steps (2) through (9).  The head command lists the top ten words in the final output.   The result is pretty boring.  The word 'the"" appears 5303 times, while the word 'it' appears 703 times.  I suspect in most books the most common words are the tiny conjunctions, articles, prepositions and pronouns.  Perhaps on something that is not a novel this might be more interesting. Good luck!"

How to convert scanned pdf to text?,"It sounds like the pages you've looked at are telling you the right thing. If you have an image-based PDF, then there is no text in it, just pictures of text. In order to convert the pictures of text to actual text, you have two options: have a human do the conversion, or have the computer do the conversion. Having a human do it would mean someone sitting down and typing out your book for you. Having the computer do it for you involves Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software. If you have Adobe Acrobat (not Adobe Reader), it has built-in OCR software. Other than that, I know that ABBYY Fine Reader has an excellent reputation. There may be other options as well. Bear in mind that whatever OCR software you use, the conversion will not be perfect, particularly if you're dealing with a bad scan. Even in a best-case scenario where you've got 99.9% accuracy on the conversion, you'll still have about one error every thousand characters—two or three typos per page. That will mean that you'll have to be careful cutting and pasting code; the whole process may not save you any effort over just typing stuff in."

Is there a fair price for an ebook?,"Since some users want to close this question as off-topic or opinion
based, I decided to give my own tentative answer, based on my own
thinking since I asked the question, and influenced by some of the comments. I am well aware of cost issues in publishing, but I have little
experience as a customer where e-books are concerned. Having to fix my
own price as an e-book customer is a new experience to me, and I was
wondering how it is perceived and analyzed by other e-books customers
and sellers. This type of pricing is not usual where paper books are
concerned. Is this off-topic on this site? I believe not. The topic page states: The main focus is on the processes involved in publishing and/or
    consuming ebooks (and related tools), rather than on the content of
    ebooks. Though this does not explicitly include economic aspects, it does not
rule them out. A question such as pros and cons of  publishing in XYZ
format can typically have economic answers. What is explicitly ruled out is questions about specific books or
sites, or discussing specific ebooks or ereader retailers, when it can
be shopping or opinion based, which does not rule out technical
questions. My question is about pricing in the general sense, not specific items,
and it is an issue that is seriously analyzed by professionals and
economists. It is a technical and scientific issue. Many documents do address this issue, for both traditional paper books
and more recently for ebooks. It is true that many statements are opinion based, because all kinds
of people have an opinion to voice, with or without competence to
justify it (see Consumers Upset and Confused Over E-Book Pricing). Some people have also an interest in keeping this fuzzy,
so that their market is not understood or analyzed too closely,  especially by authors and consumers. My own usual references on books cost are not in English.
However, I was  able to find rather quickly some new ones on the web,
such as
Book Cost Analysis – Cost of Physical Book Publishing
which does itself use several external references. This article agrees that about 50% of the printed book cost comes
from distribution (10%) and retail (40%), to which one can add around
10% of printing costs. This is reduced to nearly nothing in the case
of e-books. Clearly, ebooks have their own costs, but they are very unlikely to be
comparable to what is being saved (some more than 50%) on the material
aspects of printed books. What is more likely is that market behavior changes significantly, because eproducts have no marginal cost
(it costs nearly nothing to make extra copies).
That is to be taken into account by both the producers and the
consumers of ebooks. One aspect of it is that the market is a lot more
competitive as more authors can enter it (I am currently reading a
very nice ebook that is available only for free). Another consequence is that some sellers consider that letting the
customer fix his own price, possibly within limits, is a good way to
do business. Why do they do this? Fixing my own price as a customer,
in a way that is fair, also depends on my understanding of the
economics and of the economic analysis of the seller. There can be, as
always opinion based assessments of it: some people still have strange
opinions about well established scientific facts. But this is clearly
a matter for scientific and technical analysis. The major point is that paper books both have fixed costs, independent
of the number of books sold, and marginal costs for each (additional)
book. They also have a high investment cost in the printing, since it
must be done in large numbers to be economically acceptable. The ebooks business has a lesser up-front investment, because no mass
printing is needed, and no marginal costs (the more than 50% in
printing, distribution and retail. Once the book exist in epub, mobi,
or whaterver, it is essentially free for the publisher (except for
advertising possibly, but that is done only when return is expected). What matters to the publisher is not the number of books sold, but the total
income it brings. Any addtional dollar is worth taking, since what is
given in exchange no longer costs anything. That is probably the motivations for open pricing and bundle pricing. Then, I would think that what matters for the producers of ebooks is
not to get a given price for a book or a bundle, but how much of my
money I will input in the book production system every month. Giving
me additional books, that I will probably not read all, cost them
nothing and may increase my inclination to buy. So my conclusion is that there is no real fair price for each
individual buy. Rather one should spend monthly a global amount
proportional to one's means and one's amount of reading. The role of the seller is to induce a consumer behavior that will
maximize the total income, rather than the profit per book sold.
One role of the consumer is to make sure the producers can make a
living (and keep producing), which does imply a level of spending, but
not necessarily a high cost per book. This analysis may not be totally accurate, but it is fairly precise (in a qualitative way) and
can be disputed on objective facts and arguments, rather than opinions."

Moon+ Reader -- what kind of CSS support? formatting tips?,"This site provides pretty good case-by-case metrics for CSS support by device / reader
http://epubtest.org/results/ You are absolutely correct about your assumption that the Moon+ reader is overlaying it's own generic CSS over the publisher provided CSS.  This has been a battleground in the ebook world for a while now but we are starting to get more support for the publisher side CSS because fundamentally you can't have 'one CSS to rule them all (ebooks)'  Sure, at first it looks flashy and nice like you mention above but once you start importing a variety of books with different formatting needs you begin to see the limitations of this generic CSS almost immediately. Also appending !important to your CSS properties and attibutes can sometimes work as a last ditch effort to overriding the device / application CSS - check out how to implement it here:http://css-tricks.com/when-using-important-is-the-right-choice/ Hope this helps :)"
is DjVu still useful as a format for ebooks?,"I have worked extensively with DjVu (and wrote the text extraction extension Calibre). I consider DjVu the better alternative for scanned multi-page documents, especially for efficiency reasons. Compared to the JPEG encoded pages you get in PDF or TIFF files you often have a 20x smaller file size. For non-professional users this size difference often is not a problem, but for dessimination in the professional world it is. Just imagine having to buy 20x more storage and increased network capacity. Because a PDF reader is already necessary for many other documents (other than scanned), such users already have a PDF reader and I have seen a reluctance with non-professionals to install something just to be able to handle a more efficient file format. DjVu is hindered by sub-par open source implementations of the encoder and AFAIK also by patent issues. My expectation is that at some point some replacement technology will become available that has all of the advantage and non of the problems, just like PNG replaced GIF. That will be a multilayer encoded image format. As long as I will have some decent, commandline, conversion software for DjVu, PDF and any other format, I don't see any of that as a problematic. It would only be nice if I could tell Thunderbird which users only have a PDF reader so that I could attach DjVu and it would convert it to PDF before sending the email..."
"ePubs, PDFs and security","Most reading systems for epubs do not include JavaScript support at this time, so you're fairly safe. For those that do, the IDPF (International Digital Publishing Forum; they're the folks who make the epub standard) has a section on security in the epub 3.0 spec. It pretty much lays the onus on the reading system developers to disable various avenues of attack. One thing of note is that all their points are phrased as ""reading systems should"" where ""should"" means: that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to
ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be
understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different
course. So their security concerns may or may not be addressed by individual reading systems. It's a good bet that the major ones will play ball, though--particularly as most of them have someone in the IDPF. As far as downloading stuff from random places on the web--well, run a virus scan on anything you get and you'll probably be okay, but that's always riskier than going through ""official"" channels."
"As a US citizen is it illegal to access an ebook from a country where it is PD, if it is not PD in the US?","Assuming the US Citizen is in the US then almost always yes it is illegal. Downloading a copy for personal use to an ebook device while in the US Yes the US copyright law prohibits the downloading of works that are protected by copyright in the US from foreign servers that do not have permission to distribute the copyright protected material in the US.  This is part of the Title I of the DMCA. Reading a copy of the ebook from a server in PD country without
  downloading (i.e. html only) Technically you are still downloading the text.  The HTML Files are stored on your local computer in your Temporary Internet files. This would be in violation of the DCMA.  In theory if you remote in to a computer in another country and read it, they there would be no violation of the DCMA.  However if you are remoting into that server specifically to evade US law then you are in violation of other statues involving international crime. Opening a copy of the eBook from a server in PD country without reading This is going to be dependent on if the text gets stored in non volatile memory on your computer.  If it creates temp files with the text on your hard drive then technically it would violate Copyright in the US under the DMCA.  If it is only putting the text into memory then it is not actually creating a copy of the document.  So it does not violate the DMCA unless there is a way to save the text on your local device in which case it would be a tool capable of circumventing Copyright.  In which case the use of the tool is a violation of DMCA even if it is not used in this manner."

Inside Calibre, select the ebook, press K, and you will get another window that will let you do something similar, but you have some more options compared to Sigil, for example you can generate entries not only from html headings but also from single files inside the .epub, rearranging the list and the hierarchy, and so on. It's simplier to do it than to explain it."
What was the first commercially available eBook reader?,"I think NuvoMedia's Rocket eBook was the first e-reading device. IIRC it was released in 1998.

"How to change the font(s) used on a pdf, or improve how they are rendered?","Based on the sample you provided, you will not be able to change the font on that particular document.  Here is why: As one commenter already suggested, it is very clear from the sample you provided that the text you are reading is a scanned image of the page and not text being rendered in realtime from a font. I work with scanned documents and OCR tools on a daily basis, so I can say this with confidence.  All of these things are clear visual indicators of a scanned image. You are able to select text in the document because there is a hidden OCR text layer ""behind"" the image which contains the plain text of the book and a mapping file which tells your PDF viewer where each letter is located in the image. There are a few different ways this can be accomplished, but as an example here is a tutorial that shows how to OCR images with Adobe Acrobat (the full software, not Reader)."
Converting pdf with table of content to Kindle format,"A few quick thoughts.  First, if you are using a Kindle Fire tablet, there is no need to do a conversion. just download a PDF Reader app from the app store and read the file that way.  If you are using an eink Kindle, I would suggest sending the PDF to the Kindle Personal Document Service which will do the conversion for you. (It's free and a cool feature in your kindle account):  https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_pdoc_main_short_us?nodeId=200767340 I haven't really looked at PDF conversions from the PDS; I'm guessing it will look really ugly. But I suspect the Kindle conversions to PDF are better than calibre's (although calibre might let you fine tune it). Using Kindle eink to read PDFs is usually a disappointing experience unless the document is short and very simple.  I glanced at the document. (I have made similar kinds of documents using Docbook XML). This document was optimized for PDF; you will lose a lot of formatting by trying to convert it -- though ironically it's pretty easy to convert it from Docbook XML to epub files.  To answer your question, the .opf is a file that stores epub metadata; apparently calibre needs to convert the PDF first to epub, and then reconvert it to the kindle .mobi format. That's why the end result is so horrifying.  Also: If you have access to an android tablet, you could upload the file to Google Play Books website and then read the PDF perfectly in the Google Play Books app on your device. "
Where to find Programming Ebooks in epub/mobi format? [closed],"Depends on a lot of things.  First, are you using an eink version of a kindle? or a Kindle Fire?  If you are using e-ink (and therefore can't use pdf easily), I would recommend buying ebooks from Oreilly or Packt Publishing. They're very expensive, but at least they will format properly for an eink device.  (by the way, both companies have pretty good sales (and occasional free downloads), so I would recommend signing up for their email list.  If you have a Kindle Fire, then all you need to do is to download a PDF reader app (there are many -- don't try to read things  with the Kindle app).  You may be limited by what you can afford, but because PDFs are not reflowable, you want to get a fairly good screen size to read them. You need at least 8 inch screen in my opinion. If you buy smaller, the text size will be hard to read. (There's a zoom function in smaller devices, but it's inconvenient). Try http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/ for a good (and famous) introduction to basic structures (using python as an example). I recommend this for starting out. Here's the pdf of the latest version http://www.ict.ru.ac.za/Resources/cspw/thinkcspy3/ (Older editions of this book in other computer languages are here: http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/archive/ ).  Here's a list of ebooks for free out there 
https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md One more thing. If you have kindle fire, I would sign up for evernote, download the app on your tablet and then clip recent web tutorials on subjects which interest you. this is a good way to read articles when offline; evernote renders the content pretty well.   Finally, I want to really recommend buying a tablet which you can be comfortable reading PDFs on. 6 or 7 inch tablets just aren't good enough for most people to read PDFs on. I have an ipad 1 with the 10 inch screen and I still use it for reading technical manuals. "

How do I read a .sbrz ebook?,"I researched this issue in order to answer this related question. What I found is that there is pretty much no way to read the file short of the software supplied by the Sky Ebook Reader Company. If you have a legitimate .sbrz file and are unable to read it on your Windows machine with their software, your best bet is to seek support from that company."
File types and readers - maximum coverage,"I think that if you provide .epub, .azw and .pdf versions of your book you can be pretty sure that you have covered the largest share of your potential readers.
For those that need another format, they can easily use Calibre to convert it, especially if they have access to the .epub version.  Edit: I don't have any statistics, but if you consider  you will have that the stores mainly offer .azw (or the rather equivalent .mobi), .epub and .pdf ebooks; that if you pick any random ereader or ereading software, it will be capable to read at least one of these formats, and often all of them; and that if for some reason someone needs another format, he can start from one of the said formats to get what he needs.
So even without any ""official"" study (assuming that any study in this respect can be considered meaningful of the entire market) that supports this empirical evaluation, you can be pretty sure that if you provide these three formats your book will be almost universally available; if I have understood your question correctly, you are asking how to reach the 99,99% of readers, and you should be able to do so with these three formats."
Scrivener as a tool for creating ebooks,"Ed, the answer more depends on your purpose. The literal answer is Scrivener does indeed create valid e-books and is well maintained. I've used Scrivener for Mac for years. I've occasionally compiled the document to kindle format to carry around. That process works just fine. If your real purpose is to Write the Great Novel or some other large and complex effort, I can definitely recommend Scrivener as a great authoring tool. Their user forum over at Literature and Latte is helpful, knowledgeable, active. At the point of Becoming Published, you may need to switch to a different tool for the process of publishing. That would depend on your publishing route. Scrivener is very good at generating whatever format you need at that point, be it input to Microsoft Word, Calibre, various markup languages, whatever. If you have already created that content, so that now your focus is on the publishing stage, not the writing stage, Scrivener is adequate to the task but probably not your best choice. You're probably better off with a universal conversion tool such as Calibre. The key question is Where and How you intend to publish. If you're thinking of going through a traditional publisher, they have their own requirements, and that might dictate your choice of tool. If you're intending to self-publish, e-books only, you again want to consider the big picture. Barnes & Noble, Amazon, Kobo, Smash Words, etc., all have their own requirements. To meet those varying requirements, we use a combination of Microsoft Word (yuck) and Calibre. Note that this is when focused on the publishing of something already written. Self publishing is a moving target. What I'm suggesting here is that you consider the task of writing stuff separate from the task of getting it published. Scrivener is well designed as a writing tool. It's very good at producing output which becomes input to the publishing step.  To directly answer your question, Can scrivener reliably create e-books? Absolutely. If you intend to personally distribute your e-books and PDF files to your friends or colleagues, Scrivener makes that task extremely easy. However, if you are thinking about self publishing via Amazon, Barnes & Noble, etc., or via a traditional publisher (who might in turn publish to Amazon, etc.), use Scrivener for writing, and whatever the process demands for the publishing part. EDIT: As I re-read your question, I realized I missed a point. You ask about technical, formatting, and other hurdles. If you are self publishing via various outlets (Barnes & Noble, Amazon, etc.), each has different formatting requirements. ""Doing the rounds"" is a matter of continuously reformatting the completed work, fixing rejections and resubmitting, and so on. I can assure you that you will have countless technical, formatting, and other hurdles as you travel that route, but that fact has nothing to do with Scrivener. In other words, Scrivener for Mac is straightforward and easy to use. It's designed for authors creating their works, and that's where it shines. Here's a concrete example. One destination will require a table of contents linked a certain way, whereas another might allow it to be at the back of the document. Scrivener is not your best tool for this constant reformatting of content to meet publisher requirements. Scrivener is an excellent tool for creating the content in the first place."
How do I create a simple e-book with MobiPocket Creator on Windows?,"Creating a simple e-book with MobiPocket Creator is relatively easy. The steps for doing this are as follows: Grab the latest version from here: http://www.mobipocket.com/en/downloadsoft/DownloadCreator.asp Complete the installation, paying particular attention to the page below where you are asked which edition you would like to use:  You will now have an icon on your desktop that you can use to launch MobiPocket Creator:  The start page looks something like this:  Under ""Create New Publication"", click ""Blank publication"". You will be presented with a wizard that asks you a few questions about your publication, including: After completion, you can begin adding content to your book by dragging-and-dropping files into the window:  For example, you could create an HTML file like so: ...and then drag it into the window. It will be copied to your project folder. Click the ""Metadata"" link on the left of the window to edit the title, author, etc. When you are ready, click the Build button in the upper-right corner. Leave the settings at their defaults and click the Build button:  In my case, the tool produced a file with a .PRC extension. You can simply rename the file to .MOBI if you wish.

How do I download DRM-free books from Amazon?,"Simultaneous Device Usage: Unlimited is not a reliable indicator of DRM-free books. AFAIK, all free Public Domain books sold by Amazon Digital Services are DRM-protected. For example, this free Amazon book is listed as Simultaneous Device Usage: Unlimited, however it's not DRM-free.  I am running Linux, if that can be any help. But I do not own a
  Kindle, and my only devices are my PC (running Calibre on Linux) and
  an Android pad used by another person. In that case you can easily test for yourself whether a book is DRM-protected: Open a terminal window and enter the following command to locate the Kindle books folder: cd ~/Documents/My\ Kindle\ Content Right-click the .azw file and select Open with Calibre."
How to confirm if ePub is DRM'ed ? Kobo Aura HD possibly refusing to read DRM-free ePub,"I have a different type of Kobo (Glo HD), and no knowledge of DRM
implementation for ePub, though I would expect that a variety of
distinct DRM techniques can be used on ePub files. I would however expect that an eBook from O'Reilly does not carry DRM. So your problem should have another cause. Which you apparently confirmed by testing on different devices or application software. What I noticed by experimenting with my Kobo is that, when an eBook
has been loaded and made visible to the Kobo, it may interpret reading
problems as caused by the presence of DRM, though that may not be the
case. And you get an error message that pretends that the book is DRM
protected. Typically that can happen if some mishap destroys the file or
moves it to another directory in the Kobo memory. That is easily done
by accessing the memory directly, as done by tools such as Calibre,
though this should in no way be construed as suggesting that Calibre
makes such mistakes. From what I understood experimentally (so I may be wrong) The Kobo
believes it has a DRM problem with that eBook until it does a scan of
its memory, and refreshes its tables, which will then no longer point to a
missing ePub file. I am not sure what is the best way to force that scan.
The way I did it was by using the Kobo browser to download in the Kobo a DRM-free
book (I usually go to http://gutenberg.org for that). So it could be that your Kobo has some problem reading the file, for
whatever reason, and interprets it as a DRM problem, exactly as it did
for my missing/displaced files. My idea is not to give you a definite answer on what is wrong, as only
you can do that. It is more to suggest that the Kobo may interpret as
a DRM problem a problem unrelated to DRM."

Annotation of non-Amazon books on Kindle Paperwhite,"Update 2018:
Got an epub book? Best way at the moment for most qualiity and support is renaming to .txt (or png?) and sending to kindle email adress with convert subject (doesn t even need convert subject here? ;  anyway better than calibre mobi conversion way). This way (direct) epub conversion is supported although it s officially not. TL;DR (today's environment) As I'm highly interested in reading PDFs on my kindle paperwhite 3 (the recent one), as I want a perfect reading experience (eInk/no bright display and high resolution) and the kindle paperwhite gives me that. I experimented with my kindle fire and my paperwhite, so far my insights for the kindle paperwhite are (they correspond to todays possibilities, when something changes, feel free to comment): There seem to be 3 factors: The software version decides how the notes are stored on the kindle. It seems to be that in earlier version notes where stored in an ""mbp"" file format, which could be read with the right software. But amazon changed that to ""mpb1"" (I don't know, if it is possible to read that). (I tested everything with today's recent kindle version 5.8.10.) The transfer type decides if your uploaded document (only the document, didn't say anything about annotations yet) is distributed to your devices. It is distributed if you upload it via amazaon (e.g. with send to kindle via email), with USB it is not.  The format decides if your annotations are synced around your devices. This obviously only works, if the document itself is synced (uploaded via amazon). So you need to upload it via amazon and use an kindle compatible book format to share your annotations (pdf won't work). temp TL;DR: Sadly: https://read.amazon.com and also https://read.amazon.com/kp/notebook? (shows your annotations in the browser) won't work with that methods (also the windows kindle application!). They just work with amazon bought books, as I see it. For me, this is very unsatisfactory as I don't just want to have the notes on the kindle reader app or on my kindle paper white, I want it to be on my pc! Reading app for pc would only be second best option, but as I said, it doesn't work like i said in the paragraph before.  So I experimented further.  Sharing the notations via kindle itself: The pdf annotation extraction/export seems to be difficult. This is very unsatisfactory for me, as some documents (math formulars?) and magazines can only be read properly as an pdf. I appreciate any solution in this area!"
Is there a difference in rendering between Paperwhite and Voyage?,"Apparently the Voyage rendering system is similar to the Paperwhite, but not the same. I (currently) know of one difference between the two; there is a rendering bug in the Voyage that the Paperwhite does not have, as described on the MobileRead forums: let's not forget that Voyage has that weirdo width bug, too, for
  images? Not the same, mind you...but not totally dissimilar, either.
  If you have an image that's <50% wide in Voyage, you're set; but if
  it's 51%, you're screwed, it blows up to full width. Now, again: this
  isn't the same as this wacky, ""the image won't float unless it's SMALL
  enough, in iOS,"" but...I wonder if they are in some wild-ass way
  related? In some algo, somewhere? —Hitch I'll try to update this with any further information I get."
Can I transfer my Purchased Nook library to Kindle or other Service?,"Some authors and publishers require their books to be sold DRM free. Those books you can use on other reading platforms. Nook uses the ePub format which is used by just about everyone - Amazon being one of the exceptions. Depending on the specific reader, you might have to convert the file to a supported format. An ebook manager/converter program such as Calibre can help you with that. Beyond that, your options will depend on the type of DRM used. A web search for Nook DRM found a document from 2009 describing the Nook DRM as a proprietary form of encryption using a credit card number as the key. Assuming that is correct, then your options will vary depending on where you live. In the US, you do not have any legal options under current law, as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) prohibits the removal of DRM, except under certain special circumstances, such as visually impaired readers wishing to use text-to-speech."
Calibre custom news source - How to set publication author(s),"This was kind a hard nut to crack...
Regarding this issue this functionality is currently not available nor planned for the future. In fact there is a workaround to more or less solve this issue. There is a real master tool called 'Metadata Plugboards' hidden in the settings. This allows you to modify metadata when media is exported (save to disk, send per mail or upload to device etc. - this applies not when you simply convert to another format). The tool gives you a lot of options - For this example I just chose any format -> any device. Then you can specify what should go to which metadata field. Select authors as target and enter the following template code This replaces the author field with the title, if the author currently contains calibre, otherwise the authors field remains untouched. More details on the template language are available at the calibre manual."
What design patterns exist for responsive web design of ebooks?,"The problem with trying any really interesting design elements (like responsiveness) in ebooks is that the main reading systems out there are amazingly primitive by web standards. JavaScript support is more or less confined to iBooks at present, and the only system that uses media queries that I know of is Kindle, and they only support the amzn-mobi and amzn-kf8 selectors. A few reading systems will support some CSS 3 elements like border-radius, but mostly you're stuck with the older stuff. On top of that, many reading systems (like the nook) will by default ignore the publisher's CSS file completely and use their own stylesheet instead. If what you're looking for from responsive design is the text conforming to the screen size, though, you can certainly achieve that through good markup and simple CSS. Make your markup as semantic as possible, and use semantic elements rather than styles, since many systems will ignore, for example, a style that bolds some text, but will happily bold anything in a <b> tag. If you're going for a wide array of devices, keep things as simple as possible. In general, think of the web circa 2000. If you're targeting a specific device, you can do some more interesting stuff. The first lesson here is: know what specific devices and reading systems you're targeting. If you have specific questions about any of the areas that you mentioned in your post, feel free to ask more questions!"
AWZ3 conversion not working,"Calibre conversions usually do not that long. There are a few things you should try: View the book in Calibre and flip through the pages. If the calibre viewer cannot handle that file, it is unlikely to be able to convert it. Your output seems to be from the interactive conversion log, you should try the command-line conversion with ebook-convert, the options might be a bit overwhelming, but the interesting ones are the ones for debugging: --debug-pipeline, -d --verbose, -v With those you can try to get some extra information on the process. While converting keep an eye on processor load. This should not go down during the conversion progress. If it does hit Ctrl+C,
you will get a Python backtrace from the ebook-convert program, which might help you determining where the process is stuck."

how to convert djvu files to some files?,"There is AFAIK not such a utility that does exactly what you want but you can explode the file by repeatedly using the djvused utility: where <nr> is the pagenumber and <filename> the output filename. I have a python utility that does this automatically for all the pages while using incremental filename of the form page_<nr>.djvu. After that you can combine multiple files with the djvm command: for each of the combinations of page. The images and associated data (like OCR-ed text) will get in the 84 files. That data is not unpacked and repacked, so the process doesn't lead to any loss of quality. The following is a minimalistic version of my Python program that calls djvused to explode the file into individual pages: "

Kindle (classic) power consumption when reading PDF vs. MOBI,"If the PDF file is not formatted to the size of your Classic Kindle screen (roughly A6 format or 6""x4"") you will consume a lot more power because you will need to zoom in and out and navigate on the page in order to read it. A MOBI file does not have this kind of problem because it dynamically resize the text so you can read without interaction. Your e-ink device (any Kindle generation) will be off while you read and will power on when you click on any button or on the screen. So as well as it is on sleep mode it will consume less power. The device only needs power to refresh the screen and redraw anything or change pages, thus any interaction that redraws anything consumes more power."

Are there studies on whether reading in landscape or portrait mode is better on smartphone size screen?,"Some where (I can't find it right now), I read that 72 characters per line was best for reading comprehension. When there was less than this the end of line moving your eye to the begging of the next line slowed you down, and when there was more than this following lines become more difficult, because you have to move your head which makes eye tracking more difficult. The study did not take into account dyslexia. So I guess it depends on your font size."

SVG covers: which size must be used?,"Since you can only specify one size, and not have the selected image depend on the devices resolution, you best take something that is as large as the largest expected screen format.

What fraction of unrestricted ebooks originate with the top digitization projects?,"I am assuming that the poster of the question calls
""unrestricted books"" the books that have no DRM, i.e., no technical
devices intended tp prevent some uses, such as copy, search, or
adaptation to new reading devices. All books are born legally restricted by
copyright, at least today, until they enter the public domain. Very few rightsholders fully remove copyright
restrictions by providing adequate public licences. Though I have read many papers on the topic, and written some, I doubt there is such a
document as requested in the question. The reason lies in the
diversity of objectives of the numerisation projects, on the lack of
standard definition of what a book is, on the wide variations
encountered on book counts in various studies (notably those concerned
with assessing the proportion of orphan books in various libraries).
The definition of a book depends on a variety of parameters, including
content and purpose, commercialization, relevance of distinct
editions, choice of illustrator, each of which may impact some numbers
by an order of magnitude. Does the Bible count for one, or for one
hundred thousands? What about Shakespeare's works, or Alice in
Wonderland? Does a single poem count as a book? What about a short story, a music score, a ship log, a catalog, a birth registry?  Recall that what figures may be available may have been
computed with different issues or purposes in mind, hence with different visions (often not explicited) of what counts as a book, and of what counts as two different books.   Hence, rather
than pointing on a specific document as requested, I try below to give a direct
answer, based on figures I may remember or retrieve. But a short crisp
answer would be misleading given the very fuzziness of available
information, and the fact that the question itself is thus
unwittingly very imprecise. The production of unrestricted books by Project Gutenberg and similar
projects is tiny compared to raw digitization and OCR, as donne by
Google and large public and academic projects, for example by national libraries. It is on the order of
100 000 books, a magnitude order of 1/1000th of the total
number of books, that seems to range somewhere between 50 and 130
millions, depending on how books are counted. Large digitization
projects like those led by Google, National Libraries and large
institutions are about two orders of magnitude more productive, some producing several millions of digitized books, though
exact numbers are sometimes hard to assess. However, if you consider quality digitization with proofread text and
structured formatting like the epub standard, efforts like the
Project Gutenberg seem significantly more productive, as large
digitization projects produce only a few thousands, unrestricted,
quality e-books (from what I have been able to check). This is not surprising since large digitization projects are intended
mostly for preservation purposes, and for accessibility by the
research community (or for indexation purposes in the case of Google), while Project Gutenberg and its likes are intended for availability/accessibility purposes, i.e. to give convenient access to existing literature to a wider reading public.  Raw
digitization for conservation performed by large project is fairly
cheap and fast, while quality digitization require long and costly
human intervention (about one order of magnitude higher), that can be
well covered by crowd-proofreading and editing. Another aspect is that, while the total number of books is very large,
only a small fraction is of interest to a wide audience. So the
relevant corpus for Project Gutenberg is probably much smaller than
the relevant corpus for large digitization project that have to deal
with all kinds of archives, inventories and the like. This is
compounded by the fact that the books that are of interest to a wide
audience are to a large extent still under copyright, hence much less
likely to be made available legally without restrictions, by any digitization project. This actually stresses the importance in the book count of orphan
books, and more generally of books not cared for by rightholders, and
whether they can, or cannot, be made legally available, with or
without restrictions. This may represent on the order of half the
books in copyright. In the USA, it is an important aspect of the legal
battle around the Google Book Search Settlement Agreement, and it is
the object of a specific law in France. So, I would tend to believe that cooperative projects like the
Project Gutenberg are the major source of unrestricted ebooks, if you
consider reading resources for a wide public. But, it makes little
sense to compare the output of two types of projects that have different
purposes, at least in the medium term. Still, it should be noted that preservation is probably a more urgent
task than high quality digitization. It is rather sound that
preservation projects will avoid diverting much of their limited
resources on costly high quality output, other than for public
relation purposes. Also, the mass of documents
digitized by large projects provide a good source of raw material for
smaller projects (in size) that are aiming for quality output
that has a chance of attracting some readership. We should also remember that digitization is not the only source of
ebooks. There are authors, publishers and institutions that produce a very significant number of
new books without DRM restrictions, though there may be legal
restrictions on use not enforced with DRM, as was the case before with
classical paper books. Though I spent significant time analyzing the question and writing the
answer with some figures to substantiate it, it ended up being far too
long, and messed up by the heterogeneity of sources. Hence I decided
to cut it short here. If interested, you may read the rest in a
previous version from the history of this anwer, which contains some additional figures and references from various projects. 2 related questions: What kinds of DRM are used in eBooks? Is it possible to purchase DRM free eBooks? Some classic literature is available for free - but where?"

How can I update an existing side-loaded MOBI file on a Kindle?,"Two questions which I need to ask: 
a)who owns the devices?
b)what kinds of files are you sharing? You say, .mobi, but are you just repackaging .doc files or .pdfs into .mobi?  First, let's not use the word ""side-load"" because that usually refers to moving a file through USB. If you're ""sending to Kindle"", that obviously is not using USB.  I think what you're using is ""Kindle Personal Documents service"" to send it to a specific device.  The key question is whether your company owns the devices in question. If yes, then it also is controlled through a single Amazon account, in which case it would be fairly easy to delete and swap  old Kindle files remotely.  To  log in to the Kindle Personal Documents service via computer, go to the Amazon account options, choose ""Manage your content and devices"" , for  show, select Docs . Under Actions choose Delete  and that should do it.  I'm guessing that everyone owns their own device and use their personal Amazon login for it. I'm also assuming that each device  has listed a specified employee's email as authorized to receive  Kindle files from via  the Personal Documents service. (Remember, the person may have several devices they are managing content on; they only need to authorize the device email which you want to send company docs to).  To add the file to devices for each employee, you would need to send a single email to all the relevant device emails and then attach the kindle file. Obviously if you can email one version of a file, you can email an updated version. If I send different versions of a file to a device, I usually rename the ebook's title (which is not the same as the name of the file). If you don't have a single login for all devices (but are simply sending things from an authorized email to the devices), you do not have access to the user's Manage Your Content and Devices screen; therefore, you could not swap files.  To give a different perspective here, I prefer the Google Play Books solution for syncing ebooks to the Kindle solution. (For one thing, Google accepts epubs instead of a proprietary file). Google Play Books doesn't let different emails share files. But Google Docs/Drive is really good about allowing files to be synced and shared.  One solution might involve keeping the most recent epub/doc/pdf on a Google drive and let people manually transfer it to Google Play Books. (You could use a plugin like this: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/drive-epub-pdf-book-to-go/fabbklgdcbijclhlffpmllpgnkalmbfd?hl=en-US ). But this still requires that each user make the manual step of connecting files from Google drive to Google Play Books.  If you can sync the file as a PDF or Word or ODT file, then you can stick the file onto your own G-drive (preferable in a separate EMPLOYEE DOCS shared folder), then each user could install the Google Docs/Drive app and then you could do a read only share with every user; that would let you always have a shared and synced copy of the file.  The only caveat about the Google solution is that might need employees to have offline access to these docs. I just checked and the Google Docs app has an option for each document which allows you to view the document offline. You would probably need to verify that Google would update a doc if an employee has chosen to make it viewable online.  (I suspect that MS Office might have a syncing method as well).  To summarize: Kindle doesn't seem to let you sync files among devices; it just lets you add new files. If the files you need to share can be PDFs/DOC files, then it would be easier to put them on the Google Drive and then share the files with users. "
Direct copying of epub files on the Kobo internal file system,"One way to make visible epub files copied directly on the Kobo file system is to use the Kobo browser once afterwards to download an epub file from the web. I did some more experimenting on my own, and finally succeeded, though
I did not explore the precise boundaries of what can work and what will
not work. I am giving details, so that you know my experimental
evidence. This is personnal experiment, not anything I read anywhere. So, get second confirmation if that info is critical for your purpose. If you are only interested in the result, and the technique to transfer
ebooks to your Kobo without any specific software, simply jump to the
last section od this answer. My question was motivated by the fact that I wanted to transfer ebooks
from my Linux computer to my Kobo eReader. I am running Calibre, which
I use to improve some of the ebooks, but for some reason that I have
not yet identified, it will not detect my Kobo when it is connected to the computer
by a USB cable. So having read in various places that a Kobo can be seen as a USB
drive, on which ebooks can be copied, I tried as reported above without
success, but no indication of the reason(s) for failure. The files
were simply ignored, wherever I put them. Performing a sync did not
help. Then serendipity came to my help. I had been wondering for some time
how I could connect to book sources on the web. I did not know how to
browse the web with the Kobo. And then I discovered the hidden web browser,
which they consider experimental.
In Kobo's own words: Since the browser is still a beta feature, some websites may not
  display properly. Please note that the browser is not officially
  supported by Kobo. Indeed, there is no indication in their user guide (which I had read)
of the very exixtence of that browser, and I had to search the web on
my computer to find it. Then I found the help page that explains how to activate this browser. So I tried the Kobo browser to download a (DRM-)free book from the
web. It worked ... and (nearly) all the books I had copied by hand on
the Kobo file system became visible and readable. I am saying nearly
all, because it actually saw only the files with an .epub
suffix. Those files had been copied directly in the root directory of the Kobo file system, or in a directory codex I had created at the root of the Kobo file
system, or in a subdirectory of that codex directory. I did not check how deep the hierarchy can be. Note that the book I downloaded from the web was also stored by the Kobo eReader browser in the
root directory. However, books with DRM are clearly stored somewhere else. I did not (dare to) check what happens when a file has a .epub suffix,
but is not an epub file. But I did check that ebooks placed in other
locations are not seen (of course, I checked only some locations), unless it is a user
created directory hierarchy placed in the root directory. I added some more books to check for other means to make then visible to the user. Since downloading a book seemed critical, I was wondering whether a sync induced download would do the job (it does not).
Then I added two Kobo (DRM-)free books to my account on Kobobooks.com, and
checked in my computer that they were indeed added to my account on
kobobooks.com. Then I performed a sync on my Kobo, and it did download the two
books. But that did not make visible the books I had previously added
directly in the file system. It is  worth noting that, though they
were (DRM-)free, these ebooks were not downloaded at the root of the file
system, like the epub files downloaded by the browser. But when I downloaded an ebook from project Gutenberg, the new books I had
copied directly in the file system became visible in the book collection of the Kobo eReader. This is already longer than it should. So, I am skipping some details to give my conclusions, for what I understand. The key idea is that the Kobo eReader (or at least the Kobo Glo HD
that I use - but I suspect several of them work the same) has a web
browser, which can be used to download books in your Kobo. The browser is somewhat hidden, as Kobo considers it an experimental
item, not officially supported. The browser download the epub files right in the root directory. And
then calls some piece of software to integrate it into its
organization of the ebooks collection. The nice point is that it checks all the non-standard (i.e. non system) files and
directories that are present at the root level, so as to recreate the information needed
to integrate them. Aa a result, it takes into account the fact that
some files may have been removed, modified or moved into a different
subdirectory. The only bad news is that (afaik) the only way to get that software
executed is to download an epub file from some site with the Kobo
browser. Hence, copying ebooks from your computer onto the Kobo, assuming
the computer does not have a web server, can be achieved by connecting
the Kobo to the computer with a USB cable. The Kobo is then seen as a
memory device, with a file system which can be mounted as usual (for
example on directory /mnt with : mount /dev/sdc /mnt depending on where it shows up, here on /dev/sdc --
note that it is not /dev/sdc1). Then you can copy epub files or file
hierarchies at the root /mnt of this file system. Then you dismount the file system with umount /mnt, and make sure copying is terminated (Unix sync command) before removing the USB cable, if you will.
Finally, you use
the Kobo browser to download at least one extra ebook (possibly always
the same one :-). This was described for a Linux system, but should be adaptable to any operating system. An important point is that all the epub files must have the .epub suffix. Another thing that I have not been able to determine is whether these
files can benefit from other services, such as cloud storage. But
I am very moderately interested in the cloud anyway. Now, some other user may have better, simpler ways of achieving the
same result, or more, without using specific software such as Calibre. I find it a
bit frustating not to be able to used Calibre because it will not
detect the Kobo USB connection on my machine. I would not mind using a degraded
version where I would have to tell Calibre when the Kobo is connected and where."
font color not showing up on color Nook for new eBook epub,"This could be either the Nook reading system or a problem in the code. The first thing to check is if your device is overriding publisher styles. Nook in particular is quite insistent about that, and will by default override all styles with its own. I don't recall exactly what menu that's in, but you should be able to find it. If that doesn't do the trick, then there's probably something up with the code—either the CSS that defines the styles or the XHTML that defines the structure that the styles are applied to. If you're still having problems after enabling publisher styles, feel free to update this post or make a new one with the relevant sections of code."
EPUB & Kindle File Glossary and Dictionary Selection,"This is what I've found thus far. The most cross-platform solution to providing an accessible glossary would be using hyperlinks (styled so as to be somewhat unobtrusive) that link to a glossary in the back.  Only the first occurrence of a word would be hyperlinked in this way, and the glossary entries would contain links that send the reader back to that occurrence of the word. Pros: Cross-platform compatibility. EPUB 2 compliant. Cons: Only the first word can be linked. Glossary terms must be styled to be different from the rest of the text, which could be distracting. iBooks supports Javascript, so you could build a homebrew JS solution.  I haven't fully explored this yet. iBooks also touts support for EPUB 3.  The EPUB 3 specification includes a bunch of new markup, including special attributes that define hyperlinks as ""footnote"" or ""endnote"" hyperlinks, specifically the epub:type attribute. When you make footnote/glossary hyperlinks, and use the special epub:type attributes, iBooks will create a popover to display your content, rather than navigating to it, which is spiffy! Details and examples on how to use this are given by Liz Castro on her blog, but the overall implementation would be similar to the cross-platform method.  The main difference is that your glossary entries would go at the bottom of the chapter instead of in the back of the book (apparently iBooks doesn't support this if your link target is outside of the current HTML document).  You may or may not have to CSS the <aside> tags to be hidden, as well. Pros: You can show the glossary entry for every occurrence of the word, because you are not navigating (and therefore don't require backlinks). It's also just cooler than the cross-platform method. Cons: Only supported by iBooks. One way to have a custom glossary on the Kindle would be to create a separate ebook file, in a dictionary format, and provide it for free on the Kindle Store.  In the front of the book, provide a link to that item so that your reader can download it to their Kindle or Kindle App. Note that I'm not familiar with the dictionary format that's used in Kindle, or how you would create one. Then, the reader would have to set that dictionary as their active one while reading.  Any time they clear a word (using the standard long-press gesture), it will show the glossary definition, if there is one. The exact behavior varies slightly between the Kindle devices and the Kindle App: One issue with this is if your glossary contains phrases, and not just single-word terms.  The long-press feature of the Kindle works by highlighting the word that your finger is on, and showing the definition for that word.  Therefore if your glossary had the phrase ""mad as a hatter"", and your reader long-presses ""mad"", they would not find your custom definition.  A potential workaround for this would be to index any phrases in your glossary by the first word in that phrase, so ""mad as a hatter"" is indexed under ""mad"".  I'm not 100% sure if this is possible yet, but I will probably be looking into it soon. Pros: The normal method of looking up definitions can show your glossary definitions. Cons: Requires that the user download a second book to gain access to the glossary. May require that the user switches between dictionaries. Only works on the Kindle family. Not every Kindle device has been tested. Unexplored. Unexplored. Unexplored."
Will I be able to put Kobo books on my Sony Reader?,"Absolutely, yes. I was a Kobo customer long before I had a Sony reader. I switched to Sony when my Kobo Touch died.  I was actually happy that the Sony store was killed because it resulted in the Kobo store being put on my Sony reader. You need the latest firmware update (or at least since the Kobo rollover), and then you will have a ""Kobo Bookstore"" option on the home screen, and under ""Bookshelves"", where there used to be ""Books"", ""Collections"" and ""Evernote"" options, there is now an additional ""Purchased Content"". Select ""Purchased Content"" and it should show you everything you've ever bought from both the Sony and Kobo stores (and it will handle DRM'd content just fine)."
"Is ""soft DRM"" a viable option?","I don't know if there are studies into soft DRM, but there are studies
on difference in behaviour between people that are anonymous and people that are not. The non-anonymous generally being more ""honest"". Removing soft DRM would rely on the non-anonymous person to do so, before handing the ebook on to someone else. Not doing so would have her/him run the risk of the passed on ebook being made even more public with name identification attached. I can only assume that for some of the potential passers-on, this is a deterrent.  You also would have to trust the software that removes the watermarking. Removing metadata is not enough, since the watermarking could be added via steganographic approach. Some formats such as PDF, have a plethora of possibilities to hide information. And you would have to remove images from an EPUB file, or severely change them, as there are watermarks for images that survive some of the re-renderings of the images. And your name could be watermarked in any or all of the images included in a book."
What is the difference between giving away my only print copy or my only electronic copy of a book?,"There are a couple of key legal differences between print books and ebooks: Capitol Records brought suit against ReDigi on the grounds of
  copyright infringement. The United States District Court for the
  Southern District of New York held that ReDigi’s website infringed
  Capitol Record’s rights of reproduction and distribution, and that the
  distribution of the digital music files was not covered by the first
  sale doctrine. The court reasoned that the process of creating a copy
  of the work on ReDigi’s cloud server was an unauthorized reproduction
  (the first sale doctrine applies only to lawfully made copies that are
  distributed, not reproduced) and that because an additional copy was
  made for the server, users did not distribute or sell the particular
  copy that they had originally purchased. As much as we may think they are basically the same thing, ebooks and print books are quite different in a number of ways, and we're still all figuring out the nature of those differences, let alone how to deal with them. It may well be that the entire business model changes enough that the first sale doctrine becomes irrelevant to ebooks—if ebook subscription services become the primary method of distribution, for example."
Dedicated ebook reader?,"The device that you need is basically an e-ink ereader, all of them have the features that you have requested. Since there are many different brands and models, each one with its own set of different features, I suggest you to take a look at the comparison page on Wikipedia, that has in one place all the informations that you need to make your choice; if you understand italian, also look on eBookReaderItalia (anyway it's just a table filled with tech specs, so even if you don't speak my language you should be able to understand it nonetheless). There is also another comparison page on Mobileread wiki, but it is a bit outdated ."
How to manage translations when self-publishing (in-house translation)?,"I recommend you consider to move to an explicit mark-up system (LaTeX, reST/Sphinx) that allow you to: You can continue to edit the files in word, you should just not use its What-You-See-Is-All-You've-Got features for layout and styling. This might seem overhead if you never used tools like LaTeX/Sphinx. Having persistent predictable output is something that will be invaluable for anything serious (more than 10 pages I would say). I have seen academics trying to do their thesis in Word (and more recently LibreOffice) and be driven up-the-wall by documents breaking after a section or picture was moved around or missing hyphens while exporting to PDF. Revision control systems like Mercurial allow you to save often, mark specific revision and compare those against the latest (or each other) and push your whole writing effort to a (private) remote copy of the full repository (with all the revisions) in an efficient way. This is much quicker than keeping track of revisions by hand ( e.g. saving as book_20131225.docx) or making off-site backups in any other way. The people at TeX-LaTeX StackExchange are very helpful and for revision control you can ask on StackOverflow."
Is there any advantage apart from more storage space when using a memory card in a book reader,"There is one major advantage of using add on cards for storing books, and that is in case the device has problems with some of the newly added books. If you use a card you keep your devices internal memory clean. Sometimes it happens that you have a faulty ebook, or a half-written one, that confuses the ebook-reader. It is not always possible for the ebook-reader to ignore or delete such files, which means you need to delete them using a PC connection. Because of the confusion, the ebook-reader might not be able to allow even that, which requires restarting or even reinitialisation of your reading device.  I have had this happen on my SONY PRS-700, as well as my BookEen. The latter prompted me: (retrying did not help). Storing books on removable media allows you to remove the card, remove any added—faulty—files using a card reader that is not confused by any ebook internal problems, and have a working device without restarting or reinitialisation. Another, minor, advantage of using cards can be, that if you use an USB 3.0 card-reader for writing, you will probably have faster writing speeds than can be achieved via a wired connection via the ebook-reader (often USB 2). Given the small size of text only ebooks, this might not be notable too much unless you re-write your whole library."
Are DRM free ebooks considered a better quality ebook? [closed],"This question is a little subjective (is it better) and broad (there are many different DRM formats).  With that being said, in my personal experience, I prefer DRM-free ebooks. They work better in various readers that support the given document format. I don't always like to use my Sony Reader for books that I purchase (usually epubs). For programming books I often like to use my laptop (either web browser or Calibre) because the programming examples are more difficult to read when shown on a smaller screen that forces line wrapping in unusual places.  I've also had scenarios where I have bought an epub that only worked properly on a Kobo reader (bought from Chapters). I was forced to remove the DRM protection and manually edit the CSS files and remove some javascript code that was causing the font-size to be so large that the book was illegible."
What are serif and sans serif fonts on different ebook reading systems?,"My 1st gen Kobo Glo has the following fonts pre-installed (I suppose other Kobo devices use the same set; it is possible for the user to add more but I think this is beyond the scope of your question): Serif: (1) Sans Serif: Other: Of course, these customizations are optional, and it is possible to default fonts as defined inside the ebook.   About titles, if there are not specific settings inside the ebook stylesheets, they are treated like other text: besides having a larger size, if not explicitly set to something else, the default Georgia is used. Compared to the ereaders, the app is more limited in the customization options: 1. Including slab serif
2. I'm not really sure but I think that these are used for Chinese/Japanese languages compatibility."
Ebook app for Windows 8,"You can try the good old ebook reader bundled with Calibre. It's a multiplatform software, so it's available for other systems too, not just for Windows. Besides being a great application (Calibre itself is the swiss army knife for all things related to ebooks), it's also free and open-source. There is also EPUBReader, it's not a standalone program but a Firefox extension. Anyway I've never used it so I can't tell you much more than this. Other available ereaders are those tied to online ebook stores, like Kindle, Kobo, Nook, and so on."
What 's the best way to read a scientific PDF?,"Buy an iPad or iPad mini and install Goodreader (the latest version at this time is actually called GoodReader 4, according to the previous link; it can be found here).That is the best choice."
"Can I have ""clickable"" links/references/index entries in an ePub?","You can certainly use standard <a> tags with matching ids to create hyperlinks within an epub file, yes. The structure of the text could look like: With a matching note in a notes.xhtml file: There are a few best practices to consider: Indices can be pretty painful to create if the production files weren't tagged correctly at the time of creation; one quick-and-dirty method to consider in that case is to insert <span epub:type=""pagebreak"" id=""page1"" /> into the document at each page break, then have the index link to the print page. This isn't ideal, as a print page can span multiple screens (particularly on a cell phone!), but it can get you part way there if you're interested in cutting corners."
What book collection related features can be useful in an eBook reader app,"Collection download and transfer Ability to synchronize your collection between multiple devices Ability to synchronize your collection with the cloud Ability to manually download books from your PC collection to mobile device without automated syncing Ability to connect to eBook vendors of your choice, purchase ebooks from them and download (Amazon, Samsung, Apple, other web books stores...) Ability to recognize the book (author/title) by reading the unknown book's content and matching it to special content database, the way music players can identify an MP3 file by the audio fingerprint. Not sure if any software today supports this. Picking a specific book from a collection Finding a book by file name substring Finding a book by browsing the directory Tagging and searching by tag Ability to read book metadata, including EPUB; and finding books by metadata Finding a book by searching for a string in actual book text If books support summary blurbs, ability to view a blurb before opening the book For mobile devices, persistence of experience Remember the last book you were reading, and open it immediately Remember several of the last books you were reading for quick pick Remember the last directory you opened the book from, and start browsing there Remember a list of your past searches and let you re-do them Social features Rate books Recommend books Share books For DRM books that support it, lend books"
How to effectively manage ebooks using Calibre?,"Calibre organises the books that way, there isn't much you can do about it. If you want to use it, you must accept that folder structure.  Anyway, books are better categorised by using tags and other metadata informations.  Beside that, Calibre can also run as a web server, providing a website-like interface that you can access from every browser. Obviously, to use this feature, Calibre must be installed on a machine that is always on and connected to Internet."
Selling ebooks of school textbooks,"This is not legal advice, but the answer to your question is almost always no. In general, it is illegal to sell a copy (physical or electronic) of a book if you are also keeping a copy. Say you own a physical copy of a book. You can sell that copy, but you generally cannot sell an electronic copy, regardless of whether you keep the physical copy. This is also generally true even if the buyer owns a physical or electronic copy of the book already. This is because copyright protects the copyright owner's exclusive right to make or distribute copies in the first place. If you are even thinking of doing this, you absolutely must consult a copyright lawyer. There are very large potential penalties for copyright infringement, regardless of the amount of money changing hands. For example, one person was ordered to pay $1.5 million for sharing 24 mp3s. So, the answer is: probably not. Tread with extreme care and consult a lawyer."
Does something about DjVu prevent making a free viewer on iOS?,"In my opinion the relative inaccessibility of DjVu's libdjvu, including having their own bytestream compression contributed to the low acceptance of the DjVu format over the years and not patent issues. This hinders other software developers adapting their software to support DjVu and even more so 
when porting to a new platform. The DjVuLibre software has several characteristics that make it difficult to port. It is C++ based code that builds on a framework that seems to be generically usable, but is probably DjVuLibre specific. I conclude that on not having encountered the framework anywhere else, as well as specific names of classes, etc. that include the substring DJVU) in the framework. That framework, in the form of libdjvu, is however used in all of the DjVuLibre tools (bzz. djvu...) The libdjvu being a C++ library  makes it less portable and less accessible for being called from other languages (e.g. Python), than a C based library. To complicate things, the bytestreams in the DjVu file format are compressed using a Burrows Wheeler encoder. The encoder is similar to bzip2 but has its own, DjVu specific, implementation. This gives a small advantage over more standard compression schemes, but this is dwarfed by the conceptual better handling of compression of the images through the use of wavelet encoding and individually compressed layers. I analysed the DjVuLibre software some time ago, to extract OCR-ed text. I settled for a minimal Python implementation for that piece, as I could not get a Python program to hook up to the C++ libraries in a reasonable amount of time. I spent a few days getting the Python implementation to work, analysing the intransparent program flow of the library, all the while comparing the output with results from djvutxt and bzz. This resulted in the DJVU OCR extraction program included in Calibre. (The difficulties might be based on
my lack of programming experience: I have been programming C++ since the late 80's—one of the first commercial things I developed in C++  was a library  for creating GIF files in 1987—and have used Python since the mid 90's). I must say I really like the DjVu concepts, and love the superior quality/filesize ratio, compared to scans in other file formats I have used. I always scan to .DjVu. But although I primarily work on a Linux system, the scanning/conversion process includes commercial software running on a Windows box that gives me even better compression results than the open DjVuLibre library does (as well as OCR without an additional program)."
is there any software available to directly write in mobi format?,"Your question -- if I may restate -- is whether there are tools which allow you to create ebooks natively  for Kindle. Probably not, although it does have some specialized creation tools (Kindle Textbook Creator, > Kindle Kids' Book Creator, Kindle Comic Creator, Kindle Previewer).  My guess is that only Amazon.com could create such a tool because the .mobi standard is a proprietary format and is updated fairly regularly.  Some  tools have features  which let you export  to .mobi format (from MS word, PDF, or .mobi),  that includes Calibre  https://calibre-ebook.com/ Sigil, and Adobe InDesign. usually it converts from epub to mobi -- though calibre lets you convert from MS Word to mobi. But it isn't always a good conversion.  The thing is, aside from being a binary file, the Kindle format is trying to align closely to the epub format, so it makes sense (in my opinion) to focus on developing and testing an epub file -- and then after the fact converting the epub to mobi (and testing it and maybe  the styles so it works well on kindle devices and apps).  It's crazy and a waste of time to do all this; it would be a lot easier if Amazon.com  had adopted the epub standard. Certainly that would be better for publishers. But Amazon has come half-way and said if something is a valid EPUB file, then our Kindle Previewer app can reliably convert it to mobi. That's better than nothing.  For long term use, it's best to have an epub file -- because in the future it will be easier to convert from epub than to convert from .mobi"
is it allowed to print a freely available ebook for own usage,"The first point is that freely available does not mean freely
usable, not even freely redistributable.  Many copyrighted works are
freely available, even placed under a Creative common licence, but
still have legal restriction on their uses, regarding for example
modification or commercial use. The fact that it is, or is not
available in print or some other form is irrelevant. The only thing
that matters is what the licence says.  If you have no licence, then
every use is forbidden, unless explicitly permitted by local law,
though you are obviously permitted to read the document, as there
would be no point in making it available otherwise. However, the copyright law of some countries (France for example)
allow private copying, provided it is for your own use (which implies
that you do it yourself). There may be a further restriction that it
is legal only if your access to the source work is itself legal, thus
preventing copies from pirated sources. In your case, you have legal access to the document as it is freely
available. Hence, where law permits, you can make private copies on
whatever medium, including paper. However, using an online service to
get it printed would probably not be considered as doing it yourself.
Even going to a print-on-demand shop in the street might be legally
disputable. Then, things seldom get that formal, and it is likely that no one,
author included, will object, especially if the book is not available
for sale in the form you seek, so that you cannot possibly cause him
any damage. Further legal details (to add accuracy to previous answers) If you are in a country that is a member of the Bern Convention - which
is most countries, USA included - the work is protected by copyright
regardless of where it was created, and at least as well as work
created within the country. Actually, in the USA, copyright protection
is higher for unregistered foreign works than for unregistered US
works. In the USA, your legal risk in printing for your own use a book that
has not been registered with the Copyright Office is very low, since
the copyright owner cannot sue for attorney fees or punitive damage,
but only to get the price of the printed book. But I am not a lawyer."
eBook format in nowadays: EPUB is de facto standard?,"First, a note: I will not be considering PDFs in this answer, because I do not consider PDFs to be ebooks. There are a number of reasons for this, like lack of reflowability and end-user customization options, but the primary reason is that PDFs are not generally sold at sites that sell ebooks--you can't sell your PDFs through iBooks or the Kindle store or whatnot. Others have other opinions, and that's fine—the relevant info is that I won't be considering PDFs here. In terms of variety of devices supporting the format, epub is the clear standard—it's supported on nearly everything that reads ebooks. When you look at numbers, though, it's a different story: according to an article at Digital Book World, a recent Book Industry Study Group found the following statistics to the question ""Where do you typically acquire ebooks?"": This means that Amazon accounts for roughly 2/3 of the sales of ebooks, making their proprietary mobi/KF8 format the dominant format. In essence, there is no ""winner"" yet, and there is not likely to be any time soon. Apple, Google, Barnes & Noble, and Kobo are enough to ensure that epub will remain alive and kicking for quite some time. With a majority of the sales, Amazon has no impetus to switch to a standard, and they don't appear to be in any danger of losing much market share. Where we are is where we're likely to be for quite a while, which means making two formats: epub and mobi/KF8. fortunately, Amazon has gotten much better at making tools that convert from epub to their format, so concentrating on epub will give you something for Amazon as well with little extra work."
I have a book written in Word format [duplicate],"The accepted answer for the question How do I convert a Word document into an ebook? describes how to convert a book in .docx format to AZW3. As is very clear from the 3rd picture in that answer, where AZW3 is selected as output format, that there is a whole list of ""calibre output formats"". Searching the latter phrase should get you to the complete list of supported formats in the FAQ: 
AZW3, EPUB, FB2, OEB, LIT, LRF, MOBI, HTMLZ, PDB, PML, RB, PDF, RTF, SNB, TCR, TXT, TXTZ. From that list, someone can just select what they prefer for their device and/or software¹. For iPad users that depends on their software, but if that doesn't support AZW3 directly, it probably does support EPUB. Assuming you already can convert the .docx to AZW3, and since the capabilities of EPUB and AZW3 in formatting the eBook are very similar, selecting the conversion is the only thing you (or the owner of the iPad) needs to do. There is not going to be any additional considerations, beyond what you do for going from .docx to AZW3, on how to go about the conversion². ¹ One can argue that if the device/software does not support any of these formats, it should not be called an eBook reader.
² That should only be an a concern if the other output format allows for very little formatting control, like TXT"
Publishing blog posts as an ebook at Smashwords,"I can't speak for Smashwords, and this isn't legal advice, but I will say that none of the terms that you quote above seem to prohibit what you are describing.  I'm actually not sure what parts concern you. They require a complete work; that doesn't mean you have to publish a complete copy of a blog's archives. They seem to be worried mostly about books that end with an upsell, like ""Thanks for reading; to find out what happens to Joe and Susie, buy my other book for $99!"" None of the terms that you quoted prohibit publishing a book of material that you wrote that is available elsewhere. If the purpose of the blog posts selected for inclusion is advertising for your site, then 9b above is a problem. But if the posts are substantive in their own right, 9b doesn't indicate to me that you can never publish anything if it might interest the reader in other stuff that you've written. As for nonfiction, the Smashwords homepage has an entire category of nonfiction works. They clearly allow nonfiction as well as fiction. If you are concerned about it, you can always just email them and ask. If you are really concerned about it, get a California lawyer to review the terms and give you their thoughts (the terms are subject to California law, under paragraph 15b)."
"What does FlightCrew's ""Unable to find zip structure: End-of-central-directory"" mean?","That would mean your EPUB does not have a proper ZIP file structure.

Possible to transfer Adobe Digital Edition ePUB books from my local library to my Kindle?,"Your Kindle cannot handle .epub files.

Can you defragment a Kindle Paperwhite?,"To defragment a filesystem you need a software that does that. All you have to do to defragment the memory of your Kindle Paperwhite is to connect it to a PC/Mac and run a defragmentation utility on that drive. Edit: Being a flash drive though, as @Daniel suggests, it's actually not a good idea to defragment it, because there will not be any real benefit in terms of performance and actually doing it many times will shorten the life of the memory of your device. There is always something to learn out there!"

Is there a Linux distro geared to ebook users? [closed],"Greenie is an Lubuntu spin that works with standard Ubuntu repositories. It comes with a set of pre-installed apps for ebook readers and authors, including: The default language is Slovak, but experienced linux users will have no trouble installing Greenie and switching the installation and system language to English (or any other language).  Afte‌r installation, you will still need to use Keyboard Input Methods to switch the keyboard to your preferred language. I also had to add the Mozilla English add-on for browser spell-checking. Windows users can try a linux distro in a live session without changing their hard drive.  If you have never installed a linux distro before, you can find lots of answers at AskUbuntu that apply to any Ubuntu-based distro about how to burn an iso to disk or usb and how to do an installation. (But please note that Ubuntu-based installations such as Greenie are off-topic as such at AskUbuntu.) When you boot Greenie, the first option translates to Try Greenie without Installing, the second to Install Greenie. The easiest way to switch the language for experimenting with the live distro is to: This will drop you into the Try without Installing option, but with your preferred language as the system language.  You can then change the keyboard from Menu >> Preferences >> Keyboard Input Methods. (I have no connection to the Greenie project.)"

What software is used by the publishing companies to create diagrams in the introductory physics textbooks?,"They are almost certainly done in TeX/LaTeX.

How are Kindle standard pages calculated?,"There is a plugin for Calibre called Count Pages. It can estimate page and word counts for a given ebook, using various algorithms, and one of them is an APNX estimation based on Amazon Kindle. You can try to use it and perform your own tests; if you have a decent amount of books, once it has counted the total words of each one and estimated the page numbers, you can do your math and calculate the average words per page."

Are book trailers necessary?,"By itself I don't think book trailers accomplish very much; they have to be coordinated with other publicity/marketing methods. On the other hand, Amazon and Smashwords allow book trailers (with Amazon, you have to create an account on Author Central). So it gives potential readers a different kind of medium which can justify the purchase decision.  I have created one book trailer and am working on another. I have also studied other book trailers and have reached the conclusion that lowtech works best. Many of the book trailers seem way too polished and marketing-ish to convince me of anything. On the other hand, I have seen some book trailers in sci fi genre which definitely made the book more appealing to me. But sci fi is a special category, and the graphics/presentation for these book trailers were top-notch -- and expensive if you had to pay someone to do it.  In my opinion, book trailers are fairly good at building an author brand. You could just have a 2-3 minute video of the author speaking about why he/she wrote the book. If the book is nonfiction, the author could talk about what led him or her to write the book (that is always interesting). Keep in mind that viewers tend to judge authors by appearances or  manner of talk or dress.  Some degree of mystery can be good for an author.  Update: I just checked the youtube page for my 1st book trailer, and I see that in 2 years the video received 164 views. That's not a lot of payoff; on the other hand, a lot of self-help, business gurus do youtube videos to accompany their book and get a good number of hits -- especially if they are peddling practical knowledge.

Installing own font & using it to read ebook,"Kobo ereaders are known for their font customization capabilities. They have a dozen of preinstalled fonts, and a couple of them aimed exactly to dyslexic readers.

You can read a couple of reviews, here and here, that explain these features with pictures so you can see if this is what you need. On Kobo ereaders it is also easy to add custom fonts, we already have a question on this site that explain how to do it."
Can an ePub 2.0 contain multiple .opf files?,"I am not sure what your two .opf files contain, but the EPUB 2.0.1 specs http://www.idpf.org/doc_library/epub/OCF_2.0.1_draft.doc (section 10.1) say: The <rootfiles> element MUST contain at least one  element
  that has a media-type of “application/oebps-package+xml”. Only one
   element with a media-type of
  “application/oebps-package+xml” SHOULD be included. The file
  referenced by the first  element that has a media-type of
  “application/oebps-package+xml” will be considered the EPUB rootfile. 
  The EPUB rootfile (the OPF package file) MUST NOT be encrypted. This means that you can have more OPF files in the container, and even reference them in the container.xml, but only the first will be considered the primary one. (And, I add, most real world reading systems will ignore the others.) Note, however, that you can have multiple renditions inside the EPUB container: So, just having another OPF file is fine, as long as you list it in the <manifest> (of the OPF actually referenced in the container.xml). For any functional purpose, it will be ignored by the reading system. Comment 1: I still think that the EPUB you have been given is probably the result of some sort of experimentation, and having two OPF files is the result of some mistake. Comment 2: in theory, having multiple OPF files is a way to pack multiple renditions of the same publication inside the same EPUB container. The IDPF has a working group on multiple renditions: http://www.idpf.org/epub/renditions/multiple/"

What should I consider when purchasing a solar charger for my Kindle?,"I've worked quite a bit with solar chargers for Kindles. The main Kindle models I've powered are Kindle 4/5's and Kindle Keyboards (3rd edition). Let me try to answer your specific questions first, then I'll go into more background in case it's useful to you and others: e-ink Kindles need somewhere between 500mA and 700mA to charge effectively @ 5v DC. They have a battery of roughly 2000mAh depending on the model, so charging can take several hours. Most integrated solar chargers include some or all of: a solar panel :) These range from milli-watts fitted to the battery case, to several watts where the battery is often separate from the panel (but may be stored at the back of the panel). voltage regulators and convertors between the panel and the battery and the battery and the device it's charging There are various options available, depending on your budget and what you need. Solarmio provide integrated covers with an inbuilt solar panel on the front and light inside the cover. These are available for the Touch and the Kindle 4 http://www.solarmio.com/en/4712389290168.aspx (for the Kindle 4 model). I have 2 of these currently and they seem to work very well with no complaints from the end-users (schools in Kenya). Similarly, http://www.worldreader.org have used lots of these cases and they are reliable in use. I also use 3 watt panels which I connect to a generic USB battery-backed recharger. The battery stores the charge from the solar panel. From my testing of using 3 watt panels to charge Kindles directly (without an intermediate battery) caused the Kindles to hang and need rebooting, the charging didn't deliver consistent voltage (5v DC needed by the Kindle). For more info here's a blog post I wrote about some of the challenges http://kusaidiamwalimu.org/musings-on-solar-power-and-usb-batteries/ Picking suitable panels and batteries can be a challenge to find ones that are reliable yet cost-effective:
- Many integrated small battery-based units with small built-in solar panels don't generate enough charge to be usable (I've tested them in various countries including Kenya near the equator in peak sunshine).
- Similarly, most of the models I've bought have failed with the Lithium-Ion batteries swelling sufficiently to explode the case. These tend to be delivered from China or Hong-Kong, via eBay. I deliberately bought various no-name units to test their viability for my e-reader projects where I provide Kindles to schools in Kenya, etc. The 2 models of batteries I've found useful include a 5000mAh unit, I pay around £10 per unit on eBay.co.uk, and small 1800mAh batteries from Volt http://getvolt.dk/en/ (they don't currently sell them to end users, I happened to meet one of the founders and eventually obtained several to support my e-reader projects in Kenya). Here's a recent blog post about using the Volt batteries in Kenya http://kusaidiamwalimu.org/solar-powered-kindles-with-e-volt-batteries-at-nyabondo-school-oyugis-kenya/  I'd love to learn more about how other people fare with solar charging of their e-ink devices. FYI: I'm also going to be creating larger solar charging systems to charge tablet-based ereaders and devices e.g. such as Nexus 7 and iPads."
How do I make Calibre convert CBZ to EPUB without images shrinking or conversion?,"When you open the conversion window, before actually starting the process, go to the comic input tab, you will find a box labeled change images dimensions1. By default, Calibre uses the settings from the page setup tab to select standard output settings for the selected device, this includes that device screen size, to which the images are resized. By putting a custom value (in your case, the original dimensions of the pictures inside the CBZ files) on the change images dimensions box, you can force Calibre to use these values instead of the preset ones from the 
page setup tab. 1 - Or something similar: I'm using the italian version, the actual wording may be a little different."
Does .epub support inline links?,"Yes, you can do that, .epub books are basically made of HTML and CSS, so if you have knowledge of these languages, in theory you can manually build an .epub from scratch (but the norm is to use specific GUI editors, that help you with this and many other tasks). Anyway, like I said, it is just HTML, so you just need to set ID's and anchors: Example  First, create a bookmark with the id attribute: <h2 id=""C4"">Chapter 4</h2> Then, add a link to the bookmark (""Jump to Chapter 4""), from within the same page: <a href=""#C4"">Jump to Chapter 4</a> Or, add a link to the bookmark (""Jump to Chapter 4""), from another page: <a href=""html_demo.html#C4"">Jump to Chapter 4</a> Source: HTML Links from W3 Schools"
Does a screensaver serve any purpose on eink displays?,"Technically it isn't a screensaver since the images are static (unless of course the device cycles through images at regular intervals). Either way, e-ink doesn't suffer from burn-in, so it really isn't necessary. What a screensaver (we'll call it that) does do is show that the device is sleeping, so it will not respond to commands (either via touchscreen or buttons, depending on the device)."
"Why is Hard copy book black and white, but Ebook is color?","Obviously cost is the major concern, but often the importance of having color graphics in a printed book is overrated. For example, I have published a few print technical books with lots of screenshots, none of which would be better if the graphics were in color.  For example, a book specifically about css or layout or typography might not need color at all.  Yes, you're right that Packt and Oreilly typically use BW/grayscale graphics in their printed books, but I've also seen print examples from both publishers that are colorful. (Indeed, a lot of printed books about design are pretty awesome to look at).   When you're printing, you're trying to maximize royalties while keeping retail price low. When plugging in numbers via an online calculator for b/w and color versions of the same book, the cost differences can be substantial. One calculator shows it as costing 2x as much.  By the way, you have just described an easily overlooked advantage of ebooks -- the ability to include color graphics at no extra charge. I recently published a literary graphics with multiple interior graphics. I'm selling it at the minimum price (2.99) but if I sold it as print book, I'd have to increase the price so much that it wouldn't sell well.  (If you're buying a large number of print copies and  selling it  at workshops and conferences, the numbers  improve somewhat though). "
How to prevent Calibre replacing my cover image,"Calibre has had an option to insert a cover long before it offered editing some ebook formats. That option comes with additional utilities of finding a fitting cover using some internet services.
If such a cover is not selected, calibre generates its own and inserts that in the epub file. With the relatively new editing possibilities in Calibre, the cover still comes from this explicit selection (via the metadata editor). And any hand-crafted cover page gets overwritten by the ""insert cover from metadata"" functionality. That cover is actually stored along with the ebook and the metadata in the directory where the ebook is stored. You can probably just replace that there, or select the cover you want via the metadata change functionality."

How to install KOReader on Kobo Aura ONE,"I was impatient so I went ahead with the procedure. (Although worried about bricking a new device, I got it mainly to read PDFs and therefore really wanted to have KOReader up and running). So I will sum up here the procedure for first-time installation of KOReader on fresh new Kobo Aura ONE.
Note that this is just the procedure that I followed, it might change in future or not work for you. Off course, I provide no guarantees about accuracy of this guide. Please read the information in the below links for most up to date information. Prepare your device. Make sure your device is working properly with no errors. It's recommended to update to the latest firmware version. Charge the battery full and switch off WiFi. A prerequisite for installing alternative readers is the installation of Kobo Start Menu (KSM). The detailed instructions and the most up-to-date archive can be found here. Download it and follow the instructions: Step 1 Step 2 Note 1: You can always return to the default Kobo reader by starting the Nickel reader (press start nickel). Note 2: KSM is by default only launched every second time but if everything is working correctly for you, you can set it to be the default: KSM is by default configured to run only after every second reboot, and nickel automatically runs after every other second reboot. This is a kind of security measure in case KSM does not properly run after installation (something that cannot be excluded with future firmwares or changed hardware). After KSM has started the first time, please change this behaviour: Select tools > activate > set runmenu settings.msh > always The KSM should now be installed and working. But for Aura ONE (and some other newer devices) we need to apply also a patch. You can find the archive and instructions here. Follow the instructions: After the patch, you should notice that the KSM font is slightly larger (at least on the bigger Aura ONE). Now that KSM is up and running, you can install any compatible readers and utilities. This is relatively simple. Download the latest (or a version of your choice) nightly build from
http://build.koreader.rocks/download/nightly/
Extract the archive and copy the folder koreader to the .adds directory of your connected device. Safely eject the device and press start koreader to launch KOReader. That is all. I haven't encountered any problems and the process was quite simple, after I gathered all the information (which was the hardest part). On a sidenote: After brief testing, KOReader is definitely superior to the default reader for reading PDFs, thanks to its adaptive zooming (cropping) of whitespace. This makes even A4 documents readable. So if PDFs make big part of your reading, I definitely recommend it. For EPUB ebooks, I might keep using the original reader (a subjective choice) but thanks to the KSM, it is relatively simple to switch between the two readers. The main information sources I followed were:"
What are epub JSON links?,The reader should just ignore it. According to epub standard which says content should be valid XHTML or HTML5 and then  following the links through to the RFC 3987 for an URI section 2.2 a href begins with a scheme (e.g. http) and then a : I would guess that there is a reader that preprocesses a file and this converts the JSON to a link.
Convert/Send Standalone EPUB from PC to Kindle via Menu/Command Line,"You could use the Calibre ebook-convert command line utility. The following simple batch file should do the trick: (The script assumes that your Kindle is mounted as the E: drive; change the drive letter if it isn't the E: drive.)  Copy the two lines to a text file, save it with a .cmd or .bat extension in the same folder as the .epub files and then double-click it. "
What is the best way to read manga on Kindle?,"The fastest and simplest way is to use a comic book archive format. If you already have the image files, make sure that they are named with the correct alphabetical and numerical order (I.E. cover.jpg, page001.jpg, page002.jpg and so on); the program that you will use to read the comic will display your images in alphabetical order.
Then you can simply compress them in a .zip archive, and rename it's extension from .zip to .cbz. If you prefer, you can also compress the files in a .rar archive, but in this case you should rename it in .cbr.
Your ereader should be able to read one of these formats. Alternatively, you can try PDFtk, it is a nice tool for manipulating PDF in various ways; it is cross-platform (hence you can find it also in the Ubuntu repositories) and can be used to create a PDF from the source images.
I've always used it from Command Line, but on openSUSE repositories I found at least a couple of graphical interfaces, the packages are named pdftk-qtgui and pdfchain; I suppose that these should be available on Ubuntu as well, try to look for them (bear in mind that on different distros, the package names could be a little different)."
Amazon eBook Self-Publishing vs Major Publishing Houses,"Big publishers may have a more direct route they can take for submitting their titles, but they are still required to follow the same formatting guidelines and provide the same information that Amazon requires of any self-published authors who use their Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) program. The KDP program provides an interface that authors can use to submit and manage their titles to Amazon for sale as e-books. Basically, this interface is how the author (or publisher) provides all of the pertinent information for the book, and regardless of who is submitting it, that information has to be provided. I think the only real advantage a major publishing house would have would be in their ability to hire a staff that manually enters this information for each book. "
Web service that sends html pages with code to kindle,Have you tried Push to Kindle from fivefilters? I tried a couple of webpages with java code on them and worked pretty good.
Is there any way to get a discounted ebook if I already have the book?,"This would depend on the publisher, and as you mention, it's difficult to prove that you bought the book unless you bought it directly from the publisher and they have a record of it. Many publishers will offer discounts if you're buying both the ebook version and the print version, so it doesn't hurt to ask if you've bought directly from a publisher, but if it's from a retailer it's less likely."
Testing a reader's EPUB 3.0 support,"There is; EPUBtest provides a detailed grid of supported features by reader, app, and platform, as well as an extensive test suite for conducting your own tests. For example, as of January 31, 2014, Kindle for PC 1.10.6 on Windows 7 has very limited support:  Note: I have no affiliation with EPUBtest; I just thought it was a handy tool."
What is the most popular font style for ebooks?,"Besides a preference on the broad family of serif fonts over sans-serif ones (see my answer to your other font related question), I don't think that there is any set preference for a particular font type.
Often books from the same publisher tend to have a set of shared fonts (once they have bought licenses for some font types, it is reasonable to broadly use them, both to maximise the investment and to create a unique look and feel for the products of the same company).
Then, one must also consider that there are also many publishers that don't include any font at all in their ebooks; in this situation every ereader uses its standard fonts, unless the users apply their own personal preferences. Even now, serif fonts seem to be the most commonly used (my Kobo defaults to Georgia, and judging from online screenshots, also Kindle and other ereaders default to some kind of serif font)."
Is ePub3 backward compatible? [closed],"I believe you are confusing ePub2.0 vs ePub 3.0.  If I recall ePub 4 is for Google only.  If you are worried about older devices I would focus on validating your .epub file with a 2.0 validation tool. To answer your question if its backwards, yes, only if it validates across the board: Example: The reason is because an .epub file can be accepted by some as a 3.0 valid ePub ONLY and it could still fail the ePub 2.0 validation.

Is the Triton eInk display a viable option for future ereaders?,The Triton display is an E Ink display so it should greatly reduced power consumption when compared to a conventional LCD display. According to the E Ink website the Triton display has a similar crispness as an monochrome E Ink display. The price for the Ectaco Jetbook Color using this display is $499.95. However the price of future color E Ink displays could decrease.
Calibre viewer displays books wrong,"When the DjVu support for Calibre was added a few years ago, it was implemented by taking the  text layer, when available, and extract and convert that to textual material usable for conversion, by Calibre, to other formats. When available it uses the C++ based djvu2txt from the djvu-libre toolset, otherwise it uses a, much slower, decoding done in Python. That text layer can be generated when ""printing"" to DjVu, but it normally is built from the image material that you get when you scan files to the DjVu format. And the layer allows you, in most DjVu viewers, to select something on the image and then either copy the image rectangle or the associated text in the text layer. What you see in WinDjView is the image layer in your DjVu file, what you see in the EbookViewer is the text layer. The text layer has some positioning information (otherwise a viewer would not be able to associate text with a picked area of the image data), but most of that is discarded and only used to make paragraphs. When I wrote the original DjVu support for Calibre (several years ago), I did so, to make it possible for conversion as indicated above. I had no idea that this made it into the Calibre ebook-viewer. The ebook viewer should directly use the image data, but it obviously doesn't (and that is even less trivial than writing a Python based extractor of the text layer).  I tested viewing a DjVu file without text layer on a recent version of the Calibre ebook viewer. It shows nothing, which confirms my expectation.
It could be that the ebook-viewer just picked up the DjVu plugin by using the same interface as the convertor, that would make sense, but in the case of DjVu files that is not the right approach. IIRC there was no way to provide such a plugin and tell Calibre it should only be used for conversion (and not for display). You're not doing anything wrong. I would rather say this works as can be expected knowing the implementation, but that doesn't make it very useful for books that are not paragraph oriented. So in your words: it is converting the books to some basic format. And this is not easily/quickly fixed."
Publishing HTML to Kindle - Encoding problem,"Most likely your source files aren't properly encoded. It's not sufficient to add utf-8 charset declarations, you'll need to actually save your source files as utf-8 files. (If you happen to use the old Mobipocket Creator, you'll also need to save all HTML files with a BOM (byte-order mark). If your source file is an ePub, open and save it with Calibre Editor or Sigil. This'll re-save them with the proper encoding.  If you hand-crafted your book, open all HTML files with Notepad++, change the encoding to utf-8 and re-save them."

Did Kindle contrast get better or is my old Kindle growing old?,"Apparently E-ink does age due to various physical processes. There is
lost of contrast (greying), but also freezing of some microcapsules to
the black state where they are kept too consistently in that state (typical
for some parts of device state display which stays on-screen). I am not a specialist, but you can get more (layman level) details
on the web, such as the article Aging of e-ink screens, which come
with other articles on display technology."
How to automatically hyphenate before sending to a device?,"Hyphenating a text that is not in a fixed presentation (page shape, or
ratio page size/ font size) makes little sense as the words may change
position on a line.  Hence, I am assuming that what you are asking is how
to automatically do soft hyphenation, so that the reader of the file can
modify the font size and still get proper hyphenation where needed. Soft hyphenation consist in marking with a special character
(e.g. SHY) all the places in the text where a word can be hyphenated.
Then the displaying device does not have to know hyphenation rules,
which vary from language to language, and can simply use the markers to
cut words when needed, which may vary depending the fonts chosen by
the reader. Can this be done by Calibre. I never had to do it myself, but Calibre
does have a plugin that will do it. It is called Hyphenate This!
and works for AZW3 and for EPUB. It is described in some details in
this article of the-ebook-reader.com(with a download address), and is also discussed on mobileread.com. It can also be downloaded from Softpedia. From what I have seen in the files, the whole code is in Python, so it
is likely to be platform independent (Mac, Linux, Windows). Now, if the question was whether soft hyphenation can be done without pushing an extra button, I cannot answer. But the OP does not seem very willing to add more details to his question."
How to download ebooks from Kindle to PC?,"Calibre, on the other hand allows one to edit epub books, convert between file types and generally maintain your ebook library on your computer. You can then send them to your various readers. Some of those features require removal of DRM to do but there are many public domain ebooks.  "
google ebooks from linux to ereader,"For Linux you need to run ADE in Wine. On this page there is a pdf and a video that I made for my library on using ebooks via ADE for Linux users. FWIW, I had trouble getting ADE to detect ereaders on Linux ( ubuntu). Your mileage may vary. Good hunting!"
Hide a folder of ebooks on Kindle,"Well, it's a bit of an involved solution, but you could access the ""documents"" folder on your kindle via miniUSB/USB data and charging cable with your computer, and compress the book (and remove the original). Kindle will not recognize the file anymore, though it still contains the same data.  NOTE, however, that if the file in question has a duplicate in the cloud, the duplicate will remain accessible. For this purpose, I recommend Settings>Device Options>Parental Controls>Restrictions>Cloud (and an adequate password).  You may also want to restrict access to the Kindle Store? Just sayin'. These steps will secure the files on your kindle, but inaccessible by kindle;
in your kindle cloud, but restricted to those with the password. (Just tested on my Kindle 7th Gen.)"
How can I create internal links with Sigil?,"Well, it turned out that Insert->Link works even across files contained in the epub (and if it was really necessary I could use Insert->Anchor for inserting an anchor which I may use later). It is also possible to select some text, so that the link corresponds to the section selected. "

Differences and commonalities between publishing an ebook and a paper book [closed],"actually also publishing a paper book requires a store :-) Off the top of my head, here there are some differences: On the other side:"
Converting an sbrz file on a Mac?,"According to the FileSuffix.com website, this suffix is for the ""Sky Ebook Reader Encrypted Ebook"". Because the file is encrypted, it is not (generally) legal under DMCA to remove the encryption (in the US). And of course, as you certainly have already found, the Sky eBook Reader company only offers their software on Window. The format is not used by any of the major ebook companies, as far as I've been able to determine. There is a message on the MobileRead forum from the developer of the Calibre program that he has no plans to support that format. While a solution might be available eventually, it does not appear that one exists at this time."
Migration path for Sony PRS-650 notes,"The Sony Reader software that came with the reader has an option to export notes as an RTF file. I'm not sure whether or not you can import the notes into another device though. I'm not able to find a user manual and I don't have the software on this laptop (I do on my other one, so perhaps I can find the information later). However, I did find a blog that gives a basic step-by-step of how to export the notes: Export Notes and Highlights:  Plug the Reader into your computer with
  the USB cable, open the Reader software if it doesn’t open
  automatically, navigate to the book with the notes/highlights using
  Sony’s Reader software, open it, and then click the green icon on the
  lower left to export the notes as an RTF file."

Creating an eBook with GIF animations,We can integrate the gif format in epub3 packages say as a background to div container or another option would be convert gif to mp4 format.
Any way to increase font size in Moon reader when reading pdf?,"No - pdf's are statically sized documents.  One of the benefits of different formats such as EPUB and amazon's MOBI files are that they are reflowable and built with html and css. This is what allows you to adjust font size in relation to the container.   The text then reflows throughout the container at the new font level. However, you can zoom on pdf's and as long as the document isn't one big image the fonts should stay highly readable."
Converting DOC (with images) to EPUB,"Calibre is very useful piece of software for ebook-handling purposes, it has many options for converting between formats and generally does a good job keeping the original formatting and images intact. Also works for batch conversion."
Can a Kindle Paperwhite show metadata?,"The only metadata that is visible to the user in a Kindle Paperwhite is the title and author of the ebooks. Connecting the Kindle to a PC does only help if you synced your Kindle with Calibre's library, because in this case you would have in the root folder of your Kindle a file called metadata.calibre that would contain the metadata of your ebooks in YAML format."
Is it possible to use Amazon Kindle without signing to a non-free unlimited cloud storage plan?,"The Amazon Send to Kindle service has been around way before the Amazon Cloud Drive was introduced. Amazon automatically adds any personal documents sent through ""send to kindle"" to its cloud drive (which is included for Amazon Prime members and fire device owners). This supplementary feature would not be anymore available without an Amazon Cloud Drive subscription. Nevertheless the actual send to kindle feature is not affected by this change and would still work without such an additional subscription. Some months after switching to the paid subscription, kindle documents aren't any longer included into the amazon cloud quota. An extensive disucssion about this notification email and the resulting consequences can be found on mobileread.com"
How to make ibooks automatically break sentences?,"Assuming that you've got a reflowable epub formatted semantically, it should do this automatically. I've seen some conversions that used tables to lay out text rather than simply putting each paragraph in a <p> tag, and that can have the result you describe. To be any more specific, I'd have to have a look at your code. If you update your post with a relevant section of HTML and CSS, I'd be happy to do so. EDIT: From what you've posted, it looks like all the spaces in the epub have been replaced with non-breaking spaces. These are space characters that do not function as word boundaries, so lines don't break at them. They are represented by &nbsp;. There may be more going on in the chaos that comes from an auto-generated epub file--for starters, you might check to see if hyphenation is disabled in the CSS. One thing you might try is opening up this HTML file in Chrome and see if it looks the same as it does in your devices. If it does, hit shift-ctrl-j to open the developer tools, go to the Elements tab, and then select a particular paragraph that runs off the screen. The Dev tools section should show a list of all the styles that are applied, with checkboxes to temporarily turn them off. At that point, is just a matter of experimenting until you find the one that is causing the problem. If all else fails, the nuclear option is to just remove everything in a <style> tag and to delete the contents of your CSS file. 2nd EDIT: The problem is the &nbsp; tags throughout. If you do a global find and replace and turn them all into spaces, the problem should go away—it does in the browser, at any rate. The epub reading systems I checked your file on did not have the problem that you mention, so reading systems may vary. In general: Your file has been autoconverted by or through Microsoft Word. This is a terrible idea. If you need to go through Word, consider going into something better at conversion, like InDesign, or get used to cleaning up the HTML and CSS on your own. There are numerous other design issues throughout the manuscript, not least of which is that all measurements are absolute rather than relative, meaning that it is not possible for readers to change font size. You should also be aware that whatever did the final conversion did not produce a valid epub file, even taking into account that it is epub 2 instead of epub 3. Here is the result from epubcheck: If you have any further questions, please feel free to open a new question addressing specifically them."
Which does have the least glaring minimum-brightness backlight: backlit e-ink readers or tablets?,"I don't know every single ereader on the market, but my Kobo Glo has a lighting that when set at its lowest level don't hurt my eyes at all. Furthermore its screen is not backlit. Eink screens are different from LCDs, they are an entirely different technology and are not lighted from behind. Usually their lighting is provided by LEDs positioned on the side of the screen, so that the screen receive their light perpendicularly and not directly emits it. In fact, there are also ereaders without any lighting at all, it is a feature separated from the screen itself.  This way the light is pointing towards the screen and not directly into your eyes, resulting in a comfortable reading."
Is it possible to get rid of the search button (magnifying glass) from the bottom bar?,"The overflow menu is automatic and controlled by the OS (similar to the Action menu on devices based on the default Android experience). You can partly hide the whole Content Bar by making your app full screen but you can't hide it completely as it replaces the functionality of the home & back buttons on non-kindle android devices.  According to the Kindle Fire User Guide (on page 8, section “Content Bar“), the search button helps users search their content library, not search within the current app. Therefore, the search icon is fixed and it will take you to the platform search… unless you override it as described here (scroll to bottom)."
Avoid additional styling of images in html made by Calibre viewer,"Testing this it seems that this is simply a quirk of Calibre's ebook viewer. It adds the absolute calculated size of the image dynamically into the source. This size changes when you resize the window (with the inspector window open it shows continuously). Whether max-width and max-height styles are set by the viewer depends on the viewing mode. In page mode (default) these values are set, they seem to be needed for the calculation. In continuous mode your values will not be overridden. So this is just a quirk of that specific software. You can't change it, you can't draw any conclusions about the behaviour of other software; e.g. my Sony T2 doesn't set own max-width leading to pictures that are not completely visible. In fact I would prefer the intelligent behaviour of Calibre viewer here. FBReader resizes the image to a smaller size to fit it into the width. Sizes smaller than 100% or the current pixel width can be used without problems, Calibre does not ignore it in either mode. (Absolute pixel widths are obviously a bad idea in any case.) You can set the values to your needs. As different applications use different heuristics to produce a readable rendering you should stay as close to a semantic markup as possible to be able to ignore such additional output."
How does the 3G carrier designation limit a Kindle's use?,"If you want to use the Kindle to read PDFs then the connectivity to the mobile network is not relevant once you have the PDF documents installed on the Kindle.  There are various ways documents reach a kindle, these include downloading them over WiFi and/or 3G connections. They can also be copied directly from a computer using a USB connection (using a USB cable to connect the kindle to the computer).  Here's more info, in case you are interested in knowing more about the 3G aspects... 3G is the main mobile network protocol available in many countries. Some kindles include 3G support, others may WiFi only, and some support both WiFi and 3G. A 3G connection uses a SIM card within the device, in this case a Kindle DX. Amazon use various SIM cards in their kindles. The main difference is which mobile / cell company they obtain the SIM card from.  AFAIK Kindles with 3G connectivity & sold in the USA have an AT+T SIM card installed. In some countries Amazon includes a SIM card from another company, Vodafone. The choice of SIM card can affect which countries the 3G Kindle works in. There is an interesting article on that topic, which compares the 2 configuration of Kindle 3 Keyboard devices. Like you, I'm not quite sure why some sellers in the UK describe their Kindles as unlocked? Possibly it's to indicate that kindle might have a working connection abroad?"
Is there a way to push epubs to iBookstore moreover using iTunes Producer?,"There is most likely an API working between iTunes Producer and the iBookstore, but AFAIK Apple has not published it. It is of course much easier for Apple to control a protocol— and change if needed—when you control both client and server sides (client: iTunes Producer, server: iBookstore). This keeps development cheaper than with a published API and it might even allow Apple offload some of the work to the client side that they don't want to re-check on the server. If you are not willing to do repetitive work using iTunes Producer, I see two possible alternatives: checkout if any of the iBookstore aggregators (approved or others) has an API you can use. Of course a commercial service costs you, reducing earnings from the list price down from 70% when directly dealing with Apple¹.  programmatically drive the iTunes Producer application to do the uploading  using the Quartz Event Services². This might actually be quicker to develop than trying to interface with an API programmatically. ¹ I am not sure if any aggregators have an API available. Earning will  e.g. be down to 63%  using Lulu; to 60% using Smashwords ² I have done that kind of automation, programming the 'driver'
for the .tiff to .djvu conversion in a Windows GUI application."
Is it possible to add a Table of Contents to a CBZ file?,"Since the CBZ format is not standardised, there are some pitfalls if you try to achieve this. The best you can do is render the ToC as an image and add it at the front of list of image files contained in the CBZ.
Adding an extra file with the ToC information might break existing readers, if that ToC is not an image file. An alternative is to load the data in the file comment of the CBZ file. This is limited in size (64K IIRC). There is an effort for metadata in CBZ this way (using JSON) that you could piggy-back on. Disadvantage of a metadata solution is that there are no tools that currently display that information. A bigger problem might be to get the information that you want to put into the ToC. Contrary to analysing the text of EPUB files after they are generated, the individual images of a CBZ have little to form the basis of a ToC."
Kobo Aura One or the new 7 inch Kindle Oasis for PDF files?,"Ever since the time I originally asked this question, I have bought both a Sony DPT-RP1 and an old Kindle DX. The DPT-RP1 is really excellent. Thanks to its screen size, almost any conventional PDF book or article are perfectly readable.  But this has little to do with the answer. In fact I more recently bought an old Kindle DX because it was cheap and I wanted to try it. I am still amazed by how capable this old thing is. Its display quality is surprisingly good considering its age, and having a lower resolution than the DPT-RP1 has rarely been an issue. The Kindle DX has a 9.7 inch-screen so it is much smaller than that of the DPT-RP1. However, aside from some rare exceptions, almost all of my PDF books are perfectly readable on it. Issues arise when reading two-column formatted scientific papers where the font size is small and the original paper size is A4. These are the bane of the DX because you have to either read in landscape mode and constantly scroll using physical buttons; or zoom in and again, scroll up-down and right-left. So when most PDF files are formatted this way, indeed, as stated in a comment, the DX is ""barely tolerable"". I do not own a Kobo Aura One nor a Kindle Oasis, however, my experience with the DPT-RP1 and DX drive me to the conclusion that neither of those devices are good enough to deal with common PDF files because of their screen size."
Problem with hyperlinks after converting chm to epub with calibre,"CHM and epub are based on html files, but generally the production method for chm determines how simple the code is. Often the HTML files in the CHM files are made of complicated code which confuse calibre.   The first question to ask is: why do you want to convert it to epub? 1)Because you have one special file  you wish to read in that format or 2)eventually you want to republish (i.e., ""repurpose"") the content so that others can read it in an epub reader? or 3)you have many different chm files you wish to convert.  If you need it just for your reference, I would try skipping the step of converting to epub and just look for a chm reader on your device. Android and Ios have decent apps which can read chm files natively. That is always the best option.  I tried converting a simple chm to epub using calibre. Guess what? All the hyperlinks work for me. It sounds as if you are saying that the glossary for your chm contains all the definitions, and the problem is that every defined word goes to the top of the page (instead of going to the right part of the page).  My test files don't have anchors, so I cannot see what you are talking about.  To diagnose the problem, you need to view the source of the chm and epub.  The first step is renaming the epub to zip and then unzipping everything so you can see the html. Then open one of the files in a text editor (or open it in a browser, right click and select VIEW SOURCE).  You can also view source in a chm file on Windows. Just right click on the topic with a defective hyperlink, view the hyperlink and see what is supposed to happen.  From doing these two steps (and especially the first), you can see why the hyperlinks in the epub are not working. Perhaps epub stripped the part of the hyperlink that would put the target hyperlink to the middle of the page. 
Normally it should look like this <a href=""first.html#elephant""> where ""elephant"" refers to the anchor in the middle of the page.  Another possible cause of the problem is that the chm file might be doing weird stuff. Perhaps, depending on the authoring tool which produced the chm file, javascript is making the anchor (I'm guessing randomly here).  Another possibility is that when producing the epub file from chm, for some reason calibre removed the anchor references. If the glossary page does not have something like:  it will be impossible for the hyperlink to find the anchor on that file.  Calibre gives you powerful tools (like regular expressions) to rewrite certain code when converting. (although it may take you a while to learn how). If you are motivated, you can probably just re-edit the html files and make sure the references work and then rezip it again and rename the file extension to epub.   Again, without seeing the HTML source, it's hard to know where the problem lies.  But again, finding an chm reader to read the file natively would probably be the easiest thing to do. "
What are criteria for determining whether an ebook file is pirated or non-infringing?,"There is no real way we have had cases where major ebook places sold books that later were shown they did not have the right to .. e.g. Amazon and the copy of 1984 they pulled back see here An Amazon spokesman, Drew Herdener, said in an e-mail message that the books were added to the Kindle store by a company that did not have rights to them, using a self-service function. “When we were notified of this by the rights holder, we removed the illegal copies from our systems and from customers’ devices, and refunded customers,” he said."
Should a shorter Kindle file have faster word look up?,"Usually word look-up is done through what is called a index. I don't know exactly what kind of index is used in Kindles, but I know for sure that they do use one (indexing file can be found in the system folders in your Kindle). In general, indexes are made in such a way to minimize the time required for a look-up even when dealing with a great amount of data (search engines online are an example of that). This means that the dimension of the file, in general, should NOT affect much the time required for a word look-up. Now, considering that the elaboration power of a Kindle is not as the one of a PC, there might be a number of contingent factors that might influence the time required for a word look-up. Perhaps the two most significant ones are: In order to optimize word look-up in general you might try to go off-line (in order to reduce background processing) and to defragment the memory of your Kindle. This done, the speed of word look-up should be very similar for all e-books (with a difference of maybe some milliseconds)."
Calibre for metadata scraping,"Yes, a calibre plugin could do that. Does one?  Not that I know of! You could look at the Extract ISBN plugin (http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=126727) for an example of pulling data out of the ePub, and any of the metadata search plugins for how to then use the information you've found in a web search."
Why can't I download the same books to Adobe Digital Editions and Overdrive apps?,"Use your Overdrive account to authorize ADE: ""If you plan to use ADE and our mobile app, we encourage you to use your OverDrive account to authorize ADE.

"For Kindle DX Graphite, how to quickly add books to different ""Collections""?","If you add the books to folders in the document folder then you can use a software called Koll3ctions to create the same collections as the directory structure. I seem to remember it needs you to restart the kindle after using Koll3ctions, so I rarely use it for just one or two books."
Is it possible to disable screen zoom on a Sony PRS-T1 reader?,"Unfortunately, it's impossible to disable the ""zoom"" function. Typically it's not something requested in user experience, and a disabling function would cause more harm than good. What you can see are alternative options to avoid and get out of a zoomed screen, laid out in this guide. While the back button is a way of reverting back to default, you can also pinch (by placing two fingers on the screen), moving inward or outward to either zoom in or back out of display."
What CSS can I use to change the background color of an epub on a Nook HD?,well this looks like a html/css question the height percentage in the css also needs that its parent has height as well so you can try this. and use your #myDiv coloring.
Problems with ePub for iPad,"For iBooks issues, your best bet is to go straight to the iBooks Asset Guide, which is available when you log in to your iTunes Connect account. As far as cover size goes, the guide says: The book’s cover art must use RGB color mode and should be at least
  1400 pixels along the shorter axis. For best results, a good rule of
  thumb is to use an image that is a minimum of 300 dpi. This applies to the cover art that is submitted along with the book, not the cover in the book itself. For the cover in the book (and for any other image in the book, for that matter): Images (within the EPUB) cannot exceed 3.2 million pixels. Apple
  recommends providing images that are at least 1.5 times the intended
  viewing size up to a maximum of 3.2 million pixels. You can calculate
  whether an image inside the book file exceeds 3.2 million pixels by
  multiplying the height of the image with the width. Assuming that you're creating an epub 3.0 file, if you add properties=""cover-image"" to the <manifest> entry for the cover image file, the cover will show up in iTunes. As far as extra blank pages go: you shouldn't need any page-break-before: always statements to break your chapters, assuming that you've followed best practices and broken the content into one xhtml file per chapter. iBooks and all other reading systems I've seen will automatically break pages for each new file. What errors specifically did you get that went away when you changed the extension of the cover image? Without seeing anything, my guess would be that there was a difference between how the file was named and what it was called in the <manifest>. Finally: if you're going to be doing ebook conversions, you really need to have the devices you're converting for—every reading system has strange quirks, and you're doing your clients a disservice if you don't test, particularly on devices that you know they're really interested in."
Can I include code in .mobi to control the native voice synthesizer in a Kindle?,That is not possible in any of kindle eBook formats.

What are the actual on/off/sleep states for and how do you hard reset a Kindle WiFi?,"As already commented,  plug in the Kindle 4 to the wall or your Mac/PC.  Let it charge for a bit -- even 15 minutes will help.  Leave it plugged in,  and press and hold the power button till the screen flashes. Wait a minute to see if it is doing a reboot. When that probably isn't enough,  do it again.  I've heard the number ""5 times""  and I've experienced needing at least 4 times (actually, I wasn't counting).  The screen will flash, and after a few times of this,  it will finally continue past the flash and will begin a full reboot. After 4 or 5 of these freeze ups, I decided my battery might be aging, and started recharging it every night.  It can't hurt.  I also kept my eye open for a cheap spare K4, just in case."
Will Kindle 3 Touch cover case fit a Paperwhite?,"As far as I know, there is no Kindle 3 Touch. Kindle 3 readers have a keyboard and are therefore larger. Their covers will be too large for a Paperwhite. If you are talking about a Kindle Touch (4th generation): There are non-original covers that claim to fit for both, so your old cover should fit. On mobileread they do however claim that the Paperwhite is slightly smaller: The PW is 4.6"" x 6.7"". The K4 (non-touch) is 4.5"" x 6.5"". The K Touch is 4.7"" x 6.8"". An advantage of buying a new (original) Paperwhite cover is that It has magnets inside. These will automatically switch your Kindle on and off if you open or close the cover."
Indesign -> Kindlegen -> Kindle flattens TOC?,"It seems that the NCX is limited to two levels of hierarchy. I tested the actual hardware for the Fire HDX, Kindle, and Kindle Paperwhite. They all had the same results. Kindle for PC only shows one level. Lastly, I realized that the multiple-levels displayed in Kindle for PC (in a separate author's book) worked because the author (apparently) submitted a PDF, not an EPUB."

How to filter curse words?,"What you're experiencing is also known as the ""Scunthorpe problem"", which is caused by wordfilters going haywire. To make a long story short: Wordfilters do not work. They never did and never will.  If you actually want to remove cursing from any text, you're looking at a major programming task.  There is no short-cut approach that actually works. It needs a substantial amount of code to semantically analyse every sentence in its context to find out if ""cock"" actually refers to a male chicken. If cursing bothers you so much, I truely suggest picking your authors accordingly. There are tons of good authors out there who don't make judicious use of curse words. I assume there are more people bothered by this so there should be bloggers, forums etc. around giving recommendations. P.S. I find it funny that you seem to have ""Christ"" on your filter list. "
Merge PDF files,"For serious work with PDF, you can't stay away from Adobe Acrobat… still… You might also look at Nitro."
Reader for scientific papers - what should I look for?,"It's hard to tell exactly what is going wrong without being able to at least poke around inside the files you're having problems with, unfortunately. Just as not all ebook readers are created equal, not all ebook files are created equal. Images not showing up could be conversion errors as much as they could be problems with your device. It might not be a bad idea to check out the files on other reading systems (there are a myriad of free desktop reading systems, like the Chrome extension Readium, the Firefox EPUBReader add-on, and good old Adobe Digital Editions). If the images don't show up in those systems either, it's probably a problem in the ebook file rather than with your device. For scientific texts, I would advise that you check to be sure the reading system supports MathML, which will allow properly formatted equations to show up as readable, searchable text. Note that for MathML to work, the manuscript must have been formatted properly, and since not all reading systems support MathML, not all publishers necessarily bother with it. Since this is a chicken/egg problem, I'd advocate picking up a MathML reader and making sure to harass publishers that don't use MathML until they do. You can use the support grid at epubtest.org to find MathML-capable systems, but most of that information is geared toward tablets. For reflowing not working where there are formulas or graphics—do you mean that the images (and formulas that aren't MathML are frequently just images, to preserve formatting) aren't expanding in size when the font is increased, for example? That's something that you'll see in any ebook reader, I'm afraid. The best you can do there is get something with a good zoom feature, which unfortunately argues against eInk devices. Display size is probably the easiest single criteria to look into, though it's also fairly subjective—what's fine for you to read my be too cramped for me.  As mentioend above, zooming is going to be somewhat problematic on any eInk device, as the refresh rate for eInk is much slower than for a tablet screen. If tablets are absolutely not an option, you might want to look around for eInk readers with large displays; a quick search found me this article. Best of luck with your search! EDIT: Here's a good summary of which reading systems support MathML: http://www.mathjax.org/resources/epub-readers/"
Transferring books between Kindles,"When you connect the new device to your account, you will be able to see all of the existing books in your library. You can then download whichever ones you want to have on the new device."
What is the most paper-like display resolution for e-book?,"There is no display resolution ""where the text display is 100% indistinguishable to average human with 20/20 vision from a regular paper book."" In fact, display resolution is not the most important factor in producing text as legible as a paper book. Notice I used legible, not indistinguishable.  Start by reading Wikipedia on font rasterization. Compare that to offset printing, the process that is used to produce most printed books. In offset printing, the quality of the paper affects how much the ink spreads as it is absorbed into the paper. There's no way to duplicate that effect in a digital display.  The perceived quality of text display on digital devices is affected by the font rendering technology (i.e. Freetype, Microsoft renderer, Adobe's, etc.), the text rendering technology (usually either an HTML/CSS engine like WebKit or a PDF renderer), the particular font, and the type of display (LCD, eInk, etc.). If all the other factors are executed correctly, the display resolution is only important at smaller type sizes. However, higher display resolution are almost always better because they give the various rendering technologies more resources to use. "
How to write a presentation slide using pdf,"As Nathan Yegler already blogged: “it’s more fun to write programs to help you write slides than it is to write slides.”. There is a plethora of programs out there that allow you to make slides in many forms and there are books on the subject as well¹. From personal experience I can recommend starting with a structured mark-up based format for editing that is then converted to PDF and your preferred ebook format (e.g. EPUB). Using mark-up instead of visual positioning will make it easier to keep the slides consistent. Sphinx, based on the reStructured Text markup, can generate both PDF and EPUB and an extension allows you to embed your slides on slideshare.net. If your slides are going to contain mathematics formula, you might want to look at LaTeX and the slide generation package (beamer) for that instead. ¹ Edward Tufte has written a great essay on the problems with PowerPoint presentations, a must read for anyone making slides."
Alternative epub reader app for Android,"Aldiko, though not perfect, is by far the best ebook reader available for Android. It has full support for all ePub features, plus PDF, and has a reasonably nice UI unlike all the other apps. It has all the features you asked for, except built-in ColorDict support - however, you can ""share"" selected text using the Android sharing system, which allows you to share it to ColorDict. One extra tap, but it works. UB Reader also works well - it has the best ePub formatting support of any reader I've tried. But it has a poor UI compared to Aldiko. It has some kind of dictionary system of its own built in, which I have not tried. Regarding the other suggestions :"
Using Nook outside the US,"Yes, you can load ePubs from your computer. I've done this in Israel with both a 1st generation Nook and a Simple Touch."
Why are ebooks priced lower than their physical counterparts? [closed],"There are three main factors why the price can be lower. One is transportation costs. The second is the 'cutting out the middleman'. The third is the cost of producing the physical book. The physical transport costs and the need for human handling fall away if a book is transferred electronically. This is both the case when buying in a bookstore or from an online shop. Physical books often go through distributors to stores and smaller online retailers. Ebooks cut out these distribution channels and their profits. Some publishers even have their own ebook sites, eliminating the profits of the ebook stores as well. I hope the diminished cost of not having to kill and process a tree to make an ebook is clear. I actually assume (but have no proof) that electronic books are artificially expensive compared to their physical counterparts, based on the percentages of physical book prices I have heard that authors receive."
Where should font licenses be embedded?,"I don't disagree with the above answer.  I just wanted to say that on the Title/Credits HTML page (which contains copyright, date, etc) I included this line:  The HomemadeApple Font embedded in this ebook is copyrighted 2010 by Font Diner, Inc. under a Apache 2.0 license.  (and I linked to the license). "
Page flipping effect in eBooks,"Page flipping¹ is normally supported by a reading application (not necessarily by all). For this to be effective on a software reader, or specific hardware reader, the refresh rate of the screen needs to be relatively high, to be able to draw and redraw all of the intermediate stages of the 'flipping' page. So some ebook readers (I would assume most e-Ink based ones) will not have that kind of refresh speed. But tablets and desktop PC based readers might. In the former, no amount of JavaScript or Flash would help to get the effect you want. ¹ On a personal note: I have been forced to get these page turn effects in PDF files of catalogues of products. And it is a guaranteed way of losing me as a customer, if this cannot be switched off, and to make me annoyed customer if it is on by default."
Bulk conversion of PDF books to DJVU/MOBI/EPUB,"I'm not sure why you wouldn't want to stick with PDF but I recently just converted over 1T of EPUBS & MOBIs to PDF as I use Adobe Acrobat X Pro on a daily basis both personally, academically and professionally.  AniceSoft worked beautifully keeping everything as they should be and as it allowed me to set the margin size output for the final PDF. It will convert your files to EPUBS or whatever files you want. It is also capable of 100 files per batch and converts quite rapidly, especially when compared to Calibre which I had initially tried and found I could single convert quicker using Online-Convert (which is my go-to single converter for both work and pleasure). I was able to complete all of the conversions before the trial ran out.  As for DJVU, I found Online-Convert to do the best work and I use a 2cm border when I convert anything to PDF."
Can I only transfer files to my Kindle Paperwhite using the cable that shipped with the device?,"Additionally, there are some USB cables that are with charge-only feature. They have less pins, usually a lot cheaper or come with devices that are not made for a pc-device storage connection. For example, a Chinese cable for 0.99$ or a cable that came with a portable charger (power bank). I've come across quite a few of these in my life, they will not work with your Android phone also, or your camera, or any other device that needs the data transfer pins. [Edit] oh, and NO, the cable that goes with your Kindle is NOT the only one it can use, it's only the ability to transfer data with it that is required, as already stated by the other answerer :-)"
Is it possible to sell PDF as Kindle books on Amazon?,"No, Amazon does not sell PDFs on their site. If you submit a PDF to them via KDP, it will be auto-converted to mobi format for sale to Kindles. (As an aside, the fact that no major retailers sell PDFs in their stores is my primary argument for not calling PDFs ""ebooks"")."
How to hide/delete/ignore a specfic span type,If you have an html editor which supports wild card or RegEx search and replace like Adobe Dreamweaver you could delete these out of the source code very quickly.  See image below-  Also you can go to RegEx tester sites like these to form the most effective search expression for your needs. http://regex101.com/
If a publisher owns the rights to their own content does it become public domain if they go out of business?,"The publisher does not own the copyright unless they create the work--the author does. In traditional publishing, the author typically gives a world-wide exclusive license to use the copyright to the publisher, though many small and mid-sized presses will only ask for rights to the areas or languages they distribute in. If the publisher goes out of business or the work goes out of print, the rights generally revert to the author. If the rights do not revert, they may get sold to creditors or other interested parties to help settle the publisher's debts. If the publisher goes under in a huge mess, it's possible that the manuscript will become an ""orphan work""--which basically means that nobody is really sure who owns the copyright."
Known Issues with Amazon's Converter,"Kindle uses ISO-8859-1 format, not UTF-8. So there are a lot of characters not natively included in Amazon's format. I am Spanish and I find issues with characters like — (em dash) or € (euro currency). Fortunately, you can use their html entity code instead. For instance, the html entity code for em dash is & mdash ; and the html entity code for € is & euro ; (without spaces). Here you are: Amazon published a list of ISO-8859-1 characters in a gif image. This is my first post on stackexchange, so I cannot publish more than two links. This is the image distributed by Amazon (you can google it if you want to access the info by yourself): "
How can I prevent a widowed/orphaned header?,"According to this blog article, you should use the display: inline-block property on  a div selector that encloses your header and paragraph. Here is an excerpt from the said article: If you set the display property for a div to be inline-block,
  iBooks will display the contents of the entire div together on a
  single page, skipping to a new page if necessary, unless the entire
  div can't fit on a page by itself, in which case it will be divided
  across pages. It's simple and very powerful: div {display: inline-block} Here's a short document with no inline-block display. Notice how the
  header is separated from the paragraph that follows it, and even how a
  bit of the background bleeds through to the following page. Icks. The
  image and caption are likewise separated. Terrible!   Here's the exact same document with one div enclosing the header and
  paragraph and second div enclosing the image and caption. Both
  divs were set to display:inline-block. The result? Goodbye widows
  and orphans:   Where can you use this? As shown here, if you have a series of
  illustrations with captions, use inline-block to keep the caption
  right under the illustration. If you want a header to never appear alone at the bottom of the page,
  but always be followed by at least one paragraph, just enclose the
  header and the paragraph in an inline-block div. The article that I have linked also contains two epub files that can be used as a reference for these examples."
"Can a custom column with ""Date"" type be added to the tag browser?","Yes, you can accomplish that using SubGroups in Calibre. The way to do a subgroup is described here (for user entered Genres) but I'll do the TL;DR below for how to do it with publication dates: https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/sub_groups.html Create a custom column with desired lookup name (yearpub) and heading and give the column type ""Column built from other columns, behaves like tags"" In the Template box, enter this code: {pubdate:'test($,
strcat(substr(format_date($,'yyyy'), 0, 3), '0.',format_date($,'yyyy')),
'Unknown')'} Set ""Sort/search columb by"" to TEXT and mark a check in the ""Show in tags browser"". After restarting Calibre, go to Preferences-->Look and Feel-->Tag Browser and in the entry ""Categories with hierarchical items"" enter your custom column's lookup name. Now, what that all does is takes the Published Date data of that book/entry and puts it in the format of an hierarchical tag by decade.year which will now show in the Tags Browser under the lookup name you gave, then the decade, then the year. All without having to enter in any extra data! Just make sure the published date is correct. If no published date is given it will mark it as Unknown. Enjoy!"
Calibre to Kindle Book Transfer,"Increasing font size and spacing is a frequent problem for PDFs, especially for tablets that are 6 inch. PDFs are supposed to be printable documents, and so font size and other things tend to be fixed proportionate to the document size.  Merely converting to .mobi will not solve this.  If your original book were .epub, this is less likely to be a problem because it is based on HTML which is reflowable.  My recommendation is to try to read the PDF on a mobile PDF app instead of doing another conversion. Also, the larger the tablet size, the easier the PDF will be to read anyway. I have a 9 inch device where PDFs are generally easy to read.  Another idea (if you are desperate) is to try to copy the text in the PDF to a MS Word file, and then do the conversion from MS Word. Those kinds of conversions tend to produce significantly better results in Calibre. "
Is it possible to transfer my Wattpad books to my Kindle?,Some Wattpad files are epub format and other are jad format and the latter may be more of an issue though I did find a number of on-line converter claiming to be able to convert them - preferably to epub as I found that reading pdfs on the Kindle was hard work because they are not re-paginated or re-flowed to match your screen size. Personally I would suggest using Calibre E-Book Manager for storing all & managing all of your ebooks.  If you store them in sensible formats like epub it can convert them to a number of formats including mobi for you and upload them to your Kindle and a large number of other devices via USB.
how to properly declare metadata in epub3,"The difference between the suggestions from the source you pointed at is how you define the target element. You should be aware that a lot of the metadata options available in an EPUB 3 can have multiple occurrences. The above example is problematic because the meta element is trying to work on the dc:creator element, except there are two of them. Which one does it go for? You should use the refines attribute and the simplified version of the property attribute (e.g. 'file-as') when there is more than one occurrence of the target metadata element. The refines attribute allows you to specify by the id attribute of the target element (which according to specs must be unique). If you do not specify a refines attribute, and the property attribute doesn't refer specifically to a reserved list of EPUB 3 spec metadata (Dublin Core), then the meta element is deemed to be working on the publication as a whole. EDIT: In regard to what meta::property values are allowed have a look here: Archived from the original on epubzone.org here
Also, the latest official IDPF specifications for EPUB Open Container Format may be found here: https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub3/epub-spec.html#sec-core-media-types"
What devices support reading scanned PDF documents well?,"I read scanned PDFs on my Android tablet pretty regularly and without problems.  I presently use a Lenvo Yoga 10 HD+ (previously I had an Acer Iconia A200), but any reasonable spec tablet should do you. I usually use ezPDF reader, but there's a lot of PDF readers out there that work fine (ezPDF was the first that I found that performed well for most things I look at).  If you're trying to quick-flip pages one after the other, it'll take a second or three to go to the next one. If you actually read each page, though, you won't see that, because it renders the next page in the background. Things to look for: I find it's nice to side-load stuff to the SD card, and read from there. "
Adding blurb/summary metadata to an ebook file,"Anything that you want to actually show up on an ebook reader will need to be in the content files of the epub, just like any of the chapters or other divisions of the text. It is possible to include a description in the metadata of the book; this should appear in the <meta> section of the content.opf file and be formatted as described in the epub 3.0 specification. That metadata will not necessarily be visible to any reading systems, but it'll be in there. Note that the <dc:description> element uses the Dublin Core Metadata standard, which says Description may include but is not limited to: an abstract, a table of
  contents, a graphical representation, or a free-text account of the
  resource. So while there's some room for interpretation, it's not really the place for blurbs as such, which are generally endorsements rather than ""account[s] of the resource."" Again: if you want it to be read by devices, just include it as another section of the manuscript."
"What is ""Read an Ebook Week""?","There's a pretty lengthy write-up on HuffPo. Short version: For one week each year, Rita Toews, 61, a soft-spoken mother of two and grandmother of one, sits at the center of the ebook universe. Operating from a spare bedroom in her home in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada with her cat Lola by her side (""Every author needs a cat,"" she says), Ms. Toews is the creator and chief ringmaster of Read an Ebook Week, an annual international celebration of ebooks.... For the one week only, publishers and authors offer thousands of original ebooks for free and at deep discounts to encourage book lovers around the globe to give ebooks a try. It apparently dates to 2004. The domain in the article, ebookweek.com, now redirects to Valor eBooks. Not sure of the relation there."
Are there any Ebook libraries in Canada,"That's going to vary by the library system. Not all library chains support lending ebooks. My local library system only started that in the last few years. Even with the system that's available, there's only a finite number of titles available, and a limited number of copies per title. My local library also lends out Kobo e-reader devices. My local library is the Greater Victoria Public Library (British Columbia). Landing page for electronic content. Looks like the GVPL uses Overdrive as well."
Why can't I remove books from my device?,"It might be that the TRS-1 plugin for Calibre is broken, or that Calibre deletion is broken in the version you have. I would try to delete files outside of Calibre using the steps here, and if that works blame things on Calibre, file a bug-report and wait for the next version."
What is the most effective way to manage an overheated device?,"For laptops there are underlayers that have fans built in to actively support the air flow. You can position your kindle on such a board, or try to construct something like that yourself from old computer fans ( the ones for laptops are probably to big )."
Is it possible to take a screenshot from a Kobo ereader device?,"Yes it is possible if you change the code of your Kobo a bit. A broad explanation and functions is explained in this forum post on another website: Mobile Read Kobo. You must add the following code to the file Kobo eReader.conf, located in the {device_root_dir}/.kobo/Kobo/ directory: Then everytime you press the powerbutton, you will take a screenshot with your Kobo Glo. This image is then stored as a PNG in the root directory. Hope this helps a bit!"
Can Kindle for PC be downloaded without an Amazon account?,"You can certainly download the app onto your device without actually using it. But I assume you really want to know if you can open .mobi files in the Kindle app without an Amazon account.  And I'm afraid the answer to that is no.  The good news is that you can use other apps to read .mobi files. FBREADER is one such reader which works on both ios and android; you can find other android apps here http://www.androidauthority.com/best-ebook-ereader-apps-for-android-170696/ . They just can't read the .mobi digital rights management locked files.  Also, remember that .mobi is in many ways an inferior ebook format to .epub . If at all possible, I always prefer the .epub file to the .mobi file (and open them in Google Play Books, iBooks, Adobe Digital Editions, whatever). If you don't have access to the Kindle store, then you can probably find the file as an ebook in another store. "
Kindle app takes up entire screen on windows 10 and I don't know how to get out of it,"If you're in full screen on Windows 10 and on a touchscreen device (2-in-1 devices) and detachable keyboard, you just touch the bottom middle of the page and a menu appears. Touch the X and you're out of full screen."
Many sites propose free or cheap ebooks? Which are legitimate? [closed],"The short answer is that any website offering permanent access to large numbers of copyrighted books, for very little money, from multiple publishers is unlikely to be legitimate. HumbleBundle offers its bundles for limited time. Book Barbarian, ManyBooks, BookBub, Luzme, and no doubt many others, search the web on your behalf and find books that are currently being offered from reputable sites, like Amazon and Kobo, for little or nothing.  Almost all of their free books are available only for a day or two, but in any case to get them you will have to click through to a recognizable merchant site. Then, publishers like Baen Books offer a large number of their e-books for free as loss-leaders. You'll notice that it's highly unusual for them to give you more than the first one or two books in a series, and the rest will cost you retail. Another clue to legitimacy is if the site offers payment in multiple currencies: there's almost no chance that any site accepting payment in US$, GBP and EUR is legitimate, because very few books are made available from a single distributor worldwide. All that said, if a site seems too good to be true, google that site's name and the names of some of the authors. Odds are they already know somebody's pirating their work, and they frequently rant about those sites on their own blogs."
How to remove and add certain pages from pdf file?,"There is an online tool konwerter, which can be used to delete the selected pages you don't need from the PDF."
How do I ensure my Hebrew displays correctly in the Kindle apps and EPUB readers?,"I'd advise wrapping Hebrew-in-English in spans with the dir attribute set to rtl. I'd also advise following each span with the lrm element. See http://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/ As for fonts, pointed Hebrew support is now surprisingly good in the default fonts on a variety of platforms: Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle for Mac, Kindle for PC, Kindle for iPad, iBooks for Mac, and iBooks for iPad. One platform completely lacking Hebrew support in the default fonts is Nook GlowLight. So, see if the platforms you care about have okay Hebrew support and, if they do, consider just letting the default font be used rather than providing your own font. Providing your own font has its pluses and minuses. For more detailed help, I am available professionally: http://bdenckla.github.io/efs/. P.S. I consulted Meta Stack Exchange about self-promotion, https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/57497/limits-for-self-promotion-in-answers, and I hope I understood correctly that it seems it is within community standards to have promoted myself as I have done above."
What can I do about Sigil breaking EPUB3 files,"There is some hope on the horizon for the many users of EPUB3 files¹
masayoshi takahashi has presented a relatively small pull request with changes for the Sigil source base that does prevent Sigil from breaking the OPF file when saving EPUB 3. Hopefully the next Sigil release will incorporate these. In the mean time you can of course compile your own Sigil to include these changes, try them out and report any issues if you encounter them. ¹ The style-sheet facilitates in EPUB 3 support the top-bottom written languages, most Japanese EPUB Ebooks are EPUB 3"
Ebook content versus physical book content,"They are actually two different questions :-) In Europe, for example, sales are affected by the fact that (paper) books have a very low VAT on them (in Italy it's at 4%) while ebooks are taxed like most goods (in Italy it's 22%), so it may even happen that an ebook is more expensive than a book.  As for readability, my impression is that it heavily depends from the type of book. A novel, or in general a text with few if any pictures and which is read sequentially, is equally readable; for non-fiction books, where people tend to skim content, to return on a previous section, or to peruse the notes at the end of the book, a physical book is easier to read but an ebook is easier to search in; mathematics on an ebook is a complete mess, at least until epub3 will be deployed in full.  I read on Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think that Amazon actually collects statistics on how people read on their Kindles, but I don't think the results are public ;-)"
My Nook Simple Touch screen is no longer responding to touch reliably. How can I fix it?,"Over time, grease and grime from fingers transfers to the display and can cause touch sensitivity to become erratic. Simply clean the Nook display with a water-dampened cloth and touch sensitivity will return to normal."
How to tell if an entire ePub ebook was downloaded for offline viewing?,"I don't have a recent ipad and I rarely buy things through the iTunes store, so my answer is based on knowledge and guesswork.  When you first try to read it, the reading system (in this case, iBooks) will download the complete ebook if it has not done so already.  There is a simple way to test this. Open the ebook, and then put your device in airport mode (ie. no network or wifi). You can quickly check that you can get to the last page. I know, some itunes ebooks have multimedia content; that is a different story. In some cases, the multimedia is embedded and available only online (i.e., youtube). In some cases, it is actually part of the ebook, so it would fully be available in offline mode.  When I have downloaded purchased items from Google and Amazon, occasionally the download will be interrupted, but usually the cover icon won't appear on the bookshelf (or it may only partially appear). I assume iTunes does something similar. "
How to change text alignment with Calibre book editor,"You can use a CSS style to apply this formatting to all your text: This rule will be applied to all your text, so it will affect both regular paragraphs (<p> and <div>) and headings (<h1>, <h2> and so on). If you just want to format ""regular"" text you could try to apply this styling just to <p>'s and see if it is sufficient: Of course, if some custom style is already present for these elements, you can just add the CSS properties to the existing selectors. You must place this code inside the CSS stylesheet. Usually it is named stylesheet.css (but it can be different) and you can find it on the left ""File Browser"" panel under the ""Styles"" voice"
How to sort on books that aren't in a specific format in calibre,"I'm surprised nobody has responded in six months, sorry I haven't been here :-( I do this all the time.   You want to convert everything that has formats:""=PDF"" and doesn't have formats:""=MOBI"".  You can just put those conditions in the search box, or in the tag browser: You'll see the following selection string in the search box: not formats:""=MOBI"" or formats:""=PDF"". Now you have all the books that are either not MOBI or are PDF.  That's not nearly what you want, but now just change the or to and (or delete it—no conjunction is the same as using and) in the search box and you have all of the PDFs that don't also have a MOBI."
What is support of source code files in Kindle?,"No you cannot directly upload the files and use them. You would have to convert the file (with a syntax highlighter) to a format your kindle supports (EPUB,AZW3) and then upload those files. I would not use PDF, I still have to come across a converter that correctly does whitespace (significant in e.g. Python) correctly. Although you might be indifferent wrt that."
How can I upload my 100+ ebook collection to kindle cloud?,"If you use the Send to Kindle function, your books may end up stored as Documents. Kindle ownership gives 5 GB Cloud storage, so log into your Cloud Storage first and see how much you are already using (all your Documents back up here). If you want more storage, you have to buy it. How to do it? I'd use Calibre's own download to disk function to put them on my computer, locate the files and right click to use the Send to Kindle. Yes, 100 books is a lot, but if you want to send big batches of data, I'd check with Amazon Customer service first to see if there is a way to do that. I suspect not unless you submit zip files, since they won't want their system flooded."
How can you delete the books from 'Cloud' in Kindle PaperWhite?,"Aha, I figured it out. You need to log in to your amazon account from a PC or laptop.  From there, you will see all your personal content and be able to delete content. "
Collections Mangement of Kindle Paperwhite 3,"An alternative, which at least gets round ""kindle is slow"" is to use the Kindle app, on e.g. Android phone or tablet, if you have one, to manage your collections. The Android app does support the new-style ""cloud collections"", as used by the PW, Voyage, etc. The advantage here is that it is much more responsive, both in screen display and touchscreen behaviour and, with a tablet, larger with easier to see covers. It supports a multi-select mode, where you can select many titles at once, to add to a Collection. That's what I do, anyway: use the Kindle device to read, and the Android app to manage."
Convert fixed layout epub to fixed layout mobi,"This is a very broad question; I'll try to give you some general guidelines, but feel free to post more specific questions if anything in particular comes up while you're doing the conversion. If you have an epub 3.0 fixed layout file, you should be able to run it through KindleGen and get a working mobi file. The Kindle Publishing Guidelines are pretty comprehensive as well, and should give you plenty of information if there are any particular stumbling blocks. If your fixed layout is a graphic novel, you might want to use the Kindle Comic Creator instead; it offers some interesting functionality specifically for content with panels. If your epub is one of the old iBooks pre-epub 3.0 files, your first step will be to convert that into an epub 3.0 file and then go from there."
Help creating a toc.ncx file for compatibility with epub 2,"Instead of using Adobe DE (which isn't always reliable), you should use the epubcheck validator online on your epub file. http://validator.idpf.org/ You can download a copy of the validator tool on your own machine if you wish.  That will give you more verbose and  actionable error messages.  Here are some examples of error messages: https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck/wiki/Errors (unfortunately this list doesn't seem to be complete or up to date).  My guess based on a cursory reading of your file is that there are no file references here. Here's an example from one of my own files:  But your .ncx file has an empty reference; As for your other questions, let me say that I have never had to worry about toc.ncx file problems before ... mainly because I auto-generate the file from Docbook.  The meta stuff you have is exactly what I have; IIRC, it had to do with accessibility and spoken books.  In my experience, kindlegen almost always produces a working file for kindle if you have given it a valid .epub file. "
How to convert .epub to .pdb for testing,"There is an old program called TL-PDB. The original authors site seems to be here according to this site, but I have some difficulty reading the original. You can read about it here and here as well (download sites for free software seem to copy each others content). Calibre can generate PDB output (not surprisingly as MOBI is a superset of PalmDoc)."
Question about vocabulary used on itunes paid ibook application form,"You've pretty much sussed out ""frontlist""--the older titles, by comparison, are all ""backlist"". And yes, digital rights are similar to copyright. Basically (and IANAL), the author has copyright to the created work, and can then assign/give/sell some or all of those rights to other people. So ""digital rights"" means that you either have copyright, or the author has assigned you the right to publish digitally. So it's not quite the same as copyright, but it does mean ""yes, I'm allowed to do this"". Active print catalog simply means ""how many print titles do you have in current rotation?"" If you're doing exclusively ebooks, that number will be zero."
How do I crop out an image from a pdf file?,"This is not possible using only Adobe Reader unless you either take a screenshot with another tool or use the Edit > Take a Snapshot feature of Adobe Reader (may be version specific... I don't have an Android device to confirm, or know which version of Adobe Reader you are using). Doing the latter will require you to paste it from the clipboard. Another option is to look into using different software. A google search (or Google Play search) reveals many. For example, you may want to look into the PDF Utility - Lite. The description for this software says specifically:"
Embed a CDF file into an EPUB 3,"In principle a CDF could be embedded in an EPUB3 file, but it would not bring you much. You would need a reader that knows how to extract it and play it and those are currently not available. For viewing (playing?) a CDF you need to download and install software. This a problem for acceptance, a problem that Wolfram would have avoided if they could, e.g. by writing the viewer in JavaScript. Not reaching acceptable performance of a JavaScript based implementation of a CDF viewer is probably the most likely reason why this is not done, assuming there are no other technical difficulties. In this table you see how CDF compares to HTML5 and JavaScript, so it seems only a subset of the CDF functionality could be achieved by conversion to HTML5."
