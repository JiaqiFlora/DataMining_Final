"OK we're all adults here, so really, how on earth should I use a squat toilet?",":D I grew up using that thing. When I went studying abroad, I had problems with the toilet you guys called as the normal one (the sitting one). I literally wet my pants several times. Probably I should start a post about ""How to sit on the normal toilet"". Here are just some extra tips so you don't wet your pants on a squatting toilet."
How do you know if Americans genuinely/literally mean what they say?,"There is an essay which explains the difference between ""polite"" and ""direct"" cultures. First of all: For members of the Anglosphere like Americans, Britons and Canadians the Germans are using the term ""Angelsachsen"" (Anglo-Saxons) which is slightly different from the meaning in English, it especially has a more humorous connotation like ""Teuton"" for Germans. As it is used extensively in the original essay, the original author suggest the use of ""English speaker"" as translation, be aware of the difference. The essay describes the cultural difference between English speakers (polite) and Germans (direct) very well in German. I translated the essay with help from other people, especially the user Semicolon, because it seems to gather much interest. Why Americans (Brits, Canadians) do not say what they mean
translated by Thorsten Siebenborn with permission
of the original author Scot W. Stevenson, a German-American
  ""Hey, how are you"" asks an American -- and is surprised when his German friend tells him that his pet ferret was killed by a car. ""Just come on over sometime!"" said the Briton and is aghast when the German sometime later really stands before his door. English speakers do not always mean what they say; Germans, in contrast, almost always do. If those two cultures come together, there are some more problems than just the handshake [Translator: Short addition to the essay: Germans shake hands and subconsciously slightly bow their head, Americans don't => Americans are arrogant, Germans are cute]. Cultures from the Anglosphere are speaking with a cultural code which demands politeness. For example, it is considered crude to answer directly with ""no."" Therefore they use phrases that every other English speaker understands as ""no,"" yet do not mean ""no"". (Dear women: Some problems with ""no"" seem more influenced by gender than culture. I am sorry.) When a woman asks her best girlfriend if a specific dress fits her, should the friend be German she may answer with a grimace: ""You? Not really"" or ""I don't know if that really fits you."" An American woman would be more apt to answer, ""Wouldn't blue be a better fit to your eyes?"" -- which means you are looking like an anorexic scarecrow with a drug problem -- while a German girl asking would get the inkling that they are talking past each other. ""Eyes? Why is she blathering about my eyes? I want to know if my butt juts out!"" Other examples: During a discussion with Americans, ""I wonder if this is really the best solution"" means ""no."" Likewise, ""I'm wondering if we need more time"" or ""we might want to review some parts of the project"" are also negative. Americans are perplexed (or simply angry) when Germans, after a short reflection, respond, ""Nope, it's ok"" and simply continue. From the American's point of view, the message was clear. The rules are valid for the daily routine, too. A polite Canadian won't tell you that he does not like a present because it seems to him to be indecent as it could hurt your feelings. And that is -- we are coming to the central point of the story -- in case of doubt, more important than the truth. For this reason he or she tells you -- if ever -- encoded in indirect language, and because the gift-giver is expected to know the code, he understands and everything remains polite. Not without good reason there exist the terms ""little white lie"" and ""polite lie,"" which are significantly weaker even than ""white lie"": these are culturally accepted, even culturally mandated lies. This prompts the question of how Britons & co. react if they really like the present. In short: they freak out. ""Look, honey, I wanted this since I was seven, no, I mean, before I was born, wait until the neighbours see that, oh my goodness!"" There will be many, many, many thanks. This day will rest in his memory forever and he will tell his grandchildren about it and it will be chiseled on his tombstone, etc. If you are German and you begin to have the feeling that it's getting embarassing and you begin to suspect that your counterpart is pulling your leg, all was correct. While happy English speakers are a bit strenuous for Germans, the reverse situation is more serious. An American who gives a German a present is almost always crestfallen because Germans never flip out. In the codebook of an English speaker, a completely normal German ""Thank you very much"" is a sign that the present was not liked. The author needed to comfort several saddened English speaking compatriots coming back from a date with German woman: ""She didn't like my present! What did I do wrong? I don't understand."" Erm, no, she really liked it, but she is a German. They are that way. Marry her nonetheless. And now the part which may be uncomfortable for interested readers: The rules are still compulsory for English speakers in foreign countries. ""If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything"" has been hammered into their minds as children and so they will hold their tongue about anything negative during their time as a guest. Criticism as a guest is one of the most grievous offenses of politeness. For that reason it's impossible to find out what English speakers really think about Germany. If they are well-mannered, they will always say that it is wonderful. Amazing. Great! Any other response would be a catastrophic breach of manners on par with using the tablecloth as a handkerchief and chopsticks as cotton swabs. For Germans this is frustrating. After the guest has been in a new country for some time, the German would expect that there a things which their guest don't find to be as good as in their home country -- naturally. It's expected in Germany to mention such things ""honestly"" because it shows that you have a ""sophisticated"" opinion about the world and a cultivated and critical mind. People who find everything super, great and wonderful are considered dumb, gullible and superficial -- the last one is, not without reason, the leading German prejudice about Americans. From a certain American view it could be considered a compliment. Such cultural differences are known to most Germans in regards to countries like Japan, where ""no"" only exists in a dictionary because the communication police demand it. For unknown reasons they don't expect it from Britons and Americans. It's also not taught in English classes, which remains a complete mystery for the author. As an exercise I ask the reader to imagine normal German au pair pupils in London, New York or Ottawa. They will all be asked ""How did you like your stay?"" -- and every year, thousands of unsuspecting German children will run straight into the cultural knife. When Germans in frequent contact with English speakers become aware of the code, they're prone to panic. Every sentence and statement will be dissected: Does he mean it or is he polite? What do I do now? I want the codebook! You need to realize that you just won't know some things. A good host will always give the impression that life has changed a bit. If you cannot cope with that you need to follow their train of thoughts, put yourself in their position and trust your empathy. If you are guest, please spare your criticism for your diary and concentrate your honest praise on one point -- at least, as honest as possible. It was different means it was terrible, so you cannot escape easily. A rule of thumb is the principle I explained above -- behavior that looks like overstating is more than politeness (though be careful with Americans who live in Germany long enough and now know what to expect). There is a helpful ""three times rule"": If an English speaker tells you something three times (""Please come visit us again!"") or enough times that you are irritated, you can safely assume it is honest. One time means nothing. In the end you should know: No one expects a foreign guest to exhibit completely correct social behavior. Most Americans know that Germans are, erm, more ""direct"". If you don't mind fulfilling stereotypes, you have a certain leeway to handle things. If you know the rules or are at least aware of their existence, you could break them on purpose. The most beautiful German [Translator: His wife.] sometimes uses the introduction ""I am German, so I am sorry if this seems to be a direct question,"" which causes immediate blood freezing of every English speaker in hearing distance. Ist der Ruf erst ruiniert... [Translator: German idiomatic expression meaning that once your reputation is ruined, you can stop worrying about what other people think.] He advises that in addition to Max's answer about necessary included information in your interaction that repeating it several times is an indicator of genuineness. Three times is almost binding; once is simple politeness. Another thing is that in polite cultures real happiness and agreement are likely to look overstated in general. If the person in question does not change much from his usual politeness, it means nothing; if you get the impression that he/she is out of control for happiness, it really might mean ""Yes"". He also added that if you ask for something where a negative answer contradicts politeness (""Did you really enjoy your holiday here?"") you won't get an honest answer and you really must look for empathy. I will add some general information because the blog author is quite astounded that people in Western countries expect that other people in Western countries act the same. They do not. People in more ""direct"" cultures like Netherlands, Germany or Russia are quite simple. Yes means Yes, No means No. As noone is expected to adjust his mood for other people, people are looking sad if they are sad and if they are happy they look happy. What you are saying will be assumed to be true.
If you as ""Anglo-Saxon"" say: ""Just come on over sometime!"" it means that you literally invited people to visit you at home !
""Hidden"" No's are likely to remain unnoticed. A ""I wonder if this is really the best solution"" means ""I'm ok with that, but I think over if we can find a better solution later"". You will be ignored. For people from more direct cultures it is quite vexing because you are operating outside cultural norms (which can be in fact very different in polite cultures) and if you know the difference you must always ask yourself: ""Does he/she mean it"" ?
For people from polite cultures people from direct cultures appear to be rude, dismissive and obnoxious. A ""No, please redo this parts again"" which means in a direct culture ""Quite ok, but this part needs some polish"" is a complete disgrace and dismissal in a polite culture."
My name causes an issue with any booking! (names end with MR and MRS),"Airlines were early pioneers in communication technologies, and have been very slow to modernize. For example, today, airline IT systems still communicate extensively using TTY: Type-A for synchronous communication, and Type-B for asynchronous communications. There is a standard for TTY, which nobody follows, a de-facto standard by SITA, which is mostly followed, and many parties have quirks in their implementation, either not being able to parse some fields/special indicators, or emitting incorrect ones; everything you'd expect from a 100 years old format which grew organically as new needs and ideas arose. This is a pervasive theme in Airline IT, with multiple epochs of technology being used side by side as companies migrate very slowly. The airlines will swear that they received the name as A and the agent will swear that the name was sent as Amr. They are both right, quite likely, and the issue lies between the Travel Agency and the GDS. GDS -- such as Amadeus and Sabre -- generally offer multiple interfaces into their systems, from old ones kept for compatibility reasons to more modern ones. More modern interfaces will accept structured messages which leave no room for ambiguity; the old ones however... are full of quirks. In general, Travel Agencies are loath to modernize their IT: it requires re-training the agents, and buying new software, which costs quite a bit of money with little to no benefits to them. In the case of a Travel Agency connected to Amadeus, for example, this means that they are likely using ATE: the Amadeus Terminal Emulator, which as the name implies emulates the terminals of old. Check the Quick Reference Guide, p. 33 on how to create a PNR: Using a space, the parsing is unambiguous, however not all agents put a space, thus if instead the agent types: Then the command will be parsed as (NM, 1, ELADAWY, A, MR) to be ""helpful"". As mentioned, internally a GDS will use structured records. If you solve the data entry issue, and your first name is properly recorded into the system, then you should not have to worry about further issues. You'll need to double-check the agents' work. Just because they type AMR does not mean that the system will interpret it as AMR, as we've seen. They can fix the issue by explicitly specifying the title: NM1ELADAWY/AMR MR. Agents may not be entering your name in the system immediately, for a variety of reasons. If they do not, you cannot double-check that they did it properly. You may have to insist that they do it immediately. OTAs generally have more modern, automatized, systems. As such they are more likely to rely on the more modern interfaces of a GDS. Using an OTA may be a simpler way for you to ensure your name is properly entered in the system. Good luck"
Why are airline passengers asked to lift up window shades during takeoff and landing?,"I will answer this with a very long answer since aviation safety is my day to day job. The window shade opening is a part of a long process to prepare the cabin for sudden (unexpected) emergencies. Why is that? Well, cabin crew have only 90 seconds to evacuate all passengers in case of emergencies. The process of evacuation itself should not take more than 90 seconds regardless of the size of the aircraft or the number of passengers. So to make the evacuation possible in 90 seconds cabin crew and other airline staff will prepare every flight in advance to make this possible. One example is the emergency exits, only healthy adults are allowed to occupy these seats, they are also required to read the safety card for emergency exits to make them prepared in case of emergencies to help the cabin crew. They are called ABPs (Able-Bodied-Persons). This is just one example. Anyway, window shades opening is a small part of a long preparation process. Passengers are asked to open window shades before take offs and landings because these are considered to be critical times in aviation. Many things can go wrong during these times (most accidents do happen during take offs or landings), so people are asked to open window shades along with other things (seats in an upright position, people seated and buckled etc.) to make everything prepared as if the plane were in an emergency. In case something goes wrong (God forbid) things will be ready in advance so cabin crew can easily evacuate people in the short period of 90 seconds.  Specific reasons behind the window shade opening include: These rules might be different from one airline to another, but in general, almost all airlines require their crews to make sure of the window shades during take offs and landings. They also add it in the preparation announcements prior to take offs and landings."
"How to intentionally get denied entry to the US, without getting into trouble?","This question was shared on Hackernews and has a lot of comments and ideas over there that might be of interest to you as well. Some of the major points raised there: There are some other options like telling the border officer that you're likely to overstay, which will get you taken aside for further questioning, at which point you can explain your situation. But it would be better to find a solution BEFORE your flight."
Tactics to avoid getting harassed by corrupt police?,"I live in a very corrupt country - Ukraine. (Not that corrupt any more. See update below.) Let me give you some advice. This is the only advice I can give on how to avoid corrupt police. They often search for strangers just to get some money from them, because strangers are easy meat. All the other advice is how to deal with bribes and police. This is not a complete list, of course, but I tried to make it as descriptive as possible. To summarize, I'd like to remind you that your dominating behavior is the key. UPD as of 2019: In 2014, after Russian invasion, the new government was elected. A huge number of reforms significantly decreased the corruption level across the country. The street police was fully replaced, like 95% of street policemen are all new people. The on-street bribing has stopped across. You can now go to a police officer and ask for help, they would be honoured to help an overseas tourist."
Why prohibit engine braking?,"Completely different thing!  They are referring to the ""Jake Brake"" in heavy trucks, where the trucker opens a portal to the depths of Hades and you hear a very loud  sound, wrap the pillow over your ears, and call the Realtor in the morning.   This does not apply to regular old downshifting in a gasoline car, where you spin the engine to use your cooling system as a dynamic brake.   If trucks would just do that, nobody would complain.  The Jake Brake (or more properly the Jacobs brake) makes engine braking more efficient.  Normally a diesel gulps a full load of air (no throttle plates) and no fuel is injected when it is in engine braking. The engine consumes energy in the compression cycle but regains that energy in the expansion (normally power) cycle.  The Jake Brake prevents that regain, by opening the exhaust valve at the start of the power cycle instead of the end.  This instantly, and percussively, dumps a shot of 200-400 psi air directly out the exhaust stack. "

How to avoid drinking vodka?,"In Bulgaria, Russia, former USSR countries and others, it's considered offensive not to drink when you've been invited to, and you might need a good solid excuse if you decide not to drink at all. Expect to be on the receiving end of some good-natured banter if you decide to abstain completely. Medical reasons are a possibility, although it will be difficult to refuse to drink at least once with your hosts, regardless of your (supposed or actual) ailment. But if you decide to drink with the best of them, then you are expected to do so each and every time a toast is raised -- which can get you down pretty quickly if you are not a serious drinker. What you can do is just pretend to drink from your glass after every toast -- you don't have to shove the whole 100 g down your throat every time. Just take a little sip (maybe a little bit more in the beginning), and after the first few rounds the hosts and their guests will be in too cheerful a mood to notice you're not keeping up volume-wise.  Your glass will be helpfully refilled by someone sitting close to you when getting below one-third or so, so just don't empty it as quickly. There's always more where that came from.  There's a whole culture of proper drinking in Eastern Europe, so here are some generic drinking tips that will help you a lot if you are drinking only occasionally:  Good luck, and Наздраве!"
I don't know my nationality. How can I visit Denmark?,"From your description it appears that you are stateless -- that is, no country recognizes you as its citizen. That makes international travel difficult, but what's generally supposed to happen is that the country where you're legally resident (that is, the United States) can issue you a passport-like document which can serve as an identification document while traveling but does not declare you to be a citizen of anywhere. In most of the world this would be known as a ""1954 convention travel document"", but the US is not party to the 1954 Convention. Instead the USCIS can issue something called a U.S. Re-entry Permit, which a number of countries, including Denmark, recognize as equivalent to a 1954 convention document. [Beware: As of 2017-04-09, the official lists of travel documents accepted by Schengen member states indicate that Denmark does not recognize US ""permits to re-enter"" but does recognize US ""refugee travel documents"". They are the same kind of booklet, but have different heading above the photo. There are different boxes you need to check on form I-131 when applying.] After getting a re-entry permit you will still need to apply for a Danish visa, since you're not a U.S. citizen (who are visa-free in the Schengen area). On the visa application form, you would put ""stateless"" as your nationality and check ""other travel document"" rather than ""ordinary passport"". You would need to support your visa application with extra good evidence of ties with the US that motivate you to leave the Schengen area after your proposed trip (a green card is a good start here, but by no means sufficient), and having spent your childhood here is not going to make it easier. But it's not categorically impossible. In the long run it would probably be in your interest to pursue naturalization as a U.S. citizen."
"When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?","I think the current usual solution is to get a debit card (or failing that a credit card) with low/no foreign transaction and cash withdrawal fees. (In the UK, the Halifax Clarity Card is the best for this at the moment) Then, when you get to the country, take out cash periodically. Not too much in case of issues, but don't assume you can do it too often as you may not always be able to find a cash machine depending on where you are. It's worth getting a little bit of currency before you go (if you don't have it left over from another trip), so you can buy a coffee while you wait for everyone who got off the plane quicker than you to finish using the cash machine at the port/airport/station! Edit: Since you've said you're in the US, I can't suggest the best card for you to get to avoid/minimise foreign transaction fees, but asking on the personal finance SE site is likely the best bet for finding out what that card is."
"OK, we are all adults here, so what is a bidet for and how do I use it?","The bidet is a sanitary installation which looks like a shallow toilet bowl with water taps. The purpose of the bidet is to clean up after you've done what you came to do in the toilet. The rationale here is that sometimes toilet paper isn't enough and you can't always shower after you went to the toilet. Enters: the bidet. I feel like I have to mention this: the bidet is not a toilet. You go to the toilet first and then you use a bidet. The way a bidet works is fairly intuitive: you get tempered water and a piece of soap and you clean yourself. Like a targeted shower, if you will.  There are two ways you can sit on a bidet: The way you sit depends on what you want to clean up, and also on the way you feel more comfortable. Below is a picture of a person straddling a bidet facing towards the taps: 
Image courtesy of WikiHow, CC-by-SA You might need to remove your trousers to sit in this way. Having found your seating comfort you are now ready to turn on the water. You'll want to do this slowly so as to control the jet strength and the temperature. Once you are satisfied with both you start washing yourself using whichever cleaning product you require. When washing yourself you can either fill the bowl and splash water on your body or use the water stream directly. This will depend on personal preference. Some bidets have nozzles you can use to direct the water flow (top left). Others don't and sometimes provide holes from which flows a weak water jet (top right). Some have a vertical spray nozzle (bottom left) which is commonly used to clean the anal region. A more technological bidets can be integrated in the toilet bowl in the form of a water nozzle (bottom right). Below are pictures of these types of bidets: 


 To avoid any surprises turn on the water slowly and cover the jet with your hand so as to get a warning before the water hits you. When you are done washing you can either use a towel or toilet paper to dry yourself.  Here is a nice instructable video on how to use a bidet. You can also find a text-based guide here. For completeness sake, note that you can also use bidets to soak and clean your feet. To do this you lower the toilet seat lid, sit on that, and put your feet in the bidet, provided the two are installed close together."
Took airline plane blanket by accident; didn't realize it was forbidden. What should I do?,"To avoid any lingering feelings of guilt, you can call the airline and ask them what they'd like you to do with the blanket.  Explain that you took it by mistake because you were not fully alert when you left the aircraft. Most likely, they'll tell you to keep it, because it would cost more for them to receive it in the mail and return it to the blanket pool than it would simply to buy a new blanket.  But if you have their explicit instructions to keep it then you won't have to worry about anything.  Furthermore, in the (less likely) event that they do ask you to send it back, you can send it back, which will also relieve you of any lingering guilt. You can find out how to get in touch with them at https://www.aerlingus.com/support/contact-us."

Which museums have artworks of all four Ninja Turtles' namesakes?,"It seems that the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC has works by all four artists in their permanent collections, but for Michelangelo they may only have some simple drawings. I don't know if they are all on display though. I came to this conclusion by using the website artsy.net. There you can look up individual artist and it will give a list of artworks by them, which can be sorted by institution. I did this for all four of them and there were several who had Leonardo, Michelangelo and Rapahel, but Donatello seemed to be the ""bottleneck"". Here is what I found for the National Gallery of Art: All works by all artists are of course not listed on this website, so there may very well be other institutions that also have works by all four artists. Update: After reading @Pere's answer, I realized it might be possible to find information about which works are on display on the museum's website. Here is what I found: So you probably cannot visit the museum and see originals by all four artists on display."
Passing through airport security with autism,"I understand that logic doesn't always help in times of stress, but the first thing I want to assure you is that people are not going to run off with your things. This is something we all worry about but that essentially never happens. The folks who manage the checkpoint are monitoring and your things are not out there without you for more than a few seconds. Second, you mention that your plush helps you. Could you procure a small square of plush fabric? You could keep this in your pocket - there's no requirement that your pockets be empty, merely that they be empty of metal. Fabric alone will not set off any detectors and you can put your hands in your pocket and calm yourself if you have to wait a moment before you go through the scanner. Third, forget the people behind you. The pressure you feel is not really from them. You owe them no obligation. They are waiting, they have their own issues, but they will never say ""great trip today, the guy in front of me in the security line was so quick!"" What's more, if such a person existed, they would say that about you because you're not pulling things out of 4 different bags and pockets, having to go through the scanner twice because you left your keys in your pockets, and so on. You're already faster than most of the people in the line. You have no obligation to set some sort of land speed record by not hesitating, not waiting with your stuff (I do that), or just walking at the pace you prefer. Fourth, reward yourself for completing this worst part of the journey. Whether it's an expensive coffee, a magazine, a bar of chocolate -- buy something fun and frivolous right after the security check. Something you wouldn't normally get yourself. The day may come when you're planning a trip and find yourself looking forward to that dark-chocolate-and-orange bar waiting for you on the other side of security."

"Canadian citizen, on US no-fly list. What can I do in order to be allowed on flights which go through US airspace?","As you've discovered, US regulations apply not just to flights to or from the US, but also to flights that pass over the US.  Before such flights the airline will send APIS data (basically the details of the everyone on the flight) to the US Government, who can flag certain passengers as appears to have happened here. Your only real recourse is to apply to the US Department of Homeland Security Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP).  This will trigger the DHS to investigate you specifically, and if they determine that you should not have been blocked from boarding (which could be as simply as them confusing you with someone else, poor data on their behalf, etc) then they will remedy this. As a part of the TRIP process you will be given a ""Redress number"" which can be used on future bookings, and will allow the government to match up your TRIP application and determination with your flight. Of course, it's very possible that the DHS will determine that you are on a blacklist, and that fact is justified, in which case there's really nothing more that can be done."
Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?,"TL;DR:  If you know you're going, and there's a fare you can afford, book it. Waiting will almost never save you money, and never enough to offset paying double or triple the cheapo fare because you waited too long. Detailed explanation, with pictures:
The problem is that there is no single ""the price"" that goes up and down. On any given flight you can buy as many as a dozen different tickets, each at a different price. They carry different privileges -- eligible to earn frequent flyer miles, lower change fees, lounge access, seat selection included, less credits needed to upgrade, free meal, etc -- depending on the airline. Often, some or all of those privileges mean very little to you and you will just buy the cheapest one. When all of the absolutely cheapest ones are gone, you have to buy the next most expensive class, and that means you will pay more. So how do prices go up? By the cheapest seats getting bought. How do they go down? By those seats being cancelled and returned to the pool (unlikely, since they have high change fees and are bought by people who have firm plans), by discount codes or overall ""seat sales"" being issued, or by seats being moved from one class to another. That last thing is called ""yield management"" and it is what some very smart people do for a living. They don't want a plane to go out with an empty seat (getting $0 for it) but they don't want to sell it to you 3 months in advance for $200 if somebody with an urgent need to travel would pay $1500 for it the week of the flight. So they might decide to move an unsold seat from the $1500 fare class to the $200 fare class, but only if they are sure that's the only way they'll sell it. You can see that they can go out with an empty seat 5 times, and the 6th time sell the seat for a premium, and still be ahead overall. They are pretty good at guessing how many ""urgent needs"" are likely to arise in a given week. And trust me, the holiday season is rich in ""urgent needs"". The chances of cheaper seats being available right when everyone wants to fly are slim to none. There are ways to watch the fare classes on a given flight. For example Air Canada offers Tango, Tango Plus, Latitude, Discount Business, and Business. Tango and Tango plus actually have some smaller fare classes inside them. If you look at a random city pair on a random day, you will see something like this:  You can see that already, on many of the flights, all of the Tango fares are gone. There are clearly two prices for Tango, and only one flight has the cheaper one left. Similarly there are 3 prices for Tango Plus. And so on. As it gets closer and closer, fares will disappear from some flights. Over time, you can get familiar with the patterns between two cities. You might notice that the 7am flight is alway last to lose its cheap fares, and wait till you see a pattern like this one before you buy. As always, it helps to be unusual. If you prefer a flight at a time of day most people don't (like 7am) you can pay less. If you aren't trying to fly the Friday before Xmas, you'll pay less. And so on. But look at the difference between Tango and Tango plus here. When all that's left is $597 fares on every flight, they can have a 20% off sale and bring it down to $477 - but you would have been better off with $364 in the first place.  If you know you're going, and there's a fare you can afford, book it. Waiting will almost never save you money, and never enough to offset paying double or triple the cheapo fare because you waited too long. Update Nov 7th, two weeks later: Look what has now happened to that same YYZ-YVR flight on the same date, Dec 23rd:  Every flight has gone up dramatically, except (for some strange reason) for the last flight of the day. Waiting a few weeks to book would have cost you hundreds of dollars.  Let's also look at a flight two weeks later (the same distance from today as my first set of prices, but not a holiday)   See how much cheaper those Dec 23rd flights might have been before Oct 23rd, when I took the first screenshot? The cheapest is 229 (each way, before taxes and addons, but that's not the point) while today the cheapest for the 23rd is 374, almost double, and if landing at 1am Vancouver time, 4 am body time, doesn't seem feasible then it's going to be $607, almost triple. Ouch. I see no benefit to waiting... but I plan to update this answer again in a few weeks :-) Update Nov 24th, two-and-a-bit weeks closer to Xmas: Still looking at YYZ-YVR on Friday Dec 23rd, same airline:  Now it's really awful. The cheapest is $607, in fact some of the economy classes now being sold cost more than sitting in business class would cost! Again let's advance to some point as far away from now as Dec 23rd was when I started this.  Say Jan 23rd.   Wow! Now some flights are as little as $199! Notice also that there are two less flights on Jan 23rd than on Dec 23rd. The airline has added as much capacity as it can for the route on the popular day - the tickets just keep getting bought! Update Dec 16th: So now it's less than two weeks to that Dec 23rd flight home for Xmas. What bargains has the waiter achieved?  The lowest possible price is still $607, so there hasn't been much lost by waiting. And that last flight of the day has become cheaper somehow. Some particular flights are cheaper (the noon flight has gone down $100) than they were Nov 24th. But they are ALL far more expensive than they were in late October. I think for the case of Xmas, if I had a time preference, having left it to one-month-before I might try to gut it out to two-weeks-before in the hope of getting my preferred time. But the smart thing to have done was to book two-months-before, or more. $607 might look good compared to $1279 (all these prices are one way before fees and taxes) but it's actually brutally high considering you would normally see $199 or less one way before fees and taxes for that city pair. Remember, too, that this is not the airline ripping you off because it's Xmas. They always had $604 tickets and $1279 tickets on sale for every flight every day. Normally speaking, people don't buy those tickets. That's the difference. Other people beat you to the $199 ones. Update Dec 21st: I think this is as last minute as anyone would dare. How are we looking?  The cheapest price has not changed, it's still $607, and there are still 5 times of day you can get that price, though they have swapped around a bit.  Final update, 11m eastern Dec 23rd: Believe it or not, they sold them all:  Some people REALLY needed to fly today, I guess."
"Airline reservations require name to exactly match passport, but won't allow entering name that way","Many of the systems involved in air ticketing have been around for 50 years or more, and definitely show their age as you've seen... The good news is that these restrictions are very well known, and there are standard ways to work around them. The Hyphen.  This one is simple - just leave it out. ABC-DEF and ABCDEF are treated as exactly equivalent according to the rules.  The fact the passport has the former whilst the ticket has the latter is NOT an issue. The length.  Presuming the issue here comes down to the middle name only, then the easiest is to simple leave it out.  Whilst the name on the ticket must match the passport, than requirement does NOT apply to the middle name which can be either omitted completely, shortened to a single initial, or shortened to the number of characters require to meet the maximum length.   eg, if the middle name was Jonathan, then all of """" (ie, nothing), ""J"", or ""Jonat"" would be considered valid. Note that at Check-in there will almost certainly be different requirements.  Depending on the countries being traveled to/from/through, you may need to provide the full name, including middle name.  If this is required, you will be able to enter it on the airlines website in advance (often under the heading of ""APIS""), at online check-in, or at the airport check-in."
Should I submit bank statements when applying for a UK Visa? What do they say about me?,"At first principles bank statements show that the applicant has the financial capacity to visit the UK. However there is a lot more to it and it's not just about the current balance.  Bank statements help the decision-maker understand the applicant's personal circumstances... Stability and lifestyle, most importantly regular cash flows in to the account from employment. The relationship between the applicant's cash flows and their stated employment. Sources of income that will be paid in to the account while the applicant is visiting the UK. The consistency of the applicant's lifestyle to their proposed maintenance and accommodation in the UK during their visit.  Sources of income from the applicant's family and any financial commitments between family members that demonstrate closeness to family. If the applicant is using a sponsor, a history of support, i.e., regular deposits that can improve the sponsor's credibility and willingness to support the applicant. Ongoing financial commitments the applicant has such as rent or mortgage payments. Ongoing expenditures for food, utilities, transportation and so on. That all income has been lawfully generated and are actually available to the applicant during their visit. Ongoing support and maintenance for the applicant's dependants, especially those who are not travelling with the applicant. Irregular cash flows and sudden changes in the account balance that may indicate the applicant is using a funds parking strategy.   And most importantly, the applicant's connections to the local economy and society along with connections to the applicant's family. Bank statements that exhibit two or more of these characteristics will be more successful than those that do not. While there is no strict rule about how many statements are needed, it's plain to see that with more statements the decision-maker will be able to see the patterns.  The rule of thumb is six statements over a period of six months and the six month period should end with the most recent statement prior to submitting the application. Some people can establish most of the above with three to six months of account history, but first-time applicants and those with borderline cases should submit more.  Note: successful applicants will have two or more of these considerations clearly shown. Nobody will be able to get all of them. What all of this amalgamates to is that it works to the applicant's favour to submit as many bank statements as possible so that the decision-maker will be able to detect clear cash flow patterns.  This applicant is gainfully employed and has ongoing expenditures that indicate close ties to the local economy. The applicant has been saving money for their visit. This is an ideal case and the applicant has great chances for success.   These statements show an irregular cash flow which has shifted the existing balances upward.  It is impossible to detect any ongoing commitments that show a strong connection to the local economy. These applicants can expect problems despite having impressive balances on the most recent statement(s).  The refusal notice will say something like: ...I am not satisfied that these funds are actually available to you... or more worryingly: ...I am not satisfied that you have accurately presented your circumstances and therefore your intentions in applying to enter the United Kingdom... To repeat: it's not just about the ending balance. They are also looking for the history of flows in and out of the account. ""...of course I included a bank statement! But they ignored it and refused me...""  People who fear that their history make reveal a weakness will sometimes resort to an 'opacity strategy', where they submit a single statement or several statements from a broken series, or simply too few statements. This strategy is both naive and disastrous because the decision-maker cannot get a clear understanding of the the applicant's circumstances and will suspect the applicant is hiding something.  The inevitable refusal notice will closely track those for 'Funds Parking' but with an increased element of suspicion added. As a general rule of thumb, it is better to provide a complete picture than to leave the decision-maker with the impression that you are trying to hide something.  Bona fide visitors to the UK will be transparent about their circumstances when there is a need to be so.  This series shows that the applicant is gainfully employed and has ongoing commitments, but the balance is dipping into the negative every month. The applicant is having difficulty meeting their day-to-day cash requirements and wanting to visit the UK with these circumstances is out-of-whack with their lifestyle; this is to say that the applicant's intentions are suspect. The applicant is not in stable circumstances and they can expect significant obstacles even with a sponsor.  The refusal notice will say something like: ...I am not satisfied that you meet the immigration rules on this occasion... If a cosponsor is offering to provide support, the refusal notice might make a comment like: ...I acknowledge your sponsor proposes to pay for your visit, however, it is the circumstances of the applicant that remain paramount when assessing your application... or worse: ...however whilst I take that into account in assessing your proposed maintenance and accommodation in the UK, that is only one aspect of the visitor rules and this sponsorship does not satisfy me of your own intention to leave the UK on completion of your visit... ""They totally ignored the £4,000 in my bank account and refused me!""   Both of these exhibits show that the applicant's most recent balance is positive, but regardless of the final balance, they are likely to face serious problems.  Both exhibits show wild and unpredictable swings in the balance and little to indicate a stable connection to the local economy. Using these patterns it is reasonable to expect a refusal notice that says something like: ...It is your responsibility to demonstrate that if granted entry clearance, you will comply with the terms of your visa and have the intention to leave. I consider you have failed to demonstrate economic ties to (country name goes here)... or: ...I am not satisfied that you will maintain and accommodate yourself and any dependant adequately out of the resources available to you without recourse to public funds or taking employment... Some specific cases are below... A frequent source of refusals comes under ""proportionality"". This is a strategy where the applicant intends to deplete his life savings on a visit. ""Proportionality"" also covers the case where an applicant intends to spent more than about two or three months earnings on a visit, sometimes up to six months. This strategy is doomed from the outset because ECO's believe that genuine visitors do not deplete their financial reserves on a visit and moreover, ECO's believe that genuine visitors do not spend a multiple of their monthly cash intake.  There is no hard rule covering proportionality and UKVI does not provide guidance on what is acceptable, so as a general rule of thumb if you plan on spending more than a month or two of your cash intake, you can expect problems and the solution is don't apply. Wait until your personal circumstances are more prosperous. UKVI recognizes that spouses and dependent children will not be able to present bank statements. In these cases the primary applicant's bank statements will be used to assess the family's circumstances as a whole.  The UK approves thousands of family applications each year. Children over 18 who cannot show a reason for maintaining a dependant's  lifestyle will face increased difficulty.  This is especially true if they are not travelling as a family unit.  The same can generally be said for students, although students can usually provide other evidence that demonstrates local ties. The rules do not specify an amount, they are intentionally vague so as to give the decision-maker latitude in assessing individual circumstances. A rule of thumb, however, uses the applicant's stated purpose and intended activities as a rough guideline, and the applicant should be able to clear this amount without undue hard hardship. If you are concerned about isolating and providing a specific figure, there's a good chance you have not understood this article in its entirety and you may want to read it again. It's not just about the final balance. Yes, of course.  But lots of applications fail because the decision-maker cannot understand why the sponsor is undertaking that burden. This is especially true for internet relationships where the couple has not previously met in person.  It is also true for family members where the relationship is too remote or too distant to be plausible. The sponsor needs to provide a series of their own bank statements to demonstrate their own capacity and credibility. Sponsored applications are weak to begin with and they do not relieve the applicant of demonstrating ties to the local economy and social landscape.  While the money may be there, it is much more difficult for the applicant to make a strong case that they will not overstay or abuse their visa in some other way. Generally, sponsorship should be used only as a last resort and only if the applicant can provide a compellingly strong case. This may work with Schengen applications, but not for UK applications. Credit cards add a layer of obscurity to the funding source and tend to shroud all of the lifestyle and transparency listed above.   An applicant needs to demonstrate that they will maintain themselves adequately without recourse to public funds.  Genuine visitors are usually  able to accomplish this. If you are unable to do this in a convincing way, consider putting off your visit until a more prosperous time. There are services in some countries (Nigeria, India, Pakistan, to name a few) who will do this for you. If you know about them, the decision-maker knows about them also. Remember that consular staff have built up relationships with the reputable banks over a long period of time (we're talking decades here) and are able to make discreet enquiries about the validity of a given set of statements. See above. You can expect problems demonstrating that you are a genuine applicant. Consider waiting until your parents submit a family application. You can expect problems. Genuine visitors to the UK fit a profile that is not entirely cash based.  Moreover, you will find it almost impossible to establish that your cash has been lawfully obtained. Consider opening and using a proper bank account for 12 - 18 months prior to submitting your application. There is no other form of evidence taken as an absolute substitution. Property deeds are rarely helpful because property ownership normally persists when the owner is living elsewhere. Personal attestations from family and friends are not helpful because there is a bulk of performance history indicating otherwise. But there are a few exceptions, for example, you can get an attestation from your country's equivalent of the UK's Foreign Office that puts forward your circumstances. As another example, holding public office may work depending upon other circumstances.  Otherwise, please see the section ""Other questions about bank statements"", below. ...to visit the UK, I really need to go and I promise I will not overstay. The problem is that I have no real bank accounts or anything else that shows a connection to my country. You see, my situation is different. It's like blah blah blah, and then yada yada yada... Please help! There is no magic bullet, they like to approve applicants who clearly and unambiguously fall into a low-risk profile. For more information, see below. Don't apply.  Getting a refusal can complicate future applications even when you are in more prosperous circumstances and could easily qualify.   If none of the above cases work for you, your circumstances may be too complex for an internet query answered by random strangers.  Consider arranging a consultation with a member of the UK Law Society or a licensed practitioner.  There's a great list on the ILPA site. From the guidance: ""All documents must be originals and not photocopies.""

How can I find restaurants in the USA where tipping is not expected?,"Tipping is still the norm in any U.S. establishment where you do not seat and serve yourself—that is, everywhere except fast-food restaurants and places organized as food courts or cafeterias where you order at a counter. In buffet-style restaurants, where the server does not take your order or serve more than drinks, the standard is lower (10-15% instead of 15-20% in a full service restaurant), but a tip is still expected. I tried the major food and review sites like Yelp, Zomato, and OpenTable, and none have a category or filter which makes it easy to find places with a no-tipping policy. Therefore, it seems you will need to rely on Reddit, local guides which do include such information, or indeed on headlines. You will want to follow up on the headlines. Not only are non-tipping restaurants exceptionally rare, but as Zach Lipton notes, this trend was mostly limited to a few restaurants in major cities, and as user71659 notes, many of these restaurants ended the practice and returned to tipping — sometimes within weeks. An NPR interview with restaurateur Thad Vogler provides some reasoning behind the reversals. Per @Ellesedil, if you're interested in the food from a sit-down restaurant and not necessarily the experience of eating there, you can sometimes order takeout (aka carryout or to-go; takeaway is the British term but rare in the U.S.). You place the order in person at a counter or with the host/hostess, over the phone, or online; the restaurant will prepare the food and package it; you pay and leave with it. This is a common service of chain family restaurants and especially associated with pizza, sandwiches, Chinese or Thai food, and barbecue, but it is not limited to low-end establishments, as the Morton's The Steakhouse to-go menu demonstrates. On the other hand, commenters have suggested that tipping is expected for takeout at some establishments, especially if the order is complex. I myself have never heard of such a thing, and most people seem to be with me based on reports, but on the other hand I do not do takeout from nice restaurants or make complex orders. It's never wrong to tip a service worker in the U.S., unlike in some other cultures. You can also order food for delivery, although then the expectation is that you will tip the delivery person. This is the case both for establishments which deliver food themselves, as with many pizzerias, Chinese restaurants, or bakeries, and for third party delivery services such as Amazon Restaurants, GrubHub/Seamless, Uber Eats, Yelp/Eat24, or DoorDash among others. Often, the menu price goes to the restaurant, any delivery fee to the company behind the app or service, and only the tip to the driver. One can argue that the drivers have a worse working environment than a server in a restaurant, so stiffing the driver would be a grave act. Not every restaurant offers takeout or delivery, but it doesn't hurt to ask the host/hostess."
How to escape hip-hop CD giveaway scam in New York City?,"A few things: Avoid making eye contact with them. Nothing will make them come up to you more aggressively than eye contact. You've seen them, they saw you see them, and they know it's a lot harder for you to ignore them now. As stated above, do not engage. If they approach you and you cannot immediately walk away just say no. Repeatedly say no if pressed. Blow right past them. If you are not stuck on that corner just walk right past them without regarding them at all. Do not let them stop you. If one of them tries to block your way walk around them. Wear headphones, even if you don't intend to listen to anything (and you shouldn't be.) It's much easier to ignore someone when you can pretend that you can't hear them. People are also much less likely to approach you if you are wearing headphones. If you did engage, do not take the CD. This is the worst thing you could do. If you have taken the CD and they refuse to take it back, gently put it on the ground and walk away. I live in NYC and do not have an issue with these people and have not since I was new there. You simply ignore them."
Prohibited item forgotten in hand luggage: what to do with it?,"It happened to me once in London Heathrow.  In my case I didn't have any emotional attachment to the item and it only cost around £3 to replace, so I threw it away, however I discussed with the security and the airline what my options were.  They offered me the following options: The main point to keep in mind is that you're still landside.  Depending on how much time you have left before your flight, you could even go back home, leave the item there and come back to the airport.  For example, if you're in Heathrow and live somewhere near Paddington, you can easily get from the terminal to home and back to the terminal in under an hour. That said, your options may be very much limited by what airport you are in. If everything else fails and the item is REALLY, REALLY priceless, you can always turn around, go to the airline desk and tell them that you changed your mind and don't want to fly.  They will then return you your checked in luggage.  You pack your item there, then buy another ticket.  Prepare to be quizzed by some men in black though :)  ""Changing your mind"" after having checked in is considered a very suspicious move. P.S. The item that happened to be in my backpack was an 8mm drill bit for glass and tiles, which I lent to a colleague, then he returned it, I put it in a small outside pocket on the backpack - and completely forgot about it.  I flew with this backpack almost 3 months later - and ended up throwing the bit away, as buying a new one was the cheapest option."
Norwegian refuses EU delay (4.7 hours) compensation because it turned out there was nothing wrong with the aircraft,"The refusal is logically fallacious, and it misrepresents the Van der Lans case on which it relies.  Let's pick it apart: Misleading claim about the case They claim that the Van der Lans decision holds that ""a technical error which results in the replacement of a component can be considered to be within the airline's control and thus give the right to compensation.""  This mischaracterizes the decision.  Actually, the ruling was a technical problem, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which occurred unexpectedly, which is not attributable to poor maintenance and which was also not detected during routine maintenance checks, does not fall within the definition of ‘extraordinary circumstances’ within the meaning of that provision. The ruling describes the technical problem ""such as that in the main proceedings,"" which leaves it open to interpretation -- and further litigation -- as to which aspects of the technical problem could distinguish this case from others.  But the airline asserts that the ruling applies only to technical problems that result in the replacement of a component.  That does not appear to be critical to the court's reasoning in this case, except that the fact that the replaced components having failed early was part of KLM's argument.  The court held that this did not matter. On the contrary, the court made reference to Wallentin-Hermann (C‑549/07, EU:C:2008:771), in which the ruling held that I would argue that the distinguishing factors in Van der Lans are actually those mentioned in the ruling itself.  That is, the ruling applies to technical problems that are Wallentin-Hermann, by the way, is where the airline gets the concept of ""within its control,"" which isn't found in the Van der Lan ruling.  But the test there actually has two parts, and they only mention one.  For something to be ""extraordinary circumstances"" it must not only be beyond the airline's control but also outside the ""normal exercise of activity."" Poor logic Let us for the sake of argument assume that the assertion about the Van der Lans case is correct.  That is, because this incident doesn't concern an actual technical problem, but only the suspicion of a problem, Van der Lans does not apply. In that case, the logic is this: The last does not follow.  It's equivalent to this line of reasoning: But she is a US citizen.  The fact that someone does not have a US passport actually tells us nothing about her citizenship.  More generally, if the truth of A implies that B is true, that does not in turn mean that A being false implies that B is false.  Wikipedia has an article about this where it is called denying the antecedent. The last sentence is particularly egregious: there was no technical fault and no components were replaced The Van der Lans decision is therefore not applicable Okay, even if the Van der Lans decision really is not applicable, it still does not mean that the airline isn't responsible.  The Van der Lans decision is not the only route by which responsibility may arise. The inspection itself was within the airline's control or inherent in the normal exercise of its activity, so the ""extraordinary circumstances"" exception does not apply. Conclusion I would write something like this: The reliance on the Van der Lans decision is misplaced.  Even if were true that this incident falls outside the scope of that decision, which I dispute, that does not imply that the incident qualifies for the ""extraordinary circumstances"" exception.  When the court identified one category of technical problem as not qualifying for that exception, it did not thereby cause every other kind of technical delay to qualify for it. Even if this incident can be distinguished from the one in Van der Lans, the same logic applies.  Van der Lans relies on Wallentin-Hermann, which says that the ""extraordinary circumstances"" exception does not apply unless a problem ""stems from events which, by their nature or origin, are not inherent in the normal exercise of the activity of the air carrier concerned and are beyond its actual control.""  In this case, the delay was the result of an ""inspection of the aircraft following a possible technical fault,"" which is certainly part of the normal exercise of an airline's activity. Van der Lans underlines that ""functioning of aircraft inevitably gives rise to technical problems"" (paragraph 37) and that fixing technical problems to ensure proper functioning of the aircraft is part of the normal activity of an airline (paragraph 43).  The same must be true of investigating suspected technical problems, for that too is ""required to ensure the maintenance and proper functioning of the aircraft it operates for the purposes of its business"" (paragraph 43)."
How can I convince airport screeners to stop asking why I prefer pat-downs?,"I also refuse body scanners whenever possible (i.e. I'm not running late and I can accept a delay). Yes, they always try to argue and you will never make them stop, because it is always a different person. I've never had them argue with me for 10 minutes, though. If I had plenty of time, I'd like that. They are ignorant of the actual technology and I am not, so it would be interesting. But your granddad is probably not. So from my experience here are the two answers that don't get you talked back at. I answer in a friendly way, but without smiling or otherwise showing that I am anything but entirely serious: The science on their safety is still preliminary and I fly too often to take the risk. and, of course, one that always works: I prefer not to. Which is unassailable. Just don't let them drag you into an argument. Stick to that reason and that reason alone and repeat it as often as necessary. I've never had to go beyond three repetitions. In my experience, it also helps massively to demonstrate that you are familiar with the procedure. For example, at an airport that I used regularily I noticed that the security guard in front of the scanner would tell the one behind ""100%"" in various phrases to indicate a pat-down. So I started using the same phrase when requesting it, instead of talking about body scanners and optional I'd simply say ""100% please"". Got my pat down with zero talkback several times."
How to avoid toddlers on a long-distance plane flight?,"To avoid disturbance from small children, you can use a multi-pronged approach: And finally, when you leave the plane, be grateful that you are now done with that child and don't have to hear the noise or put in any effort to try to prevent bedlam.

"When I travel next, I want to reach the point on the earth that is exactly opposite my home, how can I discover where that is?","It's very easy, and a quick google search for 'antipode' and 'map' will find sites that find it for you. For example, Antipodes Map either detects your location, or you can enter one, and it'll show you on a zoom-able map where your antipodal destination is.  Unfortunately as shown by the map above, only about 15% of land territory is antipodal to other land, and only a tiny fraction of Brazil is antipodal to Japan (in fact, to the islands of Okinawa and Amami). A rather larger amount of Brazil (but still a small fraction of the country as a whole) is antipodal to the Philippines and Indonesia, along with Brunei, parts of Malaysia and the South Korean island of Jeju.  Without knowing your exact location I can't be sure where it ends up. I'll leave that last step up to you to investigate!  Another ""Map Tunneler"" site shows it quite nicely side by side. I can click and zoom in on New Zealand and the other window zooms in at the same time to show me northern Spain - the antipode."

When and why do people clap/applaud after a plane lands?,"A cabin crew member here, and I am from a country where people do not clap after landings and I was very surprised when I experienced this for the first time, so I started asking passengers when this happens on different flights. Basically there are three main reasons: A sign of appreciation: the smoother the flight/landing, the stronger the clapping. You know, clapping is cheaper and more feasible than sending the crew flowers.  A sign of happiness for safely landing. The harder the flight was, the stronger the clapping will be. There could be other reasons as well behind ""happiness"", I am sure it happened with me when no one expected it to happen, but in general it happens on certain flights with certain communities on a regular basis. A sign of excitement for reaching home. Seen this in flights where most of the passengers are expats arriving home after spending a long time away from home.  The three above situations happen more when arriving home, not when going away from home. That also was noticed. I guess in some communities, this clapping thing became a tradition, Egypt for example. While the applause is mainly a sign of excitement, people from there do not need a reason to do so. You'll see passengers from all classes (even rich people in first class) will usually clap especially older ones regardless of the flight even if it was a one hour flight with no service and a hard landing! There are also other less common reasons behind that. Sometimes crew announcements initiate that, as mentioned in the comment (the crew announced that this was the last flight before the captain's retirement), another announcement that I personally experienced when the captain announced the result of an important football match (he got the result from the ATC). "
Can I accidentally miss the in-flight food?,"A senior cabin crew member here. There's nothing to worry about, we ought to wake passengers up during meal services, for both service and safety reasons: Service: So no one misses the meal, then gives us a hard time later trying to get them one, or even worse, file a complaint! Also, meals cannot be served more than 30 minutes after they are heated, and cannot be reheated.  Safety: So we check on the well-being of passengers. Many of the passenger incapacitations on board are discovered when we couldn't wake them up during meal services. I personally was on a few flights where seriously ill passengers' lives were saved because of trying to wake them up and figuring out that they need help.  This is a policy in my airline, I think other airlines have the same policy. An exception is when the passengers make it clear that they do not want to be disturbed (by telling the passenger next to them or by the DND sticker in some airlines), then the cabin crew will assume they are in deep sleep and they do not want to eat. Out of experience, very few passengers do that, especially in long haul flights.  Anyhow, in case you missed the meal, ask the crew. There are usually some extra meals here or there. "

Why is the price on the shelves for drinks often different from what I actually pay in supermarkets in Germany?,"You are paying for the drink and a deposit for the bottle. The deposit should be listed on the shelves, but usually in small print. Look for something like ""zzgl. 0,15 Pfand"". As to your initial thought, prices on supermarket shelves include VAT.  There are deposits on many but not all drink containers, the rules are complicated. Deposits apply to non-reusable containers as well as reusable ones, this is to discourage littering and to make sure that the reusable containers are not an economic disadvantage. These deposits can be 8 ct, 10 ct, 15 ct, or 25 ct. You can reclaim your deposit, even in a different shop than the one where you purchased it, provided they sell the same bottles. Most larger supermarkets have machines to scan the bottles and print out a receipt that can be turned in at the cash register. It is possible to reclaim money even if you do not buy anything. Most Germans return their empty bottles and claim the deposit, of course. When you do not want to do that, it is considered polite to put the bottle next to a public waste bin, not into it. Some people will collect them and reclaim the deposit as a way to make a little money. "
How to make dining alone less awkward?,"Dining alone is only awkward for you (that is, it's an internal thing).

If you're travelling, you can almost always find a hotel or airport restaurant with other solo customers. The presence of others eating their own meals alone might be enough to make you feel better about doing the same thing. If the restaurant has a bar, you can often get meals served at the bar. You'll often find other people doing this too. That way you don't have an empty seat across from you. You can even strike up a conversation with the bartender if you are so inclined. Find a table or seat that doesn't face other customers, such as looking out a window.  Do what you're doing now, absorb yourself in your mobile technology.  I also used to feel extremely awkward about eating alone. I can clearly remember specific restaurants from years ago where I was feeling really uncomfortable eating by myself. However, somewhere along the way I realised that there wasn't anything to be uncomfortable about, and today I have no trouble eating alone. "
"What's the deal with the ""string people"" in central Paris?","I think the best write-up I've seen on this is at Corporatetravelsafety.com: They begin the Paris String Scam by engaging you in innocent
conversation and will usually say that they want to show you a magic
trick.  Before you know it, a ""string man"" has grabbed your wrist or
one or two fingers and encircled it with a homemade bracelet of
colored string. You think the conversation or interaction is an
interesting way to meet the ""local flavor"" of Paris and you allow them
to engage you in what seems like an innocent act of being charmed by
the ""locals."" This happens all over Paris, and especially (obviously) in heavily-touristy areas.  The scam then is to ""charge"" you for this bracelet you had no desire for: While the Paris String Scam may be fun to watch, when the string men
finish making your new ""local Paris string bracelet souvenir,"" the
string men will demand payment of around €20 Euros when they are
finished, which is quite obviously not what the bracelet is worth. If
you fail to pay them, they will doggedly follow you and be VERY
insistent that you provide some amount of payment. It's also commonly used as a distraction while a friend of them pick-pockets you. So someone being tackled by the police might have been one of these pick-pocketers.  Or arguably selling goods without a license, although it seems unlikely police would go tackle a guy for that (Although you see it on Westminster Bridge in London too - police appear, all the touts run off). How to deal with them? The same site offers this: If someone approaches you with the words ‘for the church’ or
‘bracelet’ or ‘gift’ or 'magic' or 'trick' and they are carrying
strings, just put your hands in your pockets and keep walking. For
those string men who are more aggressive, politely say ""Non, merci""
but most importantly - keep on walking - do not stop. Be courteous but
firm, and the string man who's targeted you will usually then move on
to the next victim. If you really want a string bracelet as a
souvenir, you can easily get one free: Just pick up strings that
unhappy tourists have discarded on the steps leading up to the
Basilica."
I have two passports/nationalities. How do I use them when I travel?,"This is a common situation, and it's generally no problem.  I'll use A for the country you're in, and B for the country you're going to, but all the ""flows"" described here work equally well if you want to use your B passport to go to a third country. If you have the same name in both passports (that is, same first name and last name, minor variations are OK), and both countries accept dual citizenship (if you're not sure, find out here), the basic formula is: In step-by-step detail, when flying from A to B and back: And on the way back from B to A, just reverse the process: Pictorial representation for a UK/US dual citizen visiting the US, courtesy @GayotFow:
 If your names are different, but your countries are OK with each other: Things get harder if one or both your countries does not accept dual citizenship, especially if they care enough to look for visas or arrival stamps.  The key thing to understand here is that the airline is not a part of immigration.  They do not care if you have multiple passports and they are not going to tell immigration if you do, all they want to know if whether you will be allowed in at your destination. So here's one way to avoid letting A know you are also a citizen of B (but B will know you've come from A): On the way back, though, you will need a short detour: Beware that this is not totally foolproof, as a very careful inspection of your stamps will reveal that you were not in C for the whole time, but unless you're North Korean, it's unlikely you will be subjected to this level of scrutiny.  Some people choose to go through immigration in C on the way out as well, so they get more decoy stamps. Doing that is necessary if you also want country B not to know that you've come from A (making the scenario symmetric). If you have different names and your countries don't like each other, you can still use the same method as above, but you'll likely need to book your A-C-A flight in your ""A"" name and your C-B-C flight in your ""B"" name."
"How does President Trump's travel ban affect nationals of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen coming to the US for tourism/transit/etc?","On the 13th of November, the preliminary injunction (which prohibited the US government to enforce the presidential proclamation) was stayed except for foreign nationals who have a credible bonafide relationship with someone in the US. A summary of the subject countries is:
 So nationals of Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen will remain travel restricted to the US unless they have a  parent, including parent-in-law, spouse, fiancé, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sibling, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, and first-cousin.  For all relationships, half or step status is included (e.g., “half-brother” or “step-sister”) in the US. Any other extended family members will not count as a bonafide relation. A federal judge has rules the ban is unlawful/unconstitutional and until further notice, the ban is on hold.  This means any national of the aforementioned countries, with a visa or green card, can currently travel to the USA.  This might change any moment if a higher court rules differently, so if you live in the USA (like with a student or J-1 visa), you should travel ASAP. The ban includes both immigrant visas, nonimmigrant visas, and green card holders.  From the executive order (emphasis mine): I hereby proclaim that the immigrant
and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section
217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United
States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of
such persons for 90 days from the date of this order (excluding those foreign nationals
traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the
United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas). According to Reuters, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson said greencard holders are included as well: People holding so-called green cards, making them legal permanent U.S. residents, are included in President Donald Trump's executive action temporarily barring people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, a Department of Homeland security spokeswoman said on Saturday. There is ongoing confusion concerning people with dual nationality, such as people holding both UK and Iranian passports.  (However, dual nationals who also hold US citizenship are OK, since US citizens cannot be denied entry to the US.) The only currently stated exceptions are holders for the aforementioned visa categories, which essentially means diplomats, UN personnel, or NATO staff: Late Saturday A federal court, responding to a lawsuit filed on behalf of detained travelers, has issued an emergency stay quashing part of the order for the time being. It forbids the US Government from removing individuals with refugee applications approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services as part of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas, and other individuals from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen legally authorized to enter the United States. This does not say that the persons concerned have to be let into the United States, only that they can't be sent back. It is possible they will stay in limbo at the airports until the legal situation clears up further. It is also not clear if airlines will now allow such persons with already issued visas to board flights to the US. Update: Sunday January 29, 2017 Airlines have started to refuse boarding to those holding valid visas from those countries that are on the temporary ban list; and some passengers have been stopped at transit points. Five Iraqis and a Yemeni national were kept from boarding a flight
from Cairo to New York on Saturday, despite all seven people having
already obtained the necessary migration visas to enter the United
States. Source: DW In The Netherlands, the Dutch flag carrier KLM said it had stopped
seven passengers from boarding its flights, five of whom it had been
able to contact before departure. The identities of the seven, their
countries of origin and destinations were not given. ""We would have liked to have had them fly with us, but it would not
have made much sense because they would have been denied entry"" to the
United States, KLM spokesman Manel Vrijenhoek told AFP news agency. In Canada, WestJet Airlines said it turned back a passenger bound for
the United States on Saturday in order to comply with an executive
order that prohibits people from seven Muslim-majority countries from
entering the United States. WestJet spokeswoman Lauren Stewart said the airline would give full
refunds to anyone affected by the US executive order. It did not say
which country the passenger had come from.

Is it rude to ask if the food contains pork or alcohol?,"As a white, Christian, American person I can definitely say that nobody would (perhaps should) be offended by your dietary restrictions. I have a number of friends who are vegetarians for no reason other than they decided they wanted to be. In my opinion, that is far less sacrosanct than religious reasons, and I have always made sure to accommodate them when I cook. IMO it is rude to not consider your guests' dietary restrictions.  As CGCampbell pointed out, I would say something like ""I am an observant Muslim and cannot have pork or alcohol in my food. Would it be possible to make something that avoids those ingredients?"""
Do I need a serious reason to enter a US Embassy as a US Citizen?,"It's possible that the answer will vary depending on the specific embassy/consulate, but to use the US Consulates in Australia as an example... No, you can not.  Even as a US citizen you are required to make an appointment to visit the consulate for non-emergency services. As stated on the US Consulates Australian webpage : To be allowed entry into the U.S. Consulates for routine
  (non-emergency) services, you must make an appointment online. There is seemingly an exception here for emergency services, however I doubt they would classify ""I just wanna have a look around!"" as an ""emergency"". The appointment system requires you to enter the purpose of your visit, and once again ""just lookin'"" isn't on the list. The equivalent page for Japan has different text, but still states that you must ""schedule an appointment"" It's worth keeping in mind that US consulates have an extremely high level of security, and the answer for other countries consulates/embassy will probably be different.  For example, to access a US Consulate in Australia you need to have an appointment, have your bags X-rays, go through a metal detector, and leave all electronics at the security checkpoint.  By contrast, to access an Australia consulate in the US you need to ring the doorbell (or at least, that's been my experience at the Australian Consulate in San Francisco!)"
How to convince airport security that I am not dangerous when having metallic parts in my body?,"When I flew from Vienna to Amsterdam and back, my fears were
  confirmed: The security staff inspected me very precise, and I had to
  explain them my story. Thank god I have some scars left so they
  believed me! It is not a problem. There are many, many people with metal implants
and the standard procedure is simply explaining your condition after
an alert is raised. You are singled out and checked with a hand
induction device. You need not to be afraid, this is standard practice. However this is not a permanent solution for the future. Is there any
  international ""passport"" which my doctor and hospital do not know
  about? If not, what else are my possibilities? You are wrong on this account, it is the permanent solution. The idea
of checking you is to rule out the possibility that you smuggle something
on board. Think about it:
If there were ""passports"" from a doctor, the very first thing people who
want to smuggle something into the plane is to falsify such
documents to avoid detection. Or even nastier, coerce people with a
real ""passport"" to smuggle something involuntarily on board. It also does not help that the personnel will not be able to check the 
given ""passport"" in a reasonable time because your condition is part
of medical confidentiality and your personal privacy. So simply explain your condition and wear comfortable clothes which makes
it easy to check your shoulder. EDIT: Another problem with the idea of ""passports"": Even if you have a passport, the personnel still needs to check you because you can still try to smuggle another thing on board. So a ""passport"" makes absolutely no difference. I suppose
the ""passport"" for bigger implants informs the personnel that their detector is functioning normally when it detects copious amounts of metal on your body. EDIT II: If you have several metal implants on different body parts, I consider it a good idea to have X-rays with the implants available so that the personnel can easily cross-check their detector findings with the implant locations."

It also features English language.  Here is an example for an MVV journey similar to the one described in OP:  Of course, DB cannot expect all travelers to have a smartphone to buy tickets on, and therefore the other answers here are completely valid.  However, if you happen to have a smartphone with a data plan with you and simply want to buy a ticket, avoiding any explanations and/or hassle, purchasing a ticket through this app may be the simplest solution.

"How to prevent ""Delhi Belly"" from eating/drinking locally?","Basically, you can't. The world is full of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, even in developed, First World nations. There are some decent steps to trying to minimize your exposure: But when it comes down to it, nearly every traveller makes some sort of safe-eating ""mistake"" fairly frequently, whether they realize it or not. At the end of the day, your best bet is to talk to your travel physician, and see if you can get a prescription for an antibiotic. Using that in combination with something like Imodium will probably keep your trip mostly on track - shutting down the problem long enough for the antibiotics to treat the source. Unless of course its viral - norovirus, rotavirus etc. In that event, best of luck. And if it does happen? Stay hydrated. You're losing salts and water, they need to be replaced."
Does the European number for emergencies (112) really work in Germany?,"Difficult to say. The 112 emergency dispatcher should be able to connect you with the police, even if you also can call the police directly on the number 110. Perhaps the operator did not consider a break-in in an appartment urgent enough to do the job for you. Yes, it violates the GSM standard, but calling emergency services in Germany from a cell phone requires an active SIM card. The reason was to prevent hoax calls from inactive, and therefore unidentifiable cellphones. You could also have dialled 110 with your Italian SIM card.  There are a few differences between dialling 110 and 112 from a cell phone, but they are in most situations not relevant: When you dial 110, the call is basically treated as a regular phone call. Your phone must be registered on a supported network and the cell you are connected to must have capacity to handle an additional call. The call will hence only go through if you are within coverage of your home network, or a network you may roam on and the cell capacity is not exhausted. When you dial 112, the call is already at the initial signalling level treated as an emergency call. The cell phone will try to connect through any available provider, even if you are regularly not allowed to use that provider's network. The cell phone will use a priority procedure when setting up the call and if the cell capacity is exhausted, other calls will be dropped by the network to 'give room' for your emergency call."
"Considerations for very fragile and expensive (> $100,000) items in carry-on luggage","This is something you will need to talk directly to the airline about, or a specialist freight carrier or courier. Most airlines offer a high value item service, where special care and attention is taken with your item, and most airlines will be able to work with you for any specific requirements you require - for example, a controlled environment et al.   These high value items are treated differently in regard to security as well - you won't get random TSA employees opening and handling the items, they will be vetted according to a set of criteria that you, the airline and the TSA will agree on (for example, they can inspect the item in your controlled environment, and accept the consignment from that point in a locked box).   You may be allowed to accompany the item on its journey, if that is part of your travel criteria. You may want to talk to UPS or Fedex directly, rather than an airline. If you just show up at the airport with the box, you will be rejected - especially if you attempt to stop airport security from inspecting it.  "

Why are there no seat belts on trains?,"This Wikipedia article is a good place to start. Road, train and air travel have very different safety considerations. Crashes are significantly more likely in car travel than train and air travel. Also, seat belts prevent injuries during sudden deceleration, which is extremely rare during train travel. Plane crashes are even less likely than train crashes, but seat belts in aircraft are also designed to reduce injuries during turbulence, a comparatively common occurrence. So while train crashes are rare, surely it couldn't hurt to add seat belts? In fact, train seats are currently designed on the assumption that passengers are unrestrained, so they are intended to absorb the energy of impact during a crash. Modifying seating to add seat belts would increase the likelihood of injury for unrestrained passengers, since the seats would have to be made more rigid. Compliance on trains is likely to be low, since passengers will (correctly) perceive that there is little benefit to wearing a seat belt. Also, in the event of a crash, some passengers receive lesser injuries by being ""thrown clear"". Research finds that there is no safety benefit to adding seat belts (this is a summary of the citation ""Assessment of Three-point Passenger Restraints (seatbelts) Fitted to Seats on Rail Vehicles"" in the linked Wikipedia article)."
How can black travellers deal with unwanted harassment from locals in China?,"There is not much you can do - those people have probably never before seen anyone black, and that is the typical reaction in that cultural environment. Imagine you are green or blue, and you go in a bar with hill billies in a very remote region of the US. I would expect them to act quite similar - if not even more 'rude'. Those people don't consider it rude or harassment, and they are not intentionally rude to your friends - only in your view they are. In their view, the behavior is normal - they are just completely blown away by the strangeness of the looks. When you travel to exotic locations, you have to be prepared for exotic mind sets and cultural standards."
"Is there a way to prevent ""looking like a tourist"" in order to not be harassed?","First there's the obvious - when in a tourist area, don't act too much like a tourist. When I lived in London you could instantly tell the locals from tourists in busy tourist areas, regardless of their looks, from the fact the locals were walking quickly and purposefully and skirting around the crowds (even when lost) while the tourists had more random, brownian motion. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy tourist spots without looking like a tourist. For example, you can walk purposefully towards a clear space, glance at your phone or watch while standing like a local who is waiting to meet someone (see below), then admire the view at your leisure. Here's some further tips If you are on a trip where blending in is a priority and you want to go the extra mile, for example, to avoid scams and/or ease natural conversations with locals.  There was a section in Benny Lewis's book Fluent In Three Months about this. He described spending time working on mastering the art of blending in so that local people would be more likely to talk to him in their own language in a natural way (he added that getting harassed less for tourist scams was a nice by-product). This is what I remember of the advice, plus some of my own experience: With a bit of practice, it's possible to tune in to this sort of thing almost unconsciously, and remarkably quickly (like, a few hours; maybe plus one shopping trip at a local market if you really want to go the whole hog). Of course, this all takes some effort - don't obsess about it so much you enjoy your trip less. When reducing harassment and easing conversations with locals aren't an issue or a priority on a particular trip - for example, if you're somewhere super-touristy and there's no point pretending - there's no reason not to relax and just enjoy being a tourist."
Did I opt out of compensation by accepting meal vouchers?,"You were given meal vouchers because the EU air passenger rights regulations require the airline to provide ""meals and refreshments in a reasonable relation to the waiting time"" (regulation 261/2004, art. 9(1)(a)). This is in addition to any cash compensation the rules may also entitle you to. So go ahead and make a claim for the delay."
"I was born in a city which is now under control of a different country. What is my ""country of birth"" on US visa/ESTA applications?","It's worth pointing out the guidelines the USA itself applies to U.S. passport holders: (My emphasis) 7 FAM 1330 APPENDIX D  BIRTH OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES - CURRENT SOVEREIGNTY RULE (CT:CON-254;   04-29-2008) a. It is the Department of State policy that place of birth in a U.S. passport should reflect the current sovereignty as determined by the Office of the Geographer (INR/GGI) and the regional geographic bureau. b. As a general rule, the country that currently has sovereignty over the actual place of birth is listed as the place of birth, regardless of when the birth occurred.  Passport authorizing officers must use the country of birth as it is now known for a place of birth listing, unless otherwise specified in this appendix. c.  For a location whose sovereignty is in dispute, is not yet resolved, or is not recognized by the United States, this appendix provides specific guidance. Source: 7 FAM 1300 APPENDIX D I'm not sure whether France has a similar guideline, but if they don't, going with the above (meaning: Algeria, not France) may be your safest bet. This would also be in line with Spehro's answer."
How to lift a lifetime ban from Canada due to marijuana?,"Get an immigration attorney, a competent one. This is not the kind of question for which you solicit answers from random guys on the internet. It is not a trivial matter. Typically the fact that the law has changed does not mean immigration violations of that law in the past are forgiven because the issue is it implies you do not have a problem breaking the law, so you’re viewed as more inclined to break other laws."
Why do cars need to leave their windows half open whilst on the Eurotunnel?,"To allow for adequate fire suppression, in the event of a vehicle fire in the tunnel. The tunnel's fire suppression system depends upon complete mixing of the released halon gas with all air, without having pockets of high (or low) halon concentration. Check the document ""EUROTUNNEL'S SPECIFICATION FOR HALON 1301 REPLACEMENT""; it claims (on page 271): [...]The results proved that complete mixing did occur but also
indicated that coach doors, roof vents and car windows needed to be
open in order to ensure the Halon air mixture enters the coach and car
passenger areas.[...] on the web page with ""Safety instructions"" for coach operators, it says too: [...]Open all doors, windows, air vents and skylights. This will allow
all announcements to be heard and the automatic fire extinguishing
system will be effective in case of fire on board your coach.[...]"
How do I identify an airport’s official free Wi-Fi network?,"Unfortunately, you cannot. Nowadays anyone can use a small portable device to create a bogus Wi-Fi network, so even if you know SSID (network name), you still cannot be sure you are connecting to the right access point.  For instance, if the official network is ""Berlin Airport Wi-Fi"", anybody can create their own network named ""Berlin Airport Wi-Fi"", and there is no way to be sure you're connecting to the airport's Wi-Fi instead of the bogus one. Instead of trying to find an official network for security, make sure you are ready to protect yourself by using HTTPS websites only and having a VPN client installed and ready on your mobile devices."
Why do people on airplanes often have tomato juice as a drink?,"According to some studies, tomato juice, and many other foods,  actually taste different (better in the case of tomato juice) under the low pressure conditions in an airplane than they do at home."
Why are airlines against the transferring of tickets to other persons?,"Airlines have a pricing strategy known as ""yield management"" or ""revenue management"" - they charge less for some seats than others, and expect these seats to be bought a long time in advance. They know that only a certain percentage of their customers are able to buy seats well in advance, and that those customers wouldn't fly if they couldn't get inexpensive seats. A speculator could buy a $100 ticket and then offer it on eBay close to the flight date for $200. If more than half the seats this speculator bought were sold this way, the speculator would be making money. But the airline, which wants to sell seats close to the flight date for $500, would not. In fact very quickly the speculator enjoying selling 75% of tickets for $200 would see it fall to 0% because of another speculator selling them for $150, and then later another for $110 and so on. This is just how reselling markets tend to work. By insisting that a ticket is not a commodity to be bought, traded, resold, and passed around from hand to hand, the airline is able to keep its complicated pricing structure in place. Overall, this is a good thing, because those last-minute high-price tickets cover a LOT of the cost of the flight - their existence is what keeps the long-advance-notice tickets so cheap!"
What's the safest way to protect your valuables from theft at the beach?,"My suggestion is to take as little valuables as possible, and carry them in the water with you when you go for a dip. What I usually do is I take some form of plastic ID, a bit of cash, a payment card and my phone. I leave everything else at home since most likely I won't need it on the beach. Everything I take easily fits in what is called a freediving dry egg/box which, as the name suggests, is a gadget used by divers to keep their stuff dry whilst in the water. These gadgets come in various different sizes, cost under €20 and look something like this (image courtesy of ScubaStore): 
(source: watersportswarehouse.co.uk)  First thing you should do after purchasing your egg is to test ride its watertightness. Put a piece of paper in it, lock it up and throw it in a sink/bucket full of water. Then wiggle it around for a few minutes. Take it out, open it and check the paper: if it's wet you either did not close the egg properly or it leaks. One possible way of carrying the egg whilst swimming could be  replacing the lanyard with a longer one so that you can wear it diagonally across one shoulder like a shoulder bag. Other options include tying it to your swimming trunks, wearing it around your waist, your neck, or wearing a rubber weight belt of the type used by freedivers on which you can strap the box. The needed comfort also depends in how much swimming you are planning to do. Some of the beaches in Barcelona have lockers, according to the official municipal website. This information is everything but easy to find, since it's usually only listed on the individual webpage of each beach. The results of my searches show that the following beaches have lockers: Nova Icaria, Somorrostro, Bogatell, Mar Bella, Barceloneta (in Catalan only - Consigna). Hopefully this information is up to date. Note that the existence of lockers doesn't guarantee you to find a free/available one to use. Hence why I suggest the dry egg as a first option."
"When someone in India asks for my ""Good Name"", what are they expecting?","Aniket basically said the right thing but let me clarify a few things. There are many regions/groups of people in India but for myself the Bengali example is the best. It is very common for Bengalis to have two names, one of which (bhalo naam) is the legal name used on all official documents. The other (dak naam) is a colloquial name used by family and friends as a term of endearment. This is further complicated by the fact that many people add honorifics/titles in front of their names such as a Muslim adding Mohammad or somebody from the Choudhary caste adding Choudhary in front of their name. Therefore, a person's actual intended bhalo naam might be Abdullah Aalam but he decided to put Mohammad/Chowdhary in front of it to make it Chowdhary Abdullah Aalam. Now by Western standards his first name is Chowdhary but he intends his first (formal) name to be Abdullah. Translating subh naam literally means ""good name"". So to answer your question, in India good name means your first name from your full official formal name. The rest are called middle name and family/last/surname. Full Official Name: Chowdhary Abdullah Alam Full Official Name: John Alfred Travolta Further reading: Here and here."
Best way to dispose of a carry-on bag in Hong Kong airport?,"Ask at the airport information desk, lost property, or a luggage shop (thanks @Fattie). They most likely know some way of ensuring the contents gets given to a charity or at least recycled properly. Subterfuge will at the very least create overhead for the airport personnel, who will have to either destroy the contents safely or hold on to it for a long time before disposing of it. And you really don't want to have to explain yourself to airport security if this spiel is noticed."
What happens if you are refused entry between two countries?,"If you are at a land border and inadmissible in both directions, you'll be taken to a detention centre.  In the scenario you described, most likely Viru. They will book you in and then go over your travel document(s) with a view to determining where you are admissible.  They will contact the consulate where you have citizenship and let them know you are in custody. Once they have determined the next steps, they will serve you with a removal order.  If it happens in Russia, you'll go to the Мировой суд (local magistrate) and get a five year ban, you can also expect to get dunned for their expense.  Estonia has a similar sanction, but it operates under the EEA judicial system.   Once the paperwork is complete, you'll be escorted to a removal centre.  In Estonia, it would be at Tallinn Airport, and in Russia there's one at Sheremetyevo 2.  In most cases, you'll be issued a one-way travel document and placed on the appropriate (civil) flight.  Nobody gets stuck forever in a gulag.  If the receiving country has no problems with you, the removing country will give your actual travel document to the airline staff and you'll get it back once the flight has cleared the removing country's air space. I've been in the one at Sheremetyevo (on the representation side), the biggest concern they have is finding out the REAL reason you are in their country.  Also, you need to really hope there were no crimes committed in the area where you were caught.  I have no experience in Tallinn. Overall, it's comparable to detention anywhere; the biggest problem people face is the language barrier in the day-to-day world as their paperwork is getting sorted out.  From end-to-end, the process would take a maximum of two weeks.   When you debrief people who have been removed, they invariably report that the conditions are civil, and the most harrowing part of the experience was the screwballs they encountered whilst in detention.   NOTE: your scenario takes place where there are clear land borders.  If your scenario took place at a disputed border, like in Morocco, things could get exponentially more complex very quickly.  This answer is scoped to stable countries only and the intervention occurs at a control point. If you are caught deeply inland in Russia, you will be in trouble.  Also countries and regions not mentioned in this answer are out of scope. Related:  Airline policy when a passenger is refused entry in both departure and arrival countries Adding... Further to the comment by Nate (to whom thanks), depending upon how the control point is laid out, there may be a 'discussion' by the border guards over who has jurisdiction. My best guess is given in the first paragraph.  BUT... For the scenario described, the OP should try to get taken into custody by the Russians (even if they have to run to the interior). "
What is a polite way to tell a Scottish person that I am struggling to understand his/her accent?,"I'm English and lived in Glasgow for 4 years. Understanding many (but certainly not all) people will be tricky (even us native speakers struggle), but they'll be very willing to try to help you understand, and it won't cause offence.  You probably won't even need to explain: as soon as they see look of blank incomprehension and hear you begin to say ""Err, sorry"" in a non-Scottish accent they'll usually laugh and know what's going on. It's a common situation. A few things to understand about Glasgow: While getting people to try to help you understand will be easy, getting them to succeed in helping you understand them is a different story... Luckily, if all else fails, Glaswegians tend to be very expressive with their body language :-). You're very unlikely to cause offence (unless you accidentally get your country names mixed up and talk as if Scotland is a part of England, or imply that you think Edinburgh is in any way Scotland's most important city... those common tourist mistakes will cause offence!) One thing to be aware of is, if you're used to Londoners, Glaswegians tend to be much more direct and expressive. In general in the UK, the further North, the more directly people say what they mean.  Don't panic if a Glaswegian says something blunt or confrontational that a Londoner would only ever say to a mortal enemy - it's usually just friendly banter and a sign they trust you have a good sense of humour too. If the laughing stops and someone starts being very precise and pointed about what they say, that's when to start being careful. Update - Mast posted a comment above suggesting practicing with a native to get used to the accent. If that's hard to do, there are several famous Glaswegian comedians who have medium-strength Glaswegian accents. Look for videos of:"
The UK has voted to leave the EU. How does Brexit affect people traveling to the UK and vice-versa?,"As of today, no. Nothing has currently changed (other than currency prices, which are of interest to international travelers).  There will be a prolonged negotiating period over the next several years (specifically, two years after Article 50 is invoked unless a different agreement is reached), and immigration controls will inevitably be a large part of those discussions. The results of those negotiations, along with potential future events in the UK and EU, may bring any number of future changes for anybody, regardless of citizenship, interested in short or long-term travel to the UK and for UK citizens looking to visit EU countries.  There are also no current plans for immigration changes for Commonwealth or other visa-free nationals (such as US/Canadian citizens). Until these negotiations are completed and implemented, the UK remains a member of the EU, and all existing laws apply with no changes. As changes are proposed and enacted, travelers will need to remain alert for potential effects."

Can I ask for two meals for my flight without paying extra?,"A cabin crew member here... In general, flight attendants will be happy to give you the extra meal after the service is done, because they know it will be thrown after landing anyway. Out of experience, there are always some extra meals, at least one or two. Sometimes passengers simply do not take a meal, some other times there's just an extra meal or two loaded for whatever reason. In some other flights, there's a shortage actually. They usually cover for this by using the crew meals, and this is rare anyway. Yes, nothing wrong with it, flight attendants will not think badly of you. As long as you ask nicely, of course. One more thing, all the meals usually get heated at the same time. Once heated they are good to be eaten for a certain time, then they can't be served to passengers. So, if you feel you want an extra meal, ask for it. I have seen so much food being wasted while I was sure many people were hungry but were shy just like you. When they are serving you, give them a hint that you would love to have an extra meal if it's possible after they are done. Personally, when this happens I might give them right away if I know that there are extra meals. Otherwise, I will just wait until service is done and then come back with the extra meal, or apologize if I couldn't find any. Note: I am talking about full-service airlines. For budget airlines where food is bought onboard, you can pay extra and get more food. That's a different story."
How can I visit Antarctica?,"There are a few ways to visit Antarctica. Remember that nothing is ever guaranteed and it's quite possible with weather that you might not make it there. Cruises:
Larger cruises often will get you close but not to the land. You'll have the comforts of cruising. These big ships may be regulated soon. Smaller ships will often let you get right onto land. Costs start at least $5k (for the ultra cheap). Tailored Expeditions:
Many companies run specialty expeditions which let you visit Antarctica exactly how you want. Prices are extremely high for this. Airborne:
You get to fly over Antarctica. This is the more ecological way to see it but doesn't have the same experience as actually walking on it. This is also the cheapest option."
What are these chair-like things in hotels?,These are for placing your luggage (presumably a suitcase) on. Easier to reach than if it's on the floor and you won't have to put it on the bed. 
How do airlines determine ticket prices?,"To calculate the price of a ticket, we first need to know a little about how air pricing works. A ticket is a single, complete contract for one journey. It can contain up to a maximum sixteen flights. Each flight on the ticket must be paid for (""covered"") by exactly one fare. A fare is a price that the airline offers on a city-pair, for example, London-New York, together with a complicated set of rules on how the fare may be used (i.e., the fare rules determine under what conditions that price is valid). Although every flight gets covered by exactly one fare, a single fare could cover multiple flights: For example, a London-New York fare issued by Air France would probably cover London-Paris, and Paris-New York. If you were going as far as Rochester in upstate New York, then the fare would cover London-Paris, Paris-New York, and New York-Rochester, (with the final flight operated by Delta Airlines, but still covered by your Air France fare). Every carrier publishes a fare tariff, which is just a public list of fares. For example, let us say I want to know what the fare tariff for HKG-SYD [Hong Kong to Sydney] is as sold by QF [Qantas].
This information is distributed to travel agents via a system called the ""GDS"" (global distribution system). The validity of the tariff varies by sales city, and may change several times a day; although in practise certain fares tend to stay on the tariff for many years with only small changes to their price. The system is not designed to handle changes to the fare tariff more frequently than about once per hour. If my travel agent is located in London and intends to complete ticketing today, the current tariff on HKGSYD published by QF is (I filtered out non-roundtrip fares.) You can see there is a long price list. Each fare will have a set of rules in how it can be used, such as— As you can see, there are a lot of restrictions and rules possible! By creating these rules very carefully, the carriers intend to keep the price as high as possible but also sell tickets to as many people as possible. For instance, tickets intended to be sold to tourists at low prices will often have to be purchased a few weeks in advance. A consultant who buys his tickets with 2 hours notice will pay a large price for his indecision. It is the flexibility of these rules that make pricing an air ticket a very difficult problem to solve. To give you a flavour, I will post a subset of the rules from the cheapest fare here. I cannot post the full rules from the fare because it would make my answer far too long! This is QF HKGSYD S50HK3 ... For more information, try building a route using http://matrix.itasoftware.com, and inspecting the rules of the fares it suggests at the end of the process. Right, so you have a fare, now you need some flights to apply it to. First, better check the fare's routing map, to see what routes the fare actually allows. Great, so this fare will only cover us travelling directly between HKG and SYD (route number 1) on either QF, CX, IE, or 3K (those four carriers were listed as allowed in the fare rules). If we wanted to go via MEL we would need to get another fare, or maybe a combination of two fares. Some fares give a mileage restriction instead of a route map (so you can use it on any combination of flights [unless restricted by the rules] but only up to a total mileage). Next we need to have a look at QF flights between HKG and SYD, remembering every flight must satisfy the conditions of the rules given above. (I am going to ignore the possibility we could use this fare to cover CX/IE/3K for brevity.) The airline helpfully publishes a list of flights onto the GDS together with the number of seats it is presently willing to sell on the flight organized by ""bucket"" or ""booking code"". This is called the ""availability"". It can differ by sales city again, so a travel agent in NYC might be able to offer you a better price than a travel agent in LON, even for exactly the same journey. Most airlines do not distinguish on point of sale like this, but some do. Legal restrictions apply to this practise within the EU (see Regulation EC 1008/2008). Anyway, looking on the 1st October, from London, on QF flights between HKG-SYD, there is just one and the availability is: The key part is that last block: It tells you that if your fare allows you to book into ""J"" class, you can reserve 9 seats on this specific flight. There might be more than 9 seats available, the maximum it will display is 9. If your fare lets you book into Y class, you can buy 5 seats in one transaction. If your party is of six people, you will need to pick another fare for the sixth person. (Some booking sites would put everyone in the higher class, at a higher cost for all.) If your fare allows you only to book into M class, alas that has zero seats. If you want a ""confirmed reservation"" right now, you are out of luck. The letters J, C, D, and I represent business class; W, R, T is premium economy and the rest are economy. The letter at the left is the ""most available"" (and the fares allowing it are the most expensive), gradually getting cheaper but more restricted as we read towards the right. Actually each airline can use their own set of letters, but it is normal that the most-available (""full fare"") business class is J or C, full fare economy is Y and full fare first is F or P.  Now I should emphasise, the numbers there can change by the second. It is not quite ""how many seats are left"". It is an active estimate by the airline of how high they can set the price. Of course, when a seat is bought, it is likely that the availability will decrease. But if demand is unexpectedly weak, it might make sense for the airline to keep the availability open. On the other hand if it is announced that the World Cup is going to be set in Sydney next year, it makes sense to tighten up the availability now and therefore raise the price. For the airline it is a big problem that a typical purchaser will put hundreds, thousands or probably millions of availability requests through before he purchases a single flight. This has become an intolerable load on the airlines, and therefore the availability information tends to be cached at many levels between the airline and your screen. It can therefore be out of date very quickly. To make life even more difficult, the airlines often like ""to marry"" segments together, so that the availability on one flight depends on what other flights you propose to take in conjunction with it! Basically, if the airline discovers that you want to take a small but popular flight as part of a big and profitable journey, they can be more liberal in opening up the ""cheap seats"" for you. Turning back to our ticket buying: when the availability says 0 you may still put in a ""request"" to be added to the waitlist. The airline will decide whether to confirm your reservation at its discretion in its own time. If the reservation is confirmed, you may pay for the ticket at this point. Whether the fare permits waitlisting will be written in the rules. [This dirt cheap fare ""S50HK3"" we are looking at does not allow waitlisting.] If the fare you intend to use to cover this part of the journey only allows you to sit in S class, then alas that fare bucket (or ""booking code"") has been closed (""C"") to waitlisting: you cannot even ask nicely for a seat. So which booking code are we allowed to use under our fare? The fare is called ""S50HK3"" so normally that would be the S booking code. In most cases the first letter of the fare name decides the booking code. However, there can be exceptions for specific flights [most obvious example: if you had a first class fare but not all planes have first class], and to be sure we need to check the Booking Codes table attached to the fare. Okay so we should use the S code. Alas! The S bucket is closed. So now we go back to the beginning and pick the next cheapest fare on the list. Once we have done this we will need to repeat the process with the return trip. And then we need to ensure the two fares are mutually compatible with each other. As you can see, pricing an airfare is a complicated business and requires a lot of work. This was a very simple example of a round trip fare. When you get into multicities, where for example, because of ""stopovers"", several cities might be covered by one fare, or you need to use fares from multiple carriers: it can be computationally very difficult to compute the lowest allowed price. People like http://www.itasoftware.com make a lot of money designing algorithms to compute the lowest price. I should emphasize that actually this is a problem for the airlines too. They have over the years created a system which is so complex that they cannot predict it perfectly either. This is why ""error fares"" remain quite common. There is also a lot of inertia in this system. It is used by hundreds of airlines and millions of travel agents, and is written into huge computer systems worth billions of dollars. It cannot be changed easily. While you will need a good travel agent sometimes, most of this is actually done these days by websites that sit on top of this 1980s interface. So thousands of these calculations are done every time you want to find out a price for a simple trip. All the time the ""availability"" (those numbers we saw at the end) is being constantly manipulated by the airlines to keep the price at the right level to keep the flight maximally profitable. It is my intention to demonstrate here, as well as giving a flavour of how it works, that pricing an airfare is a difficult mathematical problem to solve. Indeed, it has been proven that, strictly speaking, the problem is ""undecidable"", that is to say, it is mathematically impossible to design an algorithm that will always find the lowest allowable price under every circumstance. Many people suggest that the price of a journey automatically rises when you compare several fares. But you can see from my description above that this would be technologically challenging to implement to say the least. (It would probably also be illegal.) In practise, is more likely that the availability is being miscomputed or cached somewhere between the airline and your screen."
How to avoid hotels with bellhops in the USA,"You don't need to worry about this. Bellhops are always optional. Usually when you check in at a place with bellhops, (and they really only exist in higher end hotels), a bellhop will approach you and say ""Can I carry your bags?"". You just say ""No thanks, we'll be fine."" Sometimes the bellhop will carry the bags anyway, or the receptionist will sumon the bellhop without asking.. Even then you can decline the service. Just say ""We'll carry our bags ourselves, thanks"". Whatever happens, f they carry your bags without you asking you are completely entitled to not tip. You didn't ask for the service, and you have no obligation to pay for it. Actually you are always entitled to not tip. Tips are always optional, and if you don't want to tip, for any reason, that's entirely up to you. The situation where a bellhop stands around holding out his hand and looking at you pointedly happens only in movies. As a final note, bellhops are almost certainly paid less than minimum wage, and may not be paid at all. "
What can I do to prevent passport stamps being put on blank pages?,"If you have a brand new passport, then keep all the pages together with an elastic band, and only release new pages when the old ones are full.  This has kept things nice and orderly for me so far - the only place anyone took off the band was Taiwan where they at least stamped only the next page and not some random mid-passport place. If your passport is already in use, then a full page post-it note works fine and leaves no residue - write on it ""Reserved for Visa"" if you think that will help.  Make sure the sticky part of the post-it is towards the outside of the page so it's not so simple to just stamp underneath it. OA (@hippietrail) kindly found an example in the wild that had anecdotal success in Russian/English speaking regions: "
How can I avoid or minimize jet lag on flights?,"I find several things help, some are physical or physiological while others are purely mental: Don't take it as a sign of weakness if you get hit hard by jetlag. Some do and some don't. But there are things you can do that help."
"When flying on a very tight schedule, are you obligated to run to make it to the next gate on a connection?","It seems almost everyone is in the ""no"" camp, however there doesn't seem to be a lot of corroborating evidence presented. Here's an excerpt from American Airline's Conditions of Carriage Delta US CoC: Delta is not responsible or liable for making connections Delta International CoC Except as stated in this rule and as provided in Rule 55, Delta will
  have no liability for making connections... In the event of flight cancellation, diversion, delays of greater than
  90 minutes, or delays that will cause a passenger to miss connections,
  Delta will [accommodate passenger...] (Rule 55 doesn't appear to add anything substantial here) British Airways CoC: 9b3) If we: ... cause you to miss a connecting flight on which you hold a
  confirmed reservation; you can choose one of the three remedies set out [...] Qatar CoC: 2.2  Extension of Validity

  4.  Cause you to miss a connection The Validity of your Ticket will be extended until our first flight on
  which space is available in the class of service for which the fare
  has been paid. I expect most airlines will show some discretion especially if you're obviously incapable of hurrying to your connecting flight and it is at the other end of the terminal, but this discretion doesn't seem to be backed up in the CoC. There is some ambiguity in ""if we cause you"", since that might be possible to interpret as ""we gave you such a short connection that you couldn't make it"". A few anecdotes from flyertalk. They're not directly analagous to ""not running"", but do show that if the airline feels it's not their fault, it might not be yours either, but you may be the one on the hook for a new ticket: Missed connection due to someone else taking hand luggage. I therefore missed the connection, and they want me to pay rebooking
  fee and taxes and fare difference etc etc which costs like 500 usd Missed connection due to not feeling well. she was forced to buy 2 walk up Y tickets for about $1500 Missed connection due to falling asleep The agent told me that it would be more expensive to change my original

Does Venice smell?,"I was in Venice in summer 2013. It didn't smell bad, even though it was hot. We asked some locals (who we were staying with) about the legendary smell. Historically, raw sewage was simply dumped into the canals and (eventually) washed out to sea. This had been the status quo for centuries, with some improvement over the years but there was still lots of old plumbing. With increasing population and increasing tourism, the smell problem got steadily worse as the years went by. It was particularly bad on hot summer days. A while ago (maybe 10-20 years ago), the city recognised the smell as a problem and started a programme to clean it up. They did a few key things: Our hosts had to replace their former home plumbing system with a triple septic tank system a few years earlier. The overall result has been a dramatic improvement in the smell throughout the city.  So, my experience (on hot summer days) is that Venice smells just fine now. But it wasn't always this way."
Why is the departures level always above the arrivals level?,"Warning, guesswork ahead -- I couldn't find anything definitive.  Checked baggage is handled at ground level (i.e. that's where it comes out of the plane). Therefore it makes sense to have baggage claim on the same level to save the not inconsiderable energy it would require to move baggage up a floor (and then inconvenience people having to take it down again). Once baggage claim is on the ground floor it makes sense to have arrivals there to.  The other concern is that you need more space for departures -- people spend more time there and that's where an airport can make money with shops and things. In arrivals people are generally moving through the airport and leaving; as such not as much space is needed. That means you can use the extra space on that ground floor for all the behind the scenes stuff (such as baggage handling).  Also, many airport terminals are big 'hanger' designs and having departures (where people spend more time) upstairs means they get the space and the high ceilings, etc. People coming off a plane are not going to care that much about how high the ceilings are. I borrowed this last point from this thread discussing the same thing. It also notes there are more than a few exceptions to the convention. "
How to cope with too slow Wi-Fi at hotel?,"At first, I thought it would be sort of difficult to answer this. The only options are hotel WiFi and 4G/LTE, and it's not always easy to do much about the speed of those. (Except for the fact that the speed given by various 4G/LTE carriers may vary, so you could check reviews of those before picking your carrier.) Then I remembered something called Speedify. It's a multi-platform service which utilizes channel bonding to allow you to fuse multiple internet connections into one.  By using a technology known as channel bonding Speedify makes it
  possible to spread individual packets amongst multiple Internet
  connections. By splitting all your web traffic at the packet-level
  even large single socket transfers such as VPNs, streaming movies, and
  uploading and downloading files can be given a major speed boost!  This would allow you to be connected to an LTE mobile connection and the hotel WiFi at the same time. If speed is very important to you, you could even join multiple LTE connections together. Of course, for that, you'd need multiple LTE modems and SIMs. That would, of course, increase your expenses. But then, you're asking for high-speed internet while traveling, which is not going to be free in any case. You mention that both LTE and WiFi speeds are unstable and fluctuate. Being connected through multiple connections at the same time would be a good protection against this, as you'd maintain an acceptable speed even when one of your connections goes slow or disconnects altogether. Speedify review from Macworld. (4/5) Speedify review from TechVise. (9.1/10) Speedify review from PC World. (Generally favourable.) As you have now noted in a comment, this also doubles as a VPN, which may also be useful in certain countries.  You get 5 GB of free usage per month. After that, it's $8.99 per month or $49.99 per year. Disclaimer:  I'm not affiliated with Speedify. (Although I realize this answer probably reads a little bit like I am.)"

Is there a ZIP code I can enter when paying-at-the-pump in the USA with a foreign credit card?,"Many fuel dispensers in the USA (for sure in Hawaii, apparently elsewhere in the USA as well) accept the numbers-only from the postal code of a Canadian billing address followed by two zeros. So, if your Canadian billing address is right beside Schwartz's Deli in Montreal where the postal code is  H2W 1L2, you would enter '21200'.  Where the '212' are the numbers from the postal code, and the '00' is padding to get to 5 digits. Interestingly, if your billing address is in Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, Alberta where the postal code is T0L 0Z0, you actually would enter '00000'. Edit: I just tested this on January 23rd, 2014.  It still works."
Do flight attendants prefer I press the button or walk to the back? (Long-haul flights),"There is no specific preference, it depends on the person actually. Some do not like to be interrupted while they are at their position (usually the galleys) because it is sometimes the only place where there are no people and they can loosen up a little. Here are some general tips: Good times to use the call button: Good times to go yourself to the galley Ordering the first time via the call button then going yourself the second time is the best you can do in general, they will understand that you do not want to bother them. In case you go yourself and they request you to sit back and they will deliver it, do so. In long flights the crew usually have rest shifts after the first service until shortly before the second service. During this time the crew will be operating with half the number, but that shouldn't affect anything since most passengers are usually sleeping at this time as well. The only bad time is before the second service, when people starts to wake up and the half the crew is either still sleeping or just woke up, either way they will be preparing for the second service, so it's better to avoid requests at this time as I mentioned earlier.  There could be things I forgot, but again if a crewmember asked you to sit back and wait, do so and do not go back yourself again, it's a clear sign that he/she wants to you use the button, be his guest! sometimes this is simply due to airline policy, especially if the number of passengers standing at the back is becoming big, in the name of security.

Do I have to whistle really loud to hail a taxi in NYC?,"I've lived in New York City for most of my life, and I've never whistled for a taxi.

How to spot fake reviews on TripAdvisor?,"Here are some of the main signs I would look out for to decide if a review is fake. (note: updated with some points taken from a study on the matter) Overly hyped. While it is certainly possible that someone had an amazing time, the more hyped the review looks the more likely it is fake. ""Fake reviewers tend to overdo “self-referencing”, that is, they overuse words such as “I”, “me”, “my”, “mime”, as if they try to underline their existence and credibility.""

Sudden burst of posts. If there aren't many reviews for the property and then all of a sudden there's a bunch of new ones. It looks like someone decided to go bump up their rating. No background for the reviewer. If it's the only place they reviewed, it takes away from the trust. Glaringly different from other reviews. Unless there's been a renovation or change of management, generally speaking reviews are relatively consistent. Truthful reviewers tend to ""focus on spatial details (e.g., bathroom, floor, small, location) of their experience, while deceptive reviewers have difficulties in filling in spatial information.

When to use the emergency brake in a train?,"Building on the previous answers: If you notice a condition where any sensible mind would think that it is extremely dangerous for the train to continue moving. Dangerous here can mean: If another passanger’s life is in danger and the danger is technical in nature.
(e.g. them being stuck in the door as noted above) If something happens to the train that could endanger passengers if the train continues at full speed.
(e.g. an outside door falling off) If a condition happens where the train needs to get evacuated quickly.
(e.g. a large fire. Note that small fires are better extinguished on the spot.) Naturally, you want to make sure that the train doesn’t stop where evacuation would be extremely difficult (on a bridge) or where stopping in case of fire would be deadly (in a tunnel). In Germany, (Switzerland and Austria,) train drivers have a function called Notbremsüberbrückung or NBÜ which they are required to activate if one of the above. In Germany and Austria, this is even signalled on the hectometre signs next to the track. NBÜ is designed to stop the train at the next position safe for evacuation. I’m pretty sure all European countries have this under different names — or else they will have signs affixed to the emergency brakes stating the restriction. If anything happens to your carriage that would cause you to immediately hit the brakes when driving a car and a similar thing happens.
(e.g. chunks of steel stabbing through the floor.) The emergency brake can also be helpful if the train hasn’t yet actually left the station but is about to and you need help fast. For example, if another passenger collapsed and requires medical assistance. The reasoning why this should not occur en route is that it is easier for the paramedics to get to stations and they might even be ready at the platform awaiting the train. But if you are already at a station, time is only lost by travelling to the next one. I already noted that fires need to be large enough that extinguishing them on-site seems impossible for pulling the brake to be warranted. Likewise, if any physical attack originating from other passengers happens (e.g. robberies, shootings), the emergency brake is better not pulled but the train staff notified (so the doors can be kept closed if necessary until the police arrive). There had been a shooting on a local train in the Allgäu where the two suspects jumped of the train at seemingly rather low speeds (I think 80 km/h — on other segments of the route it does 140). One died on the spot, the other was severely injured and didn’t get far, so having a train in motion is the better option. And to complete the anecdotal evidence: Apparantly on one train route in Switzerland, somebody kept taking the express train that doesn’t stop at his station rather than the (slower) local one that did. He knew exactly where to pull the brake so that the train would slide to a stop exactly at the platform. Somehow, he managed to disappear before the train staff caught him (and they should have been warned because that had happened a few times). Unfortunately, the story is second hand coming from me, so I don’t know whether it was really true."
Denied boarding although I have proper visa and documentation. To whom should I make a complaint?,"In a comment, you wrote that Ryanair said ""People checks during boarding are not our staff, ask to the Airport"". I don't think that's correct. You are right.  Even if the person was employed by another company, that company acts as the airline's agent, and the airline is liable for the agent's actions.  You should absolutely be entitled to a full refund plus denied boarding compensation. (If Ryanair's liability to you arises because of the agent's actions, then Ryanair may have a claim for compensation against the agent.  But whether that is the case depends on Ryanair's contract with the agent, and the question is no concern of yours whatsoever.) Ryanair is unlikely ever to say so explicitly.  Instead, they will probably hope that if they keep telling you that they're not liable, you will eventually believe them.  Many people would believe such a statement, so this strategy is probably cost effective for them.  Therefore, you should not waste your breath or time trying to get them to concede the point.  Just file your formal complaint. The EU air passenger rights complaint form says that a complaint should first be submitted to the airline.  Your e-mail exchange may already satisfy that requirement, but if you decide that it does not, you should probably fill out this form and send it to Ryanair.  That will let them know that you know your rights and that you are serious about getting your refund and your compensation.  I might try that anyway, since if they get that message you might get your money sooner than you would if you complain to the German government. If you decide that your e-mail exchange does satisfy the requirement to submit the claim to the airline first, then you can send the form directly to the ""national enforcement body"" in Germany.  That is the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA)

http://www.lba.de The complaint should probably include the following: The fact that you subsequently entered Ireland under the terms of the program is good evidence that you were in fact eligible for the program, but the most important thing here is likely to be what Ryanair should have known.  I would therefore mention the subsequent visit to Ireland, but I would not dwell on it. In case it helps, here's what TIMATIC has to say.  TIMATIC is the database that the ground agent should have used to decide whether to issue a boarding pass and allow you on the plane: Visa Visa required. Visa Exemptions: Nationals of Turkey with a valid C visa issued by the United Kingdom if they have first entered the United Kingdom and been granted a stay of 180 days in the United Kingdom. They are visa exempt for a maximum stay of 90 days in Ireland (Rep.) or until the end of the period of stay granted in the United Kingdom, whichever is shorter. Passengers arriving in the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, and traveling to Ireland (Rep.), the visa waiver programme will apply and only a visa issued by the United Kingdom will be required. The visit to Ireland (Rep.) must be within the stay granted within the United Kingdom. Passengers are permitted to travel to a third country before traveling to Ireland (Rep.) if the visa issued by United Kingdom is still valid. Furthermore, re-entry into Ireland (Rep.) from a third country is permitted if the visa issued by the United Kingdom is still valid and period of the stay granted in the United Kingdom is still valid. Passengers with a long term visa must visit Ireland (Rep.) within a period of the current stay granted in the United Kingdom. Passengers arriving first in Ireland (Rep.) and traveling to the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, and then returning to Ireland (Rep.) will require separate visas issued by Ireland (Rep.) and the United Kingdom. However the visa issued by the United Kingdom will be accepted under the visa waiver programme for the return journey to Ireland (Rep.). Not applicable to C visas issued for the purpose of transit, marriage or to enter into a civil partnership. Passengers with a family member residence card issued by Germany. The card must be issued to family members of a national of Switzerland or an EEA Member State . In particular, note the second paragraph under the first bullet, which I repeat here with added emphasis: Passengers are permitted to travel to a third country before traveling to Ireland (Rep.) if the visa issued by United Kingdom is still valid. Furthermore, re-entry into Ireland (Rep.) from a third country is permitted if the visa issued by the United Kingdom is still valid and period of the stay granted in the United Kingdom is still valid. Passengers with a long term visa must visit Ireland (Rep.) within a period of the current stay granted in the United Kingdom. By ""detailed and specific,"" I mean that you should for example mention the date on which you were admitted to the UK and the length of your period of admission or the date on which it was set to expire, to make it clear to anyone reading the complaint that you did in fact qualify for the visa waiver."
Can I fly with a gold bar?,"Maybe not exactly the answer to your question, but according to this site (see Section XIV, Chapter 71, HS code 7108131000), Russia imposes a 20% customs duty on the importation of gold bars.  So unless you have 5.3 million rubles on hand to pay the customs duty (or can break off a fifth of the bar), expect the customs officers to hold on to your gold bar until you come up with the money.  Be sure to get a receipt!"
Long term travel without being wealthy - how is it possible?,"I recently travelled for 6 months through Asia. During this time I met many travellers who were travelling for much longer periods, some for several years. Most people like myself had simply worked and saved hard for a year or more then travelled through counties where it is cheap. I also met a couple of people who were working on their travels, a writer and an entrepreneur.  In South America and Asia you can travel very cheaply ($30USD or less). As long as you are willing to live frugally and save a good amount before you go you can go for a long time.  When you travel on a long trip like this you have 3 main costs.  So if someone saves say 10,000USD they could easily travel Asia for a year. Of Course that's a lot of money, but if you don't have children, a mortgage etc, and save aggressively it is very possible. The long term travellers I met came from all works of life, writers, programmers, nurses, students, factory workers.  A final note is that if you're alone your costs are higher. A couple can halve their accommodation costs as well as taxi/tuk tuk hire."
What's the best way to take a cold shower?,"While growing up I had to turn on the heater before taking a shower and sometimes when its getting late, you really don't have time to do that. Here's some advice which might help. I'm going to go ahead and assume that any hot water source is unavailable and you are in a frame of mind where the water is too cold!!! Okay so you don't like cold water, the best way to make peace with it is to convince yourself that it's not too cold. It's like entering a cold swimming pool, if you dip your feet in it for a while, it'll be easier for you to get in. When you wake up in the morning, your body temperature feels lower because you haven't had breakfast yet, that's a good thing because it makes it easier to ease into the seemingly freakish cold water. If you happen to have a shower, then turn the shower on and let it gradually touch your feet first, followed by your hands. Keep the water running and slowly ease in from the extremities of your body all the way to your face. You face is the part which you'll dread the most, so save it till the end after you feel like the body temperature going down. If you happen to have a jug and a bucket of water, follow the swimming pool strategy. Fill in the bucket halfway and dip your feet and hands in it. Then slowly start pouring down the cold water on your hands and proceed. One additional thing which might help is to have a towel on you. A towel which you could dip in the water and squeeze out/rub on your body will help. You have to remember, practice makes a man perfect! Doing it the first time is much harder than doing it the Nth time. After cooling down your body for a few minutes, hold your breath and step into the shower, as soon as you get into it, don't chicken out! The leap is the hardest, after it, it gets exponentially easier. Same goes with a bucket of water and jug, when you're ready, repeatedly take a lot of water from the bucket and pour it over yourself. You start doing it, don't stop! Water in which you were dipping your hands or feet it will actually be warmer and make it a bit easier, which is why I feel using a bucket and jug is easier with cold water. Remember, once you get into it, there's no coming back, there's no point doing the whole procedure from scratch again. So, keep pouring that cold water over you, it gets much easier when you keep doing it. Pause for short breaks only when you need to use soap or shampoo. Wash your body in little sections, torso at once, feet at once, hands at once etc. After you're done, get a fresh towel and hug yourself tight with it. I've done the exact procedure I mentioned a several hundred times in my life quite comfortably, of course I like my hot water, but where there's a will, there's a way."
Asking same flight customers if they would agree to put my knife in their checked luggage,"Sorry, it's a valid idea but it's not going to happen Do not transport items you have received from strangers If security asks the passenger  Have you received any items from someone else?  (which they occasionally still do), the passengers would have to either lie or a lot of awkward explaining to do. So yes, you could get in trouble since you are asking people to do something that security specifically and very publicly prohibits."
Personal security during a business trip to Moscow,"Update: as of March 2022, travel to Russia is unsafe for anyone.
The country is not even safe for its own citizens.
Anyone — regardless of whether you're a Russian national or not, no matter what ethnicity you are — may face harassment, death threats and legal action (up to 15 years in jail) for opposing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, or expressing any anti-war sentiment. These are very tangible threats which I have witnessed first hand. Additionally, various payment services, flights and apps are getting blocked or canceled, some by the Russian government, some by the foreign businesses themselves. That may leave you stranded, without money and reliable means of communication or even access to independent news sources. If you are in Russia: That all said, I will maintain that I don't think that being a foreign citizen would put you in a much greater risk category. I still think most people don't care about that stuff or may even express some interest and a degree of respect. But you must understand that right now it is dangerous for anyone who is not a Putin supporter. As long as Putin's presidency subsists, the safety risks will most likely continue increasing. The answer will need to be revised once more when the presidency changes. For the historical purposes, I'll leave the original answer below. I'm a Moscovite, so this answer is bound to be biased. Safety is a very relative notion, I perceive Moscow safer than quite a few cities I've been to in Western Europe and the US (or at least some of their neighborhoods). Anecdotally, I've once been detained by the US police for several hours out of the blue, so... yes, unexpected things happen everywhere. “I’ll get a rental car, take a taxi or hop on a train if necessary.” That concern was somewhat reasonable, as you could come across a dishonest taxi driver who would want to exploit you asking for a much greater fare than necessary. I knew a person from the US who paid almost $100 (20 times more than the norm!) for a trip from the airport.  [note: As pointed out in the comments, The fair rate for getting to and from the airport as of 2018 should be approximately $10-20 depending on the airport and the taxi company] Generally, ""vanilla"" taxis are quite a mess unless you know a reliable company, so you'll be much better off using Uber or Yandex Taxi. The aeroexpress trains are a great option if you don't have a car, they're extremely safe, reliable and quick. The cheapest way to get to the city would be buses and regular suburban trains (look up the directions on the airport's website). In all my life I've never had issues with either of those, but they may be slow (depending on the traffic conditions) and not as comfy. All in all, all of the public transport (metro, buses, trolleybuses, streetcars and suburban trains) in Moscow is very safe and cheap, though not always as fast and convenient as one could wish for, and may get very jam-packed during rush hours. (Most of its shortcomings may be mitigated by using Google Maps or Yandex Maps for finding an optimal route, in conjunction with Yandex Transport which lets you see all public transport vehicles directly on the map in real time.) Finally, avoid relying on jitney(marshrutki) minibuses ran by small local companies, because the level of their service varies wildly, similarly to taxi cabs. Cases when the driver flat out refuses to get you to your destination because the cab is not ""full enough"" have not been unheard of. (Anecdotally, I've had exactly that happen on my road to the airport with a route 948 minibus. Nearly missed a flight... not fun.) Has the security level for Americans truly degraded to the point that I shouldn’t be taking in the beauty of Moscow on my own, as I try to do in every city I visit, whether traveling on vacation or on business? I consider it mostly nonsense. That said, you should adhere to the basic tourist wisdom, which is not to let others see you as a confused and helpless foreigner who could easily be taken advantage of. If you're Caucasian and don't wear a striped red, white and blue baseball cap with some stars in the middle, or a t-shirt with the Liberty statue imprinted on it, few people would suspect you to be a tourist from the US. In conclusion, my advice to anyone visiting Moscow is simple: do not be afraid and visit whatever place you wanted to visit, as long as it's not a military base or something. If you fear the wolves, you'll never get to see the forest, as the old saying goes. Use the public transport to get to places (and watch some ordinary people in their daily commute!), visit the museums and theatres, try some of the local food, go for a stroll in one of the nearest forests and parks, or leave the hustle and bustle of the city and explore the suburbs and nearby cities. Just: Update: After reading all other comments and answers, I feel a disclaimer is in order. My answer applies if you are an ""ordinary"" person (e.g. a student, a retail worker, a researcher, an engineer, an artist, a small business owner) visiting Moscow for ""ordinary"" affairs which are of no concern to the corrupt officials or the mafia. Examples of such ""sensitive"" circumstances may include, but are not limited to, things like investigating corruption or money laundering, inquiries into the foreign policies and the military affairs of the country, defense of political prisoners and convicts, meeting with the leaders of the political opposition, LGBT rights activism, or you being a well-known multimillionaire. If you think there is at least one powerful and dishonest person in Russia who would benefit from having you(personally) suffer any harm, please exert caution and follow the safety guidelines given by your hosts."
"Should I say hello to the passport control officers, or just quietly give them my passport?","Saying hello indicates you speak at least some English, which avoids the need for the immigration officer to ask.
They may be interested in your accent - if you have a characteristic accent from some part of the country you're visiting, but have not lived in that country, they may be suspicious. The same could apply if you try to speak a little of the local language that is not normally learned by tourists. In the pre-Schengen days, a German friend who had taught himself some Danish was treated with suspicion at the Danish border as they suspected him of living there without being documented.  As a Scot, I find it useful to exaggerate my Scottish accent at US immigration."
Is it rude to give up your seat in Japan?,"I live in Japan and every day commute with trains and metro. And can assure you that nobody will think you are rude by offering the seat. From my personal experience: I have a rule to always give up my seat to The only thing is that I will confirm - many elderly people turn down the offer. Sometimes because they go out in the next station, sometimes they just don't want to. But in any case they will give you a polite response. I actually feel more pressure to stay near the seat I've given up, because Japanese will thank you many-many times after taking the seat and I feel shy of such attention for such a trivial thing. So long story short - feel free to show your kindness and don't over-think about some people seeing it as rudeness. Especially in Japan where people are usually very polite."
What to do if I overstayed my e-visa for Saint Petersburg/Leningrad Oblast,"First of all, if you are not fluent in Russian, you'll need (this is mandatory) an official translator to a language you speak fluently (in my case it was English, even though I'm a German). The smartest way to get one is to call a translation agency - several of these can be found in the city. After that, this is what you'll have to do (the translator should be with you at all times, because the Russian bureaucracy is exclusively in Russian): Important: do not buy any tickets until you've got certain confirmation on when you'll be allowed to leave the country. My original ticket was for January 5, now my departure will be January 23.
Today (January 21) I got my visa to leave Russia. If you're in this situation, calculate at least 10 workdays for the process. Find a good place to stay and explore the city while you're waiting for responses. If I forgot anything, please feel free to add it."
How to book a flight if my passport doesn't state my gender?,"The number of people without a gender is extremely small and therefore even the most progressive countries still issue passports with a gender field. Airlines have even less incentive to accommodate 'unusual' people and therefore put traditional gender options into the booking details. What your friend should do is pick whatever gender they like and simply fly as usual. If neither gender is preferable, they should pick the value that resembles their external features the most, e.g. female for long hair and soft features or male for short hair and a beard. If confronted about the mismatch, simply point out that their website doesn't provide an X gender option and therefore your booking is in fact valid. Most gate agents only check passports to verify the name and visa, so it's unlikely the mismatch would come up anyway. Nothing in the airlines' Terms and Conditions forbids gender-less people from flying, so you should be fine. If you'd like to promote the availability of the X option, I'd still write a polite email to the airline explaining your conundrum. If enough people point it out, they might get around to modifying their booking systems."
"How do you avoid ""tourist traps"" when traveling to a country where you do not speak the language?","Well, if you want to know something about culture of other country, why not to try solving general problems in that country? For example: Language barrier is not the problem - if you are polite and smile, people will help you.
But never go deep into the city you don't really know about.
Start with 500m away from your hotel."
"How big is ""too big"" for an airline seat? At what point will you be required to buy two tickets?","The reason why airlines implement a policy of asking overweight people to get two seats is an air safety issue of whether they can be strapped in properly. The guideline used for this is whether a passenger can fit between the armrests. If a passenger requires two seats, then the policy differs from airline-to-airline if/what the passenger should be charged for it. On London to Sweden flights, British Airways flies Airbus A319/A320-100/200 aircraft with a seat width of 17"" (43 cm) in Economy and 18.5"" (47 cm) in Premium Economy (""World Traveller Plus""). Premium economy is not as expensive as business class and if you have frequent flyer points, you may be able to get the upgrade cheap. SAS flies either McDonnell Douglas MD-80 (18"" (46 cm) seat width) or Boeing  737 (with 17"" (43 cm) seat width) depending on which flight you take with no difference in business class. Ryanair has the same 17"" (43 cm) seat width as BA, and easyJet has 18"" (46 cm) seat width - the difference is that seat pitch (distance) is a good 4-5"" (10–13 cm) less than 'full-cost' airlines. If that's not a concern, buying two seats on a budget airline will be cheaper. EDIT: BA does not offer premium economy class for short-haul flights."
"Error when applying for ESTA: ""Invalid Street Name""","Just keep clicking retry, and eventually, after a dozen tries, it will give you the option of accepting the address anyway and continuing: "
What is the purpose of check-in before flying?,"You are correct, it is a useless extra step in the age of electronic tickets and boarding passes. Therefore some airlines (e.g. Air France) offer automatic check-in now: Automatic check-in is a useful service that helps you save time: you
  automatically receive your boarding pass 30 hours before departure. No
  need to check in!  To use this service, simply book your flight on www.airfrance.com. The
  service is currently available for most of our flights for both
  departure and return. I'm sure that in the future 'check-in' will become an outdated term, just like 'smoking is prohibited' is now the default rather than the exception when flying."
Do I need a visa to transit (or layover) in the Schengen area?,"It's sometimes difficult to find the right information but everything is somewhere on the EU Commission website. Wikipedia has a good summary as well. Some embassies or government websites from the various Schengen countries also provide useful summaries. Legally, the main source for all this is the Schengen visa code. Here is a step-by-step guide through the rules to decide if you need a visa: If your next destination is in the Schengen area, you must pass through passport control to get to that flight, so you need a regular Schengen visa unless you qualify for visa-free entry. If you're going to somewhere within the Schengen area and already have a visa issued by that country, this visa also allows you to enter the Schengen area at a layover point in a different member country. If you can enter the Schengen area, you can also transit there. You can enter the Schengen area if you are an EU/EFTA citizen, hold a Schengen visa, a long-stay visa or residence permit from one of the Schengen countries, or are a citizen of a country whose citizens don't need a visa to visit the Schengen area. If any of these apply, you can stop here, you don't need a visa. If none of these apply, read further. The list of countries whose citizens don't need a visa to enter the Schengen area can be found on Wikipedia. They are also colored green on this map from the EU Commission. Many airports in Europe have an international area with transfer/check-in counters, waiting area, sometimes lounges, restaurants, shops or even a museum before the border checkpoint where the police check the passports of passengers entering the Schengen area. Gates for non-Schengen destinations can be accessed from this area, whereas domestic and Schengen-bound flights depart from other parts of the airport. Whether you can transit without leaving this area will depend on your specific connection (airport/terminal, airline, time). For example, some German airports close at night, so that it's not possible to remain in the international area for an overnight transfer. Luggage belts are typically after the passport check so if your luggage cannot be checked through to a destination outside of the Schengen area, you will also have a problem. Finally, as passengers' passports don't have to be checked on flights within the Schengen area, if you have two stopovers in the Schengen area (for example Mumbai-Vienna-Frankfurt-Chicago or Nairobi-Zurich-Frankfurt-Chișinău), you will have to leave the international area and go through the border checkpoint to catch your intra-Schengen flight. Same thing if you need to change airports. If you have to leave the international area to make your transfer, you cannot transit without a visa and you need a full Schengen visa (and not merely an “airport transit visa”). If you can stay in the international area (“transit airside”), read further. If you have come so far, it means you come from a country whose citizens require a visa to enter the Schengen area. But there is still a distinction between two categories of countries among them. While most people can transit airside without a visa, citizens of a smaller list of countries need an “airport transit visa” even if they don't want to go through the border checkpoint and enter the Schengen area. Where things get complicated is that the list of countries whose citizens need an airport transit visa is slightly different from one Schengen country to the other. There is a list for the whole Schengen area (list in Wikipedia, dark red/burgundy on the map) but individual Schengen member states can also add countries to the list. They have to inform the Commission, which keeps a list of all these requirements (current list as PDF, see also the same Wikipedia article). If your country is not on either of these lists, stop here, you don't need a visa. On the other hand, if your country is on one of the lists (the general Europe-wide list or the one from the country where you are going to transit), you might need an “airport transit visa” but read further as there are some exceptions. If your transfer requires an airport transit visa, there might still be a way to transit without a visa as the Schengen Visa code provides for a number of exceptions for people who hold some other visas or residence permits. Note that those exceptions only apply to the airport transit visa requirement. If you need to enter the Schengen area (see question 2), these exceptions do not apply. Specifically, you are exempted from the airport transit visa requirement if you hold a valid visa from an EU country (that's the whole EU, not only the Schengen area so also Ireland, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania), Canada, Japan or the United States of America.  Germany also recognizes this exemption for travelers returning from any of the above countries even if their visa is expired, but you should check with the country you're actually transiting through, because this exemption is not mentioned explicitly in the Schengen codes. You are also exempted if you have a residence permit from one of these countries or from Andorra or San Marino. If that's your case, you are exempted even if you are not traveling to this country. If you hold such a visa or residence permit, you can transit without a visa, no matter your citizenship or your destination. If you don't, you will need a visa. Furthermore, if you just used the visa (so that it's not valid anymore but expired recently), you can still transit without a visa in the Schengen area for the return trip. This rule does not fit US visas very well because it's possible to stay legally in the US long after your visa expired. Schengen regulations stipulate that holders of expired US visas can transit in the Schengen Area without a visa if returning from the US after having used the visa; however check-in clerks may exercise an overly cautious interpretation regarding US visas expired by a large amount of time, and consequently deny you boarding. As such, in this case it is highly recommended to get a written confirmation from the ground handling personnel at the airport of departure well in advance, or apply for an airside transit visa for the Schengen Area. No, you cannot. There are provisions for 15-day single-entry visas on arrival in limited cases (mostly seamen, EU citizens' family and emergencies) but it's not regular practice in Europe. If you need a visa, the airline/ground handling personnel at your departure airport will want to see it (they can be fined if they transport you without checking) and they will deny boarding if you don't have the right to transit in the relevant airport(s)."
"My hotel ""blocked"" 5,000 dollars when I arrived and now is taking again the money","It is usual for hotels to put a 'block' (a deposit) on your payment card for the total amount, plus some estimated incidentials. On a credit card, this has little consequences (unless you are maxed out), but on a debit card this really takes the money out for some days. Many hotels (same for car-rentals and gas stations) have signs at the check-in where they explain that and explicitly warn you about it. It is a significant reason to use a credit card at check-in (even if you prefer to pay with the debit card at the end). The deposit will normally be reinstated automatically when the block period runs out, normally about three business days, but it might depend on your bank, and potential intermediaries. The hotel should be able to cancel this deposit any time, but might not be willing to (as you still will owe them around 2k). They could replace it with a new 2k deposit, though. You should talk with the hotel to ask them to drop the deposit, or at last replace it with a lower one. Lesson: Don't ever use a debit card for check-in (unless you have heaps of cash in the account)."
Leaving Thailand after months-long overstay (can't pay fine),"This question has been asked many times, so I guess you've already found some nice resources (one, two) on this topic. If failed to pay the overstay fine, you'll most certainly get detained and imprisoned. So, your actions are: P.S. Jail in Thailand usually means a small crowded room with no furniture or even fan, lots of mosquitoes, sleeping on a concrete floor, and foreigners even need to pay for their meals.
Don't expose yourself for that."
Why do flight attendants say in safety instructions that you should put on your own mask before helping others?,"It's actually quite simple.  The reason they do this is to make sure you are able to help others.  What do I mean by this?  During an emergency where the air in the plane is thinning, it is important that you are able to breathe.  You can become light headed and if you are trying to help someone put their mask on and you are becoming dizzy, it isn't as effective if you are able to think clearly in the situation. Think about it this way, imagine you and a friend have been shot in the leg.  If you are in agony and can't think clearly, how much do you think you can help your friend?  Now imagine you have stopped the bleeding on your own leg and bandaged it.  You are now much more capable of providing aid to your friend. The same applies here.  If you are sitting next to your family and becoming dizzy, disoriented, and fumbling with your child's mask, you are not just harming yourself to save the child, but also not giving the best aid possible.  It is much better to put your own mask on, remain calm, think clearly, and provide aid to your family so that neither are hindered. I'd like to add this (sourced from here: Flight Safety) First of all you should know that in a commercial passenger flight the
  oxygen masks contain enough oxygen only for 12 minutes and after that
  everyone on board will go unconscious due to Hypoxia (oxygen
  deprivation). If the flight is at an higher altitude like 20,000 ft.
  or above, within 20 to 60 seconds one can get unconscious. This is the
  main reason flight attendants always advise you to put the oxygen
  masks first and then assist your children or other passengers – in

Which safety features of the German Autobahn make it possible to have no speed limits as opposed to every other country? [closed],"TL;DR: It’s religious cultural. A considerable portion of Germans consider the absence of a general speed limit a fundamental freedom and will strongly argue against any suggestions to abolish it. If a politician or political party were to suggest a general autobahn speed limit, they would lose a considerable number of votes – which is why it does not happen. I have experienced that even with very reasonable people (including university professors and legal professionals), it can be impossible to have a reasonable discussion about this topic. Note that this also applies to much higher limits than 130 km/h. As an example, see the discussion on this answer. This has often been compared to US weapon laws and bullfighting in Spain. If you speak German, this article in a prominent German online newspaper seconds my assessment.
The answers to this question also contain a few documents sharing this assessment. Of course it should be noted that the quality of German highways allows for the laws to be like this without a considerable number of accidents or deaths, and speed limits on highways do exist when the quality of the road or other circumstances would make no speed limit even less advisable."
Do I break the law as a foreigner in Germany if an embassy keeps my passport to stick a visa in?,"I asked the Bundespolizei on Twitter. This is their reply.  In English that reads Your documents are valid in general. You only need the originals to cross borders. It would be useful to have a copy, and to tell them about the AZR. AZR stands for Ausländerzentralregister, which is the federal German database of everyone who has a permanent residence or some other form of long-stay visa or asylum.  So this seems not to be a problem."
"WOW air has ceased operation, can I get my tickets refunded?","Do not assume your money is lost, contact your payment card issuer at once.  Regardless of debit vs credit, you should always contact the bank and let them tell you if it is possible to get your money back through them. They're in a better position to know because there are a lot of specific details and local regulations. My answer from this point on is based on the fact you paid with a Maestro card: These things often depend on country-specific regulation, but it appears Maestro does allow chargebacks (refunds) for failed travel providers. Their chargeback guide states on Page 357 Intra-European Message Reason Code 4855—Goods or Services Not Provided Failed Travel Merchant—Intra-EEA and Domestic European Transactions Only Chargeback Conditions. For Intra-EEA and domestic European Transactions, when the Cardholder contacted the Issuer claiming a travel service has not, or will not, be provided, and when the merchant is seeking protection from creditors, insolvent, bankrupt or in liquidation, at least one of the following conditions must be met: The travel service was covered by a bonding authority or similar scheme according to local law,
  and one of the following: – The Cardholder (or traveler) requested reimbursement from the bonding authority or similar scheme and did not receive it, or the claim was declined. – For Swedish Domestic Transactions: no additional requirement. The Cardholder (or traveler) is not obligated to request reimbursement from a bonding authority or similar scheme prior to the Issuer raising a chargeback. The Cardholder (or traveler) does not need to request reimbursement from the bonding authority
  or similar scheme if the Merchant, bonding authority or similar scheme publicly states that the
  bond is insufficient prior to the chargeback. The travel service was not covered by a bonding authority or similar scheme according to local
  law, or neither the Issuer nor Cardholder after reasonable effort can determine whether the travel
  service was covered by a bonding authority or similar scheme according to local law. Basically, it says you should claim from any applicable protection scheme first, but if it is not covered, a chargeback is possible."
A visa to visit the island that switches countries every six months?,"Multiple sources (English Wikipedia, French Wikipedia, Official site of Hendaye) all claim that the island cannot be visited. You could try to get a job in the maintenance department of Irun, which is in charge of the island, and hope to get assigned to cut the grass there. That would require a Spanish work permit."
How to use sinks with separate hot/cold taps?,I had the same problem after arriving to the UK. There are two basic techniques: Why did these nations decide to use this system and why haven't they replaced it with mixer taps is a mystery to me.
How to successfully haggle / bargain in markets,I have haggled over the scarfs on the Jemaa el-Fnaa square in Marrakesh. The starting price was usually around 200DH and I was able to buy for 65DH. I was totally unexperienced back then but I made some observations:
"What are these large, empty towers made of connected metal girders, bars or pipes in London?","Other posters have correctly answered that these are gasometers. But it's worth noting that they are no longer used at all; they were built when the UK mainly used town gas, which needed to be stored, but since the 1970s we have switched entirely to natural gas, which is piped in directly. Gasometers are now obsolete, and many of them have been demolished. Some are the subject of campaigns to save them, as examples of the UK's industrial heritage."
My online friend is asking for money in order to visit my home country. Is this a legit request or a scam?,"The first rule for every such question is simple: If you have to ask, it's probably a scam While we cannot possibly examine every possible situation from every angle, online scams are simply far too common to trust someone you have known only on the Internet or even what appears to be a real friend or relative, who may have had their email accounts hacked or might be simply being impersonated. So the basic advice is: don't send out your private details, don't pay for anything and don't send any money for any purposes. Some common examples are: If you know the person who seems to have sent the email asking for money in person, contact them in another way or have them answer a personal question only they know the answer to, before you accept their email as real. In many countries there are organisations to whom you can report internet fraud or suspected internet fraud. They also offer advice about common scams and how to recognise them. In the USA: The IC3 (part of the FBI) (further information from the FBI on romance scams)
In Canada: The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre
In the UK: Action Fraud The second rule for every such question is also simple: google this requirement A legitimate requirement, if exist, would be found on the relevant official sources, including the airline or Embassy web sites. For example, Indian nationals are required to show USD 500/week to enter Thailand. Many countries also require visa applicants to show means of financial resources. However cash is rarely accepted as such evidence (since one can just borrow it for a day), and depositing this cash in applicant's bank account a day before applying for a visa usually backfires."
Can I eat only a crème brûlée in Paris?,"Except for upper class restaurants serving only fixed multi-course menus, I have never (neither in France nor anywhere else) experienced a restaurant, where you could not order only a part of what is considered a complete meal. It might be an unusual request, but I would simply go into any restaurant you like and order a crème brûlée and a nice glass of wine or a coffee to go with it."
"How to answer ""Have you ever been refused a visa?"" if I've had a refusal overturned","As this answer makes clear, space is given on the form to explain any affirmative answer, and concealment of potentially negative answers because ""you don't think they matter"" or ""it doesn't count"" is looked upon with very little tolerance. My personal feeling is that you're better off being clear, and briefly clarifying the circumstances.  An answer of ""yes"" with a clarification of ""refused 20/6/15; reversed by ECM 17/8/15, refs ABC12345 DEF67890"" cannot be misunderstood, and doesn't lay you open to later accusations of misrepresentation."
What is a continental breakfast and what other types of breakfasts are there?,"Whenever something is referred to as ""continental"", you can be sure it's meant as the opposite of ""British"". The popular myth of the newspaper headline reading ""Fog Blankets the Channel; Continent Cut Off"" is another example of the attitude that spawned this dichotomy. In this case, a continental breakfast is the opposite of a full English breakfast and that is where the term originated. On the British Isles, a full breakfast (called a full English breakfast, full Scottish breakfast, full Welsh breakfast, or full Irish breakfast depending on the country; I'll use English in my answer since that's the most common term), is a warm — mostly fried — breakfast. Its exact constituents vary, but it usually consists of scrambled eggs, sausages and bacon, baked beans, fried tomatoes, and fried potatoes, sometimes with black and white pudding, or with fried up leftover vegetables from last night. It's quite a heavy meal. In the rest of Europe, breakfast is usually mainly bread with cheese, slices of meat, or sweet or savoury spreads. Breakfast cereals, sometimes. The only ingredients that are usually eaten warm are eggs or porridge. It is a bit lighter meal than an English breakfast Hot beverages such as coffee or tea are common to both. The main difference between a continental breakfast and a full (English) breakfast is cold vs. hot. A continental breakfast can be served cold, eggs having been boiled beforehand. The only hot ingredients might be the beverages — coffee, tea, hot chocolate.  This reduces cost for the hotel and allows for the breakfast to be served in just about any room; it's not unusual to see the hotel bar being used for this if the hotel serves only a continental breakfast.
The hotel doesn't need any cooks to be present, just waiting staff to serve it. If a hotel serves both a continental breakfast and a full English breakfast, the latter may be offered at a premium, since the costs to the hotel are higher as well. If you've had a continental breakfast that included scrambled eggs and other hot dishes, it most likely was a breakfast buffet, where the hotel offers something extra to its guests, ending up a bit in the direction of a full English."
What kind of things can you take from a hotel?,"I would say that it all boils down to how cheap you want to look, in the eyes of the hotel management. If you don't care, and probably you shouldn't, then there are some things you can take with you upon check-out.  As a general rule I would say: you can take anything that is single-serving. For the purpose of this answer, the definition of single-serving includes anything that, if opened/used, cannot be re-used by the next guest. Hence an incomplete list would include: soap bars, shampoos, sewing kits, shaving sets, shower caps, slippers, shoe buffing kits, chocolates, etc. Most of these items are often prey of serial collectors, in particular shampoo bottles and slippers. Hotel rooms often also include branded material like pens, pencils, notepads, postcards, and the like. These can be considered as marketing material. Every time you use the hotel's pen, for example, you will indirectly be advertising the brand. It is probably safe to assume that the hotel  management will be OK with you taking such items with you when you leave.  The mini-bar is a completely different story. You can safely assume that anything in the mini-bar will be chargeable. Some hotels however offer complimentary water bottles to their guests. When in doubt, ask. You could also be fighting the recycling crusade, and using your ecological struggle within to justify yourself when taking shampoo bottles. According to this article: I was shocked to learn that the vast majority of hotels in the US have no recycling program, meaning that untold millions of these plastic bottles end up in landfills each year. However, you cannot take anything that is not single-serving. This includes towels, bathrobes, coat hangers, sheets, pillow cases, etc. Towels and linen can be washed and re-used by other guests. Taking them would be considered stealing. You cannot of course take anything that is part of the furniture, or the design of the room. Here is a good read on the topic."
Why would a visitor destroy their travel document?,"Why would a visitor destroy their travel document? Not all visitors are genuine visitors with proper authorizations. Many asylum seekers destroy their ID before presenting them to the border control in order to avoid getting deported back to their original country. Then some people destroy their ID as soon as they get any hint of oncoming trouble with forgery, then they start making excuses about which document it was and how it got lost. Those passports facilitate in their removal from the UK if their entry is denied. When they are gone down the drain, they make the process a little complicated. A random example of such a complication RAWALPINDI: Pakistani authorities on Wednesday refused to accept six migrants after the FIA found that they had been illegally deported to Pakistan from the UK. About 36 others, who possessed travel documents, were accepted by Pakistani authorities – 34 of whom were allowed to go home after brief questioning. Two others were sent to the Anti-Human Trafficking Cell. On Thursday December 3, the authorities refused to accept 49 illegal Pakistani immigrants who had been deported by Greek authorities. Only 19 people were accepted following verification. The remaining 30 deportees were sent back to Greece on the special flight that brought them to Pakistan.

Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?,"Your first port of entry does NOT need to be the country which issued you a Schengen visa. When deciding which country to apply for a visa, this is determined by which country you're spending the most time according to your filed itinerary. Once the visa is issued, it does not matter what country is your point of entry. Technically, you should also stick to your itinerary as filed but I don't think this is checked at any point. "
Where can I find publicly accessible paternoster elevators?,"There is a fantastic website (albeit in German) called PatList (Archived Version) that lists every paternoster elevator in existence, as well as whether or not its publicly accessible. Currently there's about 300 such elevators left in operation (of which at least 50 are freely accessible to the public), so they're far from rare. Google Translate works well with the site, so it should be easy to find places to visit. Overall your best bet would be to travel to Germany and Czech Republic, as they have the bulk of the worlds remaining paternosters in operation. In fact I rode one this morning here in Prague :)"
Why do some hotels ask you to leave the key at the reception when you go out to come back later?,"I have encountered this practice in the past as well.  Once I actually talked to them about the reason for it. In that particular hotel, this was encouraged, but not required. They explained that there were two reasons (for that particular hotel): It's much easier for them to know when the guests are out, so they can go and clean the room.  They have had cases when the maid would knock on the door, receive no answer, and open the door with her own key -- just to find the guest still in the room, often in a state rather not expecting anyone to come in (this did include on a few occasions walking on people having sex) Minimise the risk of the key being lost/stolen. This reduces the cost in the long run - both in term of the keys/locks needing replacing, but also the liability.  In that hotel, the keys were quite distinctive, clearly showing the hotel name and the room number on the key.  If a key is lost, whoever finds it can just come in to the hotel, go to the room and steal something - and the guests would hold the hotel liable for the stolen property.  The sign at the reception actually stated that the hotel would bear no responsibility for guests' property left in the room unless the key was handed to the reception upon leaving the hotel."
How do I minimise waste on a flight?,"I recognize there are many answers already, and some very good ones:  It is true that the CO2 is also waste, and that it dwarves everything else connected to it. It is also true that you cannot always avoid flying, and in this case it is also good to minimize the impact. I'd like to focus on what you can do if you have to take the flight. I'll use Europe/New York flights as an example. Note that I didn't look at plastic waste specifically, but it is safe to assume that burning 1 kg of plastic has roughly the same environmental impact than burning 1 kg of jet fuel - they are both made from crude oil. It is virtually impossible to commercially provide in-flight meals without single-use plastic; and there is no airline that does. Any attempt to ""fix"" rather makes things worse:  If the airline has complimentary meals, they'll stock at least one meal per passenger. If you don't take it, it'll be thrown away, plastic included. Bringing your own meal just adds food waste to the equation. (On budget airlines it does have an effect to not buy the meal, see below). You could opt for business class, where they have reusable dishes, but you'll multiply your CO2 footprint that way. The best way to reduce your footprint is to avoid as many flights as possible. For business, you may be able to combine trips - e.g. going from New York to London, taking the train to Paris and flying back from there. You may also be able to travel less often, but stay longer each time. Savings for taking one trip instead of two: Around 1900 kg (50%) per one-way trip. These are probably the things that help most. Budget airlines will usually use new, fuel-efficient planes and pack a lot of people. Meals aren't included; they'll only pack as much as they expect to sell (meaning that not taking the meal actually has an effect and you can avoid the plastic waste as well). Many budget airlines don't offer in-flight entertainment systems which saves additional weight. All of this helps: If you go to New York from London, Norwegian Air Shuttle uses new 787 planes, while British Airlines uses mostly 777s or 747s. And Norwegian fits 350 passengers into a 787, while BA fits only 215. A ""high-density"" 787 flight will generate around 830 kg of CO2. A regular flight on a 747 will generate around 1200 kg; one on a 777 still 1060 kg. (A business class flight on a 777 will cause over 1900 kg). Savings: Up to 370 kg (19%) If you're in Berlin, and have a day to spare, you could get the train to London (41 kg) instead of the feeder flight (177 kg). Or take a train to Frankfurt (22 kg) instead of a feeder flight (130 kg) and a direct flight from there. Savings: 136 kg (0,7%) or 108 kg (0,6%) Using the values from other answers, an additional bag on the NY-London route would be around 14 kg of CO2 (23 kg * 0,2 kg of fuel per 6000km = 4,6 kg of fuel, times 3). This isn't nothing, but it is isn't that much either.  Also, buying new items at your destination may be even worse: Using the formula above, transporting a 0,2 kg shirt one way will cause about 0,1 kg of CO2 to be emitted, but producing a new shirt will generate about 3 kg of CO2. Savings for one less bag: 14 kg (0,07%) There are various offers to ""compensate"" your flight through a donation. While this doesn't undo the CO2 emissions, they'll use the money on projects to mitigate your impact to a certain degree. How much this helps is up for debate - it is certainly better to avoid a flight in the first place, if possible. However, if you cannot avoid a flight you may give this a try."
"Is crime an issue in the US countryside, especially for a cyclist?","I've travelled coast-to-coast in the USA a couple of times, and would say that in rural areas it's pretty much equivalent to the UK. Both countries have random attacks, but in both countries it's so rare that it shouldn't affect how you conduct yourself, although of course you shouldn't go around deliberately antagonising people. There may well be some scary places in both countries where you feel conspicuous and threatened as a noticeably wealthy (or wealthier) tourist. Race may play a part in this more than it does in Britain -- for example a white tourist will be very conspicuous in a poor black area in Louisiana. You'll notice, though, and go elsewhere, before any trouble happens, in daylight hours. On a random country lane, though -- you'll be lucky to see anyone at all. When you do they're almost certain to be very friendly (and usually very excited to meet someone British -- even if they initially assume you're Australian). For a Brit in the red states, unless you're significantly to the right of the British political norm, it's a good idea to steer conversation away from certain topics to do with politics, religion and sexuality. You probably have watched too many scary American films. Watch Eden Lake to even things up :)"
Is standing actually illegal in Venice?,"No, standing is not illegal in Venice. I think the quote got lost in translation. The Italian version says: È proibito comunque sostare per consumare cibi o bevande ad esclusione delle aree in concessione ai Pubblici Esercizi.   As a native Italian speaker, I would translate this as: It is forbidden to stop to eat or drink except in areas designated to Public Spaces Used Commercially (i.e. bars, restaurants, fast-foods, ice-cream vendors, etc.). Which basically means ""no picnics"". "
Why do airlines offer more varieties of special-request meals than they actually provide?,"What the other answers don't mention is that the special meal types are part of a standardized system developed by the International Air Transport Association (IATA): IATA Meal Codes. These codes are used by airline Global Distribution Systems and the airline Computer Reservation Systems that back them to keep track of passengers with special service requests (there are also codes for passengers who need wheelchair assistance and other special services). This standardization is important, because it allows for consistency across all the flights on an itinerary. You might be traveling on three different airlines, but you can request a lacto-ovo vegetarian meal (VLML) for your trip, and every airline will know what that means so they can serve you accordingly (in the ideal case where the system all works anyway). Many airlines will trim down the list of choices on their website so as to avoid disappointing people who order a birthday cake (CAKE) and find out the airline doesn't do that, but the actual set of meals that can be ordered in the booking system is anything that appears on the list of codes. There's no part of the system that says ""oh, we don't have the contract catering facility in Beijing make VLML meals, so you can't choose that for this flight."" One flight may offer one, one may not, but everyone uses the same codes. However, every airline doesn't offer every type of special meal, and the meal you receive on a particular flight will depend on the airline, the route, class of service, and the catering facility the airline uses. So when the airline's computer system sees you've ordered a VLML, it instructs the catering facility to give you something that satisfies your criteria, which would include a vegan meal. That is sometimes an airline-wide policy, or it might apply just to flights from that particular station, and you could try to seek out airlines that do not have this policy where possible. While you view special meals more akin to ordering choices off of a menu, my perception is that airlines see them more of a way of accommodating passengers with a special need. You tell them what your need is (a meal that doesn't contain fish or meat, but is allowed to contain dairy or eggs), and they give you something that fits within those conditions. They're not short order cooks allowing you to choose off a menu, but rather they are satisfying your request for a special accommodation. The list of special needs is larger than the list of available accommodations.  In short, the broad list of choices comes from the industry standard set of special meal choices, but the limited number of actual meals the airline serves comes from their desire to cut costs and simplify their operations.  You could always try to ask the crew if they have any extra non-special meal trays, telling them you don't need the entree. If they have leftover food, you could grab the yogurt or cake or other sides and enjoy them with your vegan meal."
"With the passing of Thai King Bhumibol, are there any customs/etiquette as a traveler I should be aware of?","One must understand that Thai citizens are very sensitive about the loss of the King. Unlike political parties, where controversy is normal, HM King Bhumibol was sincerely beloved by everyone in the country. As a foreigner, your goal can be stated in one phrase: don't make it worse. The reason is simple: many your actions that could be tolerated in a normal situation, may cause you trouble these days. It's my personal opinion that if your planned visit to Thailand can be rescheduled you should do so."
I was denied boarding due to outdated information on passport validity? What to do?,"Check-in staff go by Timatic, which is based on information provided to IATA by local immigration authorities. They won't change their mind even if you call an embassy in front of them. Unfortunately there is a misunderstanding on your part: it is not the 3-month passport validity requirement in and of itself that was new, but the 15-day visa exemption altogether. This, however, has been around for a good while now and is definitely stated in Timatic Regarding document validity, however, Timatic states: Passports and other documents accepted for entry must be
    valid for a minimum of 6 months from the arrival date. In other words, the embassy website was outdated, which they often are, which is why I personally advise people, with a few exceptions, to never trust embassy info over Timatic. Unfortunately, your chances of getting compensation are slim, because you did not comply with the requirements. The truly annoying part is that the check-in staff is required to ensure you comply with the requirements, but not to inform you of what the requirements are. Instead, they say ""we don't know, not our responsibility, ask the embassy"", not giving a damn about the fact that the embassies' info may be (and often is) inconsistent with that in Timatic. On the day of travel, as if by magic, suddenly they know exactly whether to let you board. Like I said, they go by Timatic, which is why I always recommend travellers to familiarise themselves with it. Although it's only meant for professionals, I can't count the amount of times me being familiar with it has saved the day (most recently when boarding a Zurich-Kiev flight - they didn't want to let me board with my national ID card, but when I insisted that I can transit at Kiev and asked them to check Timatic, I got onboard) Off-topic: the best way to get familiar with Timatic is through this interface (general search, individual search). You'll end up with a great traveller tool that, for the most part, can safely be relied on. Because remember, whatever you see in there yourself, that's what check-in clerks will see as well"
"No Facebook account, will I be able to visit the US?","I'm going to answer this to cover two aspects - social media accounts for visas, and social media access AT the border, since they're related and will probably be asked as well. Currently for some visas, you're now asked for your social media accounts as a foreign  traveller to the US. The US government has begun asking select foreign travelers to
  disclose their social media activities as part of an expanded effort
  to spot potential terrorist threats. The request functions as a prompt on the online Electronic System for
  Travel Authorization, or Esta, a visa waiver application that many
  visitors are required to submit before travelling to the US. The
  choices include platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+,
  Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube, and additional space for applicants
  to input their account names on those sites. However, obviously not every person has a social media account (including members of my family).   The CBP has stated: it wouldn’t prohibit entry to foreigners who didn’t provide their
  social media account information. It's a weird request.  In theory if they find someone suspicious, they could use their social media to look up more info about them.  Equally, it could help clear them.  However, much like some of the other questions (are you a member of a terrorist organisation), it's unlikely any 'problem person' is going to volunteer their social media accounts.  However, others feel insecure if they don't complete a full visa application, and the information may be used for other things, like cross referencing with other govt organisations wondering who the followers of x are, or who is tweeting from y. However, that's speculation. The key answer to your question, again - for now, is: it wouldn’t prohibit entry to foreigners who didn’t provide their social media account information.  Similarly, if they ask you for your actual login credentials (eg password), and you say you don't have one, it can't be held against you.  However, if YOU did have one and said you didn't, and it was later found to be a lie, then you've lied to a government official, and THAT can be held against you."
Where is the quietest place on Earth?,"One journalist did attempt to research this - both the artificial labs and the natural spaces.  He details it in his book - Zero Decibels if you'd like to read it. The highlights in nature: Several years ago, the Campaign to Protect Rural England declared a spot in Northumberland the most tranquil place in the country (when the nearby military base isn't doing training exercises). 12 such quiet places exist in the US, with more found around the world. A spot in the Hoh Rainforest in Washington is one, as are places in Grasslands National Park in Canada, Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota and Haleakala National Park in Hawaii (see gallery). The others, however, he keeps confidential. On the other hand, he identified a quiet place deep in the Ecuadorian rainforest,  he suspects other such places in Poland, Norway, Sweden and Finland Recently, a map of the USA was created to show the quiet spots on a summer day. So that gives some idea for sound levels in the US. As you'd expect - away from people, cities, and wildlife tends to produce quiet, although windy areas also affect it. Aside from nature, he points out the quietest places are custom built, such as the Anechoic Chamber at Orfield Labs, in Minnesota.   Tours to the lab: ""Group tours are available a few times a year and include a brief stop
  at the anechoic chamber (call the lab for details). But the facility
  has had so much interest in the 45-minute challenge that the founder
  Steven Orfield is considering making that option available to the
  public within the next year, and is working with the Guinness Book of
  World Records to establish an official record for the longest time
  spent in an anechoic chamber. The 45-minute challenge will not come cheap, however, as companies
  renting the space normally pay $300 to $400 an hour, and someone
  trained from the lab must be able to supervise the participants to
  ensure their safety. "" UPDATE: As of this month, Microsoft now officially holds the Guinness World Record for quietest place on earth - inside Building 87 on the sprawling Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington."
How to avoid accidental trespassing while exploring rural US?,"If you're not on a road, you're probably on private property unless otherwise indicated (at least for places East of the Rocky Mountains... the situation in the West and Alaska is quite different.) National or state parks would be the primary exception to that. Granted, there are many of those in Tennessee and North Carolina. If there's a specific property you want to visit and you know it is private, you really should seek permission from the owner first, unless the owners have indicated that their property is open to the public. The lack of a fence or ""No Trespassing"" sign does not mean that the property isn't private or that its owners welcome the public to wander around their property. When you're on the road, public roads will usually have street signs. Roads with no signs at all are more likely driveways which are privately owned. A mailbox and/or sign indicating a street address beside the road is a good indicator that it's actually a private driveway and not a public road. Regarding the particular Google Maps link in the question, unfortunately, there's no Street View there, so it's not easy to tell if there are any signs there. When you're looking up properties online, fortunately, GIS is a thing. It turns out that some (all?) U.S. states have public GIS systems with data from the county property ownership records. North Carolina and Tennessee are not exceptions to this. Unfortunately, I don't immediately see a way to provide a link with a particular place focused in the North Carolina system's interactive map. However, I was able to find the particular property you linked and it is indeed a single private property. The area outlined in teal below is the property on which the road you pinned lies, so it is indeed just a private driveway, as it appeared. The actual road you pinned is not shown on the map below, as it's not a public road, but you can see the intersection of the public roads by which it lies. 
Screenshot of pinned map location on NC's Parcel Map Tennessee has a similar system."
Smartphone taken from baggage while on layover,"The airline is liable.

What are the hidden fees of a cruise?,"The cruise line will try to sell you excursions at the ports you visit at a high price, sell you extras like portrait photographs, tempt you to gamble in their casino and shop in their stores selling jewellery, watches etc. You can of course choose not to spend any money on things like these. Cruise line often come with the guarantee they will wait for you if you are late for returning for the ship from a paid excursion arranged by the cruise liner. If you go ashore your self it’s possible you could get left behind if you are tardy. Alcohol packages often cover basic drinks, if you have a taste for finer things an aged whisky or brandy you’ll pay an excess on your bill in such cases. There are on some cruise lines premium dining and entertainment options at an extra cost. Spa treatment, massages etc are extras on many cruise lines, some larger ships with families have adult only areas with cabanas etc. for people who want not to have rugrats spoiling their holiday that you pay to hire. Tips to staff are expected on many cruise lines, I am British so the cruise lines I book with have tips included in the fares we are too embarrassed to tip in person so. Internet connections are another way they make a lot of money from you those packages are really steep, but you could have and electronic detox on holiday. Thanks to Willeke and mKennedy for their suggestions."
Is it offensive to the chef/host to finish all food on your plate in Italy?,"I would say it's the other way around. Italian chefs don't like to see leftovers on the plate as it could signal that you didn't like the food. Once, in a local bar in which I have lunch every day, I left with an unfinished plate on the table, and I was interrogated the next day to make sure nothing was wrong with the food. However, there is another activity in Italy called: Fare La Scarpetta, which means, after finishing your food, you clean the plate from the sauce with a piece of bread (like this).  As written in this article: Italy could be divided into two groups: those who do the scarpetta, and those (few) who don’t. Doing Scarpetta is considered an informal activity and you rarely find people do it in the restaurants (especially in the northern parts of Italy)."
How to survive a timeshare promotional trip?,"It's very easy, just smile and say no.  Yes, the sales pressure is high, very high, but...so what?  You are not obligated in any way to buy anything. As for hidden fees, well...sure, there might be a resort fee and of course taxes, but you should settle all of this ahead of time, before the presentation. How to handle it?  Well, it's just two hours with snacks and touring the properties isn't that bad, some of them are pretty nice.  You hasten the process by staying in motion, skipping the snacks, asking only superficial questions. Also, do the presentation first, before any other activity, like right when you get to Orlando. Note, you can't get out of the pitch.  That's the whole point.  All you can do is get it over with as expeditiously as possible.  And also note, both of you must be present.  They will not pitch to half of a couple. I've done these on occasion and the presentations from the well know operators are not at all shady, Marriott, Hilton, Disney... Finally, just say no.  Then no, again...and again... One counter I gave that the salesperson really had no good response for was points.  Say because of work travel, you have half a million* whatever points and that's good for two weeks a year for 10 years. *This is just a high number.  You may have to adjust for your preferred program."
How to get rid of the men who ask for money in Milan?,"Answer by a local here. I work 200 meters from Duomo of Milan, so I find them at the underground exit every morning. First and foremost, remember that most of the people doing this are pushed by a local ""mafia"" system. Therefore a good amount (from 70 to 80%) of their pay is just thrown away, and they live in a deplorable condition, so if you don't want to give them money, please be gentle anyway. If you don't want to give money to them, you can put your hands in pockets and go away ignoring them (putting hands in pockets is the main important thing here, as I said before, that I experience this every day).
Just don't in any moment stop to give them an answer, or anything, you'll be ""caught"" in their chats, and you will no longer get rid of them.
Saying GRAZIE, or NO doesn't matter if they have chosen you as their target, so just walk away as if you had something important to do (in Milan walking fast everywhere is pretty standard, you won't be seen as a crazy). In Duomo there are many police, since the recent terrorist attacks in Europe, so the police sees these men and know they are there, but they don't do anything except if someone goes to them and reports a problem, but they are anyway reluctant to catch them, because they are just the ""last man"" behind a criminal organization and they are basically just trying to survive. The last sentence, this is mainly a personal one, if you don't want to give money to them, and you'll visit Milan in winter/autumn , and you are ""caught"", offer them to buy a coffee or a cappuccino (from 0.8 to 1.2 € in the nearby McDonalds 50 meters away) and you will be their ""savior"" for all the day; furthermore, you are sure what you'll give them is basically for them, and not for a criminal organization behind. Enjoy your visit in Milan!"
How to spend a night in an unknown city without a hotel? Is there a guide or resource online?,"There is certainly no guide to cover it all. First, if the airline is at fault, they normally provide accommodation and meal. This has happened to me several times over the years. You must insist to get your vouchers as soon as possible though. The last time something like that happened the airline told me I would get my vouchers on arrival from the customer service desk. Only the plane arrived so late, it was closed. I had to pay transport cost on my own to another airport nearby and there they had someone who (after several) hours gave vouchers for me and my family. Second, I would go to Sleeping In Airports. Yes, I know, you said sleeping at that airport is not an option but this site covers other options around the airport, including hotels and lounges. Third, I would try both Expedia and Booking.com. Expedia allows you to check if there is a hotel or not within your price range and sort by distance to the airport. Booking adds many other options that are not hotels. In places where I cannot afford the results from Expedia, I usually find something reasonable on Booking.com, often a third or quarter of the minimum price on Expedia. Those places may not be up to par with expectations of a hotel but it's better than nothing. The rest really depends on the city. In some places, if you have a sleeping bag, you can manage to sleep in a park or even on a beach. In others, they may find your body later! In Asia, some temples have sleeping areas. Sleeping in a camper or car is another option. It sounds silly to rent it just for sleeping but you can have a sleeper and cars for much less than a hotel. The last time I rented a sleeper it cost 65 Euros and the last time a car cost me $23 USD, so it's something to consider! However, before renting, you need to check if sleeping in a car is allowed near where you are. You may have to drive to a rest area but not always easy to figure out, considering different laws around the world."
"What happens if you declare more than $10,000 at the US border?","I've done this once (doing all the right paperwork up front). They pulled us out for questioning: ""where does the money come from"" ""why do you need this"" ""what are you planning do to with this"", ""why do you use cash"", etc. The amount of questioning will depend on how much you fit into any ""suspicious"" category otherwise. There is plenty of profiling going on there. Fortunately we were ""mostly harmless"" for everything else (white, middle class, small children it tow, from a ""good"" country). You also need to be careful how this looks against your visa status. If you have a non-immigrant Visa or an ESTA, carrying lots of cash can be interpreted as ""intent to immigrate"", in which case they can turn you around and send you back.  Unfortunately customs and immigration officers in the US have a lot of leeway and discretion and not a lot of rules to keep them grounded. Could be harmless, could be lots of trouble, hard to predict."

What's the difference between embassies and consulates?,"From the perspective of a traveler, there is almost zero difference. Both embassies and consulates are representative departments of a foreign country/government within another country. Technically, an Embassy is where an ""Ambassador"" is based.  As there can only be one Ambassador for a specific country, there can only be (at most) one Embassy.  As the Ambassador is the highest ranking representative of that foreign government, the Embassy is thus also deemed to be the highest level of representative location. A consulate is similar, but generally deemed to be a lower ranking due to the lack of an Ambassador. Consulates will generally be smaller - often being more like an office where the embassy often doubles as the actual residence for the Ambassador and/or some of his staff. Some countries may not have an embassy in a specific country, but may only have a consulate there. This will occur in the situation where there is no ambassador assigned to the country. From a travel perspective, both will generally provide the same services, and normally location will be far more relevant than the name.  In some cases consulates may be slower to process requests as they may simply pass them onto the Embassy rather than doing them themselves. eg, the Australia consulate in San Francisco does not issue new passports - they are forwarded to the embassy in Washington DC, however all passport requests from people in the San Francisco area must be done via the local consulate and can not be sent directly to the embassy!"
How can I avoid ordering multiple bottles of water at a restaurant?,"Your in Europe is an overgeneralization. But that does not solve your issue in individual cases. So: This has nothing to do with etiquette, anyway. You have a medical condition, that goes beyond etiquette.  I have a medical condition that requires me to drink a lot.Can you bring me 2 liters of tap water to go with the meal? Do not make it more complicated than that. If they refuse to accommodate you, walk out.On your way out you may want to inform the manager why you're leaving. (And of course, don't complain if they charge you something for it. That's fair)."
Is there a good website to plan a trip via trains in Europe?,"Seat 61 is the absolute definitive guide for international rail travel.

"I've been warned to leave the US within 10 days as I will ""overstay"" my visa, but I have legally left the country by plane months ago. What can I do?","First, check that this is a genuine warning. Check it for the usual signs of a scam email (faked ""from"" address, links you to a website that does not end in .gov). Contact US immigration on a publicly available email or number (not by any contact that you were given in the warning) and check with them.   If it turns out it is genuine, it is probably not as serious as you think. It's most likely just an administrative mixup. When you contact immigration they will tell you what you need to do, but most likely if you simply give them the date and flight number when you left that will be the end of it.  They will almost certainly be able to verify that you were on that flight, and that will probably be the end of the matter. Also remember that, even if for some reason they don't believe that you left on the flight you did, you don't need to prove you left on that flight, you only need to prove you left before the end of your legal stay, ten days from now. The easiest way to do that is probably to make some sort of visit to someone official, like a government office or the police or a lawyer, where your visit will be recorded and you can provide information. But something as simple as records of an everyday transaction will help - a few records of you using your credit card in your hometown is going to be evidence, and is probably good enough."
What are these stamps in my passport after I was advised to divert via the UK but didn't have a visa?,"The first stamp means that your exit from the Schengen area was cancelled.  This is a good thing, since if you had been allowed to exit the Schengen area, you would not have been able to fly from the UK to Italy. The second stamp means that you were refused entry into the UK.  You will have to report this if you're ever asked whether you were refused entry.  If you explain the circumstances, the refusal is not likely to have much of a negative impact.  The key points are:"
"To travel 30 km from India to Sri Lanka, do I really have to take a 1500 km, 20 hour detour?","There are currently no ferry services running between Sri Lanka and India. There have been various proposals (some of which even started running for a short while in 2011, 2012 and 2015) but none of them have lasted. Your best bet is probably to fly from Tiruchirappalli Airport (roughly in the middle of your first screenshot) to Colombo. Sri Lankan fly twice daily from here to Colombo, do this would cut around 4 hours off the drive on your first day but it would by no means be quick. I have no idea if a local fisherman or someone would take you across but if someone can confirm that they do then that might be the best option."
Job interview in London requires me to wire money to the travel agent. Is this a scam?,"Based upon what you wrote, you are getting ripped off. It means you are the victim of a con. A UK emergency travel document is issued to British citizens only. They will never issue an emergency travel document to a foreigner.  That's the job of the foreigner's country. Issuing a UK work permit (or UK visit visa) at the UK border (or airport) flat out does not happen.  If you need a visa, you need to get one before you depart.  While non-visa nationals do not require a visit visa, you're asking the question and framing yourself as a visa national. Visa fees are collected by the UK government as part of the application process.  There's a screen near the end of the application for the applicant to enter payment details.   Nobody gets in to the UK on a work permit (or visitor visa) without enrolling their biometrics.  Absolutely nobody. To do that the applicant has to print out the form and take it to a VFS or similar enrollment centre.  There is no way to avoid a personal appearance and what your agent proposes to do by sending you everything does not account for your personal appearance. Nobody gives an interview invitation and job offer at the same time; a company can lose their migrant license for doing that. There is no 'hard copy' of an entry clearance. It is a gummed
vignette affixed to a full blank page of the passport. The Sting It's likely that you were enthralled by the prospect of employment in the UK when you were offered a ridiculously attractive package which included a great job, all expenses paid, and a work visa.  They need you to pay all of the expenses in advance and will refund this to you upon arrival.   After you send them the money, they will contact you explaining that an additional advance payment needs to be made to cover an administrative expense associated with your MasterCard. Once you send the additional payment they will contact you advising that another additional payment needs to be made because someone in UK immigration needs to receive a small 'discomfort' fee. Once you have paid that, they will explain that the CEO of your new company doubts your intentions and you will need to put up a payment to demonstrate your sincerity. After that, they will think up something else that you need to pay.   This cycle of additional payments will repeat itself until you are bled dry. After that they will disappear. websites that offer jobs in the UK that do not exist. If you apply for
  one, they tell you that you have the job and ask you to pay visa and
  work permit fees. That is not how our visa system works, and there are
  no shortcuts to a job in the UK. A genuine employer would direct you

What happens when a town is under quarantine and my visa expires,"Medical emergencies (which this definitely is since they have quarantined the city) are a valid reason for a visa extension. Make sure, however, that you notify the relevant authorities ASAP. Do not think that you can just stay until the quarantine is lifted and then leave as usual without proper extensions etc. Immediately contact the relevant authorities and figure out what the procedures are in this special case. As long as you this in the proper way you should not have any problems."
"What is a ""French bed room"" in German hotel terminology?","German double beds are usually equipped with two mattresses. A 'French bed' (französisches Bett), on the other hand, is a bed wide enough for two persons, but equipped only with one mattress.  They are usually narrower than regular double beds, the most common width is 140cm, but not necessarily. If you look into bed shops with a wider selection of products, you can get 120, 140, 160 and 180cm-wide French beds: Die Breiten variieren von 1,20 bis 1,80 m.  The name allegedly comes from the 'cosier' way French people tend to spend their night. German partners obviously rather stick to 'mine and thine' sides of the bed, with a clear separation line for extra protection."
Are there any flights which permits a Sikh to carry a kirpan?,"For whatever reason the subject comes up in context of the Bill introduced in New Zealand with respect to Maori.  In addition to that the article also has specific information regading kirpan: The Sikh Centre brought to the select committee the need to be sensitive to the diverse cultures and beliefs of individuals passing through airport control to ensure they are not unfairly targeted during security checks. For their part, the Sikh community has made a conscious decision to recommend that their kirpans (ceremonial knives) are removed from under their robes, and included in their check-in luggage. Contrary to perhaps the preconceived view, the kirpan should be appreciated as a symbol of the Sikh religion, not a weapon. Similar discussion from New Zealand parliament. In addition kirpans are not allowed on the planes as per new TSA regulations. One thing in common to all these is that they refer to security rules imposed by ICAO with respect to carrying weapons on airplanes. And if this is not enough you can take a look at the FAQ from Sikh Coalition Section on Kirpan: What happens when a Sikh goes on an airplane? Do you have to take the kirpan off? At the present time, Sikhs put their kirpans into check-in luggage and do not carry it with them on an airplane."
Why are some hotels asking you to book through Booking.com instead of matching the price at the front desk?,"I'd expect this to happen to chain hotels where, as you guessed, the front desk has zero price matching powers. And the chain already allocated those rooms to booking.com -- it's even possible you can't get a room from the front desk even though booking.com has them. Insanity or not, this industry is very inflexible. Also, I'd think the main reason is bookkeeping // accounting // card handling -- consider how easy it is for them when dealing with booking.com, it's essentially ""here's a bank wire for all the rooms we sold this month"" (possibly it's not for the single property but per corporate parent!) versus ""here is a credit card which might or might not be stolen for my single night stay""."
Why do public toilets in the US have large gaps (no privacy)?,"I can't find a definitive link but there are a few reasons, a lot of which were already covered in the comments.   One, the style in your picture makes the whole place easier to clean. You can hose down the floors in one go and there are not so many joins between the walls and the floors for gunk to build up. (EDIT: in your picture you can see that the toilets don't even join the floor -- so for that setup I'm pretty sure it's for ease of cleaning).  Two, it's so that people can see what you're doing in there. It discourages drug taking or people having sex in the cubicles because it's obvious what's going on. Also if someone passes out on the toilet (for whatever reason) it's easier for people to notice -- in a fully obscured stall someone could lie in there for a long time. It may also just discourage people for sitting in there for longer than necessary.  Lastly, it's cheaper and easier. Divisions like that can be deployed in any room regardless of the flatness of the floor, or the height of the room, etc. Building divisions that actually fit floor to ceiling might require custom cutting and fitting, that might happen in a big building with dozens of identical toilets but for the odd public toilet cheap and easy is the way people will go.  To add to choster's comment, it does tend to vary widely across the US. I've seen toilets with even less privacy than that picture -- like a door that's you can see over when you stand up. The concerns about misusing the toilets tend to trump the privacy, particularly in public places. But you're right, in many private places they will be more sealed. And there're many places in the world where you'll be lucky to find a door at all -- or many people that care that there's no door there. "
UK visa refusal on V 4.2 a + c (and sometimes 'e'),"You applied for a Standard Visitor Visa and received a refusal. Your refusal notice provided an explanation and referred to Paragraphs V 4.2 (a) and (c) (and sometimes sub paragraph 'e'). This is a distressing incident and often provokes feelings of confusion or anger or frustration. These feelings can be amplified upon learning that there is no path available for appeal or administrative review. The immediate reaction for many people is something along the lines of: ""It's something simple, they just took something the wrong way, I'll call them and sort things out."" But no. Categorically no. Not a chance. Since 2006, ECO's have been ring-fenced against engaging with the public and they are not permitted to reverse a decision anyway. Let's look at this extract from Paragraph 27... An application for entry clearance is to be decided in the light of the circumstances existing at the time of the decision... This is taken to mean what the applicant wrote on their application and the evidence they provided (and the courts have supported this interpretation).  If the ECO is minded to refuse and thinks that a single piece of evidence will prevent a refusal, they will contact the applicant and ask for it. But the refusals we're talking about in this article are well beyond where a single piece of evidence can prevent a refusal. The current visitor rules were hammered out in a private consultation between UKVI and the UK legal community in 2014. There were several rounds of drafts circulated and each round resulted in concessions and improvements. When both sides were happy (i.e., fair, accessible, and consistent), the rules were activated in April 2015.  They are published in Appendix V of the Immigration Rules, and we strongly endorse a careful read of the material. Visa applications are opened in the mail room by an Entry Clearance Assistant (ECA) and a witness. Two persons are required. Each application is entered into Proviso (UKVI's tracking system) along with an enumeration of what evidence has been provided. Once entered into Proviso, more ECA's get involved to examine the evidence and perform research on the applicant's circumstances.  This is the stage where ECA's may contact the applicant's bank and employer. They will also run the biometrics and look at relevant databases. ECA's are local hires who speak the language and know the local customs. They generally aspire to obtaining a British passport through service to the Crown and, accordingly, they are thorough and detail-oriented. Eventually the application will appear on the Entry Clearance Officer's (ECO) Proviso screen.  ECO's have a mandate from Parliament to issue as many visas as possible because it helps the British economy. They also have a mandate from the Crown to make the final decision on a visitor application. He will spend somewhere between 40 to 120 seconds examining the application and reaching a decision. Or he can send it back to the ECA's for more research.  If the ECO decides that a refusal is justified, the application will be routed to the Entry Clearance Manager (ECM, the highest ranking official in the Visa Section). The ECM can uphold or reverse the refusal. If a regulated solicitor has represented the application, he may contact them with a few questions and get some clarifications. If he upholds the refusal decision, the application will be routed to the ECA's who will use 'speed codes' to compose the  refusal notice. The end result is that the refusal notice, along with all the materials originally submitted, is returned to the applicant. Somewhere near the end of the notice are the legal grounds for the refusal. These visas do not have appeal rights or administrative review pathways. Applicants are surprised to learn that the largest bulk of refusals were predictable from the outset. It means the application was visibly doomed before the person even arrived at the VFS to give their biometrics. This can be said because the application has one or more of these: Most commonly the applicant's premise and evidence conform to a pattern that can be recognised early on as a sure bet for refusal.  UKVI likes to use the grounds V 4.2 (a) and (c) for their refusals in these situations. Sometimes they will bolt on sub paragraph 'e' (insufficient funds), but this is usually icing on the cake rather than an immediate concern. These refer respectively to: To summarise, they have concluded that the applicant is not a genuine visitor and is likely to go underground and abuse their visa. We see this occur variously in articles like UK visitor visa refused due to length of prior stay: They got you on V 4.2 (a) + (c), which is their way of saying that they think you might have a secondary agenda of absconding your visa and going underground. Your next application will need to use extra diligence to assure that their concerns are fully explained. Another way of putting it shows up in UK Visit Visa refusal — need advice on next step: The ECO concluded that you and your husband would go underground once you arrived in the UK, this is implicit from taking the refusal grounds in context (V 4.2 (a) & (c)). They reach this conclusion from the items listed above in ""Predictability."" It's a serious refusal. The rest of this article explains how they reach this decision. A starting point for understanding how bank statements affect the decision process is in the article: ""Should I submit bank statements when applying for a UK Visa? What do they say about me?"" This article explains that one of the common, but disastrous, strategies applicants use is the so-called 'funds parking' strategy (which is given a full discussion here). The article also explains one of the pitfalls where the applicant is fixated on presenting a final balance and is blind to the fact that bank statements provide a window into the applicant's lifestyle and social commitments. See Twice UK business visitor visa refusal because of large deposit, what next? where the answer says: Showing a hefty bank balance is helpful, but it's only about 20% of what they are looking for. A much heavier weight, say 80%, is given to periodic, predictable flows in and out of the account that show a durable economic connection to your base, in your case Egypt... They got you on V 4.2 (a) and (c) on both applications. In this context it means they concluded that you were not a bona fide applicant and that would most likely go underground when you got here... ECO's determine how much is needed by examining the applicant's premise and there is no specific amount needed to apply successfully. Even applicants with low balances can succeed when they exhibit a stable and connected lifestyle. Having a great set of bank statements is not enough to ensure success because the ECO needs to determine if the funds have been lawfully obtained and are lawfully in the applicant's possession. We call this 'provenance of funds' and it is explained in this article: are there hidden requirements for UK visa applications? Where provenance is likely to be questioned, applicants should include their employment contract or their tax returns or some other convincing evidence. They will strenuously object to lame excuses like ""I don't have those things because blah blah blah and (insert some lame excuse here)"".  Genuine visitors are able to establish provenance quite easily. Having a sponsor does not eliminate the need to establish provenance and a lot of people seem to miss this point. The ECO is entitled to think that the sponsor is a drug dealer or an illicit importer or a criminal and it's the applicant's job to convince him otherwise. So the sponsor should submit his employment contract or tax returns in the same way the applicant does.  This is a major single point-of-failure for many applicants relying on sponsorship. Applicants who fail to establish that their funds have been legally obtained will invariably incur disappointment. If the sponsor is reluctant to establish provenance, then don't apply! Moving on, the same article contains this text: Within the same money laundering/provenance of funds regime, they also have a list of banks they don't like. If somebody submits statements from one of those banks (or they figure out that somebody has an account at one of those banks), then the app will be refused (and they will use a different reason so that their sources are not compromised). There are some banks that violate money laundering rules or otherwise engage in illegal activities and submitting statements from these banks is fatal.  The global list is beyond scope here, but a representative list of acceptable banks for Bangladesh is at Updated list of financial institutions for UK visa applications in Bangladesh. The list is qualified to PBS applicants, but the contents are directly transferable to visit visa applications. Refused applicants have often made the assumption that having a sponsor eliminates the need to demonstrate that they qualify. This is not true and, in many cases, needing a sponsor actually increases the onus on the applicant to demonstrate that they qualify. How can this be? To understand this paradox, return to Paragraphs (a) and (c) again and note that neither of them is contingent on having access to money. Indeed, having access to money is covered in Paragraph (e): must have sufficient funds to cover all reasonable costs in relation to their visit without working or accessing public funds. This includes the cost of the return or onward journey, any costs relating to dependants, and the cost of planned activities such as private medical treatment. ...which is rarely mentioned at all in most refusals! So it's not about the money and it doesn't matter how  wealthy the sponsor is or how much money they are willing to commit; the onus never leaves the applicant to demonstrate that they qualify. See UK visitor visa refused (multiple sponsors) for an example which says: This refusal cites Paragraphs V 4.2 (a) and (c) of the rules... You can see that they did not challenge your daughter's capacity for sponsorship, they accepted her sponsorship without question. But having a credible sponsor does not alleviate the applicant's burden of meeting the rules. The ECO is also entitled to be mindful of the sponsor's relationship to the applicant and why the sponsor is willing to undertake a large expenditure of no apparent benefit to them. This is especially true, for example, if the applicant has siblings who have never had sponsorship. When there is no history of a grandparent or parent sponsoring other family members and a single person is going to benefit, the motivation should be carefully explained. ECO's are especially wary where there is a sudden appearance of a ""long-lost uncle"" who is making a disproportionately generous offer of sponsorship. ""Long lost uncles"" don't do things like that without very special circumstances and those circumstances need to be carefully explained. ECO's also worry about the relationship between the applicant and the sponsor and whether it is strong enough to lend credibility to the sponsor's claim. See also Will mention of a previously undisclosed relative, who will now invite me to the UK, help me to obtain a visa? While it's true that sometimes long-lost relatives can suddenly appear and offer sponsorship for no apparent reason, it is an applicant pattern viewed with pronounced scepticism on the Sub-Saharan Desk. You would have to explain why a relative is willing to do this for you and yet you were unaware of them last year. That would be an awkward explanation and genuine visitors do not need to make awkward explanations like that. Or another refusal on Paragraphs (a) + (c) where sponsorship appears to have been contrived: Picture this: From out of the blue with no explanation, somebody gets an all expenses paid offer to attend an interview in the UK at a company where there is already a mature and abundant labour market locally. This offer is extended to someone who has been working in their current role for less than a year with no particular credentials to make a company do that. Moreover, their personal circumstances are such that they could easily drop everything and relocate. And of course if the sponsor has previously been involved in a breach, it goes without saying that a refusal is in order. Finally, attestations by the sponsor along the lines of ""...my nephew very much respects UK law and would never overstay..."" can damage the sponsor's credibility. Nobody is telepathic and telepathy is the only way such an attestation can be made. See Applied for Family Visit but refused under V4.2(a) and (c): It doesn't cut any ice to assure them that you will return home after your visit, and assurances like that make for a particularly weak application anyway. Why should you return home? This is stated more formally in My girlfriend was a refused a visa to visit me in the UK. What now? A sponsor's responsibility is to demonstrate the capacity to maintain and accommodate the application. Nothing else. Your 'intentions' are irrelevant and attempting to assert them indicates that you do not understand what your role is and, by extension, that you do not understand the rules. This is a fair assumption on their part because, if your friend decided to go underground and disappeared inside the UK, there is nothing you could do to prevent it. Sponsorship Undertakings: if the ECO thinks that a sponsorship undertaking will save the application and prevent a refusal, they will contact the applicant and ask for one. In these cases the sponsor needs to establish a sound financial picture and evidence of accommodation (from ownership or an explicit permission from the landlord).  The hurdles for establishing accommodation and financial capacity are rigorously high. And to repeat: having a sponsor does not mitigate the applicant's need to qualify in their own right.  See Sponsor a visa applicant: form SU07 for more information. This is slight variant of the refusals already discussed. Briefly, midway through the recruitment process, candidates are required to report to a military installation in the UK for a two-day assessment. The variant is that the British Army will send an invitation letter (but does not participate as an economic sponsor). Applicants from the less affluent Commonwealth nations, who are disadvantaged in the first instance, especially those in Africa, can get caught in a confusing  'catch 22' predicament. This occurs when their lifestyle and  readiness to  sever their homeland ties and 'ship out' for an assignment to a foreign post belie the very  homeland ties that the ECO wants to see in order to qualify for the visa! We can't debate the sensibility of the Army's policy here because this falls within the mandate of the Politics site; for us it must be accepted as part of ""WHAT IS"".  Hence there is nothing specific to offer these applicants except what is already presented above. When a person finishes medical school abroad they sometimes like to ""top up"" their qualification by taking the Professional and Linguistic Assessments Board test, or ""PLAB"" for short. Some portions of the PLAB are administered abroad, and some are available only in the UK. Sitting the PLAB is an activity specifically mentioned in the rules; it is an approved activity within the scope of the Standard Visitor Visa. The generic profile of a PLAB refusal is where the applicant's parents have funded their education and the applicant is just starting out in their medical career. Sometimes they are still living with their parents.  Accordingly they have a strong premise (a medical degree) but a very weak application because they have not established an independent lifestyle. If you fit that profile, consider putting off the PLAB until you are more settled in your career and have a credible pattern of being a medical practitioner in your own country. By way of introduction, Entry Clearance Officers and staff are from a cross-section of society, so it's natural that some are gay or transexual, some are Muslim, some are black, and so on. With this sort of diversity, systemic discrimination is recognised and crushed early on. Having said that, we can turn to this answer: Does the UK visa system discriminate against Muslims? which discusses a Ministerial Statement authorising discrimination for some nationalities. The Minister for Immigration (Damian Green): I have made an authorisation under paragraph 17(4)(a) of schedule 3 to the Equality Act 2010, to enable the UK Border Agency to give greater scrutiny or priority to particular nationalities in carrying out entry clearance, border control and removals functions. This authorisation came into force on 10 February 2011. It replaces the Race Relations (Immigration and Asylum) Authorisation 2004, which came into force on 12 February 2004 and has been revoked. The full text is in Hansard, but ILPA published a great summary at Race Discrimination Authorisation The answer goes on to explain that the government keeps a list of countries where historical performance has been problematic. Applicants in these countries will have a more difficult time. The list is classified, but it's common knowledge that countries with large-scale performance problems are in South Asia and Africa. As for Muslims we can see that Qatar and the UAE nationals can get fast-track visas and these are predominantly Muslim countries. For the types of refusals we're taking up in this answer, where the bulk of them are predictable from the outset, claims of discrimination are more of a red herring. There is a piece of boiler plate at the bottom of all refusal notices... Any future UK visa applications you make will be considered on their individual merits, however you are likely to be refused unless the circumstances of your application change. This is an advisory suggesting that fundamental changes are needed in order to apply successfully the next time. Caution is in order because once an individual enters a tail-spin of serial refusals, they can take on a life of their own by exposing the applicant's fixation on getting in to the UK (that's a bad thing). This article ""How do I find an immigration lawyer/solicitor to help with my UK Visa application?"" suggests that a 'doc check' can be helpful and goes on to explain what it is... If your case is straight-forward but you want to make sure your application is bullet-proof, you can arrange for a 'doc check'. It means a practitioner will take your completed application and all your evidence and give you some light feedback on it. Remember that it's light-weight and not for 'complex' cases. The article also cites an important disclaimer... I am aligned with the school of thought that solicitors should be used whenever the applicant's case is complex. Regardless of the cost, a solicitor can prevent refusals and as we know, refusals are a permanent burden on a person's history. If you have read this article and have concluded that the material is not helpful for your case, it may be that using the net is not going to work for you. In such cases, a practitioner should be sought. The UK's ""go to"" site for qualified practitioners is the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association (ILPA). They offer a search engine that can be used to present the end-user with a list of members who are regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority or the Immigration Services Commissioner (OISC). Most of the time practitioners are happy to use email and Skype to sort things out thus making direct personal contact unnecessary. I am reluctant to suggest practitioners in South Asia and Africa because there are so many con artists operating outside the UK's regulatory and ethical sphere.  However, the UK Law Society operates an international division which may be helpful for very complex situations. Notes and afterthoughts... ""Funds Parking"" is a term originally coined here on this site. You cannot Google it to learn more because we're the only known site to use the term ""Funds Parking"" as literary shorthand to describe the visa strategy."
In what language should I address foreign customs and immigration?,"Unless you're completely fluent, you risk a miscommunication in a legal context.  If you're at all uncertain about communicating to them, you should ask for a translator. In your case, if you're confident, there's no harm in addressing them, but if they address you first in your language (I'm presuming English), it's best to stick with that rather than changing.  Your goal should generally be to only speak when spoken to, and to keep the conversation to a minimum.  It's more efficient for them, and prevents confusion overall."

If you leave before 180 days of unlawful presence, there is no automatic ban. Between 180 days and one year, a three-year ban. Over one year, a ten-year ban. So pack a suitcase now."
What to do if drugs / a bomb are planted in your travel bag?,It's an interesting dilemma to be sure.  Normally I pack wire ties into my carry on not the whole bag of them buy just enough to tie the locks on the luggage.  They are easily removed with scissors or wire cutters but it does tell you if the bag you have checked in have been messed with since having the exact brand make of the wire ties is difficult at best. Having said that in the US you can simply alert the authorities that if you open the bag and check it to find something illegal like drugs or explosives or live animals.  Once you have done this I would suggest calling a lawyer or a friend to get you a lawyer (better safe then sorry). The bigger problem is if you don't know that these are there in that case get a good lawyer and hope for the best.
Are you protected in an untrusted embassy in a country you trust?,"Assuming that your friend is in a conflict with the bureaucracy of his home country, a much more likely problem is that the consulate will simply refuse to extend the passport and your friend would be forced to either leave the UK or apply for asylum there. Kidnapping, assaulting or killing someone at a foreign consulate is guaranteed to cause a diplomatic scandal and it's unlikely that the local diplomatic staff will resort to that option.  Otherwise, the police generally would not be able to assist your friend right away. That's the whole point of the Vienna Convention. If the UK wasn't willing to extract Julian Assange out of the Ecuadorian embassy (granted that he's staying there willingly), they're unlikely to be willing to help out your friend."
Do I need a US visa to transit (or layover) through an American airport?,"Unlike many other countries, US airports do not have any form of physical immigration controls when you are departing the country on an international flight. In fact, in most airports there isn't even a concept of an ""International"" terminal/gate, with the same gates frequently being used for international flights and domestic flights. As a result of this they can't enforce the concept of a 'transit' passenger - once you're in the departure area, even if you got there on the pretext of catching another international flight out of the country a few hours later, there's nothing to stop you boarding a different domestic flight, or even simply walking out of the airport! This means that ALL passengers arriving on international flights in the US must have the legal right to enter the US; i.e, you must either be a US citizen/green card holder, be from a country that does not have any visa requirements (such as Canada or Bermuda), be from a country that is a part of the US Visa Waiver Program and have a valid ESTA, or have a US Visa. If you require a Visa then there is a ""Transit Visa"" (C) available which is normally a little easier to obtain than a normal visa, but you'll still need to go through the full visa application process, including showing proof that you intend to leave the US (almost) immediately."
How to discover if a hostel is more a travel hostel or a party hostel?,"I'm posting this as a representative of Hostelz.com.  There definitely are some very different types of hostels, and it's always a shame when people end up in the wrong type of hostel for them.  If you're using Hostelz.com, on the city page look for a drop-down menu that says ""Suitable For"" (just under the booking form at the top of the page).  You can use that to filter the hostels by things like ""partying"" or ""quiet rest"".  Aside from that, I've found that the photos tend to be a pretty good indication, including the reviewer photos.  Party hostels are almost always the ones that have at least one photo of a bunch of people smiling at the camera holding their drinks in the air."
"I was allowed to enter the airport terminal by showing a boarding pass for a future flight. Should I be concerned about ""security""?","You didn't skip any security controls. Your luggage was checked and you went through a metal scanner. Finally, you were not allowed on board without a proper ticket. The rest is just to prevent people from accompanying their friends and family to the gate. Merely being in the terminal is not a security flaw per se, since pretty much anyone can buy a ticket and enter the secure area. Speaking of which, I've tried the same ""trick"" (QR code for a different flight) at Prague Airport recently and it didn't work for the terminal access scan. However the Duty Free was happy to sell me anything without a proper check, so it was in theory possible to buy alcohol for non-EU prices. A hacker was even able to use a spoofed QR code to enter the Turkish Airlines business-class lounge, so the level of checks must be different across different airports and terminal areas."
Caught speeding 111 Mph (179 km/h) in California. How can I settle the case with the court?,"The ""speeding in excess of 100mph"" charge, CVC 22348(b), is a civil infraction.  We do not issue arrest warrants for those.  However, failure to appear (CVC 40508) is a crime, and this charge will become that soon.  On the speeding-over-100, you (or your lawyer) do need to face the judge; and that is so they can give you a stern warning, explain the future consequences for doing it again, and make you ""scared straight"".  (straight is US slang for obeying the law).   Failure to appear, however, is a misdemeanor and will almost certainly result in a warrant for your arrest.  This is an actual crime. It may be surprising that a civil infraction turns into a criminal matter if ignored, but that is exactly what happens.  Given the language in the letter and the fact that you obviously missed your resolve-it date, that may have already happened.  Heading home without handling this properly is a novice mistake.  Your only option now is to hire a lawyer, since you have left the country.  Hire one who is local to the court your ticket is in - it should be a lawyer who knows the judges and staff, and isn't disliked by them.  My favorite way to get lawyer referrals is call other nearby lawyers who do not practice in that area of law, and go ""I'm sorry, do you know anyone who could help me?""  Make 3-4 such calls, you'll start hearing the same name over and over. FTA is a new, second charge, so that would be two charges.  The upside is this makes it easier to plea-bargain since you now have two things to trade.  All this will happen at arraignment, which is only the initial phase; but given your options it will surely finish here. That is common in traffic matters. If you had done this sooner, you could have pled not-guilty and asked for a proper trial (which is still a 2-3 minute affair).  An order would be issued for the officer to come and testify. Generally if the officer appears, you lose, and if he doesn't, you're off scot-free.  But you lost that opportunity. Next you can say you do not wish to plead guilty to 111 mph but would plead guilty to 99 mph, and hope the judge will allow that.  The reason to do this is to save a few hundred dollars (the point on your record and opportunity for traffic school doesn't matter to you).  You are betting the judge doesn't want to waste time with a trial. (except now he knows there won't be a trial, oops).  You can still try arguing it; good chance it will work.  However, if the failure to appear exists, it's more complicated.  You must get that dismissed!  You can argue your bona-fide effort to reach the courthouse previously. It would have helped if you were standing in front of him personally, obviously come quite a distance and effort to answer this charge, can't do that now, but judges are pretty sanguine about dismissing failure-to-appear if you really do appear (via lawyer is fine) willingly out of your own initiative  Of course, this will only impress them if you do it right away. The key is to resolve it together with the underlying ticket as a plea-bargain; if you already resolved the ticket, you have nothing to bargain with!  So you ask the judge to dismiss the failure-to-appear if you plead guilty on the 99 mph.  Or if that is not acceptable to the judge, ask to dismiss the FTA if you plead guilty on 111mph.   I would have said to try trial-by-mail.  However the CVC 22348(b) is crystal clear; you must show up in court in person: either you or your lawyer.  If the failure-to-appear was not a factor, I might have said try it anyway and see if it works.  But it's a gamble; the judge may not have the freedom to waive the CVC 22348(b) requirement since you always can hire a lawyer.    However, dismissing the failure-to-appear is an absolute top priority.  This would make you an international criminal, and that's not nearly as much fun as the James Bond movies make it out to be.  As such, I would say you are pretty much stuck with hiring a lawyer.   Because he can manage every possible contingency.  He's pretty much going to argue what I said above.  You could've done it yourself if you'd done it sooner.   Live and learn.  It really doesn't help your case that you were inside the USA the entire time the ticket was pending and you did nothing. They will feel like you consider their court a joke.  On the other hand, if you retain a lawyer after you had already made your escape, that says you take your relationship with America seriously, and earlier was a novice mistake you own up to.  They will not care that you fled the country since they would not have sent you to jail for this. You need to do this right away.  If you wait months -- or worse, if you put it off until the next time you want to visit the USA! -- it will be much, much worse.  It happens all the time where a traveler clears the pre-check, arrives at JFK Airport, and gets denied entry because of something the pre-check missed and put on a plane back home (at his expense). By the way, when you sign a traffic ticket in CA and many other states, you are not admitting guilt. You are swearing a promise to appear in court, which is part of a fair exchange: you promise to appear later, and they let you go now.  If you are convicted of violating that promise, you won't be trusted in the future, and could be hauled to jail while you watch your friends be cited and released for the exact same charge. And if an FTA remains unresolved, then the next time any state officer stops you for any reason, he will probably take you to jail. (he'll make a judgment call based on his ability and the seriousness of the underlying crime). Sorry, if you're sitting at JFK Airport, California will not pay to get you extradited (give you a free flight to CA) for a speeding ticket. Also, if you had a CA driver's license, insted of 99 you'd plead 29 over the speed limit; 30-over disqualifies you for traffic school by mail, which would remove the point from your record."
"Texas, USA speed ticket as a European citizen, already left the country","A relevant resource would be Texas DMV paying tickets (Disclaimer - this is a 3rd party website and not connected to the government.  We really need the jurisdiction of your court in order to provide an official link.  On the other hand this is a good start) IMHO paying the ticket will be cheaper than hiring a lawyer to represent you and fight the ticket - especially with you not being in the country let alone the state.  I don't think that they can affect your license/insurance in Europe, on the other hand if they issue a warrant for your arrest it will stick around for a very long time and could cause you a lot of grief in the future if you come back to the US. In either case it would definitely be worthwhile to call the appropriate court and speak to the Court Clerk and get their opinion on the matter.  I'm not sure if you can get it dismissed that way, but it is worth a try. But whatever you decide make sure to do it before the court date. Finally as a foreigner living in the US I am always amazed at the capriciousness of the cops pulling people over for speeding as well as 10mph over the limit on a freeway being ignored. From my point of view if the posted speed limit is 60 and everybody does 75 and the cops don't pull everybody over then the de facto speed limit is 75. I just don't have the guts to argue this point in court!  But then every once in a while they do a speeding blitz and start pulling people over for only a few mph over the posted limit.  Then a day later its all back to normal."
What happens if you have a medical emergency after deplaning but before passing passport control?,"I worked in the A&E at Ashford hospital in Middlesex about 20 years ago. Ashford is a couple of miles from Heathrow, and all people requiring hospital assessment from Terminal 4 were brought to us.  I can recall only a couple of times where people were brought from arriving flights not having gone through immigration, but on both occasions they were accompanied by a police officer. They were admitted to the hospital, so I don't know what happened after they left the Emergency department, except the police officer went off to the ward with them. "
Why are one-way plane tickets more expensive than return tickets?,"It's hard to understand why this can be the case without some background in how airline fares work, so lets start with a bit of background... For each route, airlines will publish a number of different fares, each with a distinct ""fare code"" - normally with weird names like ""TANRKL"", ""YSJWNN"" or ""X34Q"".  Corresponding to these fare codes are ""fare rules"" which dictate things like whether changes/refunds are allowed on that fare class (and what fees are payable for them), whether stopovers are allowed, etc. In addition to the customer-facing conditions the fare rules include controls over what type of trips that fare can be used for, with terms such as  ""One-way"", ""Return"", ""Open-jaw"", ""Circle"", and ""end-on-end"" being common. eg, looking at one specific ""cheap"" AA fare (""ONE0F0Q1"") I can see the conditions ""FARES GOVERNED BY THIS RULE CAN BE USED TO CREATE ROUND-TRIP/CIRCLE-TRIP/SINGLE OPEN-JAW JOURNEYS"".  A more expensive fare on the same route (fare code ""H2"") has the conditions ""FARES GOVERNED BY THIS RULE CAN BE USED TO CREATE ONE-WAY JOURNEYS."" If you're booking a return fare then you will be able to use the cheaper fare, whereas if you book a one-way it'll automatically bump you up to the more expensive fare as the cheaper fare doesn't allow one-way.  In each case the booking engine will automatically pick the cheapest fare for what you're doing - it's actually very possible (especially for domestic flights) that you'll end up with 2 ""one-way-only"" fares instead of a ""return"" fare if that's the cheapest way to do it. Frequently, as you've said, the one-way ticket will actually cost more than it would to buy a return.  Some people will tell you in these situations that you can just buy the return and not fly the 2nd leg - but it's worth keeping in mind that the one-way ticket, by being a higher fare class, probably includes better ticket conditions than the cheaper return.  eg, it's likely that the cancellation fee on the more expensive ticket will be reduced (or even eliminated), and fees for making changes to the ticket will often be lower.  ie, you are normally getting a ""better"" ticket for your money - even if it means that you end up sitting in exactly the same seat! In addition to one-way and return there's a third class of travel, called ""circle"".  A circle fare is when you fly AAA-BBB-CCC-AAA, without returning to BBB on the way back.  As with one-way, some fares allow circle routes, and others do not - with the likelihood of them being allowed increasing with the price of the fare. Next comes stopovers.  Some tickets will allow you to have a ""stopover"" with wording something like this : ORIGINATING UNITED KINGDOM - 1 FREE STOPOVER PERMITTED IN CONTIGUOUS U.S.A. That means that on the way from AAA-CCC you can stop somewhere in the middle.  The problem is that it needs to be somewhere ""on the way"".  eg, if you're flying AAA-BBB-CCC, then you can have a stopover at BBB, but not anywhere else. The other term you'll often see mentioned in the fare conditions is ""end-on-end"", with text something like this : END-ON-END ""End-on-end"" refers to booking 2 distinct fares, but having them combined on a single ticket.  This can be used to give fares for routes that an airline has not published a fare for - but it can also be used to get cheaper fares if the combination of the two fares is cheaper.  Some fares will also include text like ""SIDE TRIPS PERMITTED."" in the end-on-end rules, which means that not only can you add in another trip at your destination, but you can also add in a separate ""side trip"" at a stopover point. As an example, I recently flew from San Francisco (SFO) to Newark (EWR).  When I looked up the prices, it was around $800 to fly direct, or around $400 to fly via Denver (DEN).  Digging into this, the reason was because the only fare available on SFO-EWR was a high-priced fare (United ticket class ""H"").  But on SFO-DEN and DEN-EWR there were cheaper fares available - around $200 for each leg, and both fares allowed ""end-on-end"" combinations.  Thus I bought a single ticket SFO-DEN-EWR, but behind the scenes I was actually paying for 2 distinct legs, each with their own fare codes. Now, back to your specific question.  You're after LON-AUS-GIG-LON.  There's a number of different ways that a ticket like this could be built. Firstly, you could do a number of ""one-way"" fares - LON-AUS, AUS-GIG, GIG-LON.  This will always work (as airlines always allow one-way fares), but as mentioned above it'll likely be expensive. Next, you could do it as a ""circle"" fare.  To do that, you'd need to find one airline that had published fares for each of LON-AUS, AUS-GIG, GIG-LON, AND those fares allowed ""circle"" trips. Alternatively you could do it as 2 end-on-end return fares - LON-AUS-LON  and AUS-GIG-AUS.  The requirement for circle trips is now gone, as it's just 2 simple return flights, but you're having to backtrack to AUS on the return as end-on-end fares normally include the condition that ""TRAVEL MUST BE VIA THE POINT OF COMBINATION"", which in this case means you need to pass via AUS in both directions. The next option is to use a stopover.  eg, you could potentially fly a single fare of LON-GIG-LON, with a stopover of AUS on the way over. The problem is that there's no airlines that have a flight from LON-GIG that stops in AUS so in this case that's not going to work. The final option - and the reason that it's best to leave finding fares to computers rather than humans - is to combine one or more of the options above to find the best route/price. Plugging your requirements into ITA Software's search engine for some random dates in February it came up with a best price of £691.89 on American Airlines.  Looking at the details of how it came up with that price, we see that it actually used 4 different fare code to build the entire fare : So it's actually booked one round-trip flight LON-GIG-LON (fare 1 and 4), with a stopover in JFK on the way over.  If we were to check the fare rules we'd find that fare allowed ""return"" trips, but almost certainly doesn't allow ""one-way"" trips. We also know that it must allow stopovers (as we've got one in JFK). Next we've got 2 one-way fares from NYC-AUS (fare 2) and AUS-NYC (fare 3).  These are domestic fares in the US, and in most cases airlines don't bother with the whole one-way/return distinctions for domestic fares, so it's not more expensive to book them as one-way rather than return. The trip to AUS is occurring from your stopover point (JFK) of the first trip rather than your destination (GIG), which means that the fare for LON-GIG-LON allowed a ""side trip"" during the stopover in JFK. Putting this all together, you get your full trip - LHR-JFK-AUS, AUS-JFK-GIG, GIG-JFK-LHR for under 700 quid (around US$1100)."
UK visa blank refusal letter without reason for refusal,"I would try to get in touch with the consulate to explain that the refusal notice Presumably, after you explain this, they will make arrangements to give you a proper refusal notice.

Do I have to hide anything related to the swastika while travelling to the USA?,"It is not illegal to display a swastika in the US; however, the symbol is generally understood in the US to be a symbol of Nazism and displaying it publicly is likely to be extremely hurtful to those around you (perhaps in particular members of groups targeted by Nazis), not to mention earn you significant unwanted attention. If it is on a religious book and it is clear that it is a religious symbol unrelated to the Nazi party, then that is more likely to be OK. I would definitely avoid wearing it on a t-shirt or displaying a swastika tattoo. Source: I am a US resident."
Where can I change my clothes at the airport?,"If you're willing to pay a bit to avoid hassle, Frankfurt Airport has 5 shower facilities scattered throughout its terminals that can be rented for 6 euros.  The stalls aren't exactly luxurious, but they're fully separated, private and kept very clean, so you can change in comfort and take a shower if you feel like it. Most larger airports worldwide offer similar facilities, usually at much lower prices than full lounge access, occasionally even for free."
Why were holes drilled into my luggage when I entered the US?,"The three holes are perfectly spaced, and too clean/consistent on both sides to be a rush job with a handheld drill.  The dimples on the bottom suggest to me they were punched on a specially made jig.  Look close at the photo and you can see the vestiges of a rectangle around all three holes, making about a 2-hole-width margin around the holes. The rectangle is either a discoloration or a dimpling on the surface.  Very subtle.  My guess is, a handle, fitting, logo, bumper, etc. went there.   TSA or baggage handlers broke it off by accident, and asked TSA to try to fix it (since they could get inside the luggage to reach the screws). Or alternately, TSA was looking for concealed contraband, chose to disassemble the piece that goes there, and either didn't care, lost the screws, or didn't want to take the time to reassemble it due to workload. Perhaps the part+screws is in a ziploc bag tucked into a pocket you didn't check."

Is there a hawker stall selling local food in walking distance from Changi airport?,"Yes: more specifically, the staff canteens at the airport are open to the public, serving authentic and tasty Singaporean fare at rock-bottom prices!  Despite the name ""canteen"", these are mini-hawker centres with a dozen or so independently run stalls each specializing in specific dishes/cuisines.  There are at least three of these: The one you'll never find by accident is next to Terminal 2: head out from Customs, turn left, cross the road, enter the carpark (2A) and take the elevator up to level 3M, which is marked ""Staff Canteen"".  Here's the illustrated journey, photos mine: 


 There is a similar but newer one in Terminal 1, detailed instructions here.  TL;DR: find Row 13 in Departures hall, take lift at end down to B1. The least secret of the three is the Kopitiam food court in the air-conditioned shopping mall below Terminal 3 (level B2), between the MRT station and arrivals: just follow the signs for ""24 hr food court"" right after Customs to take the escalators or lifts two floors down.  This is slightly more expensive (meals from around S$5), but it's also air-conditioned, attractively presented and has a good selection of halal options:  ...and still half price compared to the airside food courts."
How do I avoid leaving my passport as a deposit while traveling?,"You already cover the sensible things that I would also do, especially online reviews and making a copy. Perhaps you could take a photograph of the person you handed it to? If you wish to go further, I have one possible suggestion: I recently bought a bike and took it for a test ride. To do so, I gave them my credit card and driving licence which they put in a lockable box and gave me the key. Obviously they'd have some other way of opening it if I didn't come back, but at least it might be restricted to the manager rather than anyone working there. It's unlikely that you're going to find a similar mechanism in Seoul, but it does at least provide you with the idea that you could buy some sort of lockable or at least tamper evident box or seal, show them your passport, seal it in the container and give it to them. They could break it open if you don't return. If you do return, you could see that they hadn't tampered or copied your passport. Tamper evident seals are cheaply available on Amazon and you could just seal any old plastic box. Obviously this does nothing to prevent them stealing it though."
What rules govern forced removal from flights (due to overbooking)?,"The relevant legislation very well could be 49 U.S. Code § 46504 - Interference with flight crew members and attendants. An individual on an aircraft in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States who, by assaulting or intimidating a flight crew member or flight attendant of the aircraft, interferes with the performance of the duties From the report we have an eyewitness saying the man got very upset when told he should leave the flight. Perhaps this was interpreted as ""intimidating a flight crew member"". Edit: also the contract of carriage has this to say: UA shall have the right to refuse to transport or shall have the right to remove from the aircraft at any point, any Passenger for the following reasons: ... Whenever refusal or removal of a Passenger may be necessary for the safety of such Passenger or other Passengers or members of the crew including, but not limited to: Passengers whose conduct is disorderly, offensive, abusive, or violent; Passengers who fail to comply with or interfere with the duties of the members of the flight crew, federal regulations, or security directives;"
Why can't I wash away soapy hands?,"Soap is mostly a chemical called sodium stearate that is moderately soluble in water. In pure water it dissociates into positive sodium ions and negative stearate ions, and the negative stearate ions adsorb onto the surface of your skin. This creates a layer of negative charge on your skin, and when you rub your hands together the negative charges repel. The result is a layer of water is trapped in between your hands when you rub them together, and this is what causes the slippery feel. You can eventually rinse away the layer of stearate, but since it adsorbs strongly to the skin it takes a lot of rinsing. This is what happens in pure water, but in many regions the tap water contains divalent ions like calcium, and calcium stearate is insoluble. As long as there is an excess of soap the calcium stearate precipitates to form soap scum and plenty of stearate ions are left to produce the slippery feel. However when you start rinsing the stearate concentration falls until enough calcium ions are left to bind to and neutralise the layer of stearate adsorbed on your skin. This neutralises the negative charge so it removes the slippery feel, and if fact the calcium stearate left on your skin has a higher friction than clean wet skin so you get an abrupt transition from a slippery feel to a ""grabby"" feel. So the differences you notice are due to the different concentrations of divalent ions in water i.e. the hardness of the water. In soft water regions it takes a long time to completely rinse the soap away while in hard water areas to get a fast transition from slippery to ""grabby""."
"In US hotels, what happens if you skip checkout and just leave the hotel?","I've been traveling a lot for work lately, and I don't want to waste any time in the morning standing in line at check out.  In the morning, I'll just drop my key with the little paper holder that has my room number at the front desk, say ""bye"" and walk out. No need to wait for ""checkout"".   I think it's polite to at least tell them you are leaving so that the hotel staff can start cleaning and be ready for the next guest, but if you don't need a receipt, then you shouldn't have to wait in line.  Once or twice I've accidentally left the key in the room on my way out, and then just tell the front desk clerk, ""I was in room XXX and I'm leaving, I left the key on the dresser"".   US Hotels always make you pay in advance when you check in.  If you ask they can even print out a receipt for you at that time.  They do have your card on file and would add any incidental charges if needed, but I don't ever have anything to add (pay per view, room service, stolen or damaged property, etc).  "
Most respectful way to set alarm when sharing the room,"Many phones have a silent, vibration only mode as part of the regular alarms. A cheap Fitbit Flex band will do that too. If a vibrating alarm isn't enough, you can get a wristband that delivers electric shocks to wake up, such as the Pavlok wristband (store): At first, it will act like any other alarm clock, with a gentle vibration to get you up. But if you keep ignoring the vibration or hitting snooze, the wristband will send a shock to wake you up for good. For a custom solution:

Is the RFID chip in e-passports read-only or is it read-write?,"TL;DR: It's complicated, but for practical purposes, currently e-passports are read-only. Long version:  The specification for e-passports contains two types of data.  Dedicated Files (DF) are writable and is meant for storing visas and various authorizations in the future.  However, this is
currently not used, and most e-passports out there don't even
include this capability. What is in active use is the Logical Data Structure (LDS), which stores biometrics etc and is
by design read-only.  Anybody with access to the key stored in the
passport's machine-readable section (the swipable bit at the bottom)
can read data from here, and the data is electronically signed, so
anybody reading it can confirm that the contents have not been
tampered with. In practice, e-passports are implemented using EEPROM memory, which expands to the somewhat paradoxical Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory.  For practical purposes, these are read-only, a casual reader can't go in there and change or add anything. The catch is that the EEPROMs are also by definition erasable, so the contents can be erased and rewritten from scratch.  However, since EEPROMs can typically be locked/""frozen"" to prevent any further changes, any attacker would need to work around this.  What's more, since the LDS contents are digitally signed, if a malicious country or agent were to gain access and erase & rewrite them, they would also need to provide a new valid signature, which they can't do without the original issuer's private key.  They could reprogram your Sylvanian passport's chip to return data signed by Borduria instead, but I presume this would be caught pretty easily, since it would now be out of sync with what the machine-readable stripe says.  And this is also why the originating country is also unlikely to change any data on the chip, even if they technically can, because it would now risk having the information physically printed on the passport from being out of sync with the digital copy in it. Some more reading on the topic: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221406395/download (free PDF download) Edit for clarity: I'm not claiming any of this makes e-passports secure or tamperproof.  However, if the question is ""are countries I visit recording things in my e-passport when I pass through immigration"", the answer is pretty unequivocally ""no""."

"How do I insist that American hotels accept my employer's credit card for payment, instead of asking for personal credit card upon check-in?","The problem here is not the corporate credit card, but that you're trying to do this without a physical card.  A credit card number is good enough to make a reservation, which is why the phone call works for that, but reception needs to charge a deposit on arrival and their protocol dictates that you need to hand over a physical card for this.  The hotel doesn't particularly care if it's yours or the company's, as long as it's valid and has your name on it. The sane thing would be that your employer gives you a physical corporate credit card, which you can then use to pay deposits and settle the bill. Since your employer is a government body and isn't doing this, I presume they're not sane though. The other option is to prepay for your hotel room using the corporate credit card.  You may still be required to hand over a personal credit card for the deposit (to cover raiding the minibar etc), but this should be returned in full within a day or two of checking out with no cost to you or the taxpayer.

Should I not use double things in a double room if I have booked it as a single guest?,"Being a supervisor at a well known 3/4 star hotel I speak from experience. If a consumable/expendable amenity has been provided in your room, it is yours. This includes personal care products, snacks, coffee, toilet paper, etc.  Housekeepers aren't supposed to leave these items for reuse anyways and should ideally be thrown away whether you use them or not. You never know what the guest may have done to an item that appears to be untouched. I heard of a location in Texas that had a guest check in and find drugs stashed in what appeared to be a untouched shampoo bottle. Taking home items that are NOT depleted by their use is theft. A good example would be towels. Do not take towels home. You may however use all amenities provided to whatever extent and for whatever reasonable purpose you wish. We may not like it, but you can substitute towels for toilet paper. It may be gross, but they will be fully cleaned, sterilized, and reused. Use of provided amenities is factored into the cost of your room and I believe that you should always use them to get full value for your money My hotel chain does not provide alcohol in the rooms unless requested with official ID, so I cannot say if alcohol is yours for the room rate when stocked prior to check in.  The number one thing that is appreciated by staff, is to leave your room as clean as possible at check out. The time to clean the room is the number one expense in a room where nothing had been stolen or damaged. Keep in mind that most hotels will charge you for non-disposable items such as towels or fixtures you steal, and may even press charges if the value is high enough. The same goes for most damage to a room so if you enter a room and find that something is obviously missing or damaged, report it to the front desk to avoid liability. EDIT: It is also acceptable to move furniture that has not been secured. If you want to join beds together, bring a table from another room you have paid for, or overturn the dresser you may do so. It might be odd and not appreciated, but as long as no damages are incurred that require maintenance to perform repairs, it is acceptable. Simply put, if you need a tool to do it, or undo it, don't."
What Happens when Passenger Refuses to Fly Boeing 737 Max?,"Here's an excerpt from a recent BBC article: Can I ask to fly on a different plane? Some passengers scheduled to fly on a Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft may wish to transfer to a different flight, but they will have no rights to do so without incurring extra costs under the current regulations. With regulators in the US declaring these planes safe and flights continuing in the UK and Europe, wary passengers would have to buy a ticket for a different flight and would have no right to a refund, according to consumer group Which?. Any pay-out from travel insurance policies would also be extremely unlikely. Some airlines are grounding particular planes, but still running scheduled flights on alternative aircraft. If airlines with these planes do cancel flights, passengers would have the same rights to refunds or re-routing to their destination as they normally do when any flight is cancelled for whatever reason.

Japanese etiquette: Most common (and offensive) mistakes? [closed],"Take name cards with two hands when given to you, give them with two hands. Look at the received card, put it in front of you on the table while you are talking to the person(s). You CAN punch with one chopstick into food and hold it with the other if it's something hard to eat (dumplings, potatoes etc). Don't stick both in however. Do not soak your sushi rice in soy sauce. Ideally, try to dip only the fish into it.
Do not throw too much wasabi into the soy sauce. Ideally, just take of a small piece and put it directly on the fish before eating it. Those two rules are specially important if you are sitting at a sushi counter since both of the errors tell the chef that you need to ""fix"" his food. You CAN however eat sushi with your right hand if you have issues with chopsticks. Eat the pickled ginger between sushi pieces in small portions - do not gobble it up before the sushi itself arrives. In general, try to mimic the behavior of the people that are of the same status around you (co-workers, co-students) when it comes to bowing, where to sit, how loud to talk, how much to drink/eat when in presence of someone superior (boss, professor etc).  Do not address yourself/introduce yourself with -san. While you say ""this is mister Smith"" and in Japanese say ""this is Smith-san"", you do NOT introduce yourself with ""my name is Smith-san"" but rather ""my name is Smith"". Dragons are lucky creatures. Do not compare something bad/dangerous to a dragon. I have seen this some times and it really shows you have no idea about Asia at large. If you try to speak Japanese, try on someone you trust to give you a good evaluation first. If you have a strong English/French accent and people do not understand what you want to say in Japanese, you make them feel uncomfortable. You can on the other hand make a really good impression by being able to make some short phrases that you can use to give positive feedback (""Oishkatta desu"" after a dinner, etc) in a reasonably understandable accent. Do not open gifts that you received in front of the person who gave them unless encouraged to do so. It makes you look greedy and there is a huge risk of face loss in case you do not like what you received etc. If you have Japanese guests wherever you are, give them a small (toy/ceramic/whatever) frog as a departure gift. The word ""frog"" and ""return"" have the same pronunciation in Japanese and indicate that you want THEM to come back. Do not do that if you are at someone else's place. If you go somewhere, buy a small souvenir (such as chocolates, cookies etc) from the place where you have been, specially local stuff stuff that normally cannot be bought in a supermarket everywhere. If you are in an office in Tokyo and go to Osaka for a business trip, buy some of the stuff sold at the train station. Those are always individually packed so you can give everyone in your department on cookie/whatever. Put those on everyone's desk when you return - no need to hand them over in person. It's not so important what it is, or that it's expensive. If you are on a private trip, buy something small for your best friends only - maybe your boss, too. If you are in a restaurant, check if there is a cashier at the entrance when you come in. You will also most likely then have a paper on a clipboard at/under your table where the waiter notes down your orders. When paying, take that clipboard and go directly to the exit to pay. Otherwise, ask for the check on the table. It's completely normal to ask which sauce goes with which food. Often Japanese people on the table will not know what goes with what either since many restaurants try to make it more special by adding different dipping sauces for a course. You will most likely get 3 questions as a foreigner in Japan (in one row, asked from the same person): Do you speak/study Japanese? Do you like Japanese girls? Do you eat Nattō? I think this comes from some Japanese having a certain fear that they are not Japanese ""enough"". They feel they speak poorly Japanese, they often prefer/admire western women and many do not like nattō. If you study/like the Japanese language, fancy Japanese girls AND like nattō, you are almost more Japanese then they wish to be. I speak Japanese and I like Japanese girls, but I do not like nattō. Japanese people were ALWAYS relieved when I told them I do not like nattō. Do not bring up topics about WWII or the island disputes with Korea/China etc. If the topic is there already, do not comment on it. If you feel you need to contribute or participate, bring an example from history/territorial disputes in your country, but do not give opinions about the Japanese topics. Chances are high that what you read in your local newspaper outside of Japan is quite different from what you read inside of Japan, and you can only appear as a fool. Do not expose any tattoos that you might have. Tattoos are traditionally linked to the Japanese Mafia. Respect food. Finish your plate. Don't walk around while eating.  Do not tip people - anywhere, ever. If you need to make/receive a cellphone call, leave the room/restaurant/train compartment. If you take a picture with your cellphone or compact digital camera, make sure that the ""shutter sound"" is switched on. People are afraid of secretly taken pictures, specially in public places. Be very careful how you behave in general. People will politely ignore if you behave in a rude manner. This does not mean that it's ok. I have seen many people who started to become more and more rude simply because nobody told them off. It can breed a certain level of arrogance since people think whatever they do is ok. Regarding some of the comments below I would like to make a statement here regarding the accusation in the comments of me being sexist. I take any kind of discrimination very seriously and oppose them heavily. Therefore, I am even more upset when I am myself accused of being sexist. I considered this quite well and came to the conclusion that there is a need to comment on this. I perceive neither the comments nor my reply to be here in the right place, but as long as the accusation stands below, I am convinced that a proper reply from my side is absolutely necessary in respect of the weight of those accusations. About the question about putting people in the same context as food: ""Women"" in this topic are objects like Natto! The accusation seems to be that a person asking me in direct sequence the questions if I like a type of food and if I like Japanese women is sexist. Me answering according to the question instead of rejecting the question as sexist, was making me sexist just as well. This means however that if someone said in one sentence to someone of the opposite sex: ""I love this country, and I love you, too"" would make someone sexist since it also compares a person with an object. I oppose this conclusion heavily. What introduction will one have to make then before talking about people to not degrade them and being accused of sexism?  About the question if the short time a tourist is in Japan matters: Why is your taste important as a tourist about ""Women"" of a country?! Women are foods or you are going to buy them or get married with them in a short period of time? 
  Surely these are not my questions as it is not important for me your or the others tourists' reason to travel to another country but this question is ""sexist"". This question was asked by a Japanese person living in Japan to me, a foreigner living in Japan. While this page is not meant for expats, but for travelers, many people on this page return over and over to the same country and are therefore interested in the culture and mistakes one can make when having longer interactions with locals. My example does not address a weekend-tourist who only sees a few of the most famous temples in Kyoto. But regardless of this issue, nothing in this context is sexist just because the situation described does not apply to short-term tourists. The context is about comparing a preference of a visual appearance of people in one part of the world to people of another part of the world. To perceive a visual difference between Caucasians and Japanese people is not sexist since it does not compare man to women in any way. It is further not racist since it is merely the observation of a very obvious fact, not a allegation of inherent superiority of one of them. Visual attraction (i.e. when seeing but not knowing a person) towards the other sex is a biological fact - and not sexism. Combining the visual attraction with a preference to the visual appearance, being the matter of a certain body type and possibly hair color is not sexism either. It does not treat women like objects and it does not judge men being superior to women. Otherwise the mere question ""Do you think this person looks attractive?"" was sexist too."
Can I refuse to choose seats with additional cost at check-in time?,"To answer more generally:  If the flight is covered by the EU Flight Compensation Regulation (all Eurowings flights are so), the airline is not allowed to charge the passenger for an upgrade in this situation. Article 10(1):  If an operating air carrier places a passenger in a
  class higher than that for which the ticket was purchased, it may not
  request any supplementary payment. The airline could however probably instead choose to deny you boarding (due to overbooking) and compensate you accordingly without violating the regulation. "
Hard time proving I am the same person as seen in the passport photo taken 9 years ago,"Let's reiterate: Even if by all laws your current passport (or other documents provided) should work, you already know that this didn't much impress the immigration officers you had to deal with. And they seemed to be of the friendly kind. Imagine what happens if one of them had a bad day and time to deal with you.  Sometimes even when you are right, it may be useful to remove as many obstacles as possible, so: Make your passport photo match your physical appearance, one way or another."
How much to tip in the United States?,"Tipping in the US is much more common than elsewhere. In much of the US service staff are deliberately paid very low wages and expected to make it up in tips. Remember this when comparing prices in North America and Europe - the price of a restaurant may look low, but you are going to have to pay up to 20-25% extra on it. I can't do better than recommend this Tripadvisor page. It squares with my experience. To summarize:"
Can a tourist shoot a gun in the USA?,"Your best bet if you want to fire a gun is not a gun store, but a shooting range. Most shooting ranges are clubs or semi-private, and won't rent guns to individuals who just walk in.  What you're looking for is a tourist-oriented shooting range such as this one.  These ranges tend to be found in the more tourist-oriented parts of the western states (eg. Las Vegas), and usually emphasize exotic or famous guns (such as the Tommy gun or the Colt Single Action Army). If it's advertising ""machine guns"", it's probably the sort of range you're looking for.  And no, you almost certainly won't be able to fire an actual machine gun.  What they usually have are automatic rifles and submachine guns."
What is wrong with eating while walking in Japan? It doesn't seem to be an issue in other Asian countries,"Since the issue is not only with food that you can spill but also with drinking from bottles or cans (even if you buy it from a vending machine, you are not supposed to drink it while you walk), which are not as easy to spill as walking around with a ramen bowl, this is not a hygiene issue. The topic is much more about the respect for food at large. When Japanese people start eating, they put the hands together in a praying gesture and say ""Itadakimasu"", wich means ""I humbly receive"". People are also supposed to finish their food, even down to the last rice corn. There is another phrase to thank the cook once you are finished. Several other cultural details exist that underline this deep respect for food. When you are eating while walking, you are taking food too casually, and forget to pay respect to the people who grew/made it and the souls of the organisms who perished in the process. You are supposed to cherish your food, which is taken to comical extremes in the ""Ramen Scene"" of the movie ""Tampopo"", which is a comedy only about food in Japan.  There are a lot of restaurants that serve food on the street, but you are supposed to eat it right there, on the spot, often under a canopy or umbrella, instead of walking away with it. Probably the only exception is ice cream. It is very possible that it is exempt because of western influence."
No transit zone at Linate airport. Couldn't get on connecting flight. Whose responsibility is it?,"You misunderstand.  The lack of an international transit zone was not your problem.  Even if there had been an international transit zone, you would not have been able to remain in it. Your problem was that you had a flight from Milan to Rome.  That is a domestic flight, and you must enter the Schengen area to board it.  You do not leave the Schengen area until after you arrive at Rome, where you need to go through exit controls before you can board your flight from there to Seoul.  (Entering the Schengen area, to be sure, means leaving the international zone.) The same is true for any intra-Schengen flight whether it is domestic or not.  For example, an itinerary from London to Frankfurt to Vienna to Seoul would be essentially the same because of the Frankfurt to Vienna flight. There is no way, regardless of airport facilities, to transfer from an international flight to an intra-Schengen flight without going through the passport checkpoint. You checked whether you needed an airport transit visa (ATV), and you do not need one.  But an ATV is not sufficient for the itinerary you booked.  Suppose you were from Afghanistan or any other country whose citizens need an ATV, and you did have an ATV: the same thing would have happened, because an ATV does not authorize you to go through passport control.  To follow this itinerary, you need either a regular Schengen visa or a passport that allows you to enter the Schengen area without a visa. As it appears to me, there was (practically) no way for me to find out that I would require a Schengen visitor visa (when I didn't even need the transit visa) just to change flights in Milan Your research, very unfortunately, led you to an incorrect conclusion.  Part of the reason for that is the source, which is unofficial.  Unfortunately, I am also unable to find (quickly) an official source that is much clearer about the airport transit visa.  If you go to the EU site, for example, you have to know that ""transit through the international transit areas of airports of the Schengen States"" is not good enough for your itinerary.  There probably is an official site somewhere that says explicitly that such a visa does not suffice when there is an intra-Schengen flight, but it's not immediately obvious.  I also looked on the site of the Italian embassy in London, and that was not particularly helpful, either. Is there any chance to get my money back or make the agency arrange a new flight to Seoul at a later date at their expense? Or is it the airline's responsibility since they haven't turned me away at the check-in? Unfortunately, airlines are very good at disclaiming this responsibility.  And governments are also very good at disclaiming responsibility for failings in their public information materials.  I doubt you will be able to recover anything, as unfair as that may be. Some online visa-checking sites allow you to enter more than one leg of your flight at once.  An example is https://www.traveldoc.aero/.  Had you used this site, you would have seen that you needed a visa for Italy. As pointed out in the comments, even traveldoc suggests that an airport transit visa would be sufficient for the itinerary, which is incorrect.  Another commenter suggests turning to a question on this site: Do I need a visa to transit (or layover) in the Schengen area?  Indeed, I have found no official government or airline-industry source that says clearly: If your next destination is in the Schengen area, you must pass through passport control to get to that flight, so you need a regular Schengen visa unless you qualify for visa-free entry."
"Is it okay for a ticket seller in the USA to refuse to give you your change, keep it for themselves and claim it's a tip?","You were taken advantage of. Tipping is very prevalent in the US, but it is extremely unusual to tip someone who sells you tickets to a tourist attraction. I've never done it or heard of it. Even if you were being given a guided tour, where tipping the guide is normal, its usual to do it after the tour and after you have decided how good it was. The cashier took advantage of your lack of knowledge of what is proper.  To expand the question a bit, for any service worker to decide what tip they want and take it is extremely bad manners, and stops short of theft only if you are given an opportunity to say no. The only exception is when a 'service charge' is advertised as part of the price. If you are in this situation again with any kind of server who says ""I'm going to take this amount of tip"" I recommend saying ""No you aren't"" and demanding the correct change. Tell them you get to decide what the tip is, unless they can show you the rules that say a tip is included in the price. A ticket seller should get zero tip, and anyone who tries to take a tip on their own initiative should get zero tip. Tips are a reward for good service, and trying to take money from you is not good service. While five years later is too late to do anything, had you realised a few days later you might have considered contacting the place you visited and telling them about your experience. They will also probably be unhappy with their cashier, and you might get your money back. EDIT: While I'm going to leave this since it answers the question as asked, I'm also inclined to agree with opa that this might have been a mishearing and the seller meant ""tax""."
"Why does Paris have two large train stations next to each other? (Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est)","The Gare du Nord was originally the Paris terminus of the Compagnie des chemins de fer du Nord (see Wikipedia).  The Gare de l'Est was originally the Paris terminus of the Compagnie du Chemin de Fer de Paris à Strasbourg, which became the Compagnie des chemins de fer de l'Est (see also Wikipedia).   These companies, with others, were eventually amalgamated into the SNCF in the 1930s, but by that stage there were already two stations with different railway lines going into each. In general, trains from the Gare du Nord take the Lille line north (to e.g. Picardy, Calais, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne and London) and trains from the Gare de l'Est tend take the Strasbourg and Mulhouse lines east (to e.g. Strasbourg, Luxembourg, Frankfurt, Munich, Moscow).  However, trains from e.g. Normandy go into Gare Saint-Lazare, and trains from the south-east go into Gare de Lyon. The following map shows where the lines from each of the Paris stations go.

Positive drug test in Singapore: How long do I need to avoid the country?,"Good move getting out of Singapore in time, since simple possession of a controlled substance in Singapore (including cannabis metabolites in your system) is punishable by up to 10 years in jail.  First time offenders usually get away with ""only"" 6 months in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre, which is located within Changi Prison and by most accounts isn't much better than actual jail. The bad news is that Singapore inherits most of its legal code from the UK, including the globally rare concept of having no statute of limitations for criminal offences.  So, yes, I would strongly recommend never setting foot in Singapore again, even in transit.  Sorry. Update: While Singapore's laws are clear that consuming drugs outside Singapore is an offense if you are a local citizen or permanent resident (Sec. 8A), it's less clear what happens if you are not one.  This implies that saying you failed the test because you consumed drugs overseas may be a defense, although the burden would still be on you to prove that this was the case."
Refused entry into Schengen after Ryanair checked passport. Now the airline wants me to pay a fine. What are my options?,"Edit: Just in case it's not clear I'm Not A Lawyer, I'm not, and you should read this as opinion by a lay person and seek your own legal advice. Dealing with the fine first, according to ICAO: 5.14 Contracting States shall not fine aircraft operators in the event that arriving and in-transit persons are found to be improperly
  documented where aircraft operators can demonstrate that they have
  taken adequate precautions to ensure that these persons had complied
  with the documentary requirements for entry into the receiving State. Since the OP didn't flush his passport down the toilet or similar, it appears plain that the fine was incurred by Ryanair because they didn't demonstrate taking adequate precautions, and the fine is theirs. Guidance for unfair contract terms in the UK contains: Terms under which the supplier must be 'indemnified' for costs which
  could arise through no fault of the consumer's are open to comparable
  objections, particularly where the supplier could himself be at fault.
  The word 'indemnify' itself is legal jargon which, if understood at
  all, is liable to be taken as a threat to pass on legal and other
  costs incurred without regard to reasonableness Although the passenger does have a measure of fault in this case, my opinion is that Ryanair's employee failed in their duty and caused their employer to incur this fine. Regarding the cost of the return ticket: 5.10 When a person is found inadmissible and is returned to the aircraft operator for transport away from the territory of the State,
  the aircraft operator shall not be precluded from recovering from such
  person any transportation costs involved in his removal. Ryanair also uses the same wording in their own Terms and Conditions: you will be required to pay any fines levied against
  us by the Government or immigration authority concerned, plus the cost
  of transporting you from that country back to your point of origin or
  elsewhere Transportation costs, as mentioned by @MSalters, are not the same as the price of a ticket. I'd be inclined to dispute that in a small claims court."
What harm can be done with a copy of one's passport?,"Yes - it does increase the risk of identity theft, however for most successful identity thefts, the attacker would need various other bits of information as well. The best way to think of it is that every piece of information about you an attacker has, the less effort he has to expend to impersonate you. Once an attacker can impersonate you they could steal your money (this happens a lot with online banking), your house, your credit rating, your reputation, and generally cause you major problems. General recommendation is to not place anything in Dropbox unencrypted, if it is at all sensitive.  We have a range of questions on this topic over on Security SE and more than happy to discuss in the DMZ - the Sec.SE chat room."
"In an emergency, how do I find and share my position?","If away from civilization (and I will count this particular instance as falling there), the real answer is to have either a Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) or a Spot/InReach device. They each have their relative pluses and minuses.  A PLB is a small handheld (about the size of an adult fist) device that uses multiple emergency channels to provide information to trigger and aid a search and rescue effort. You unfold the antenna and hit a button. Using a built-in GPS it attempts to get a fix. Whether it finds that fix or not, it uses an international emergency frequency in the 400MHz range to send distress messages to satellites. If a GPS fix is available, your location is contained in the message. If not, provided you have updated your on-line profile for your trip, it has some info to go on. Of course, the particular satellite that receives the information also gives some idea of where to start looking. Further, the PLB transmits on 121.5MHz, the international frequency for downed aircraft. All search and rescue teams are trained in using this signal to home in on the source. The PLB I use (well, haven't used yet) has a single use battery that needs to be replaced every 5 years - you don't have to worry about it not working when you need it. Devices such as Spot and InReach use the Iridium constellation to send messages. Either can trigger a search and rescue operation through the network. They also provide GPS coordinates (if a fix is available) to emergency responders. One advantage is they have 2-way messaging on them, a feature the PLB lacks. If used in non-emergency situations to track your position for friends, send messages, etc., you might worry about running out of battery power at the wrong time.  Either one, properly cared and treated, is the proper way to be prepared to alert search and rescue when away from civilization (be it just hiking in the hills - lets not talk about how hard it was to get 911 to respond to a trailhead in the foothills near town - since I didn't have a street address to give them they were really confused for a while until I used Google maps to find a house address near the trailhead). "
Are there any child-free flight options?,"So far as I can tell, there are no commercial flights that are entirely child-free, There are unlikely to be, as the economics of commercial aviation work against it—the flying public favors low fares over essentially all other considerations. Every few years there is a new column suggesting it, but in the end, people aren't really willing to pay what it would take to support a child-free flight network.  From 1953 to 1970, United Airlines [in]famously offered so-called Executive flights that were for men only, between New York and Chicago and between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Cigar and pipe smoking were allowed, women and children were not. That was probably the last of it for entirely child-free flights, certainly from any U.S. carrier. There are, however, a number of airlines that have ""child-free zones"" on selected flights. Malaysian Airlines was the first in recent years, banning children from the upper deck on its A380s. Scoot offers a ScootinSilence upgrade for economy; no one under the age of 12 may be seated in the front of their 787 cabins. AirAsia X, the long-haul sister airline of AirAsia, offers what they call a Quiet Zone: 1. What is Quiet Zone?
  - Quiet Zone is an exclusive seating area between rows 7-14.
  - Only available to guest who is aged 10 years and above. Speaking as someone without children who flies a lot, I think it's a silly marketing ploy; I encounter far, far more annoying adults than annoying children on any given trip. Besides, it isn't as if there is a soundproof barrier around those sections. IndiGo offers child-free seating in rows 1–4 and 11–14, but sitting in row 4 won't insulate you from a fussy toddler in row 5. Whether the option will spread outside of Southeast and South Asia remains to be seen. Even though The Independent declared it a ""growing movement,"" there have been no new announcements since IndiGo announced it in 2016. "
Do you have to take the second leg of a domestic flight?,"This ploy is known as ""hidden-city ticketing"", and you should find plenty written about it if you search for that term. For example, Nate Silver wrote an article about it; that caused some controversy, and there was a followup on the ethics of the practice."
I have a tattoo. Can I visit a public swimming pool in Japan?,"Tattoos or Irezumi as they are called in Japanese were criminalized in the beginning of the Meiji period (some time after 1868) as a way to make a good impression on the west. (A bit ironic in this case...) It was legalized again after the war in 1948 but still retains its image of criminality.   For many years, traditional Japanese tattoos were associated with the
  yakuza, Japan's notorious mafia, and many businesses in Japan (such as
  public baths, fitness centers and hot springs) still ban customers
  with tattoos. (from wikipedias Irezumi article)"
Handshake while holding own right elbow,"It's a sign of respect. A bit like using both hands to shake yours. (Source: I lived in Africa for something like 7 years.) I personally found this more common in West Africa than East Africa. Edit: Perhaps as clarification, the right elbow typically is held with the left hand, as if to support the right arm. But, I've also often seen 'just' touching the right forearm with the fingers of the left hand."
Does the GDPR entitle me to refuse to show my boarding pass at EU airport shops?,"You can demand that explanation. In this explanation the shopkeeper/company will try to explain what they do with the data, how long they keep it, and why they think it is legal. If it is legally required to collect this data, you are out of luck. If it is not legally required but legal to collect the data, they should give you an option to opt out of data collection without limiting your access to unrelated transactions (i.e. cash for physical goods)."
Is there a way to find out if I need a transit visa for a layover in the UK?,"Why yes there is. This UK government site will tell you if you need a visa to transit through the UK. You enter your nationality, destination, and any visas you already hold, and it will tell you if you need a transit visa or not. It also includes instructions for applying for one. As a summary (but check for exceptions): You don’t need a visa if you have one of the following: All visas and residence permits must be valid. E-visas or e-residence permits are not acceptable unless your airline is able to verify it with the issuing country. Contact your airline for more information. You might be eligible for ‘transit without visa’ if: You might be eligible for ‘transit without visa’ if: One of the following must also apply: You won’t be able to transit without a visa if a Border Force officer decides you don’t qualify under the immigration rules. You can apply for a transit visa before you travel if you’re unsure whether you qualify for transiting without a visa. All visas and residence permits must be valid. Australian paper confirmation slips are not accepted. If you need more information than is provided by this website you will need to check with your airline or contact the UKVI. The Home Office's Charging Procedures - A Guide for Carriers also provides some guidance on the subtler points of the rules (it's intended for professionals, not passengers, but does explain in great details when a visa is or is not required). Transiting airside In London Heathrow, London Gatwick and Manchester, if you fly from outside the UK or Ireland and leave to another country (neither UK nor Ireland), it is possible to transit without entering the UK and going through UK Border Control, you can stay airside. There is no hotel airside, and the transit areas close overnight, so if you have an overnight stopover, you have to go through UK Border Control. There is a detailed guide available on Heathrow and Gatwick airport websites. People on any kind of valid UK visa that is senior to a transit visa do not need an additional visa.  It means the person can transit on a category ""C"" (visitor), category ""D"" (PBS), and so on. The policy is not available on the net.  I wrote to the policy unit using my lawyer hat and got this reply...  They are thinking about including this in the written guidance.  Maybe they will, maybe they won't."
"Which airlines might I have trouble taking to India, being an Israeli?","As a rule of thumb, if the country does not accept Israeli passports, its airlines will not accept them either. In the Middle East, this means primarily Iran Air, Kuwait Airways and Saudia are off the table for your itinerary.  There are a number of minor carriers in the region that would also refuse you in theory (MEA, Iraqi, etc), but as far as I'm aware none fly to India, so these would not be an issue in practice.  (To be quite precise, Iraqi actually does fly to India, but it's banned from the EU!) However, note that the five biggest players -- Emirates, Etihad, Qatar, Turkish and Gulf Air -- do accept Israeli citizens for connecting flights."
Can Customs make me go back to return my electronic equipment or is it a scam?,"No, the Customs cannot make you go back, and return the equipment.

If the ""Diplomat"" follows up with you soon asking to send $2000 to ""US Customs"" through Western Union, please go to the police."
"While on vacation my taxi took a longer route, possibly to scam me out of money. How can I deal with this?","Use an app. Virtually everywhere these days has either Uber/ Lyft/ Grab/ Gojek/ Ola/ Didi/ Yandex/ Careem /local clone ride-sharing service, or an app put out by local taxi companies in an attempt to compete.  In Istanbul, at time of writing Uber is in a weird not-quite-legal-or-illegal state, but BiTaksi seems to be the app of choice: http://www.bitaksi.com/en/ With these, you get to input the destination, you're given a price estimate, and you can see the precise routes suggested and taken, all of which make it much harder for the driver to rip you off.  And if you suspect something shady happened anyway, if you paid by card, you can dispute with the app and they may refund you. 2023 update: Uber was fully legalized in 2021 and is widely available in Istanbul."
Where to refill my bottle in India?,"In India, never drink tap water without boiling it. In Delhi, when you ask nicely at any restaurant, they will usually get your bottles filled with hot water. There will be proper filtered water available in most hotels and hostels where you can fill up. The blue drums will be found in many places and you can ask where any of those are found. Also, bottled water can be cheap compared to your country. You can get 1 liter for Rs. 20 (0.29$). Never hesitate to buy if you are running out. Just a personal note. I have faced serious health issues, even being hospitalized while in Delhi, while drinking water without boiling or from tap. Be cautious about this."
Why are some pedestrian traffic lights covered in shades in London?,"We use these in the USA and that is the only place I have noticed them. There are at least 2 general ""shade"" types, ""visors"" and ""louvers"". The addition of a visor to a traffic-signal head that is in direct sunlight can improve visibility of the signal by providing
  additional contrast between the lens and the signal head. There are different types of visors including complete circle (or tunnel), partial (or cutaway) and angle visors. -Source The purpose of a louver is to block the view of the signal from another approach. They are similar to angle visors but are better in
  limiting signal visibility to a narrow cone to the front of the
  signal. - Source It is also worth mentioning that some visor designs work well for the same purpose as Louvers, however Louvers don't generally do a very good job as Visors."
Can growing a beard cause problems in crossing borders?,"I traveled through 18 countries last year with: When entering Brazil I didn't have a beard, and most of the rest of the time I was bearded traveling with my clean-shaven passport photo. I never had one issue. Doesn't mean you won't but most of the border agents realize that people don't look exactly like their photo. If you can split the difference in your photo, I'd recommend that, but don't worry about it too much."
Is it rude to speak Swedish in Norway?,"No, in itself it is not rude. You can do it in a rude way, by just ignoring the signals if the other person is not happy about it.   Offer the person you talk with the choice.
I would start with a Norwegian hello or good morning/day, and next try out which language sits best. One time in Norway I was asked to speak Dutch rather than English (I speak no Scandinavian languages) while the seller at the market kept to her version of Norwegian, it worked for us. I have always found all Nordic people helpful and glad to communicate in whatever language or mix of languages worked best, often not their own. While most adults in Sweden and Norway will have learned English, it is not 100% that have. And the percentage that are used to speaking English will be lower outside of the areas where tourists from abroad are common.
Whether trying to speak Norwegian or keeping on Swedish or switching to speak English is best depends on your language skills, and likely how long you have been around people speaking Norwegian and how many related languages you really know.
I have found Norwegian always the easiest of the Scandinavian languages but that might be that I learned to understand Frisian (of the Dutch province Friesland) even though I do not speak it. Not Scandinavia but I have heard and/or been part of a lot of German-Dutch conversations. Some people, mostly the young ones, would ask for English while the rest were happy to understand each other."
Is it possible to make a decent income from travelling the world?,"I do exactly this, and have done so for the past five years. I am a software developer (previously web, now iOS) doing contract work for customers in a range of countries. I live in about five or six countries each year, spending anywhere from a week to several months in each. I've lived in Tokyo, Bangkok, Singapore, London, Rome, Prague, Sydney, Melbourne, Manila, Chiang Mai, Bali, Kuala Lumpur, and many more. I'm currently on a full time contract as a senior developer for a company based in a country which I have never been to.  As others have said, there's no shortcuts. It's not often easy to get remote contract work, and the usual freelancing risks are often magnified. It's a risky lifestyle with regards to job security, so you'll need to make some mental changes, and be comfortable with living a bit more on the edge. Build trust. Customers aren't going to want to take on an unknown worker in a far away country without first establishing a reasonable level of trust. Build strong business relationships with your clients. If you're doing full time contracts, don't move too fast. Travelling sucks up days at a time, in airports, trains, etc. And settling into a new workspace in a new country can have unexpected complications (dodgy internet, etc) that can cause you to lose precious workdays. Plan on spending a minimum of a week in each place, unless you've set the time aside as holiday time. Make sure you've booked and planned a decent length stay in each place that will provide you reliable internet, a work environment free of excessive distractions, and enough full work days to get the work done. Keep your customers happy. The same goes for any contract work, but when you're living in countries in which you're not a legal resident, there's no safety net to catch you if you stuff up and lose an important client. If you're only doing casual, part time work, staying in hostels is okay. But if you've got a big project that needs serious time commitment, hostels are not good. You will be surrounded by people who are on holiday, who will treat you like you are on holiday. Holidayers are the digital nomad's kryptonite - they suck up your precious work hours with casual conversation and temptations of day trips to interesting local sights. Most of the time, book serviced apartments and hotels. You'll get a distractionless work environment with reliable internet. Hostels and budget hotels are a risk to your employment, and should be reserved for weeks you set aside as mostly holiday time.  For healthcare et al, you need travel insurance. You can usually buy travel insurance for up to 12 months, which gives you at least some safety net for the year ahead. Booking 12 months insurance is not much more expensive than booking 3 months, as most of the cost is built into a base rate, regardless of duration. Travel insurance will cover immediate medical costs, as well as theft of possessions, etc. Research it well and make sure the policy covers everything you need, and that you've understood the terms. Don't bother with travel blogging or travel photography if you already have skills that fetch much higher pay (ie software development). Every backpacker with a camera and a laptop is trying to be a travel blogging photographer, and almost all of them are earning effectively nothing. Use the high paying skills you have, and earn a proper income. You don't need to downgrade your lifestyle. Work hard for the right people doing the job that you know how to do well, and you will earn a full income. There's no need to walk the streets in dirty backpacker clothes looking like an extra from The Beach."
Why are Chinese mountains scaled by steps? (instead of winding paths),"Stairs are easier to walk than rocky paths. In ancient times they allowed royalty more leisurely access to sacred mountains symbolizing their high rank in society, while commoners were likely restricted to walking older foot paths (if they were even allowed on top). Today all 'pilgrims' are afforded the ease of stairs. In Europe a lot of mountain top destinations were fortifications, so they didn't want easy stairs to the top. And today they try to preserve them as they were."

Are international driving licences really necessary for any country?,"It does vary a lot, depending on both the issuing and visited countries. For visiting Australia for an example, you either need your license to be in English, or have an IDP that translates it. There's a much narrower list of countries for whom getting an Australian license doesn't require a test, see here for more details on those things. As an Australian, RACV maintain a handy list of which countries need an IDP, which one's it's merely recommended for, and which ones you can just drive with your Australian license in. For some examples, UK doesn't require it, USA recommends it, and UAE requires it.  For how to get an IDP as an Australian, see smart traveller.  Also worth noting that they're more commonly called an International Driving Permit (IDP) in official circles, rather than an International Driving License."
What action is recommended if your accommodation refuses to let you leave without paying additional fees?,"Calling the police might be the way to go in jurisdictions within developed countries, but wouldn't necessarily work in regions where governance is weak. In this case it would be better to pay the fraudulent bill using a credit card and then dispute the transaction once you're safe and sound at home. It's likely that the credit card company will take your side given that the payment was made under the threat of violence. If the hotel insists you pay in cash and the police won't get involved, your only recourse is to sue the travel agency when you return. Although it might not get you any money back given the bankruptcy."
"When an individual enters the United States, can they have an attorney present when going through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection?",CBP generally prohibits interviewees from having access to legal counsel during immigration inspection.  The American Immigration Council's Behind Closed Doors: An Overview of DHS Restrictions on Access to Counsel has a fairly thorough account of the restrictions and of their dubious legality.
Is tipping mandatory at Restaurants and Bars in Germany?,"Tipping is not at all mandatory in Germany and usually the service personnel does not rely on tips as much as in the USA, say. Usually, if you do not state the amount you want to round up to (""make it X EUR"" — or ""Stimmt so"" if you do not expect change at all), they will start picking up coins from their purse and give you the exact amount of change without even a frown. Nevertheless, they sometimes do this search for coins suitably slowly to give you the opportunity to correct your forgetfulness by specifying your tip while they are searching or by simply not picking up all the change.  That being said, rounding up by approximately 5% up to 10% (or to the next or second next full Euro for small amounts) is overwhelmingly common for most types of Restaurant unless you were quite dissatisfied."
"What techniques, tricks or otherwise have you used to get upgrades on flights?","Probably not the answer you were hoping for, but I think the best way to get upgraded is to fly a lot with the airline. Generally when the flight's overbooked in one class, and they're trying to pick which person to upgrade, frequent flyer status is the first metric they use. The higher your status, the higher up the list you go! Having a high status with a partner airline can work too, high tiers with a partner airline usually comes below the airline's own frequent flyers, but above everyone else. Otherwise, if you're flying on your own that'll help in the event that there aren't enough frequent flyer to upgrade to free the required number of seats! Being polite and smartly dressed can help.  Offering to pay may be an option too - if they're pretty full they may offer you a low price to upgrade, on the grounds that some money from you is better than none from a free upgrade to frequent traveller. Ask at checkin about that, and see what they say.  If you have a title, make sure that's on your booking. Friends of mine who are doctors seem to get upgraded more than ones who aren't, and the airline needn't know that you happen to be a Doctor of 14th century poetry or astrophysics, rather than a medical one! In general though,the busier the flight, the more likely an upgrade. There are a few airlines that'll upgrade people to fill a higher cabin, but most these days will only do it when a cabin is full. A different option is to volunteer to be bumped off a very full flight, but upgraded on the next one they put you onto. I know Delta to that for an example, but I think it's a fairly general possibility. Does require a very busy original flight though, and the airline really wanting people to opt not to fly!"
What commercial flight route requires the most (minimum possible) stops/layovers from A to B?,"As with many questions about extremes, the answer depends on the precise rules you impose. Hops count as multiple flights: 13 flights.  It's reasonable to argue that one should be very permissive when finding record itineraries.  As such, the following 13-flight itinerary from SVR to SRV (a dyslexic's nightmare?) is one of the best single answers I know: Note that many of these flights are only offered one or two days a week, so the entire route is not particularly achievable together.  Google Flights is aware of all but the first flight, but doesn't let you book many of them; nonetheless, all of the flights can be booked online individually.  Note that this itinerary was shortened in the comments from 14 legs by using the seasonal flights in the middle; outside of the summer, it likely takes three legs to get from SFJ to ANC (eg, via CPH and LAX). A quirk of this example is passing through Thule Air Base, which requires an access permit.  An alternative is to fly from QUV Aappilattoq Heliport near the southern tip of Greenland, though now Google Flights is unaware of the initial four flights (all on helicopters): Another quirk is its sensitivity to the direction of travel.  An alternative is KBW Chignik Bay, a five-hop trip on Grant Aviation either way: If you forbid helicopters, then it seems one can replace the Greenlandic side with airplane flights on Air Inuit to/from YZG Salluit (one of the northernmost Inuit communities) as suggested in another answer: In other words, KBW ↔ YZG is the only pair I know of which requires 13 flights in either direction, all on fixed-wing aircraft and all individually known by Google flights.  But KBW requires a seaplane and counting multiple hops as single flights, the trip can be done (with even more hopping) in a mere five flights!  (YZG → SRV only works in one direction, but requires neither a helicopter nor a seaplane.) Hops count as multiple flights, available together on Google Flights: 11 flights. I think there are many of these.  Here's one from GTO Jalaluddin (Indonesia) to SRV, nearly 6000 miles geodesic distance:  Hops count as one flight: 11 flights.  If you allow helicopters, I think there are many such itineraries, although they all share one half: If you forbid Thule Air Base specifically, then you drop down to 9 flights by switching to southern Greenland (you lose two flights because of ""helicopter-hopping""): If you forbid helicopters entirely, you can achieve the same result of 9 flights by chopping off the end of the SVR itineraries: Hops count as one flight, available on Google Flights: 8 flights.  If you only demand that Google Flights be aware of the individual flights, then you can cut off SVR from the trips in the previous category to get 10 flights (9 if you forbid helicopters). If you want to be able to book the flights, then I can't get any more than 8 flights ... and I can't even get them all at once.  For example, for the following itineraries I can get a ticket for the first 7 flights, but I have to get the last segment separately: 
 OpenFlights (August 6, 2014 data refresh): 14 flights.  I also computed the answer according to the OpenFlights data suggested in the comments.  There are 9 city pairs that require 14 flights, but none seem to hold up to inspection.  I include them here for completeness: OpenFlights (November 3, 2016 live data): 12 flights.  Using a computer (as I have) helps explore the search space quickly but is sensitive to peculiarities of the data.  For example, if I use the live data from OpenFlights instead, the maximum distance is now two flights shorter.  Here are some of the 19 such city pairs:"
"Are hotel ""safes"" really a joke to open?","In-Room Safes are provided for peace of mind and to prevent petty pilfering by maids and room attendants. They are not super secure like a bank vault or a regular sized home safe. The simple fact that guests frequently forget the combo they used (or lose keys if a safe is so equipped) means that the safes have to be easily opened by other means.  Otherwise the hotels would spend a fortune calling locksmiths. Some may well be as cheesy as the one used in your videos, but others are more secure and difficult to ""crack"".  You can't really draw a blanket conclusion."
"If, like Edward Snowden, your passport was revoked or cancelled, how could you travel?","Very simple: From the US State Department Website last sentence. A federal or state law enforcement agency may request the denial of a passport on several regulatory grounds under 22 CFR 51.70 and 51.72. The principal law enforcement reasons for passport denial are a federal warrant of arrest, a federal or state criminal court order, a condition of parole or probation forbidding departure from the United States (or the jurisdiction of the court), or a request for extradition. The HHS child support database and the Marshals Service WIN database are checked automatically for entitlement to a passport. Denial or revocation of a passport does not prevent the use of outstanding valid passports. So if you have a passport that is valid.  Until you're in the country that shares information with country revoking the passport and chooses to comply with this revocation the only country you're not going to be able to enter would be the country issuing the passport."
What exactly is a marshrutka (маршрутка)?,"Just to add to the above guys answers. Маршрутка (Marshrutka) is a slang. It's a shortened version of ""Маршрутное такси"" (can be roughly translated as ""Routed"" taxi, essentially a taxi that has a specified route that it always has to take). Usually looks like a minibus/minicab. Therefore can behave like a bus: but also is like a taxi because It might be more difficult to use this way of transport for people who doesn't speak the local language because you have to actually say where you want the driver to stop (when dropping off) unlike busses when they will either stop at a bus stop anyway or people can press the STOP button without any interaction with the driver. Of course, on Marshrutka you can simply awkwardly just leave when someone else has requested a stop but that might not be the best course of action if it's far away from your intended destination (but could work okay if you're going to a popular/busy destination where a lot of people get off anyway).  In the Marshrutka that I used to take, people either were specific and said ""Остановитесь пожалуйста у [name of a place/building/supermarket/something]"" (Ostanovites' pozhalujsta u [name] / Please stop at [name]), or they just said ""На остановке пожалуйста"" (Na ostanov'ke pozhalujsta / On the bus stop please). The last one is a shortened version of ""Остановитесь на остановке пожалуйста"" (Ostanovites' na ostanov'ke pozhalujsta / Stop on the bus stop please). "
"In US museums, why are backpacks only allowed to be carried on one shoulder?","Because if your bag is large enough to be only carried on your back (i.e. you cannot carry it on one shoulder), you'll much more likely to bump into, and do some damage to objects/sculptures/other people while turning around. This is because you don't see your bag, and it is much harder to estimate how big it is when maneuvering. It is much less likely when your bag is on your side, as you can see it. Also with a large back on your back you're taking up to twice more space, which may be a problem near crowded exhibitions. Update: Clément provided a link which confirmed the above theory, at least from Smithsonian Museum of American Art: For the protection of our artworks, suitcases, large umbrellas, large
  bags, and large backpacks are not allowed in the galleries. Smaller
  backpacks and bags are permitted, at the discretion of the museum’s
  security officers, if they are hand-carried. Backpacks may not be worn
  on the back, but must be carried on the side, under the arm, or on the
  front of the body. These limitations help us protect the artworks from
  accidental damage."
What happens if someone I invited to Schengen area does not leave?,"According to the Swiss government's Information on Declaration of Sponsorship (pdf), a guarantor cannot legally vouch for a guest's departure from Switzerland.  Any statements you may have made purporting to guarantee your guest's departure from the Schengen area are probably therefore without effect. If you submitted such a form, you have undertaken to guarantee the payment of certain costs related to your guest, should they arise: By signing the declaration of sponsorship, the guarantor undertakes to cover the following costs:
  Costs arising from sickness, accident, return transport and living costs, which would otherwise arise for public welfare or private medical services during the applicant’s stay in Switzerland A maximum of CHF 30,000 for individuals or groups and families of up to 10 people who are travelling together. Since the document appears to cover costs arising from the applicant's stay in Switzerland, as opposed to the Schengen area, you may even be off the hook if your (former) guest incurs any such costs in Germany. Without having access to the actual text of the form, it is difficult to say anything more precise.  If you can post the text of the guarantee, perhaps as an image of the form with identifying information blacked out, it may be possible to analyze it in more detail. As you indicate in a comment that you didn't submit a formal guarantee but rather an informal statement in your invitation letter, the government probably discounted the guarantee from the start.  Such guarantees generally do not carry any weight, since a sponsor or host is not really in a position to offer the guarantee. In most cases, a guarantee says that the guarantor will do something specific if a certain condition is met.  For example, when a merchant offers a money-back guarantee of the consumer's satisfaction, the merchant is undertaking to refund money when the consumer is unsatisfied.  The guarantee you gave has no such backing: you haven't undertaken to do anything in particular if the person does not leave. You are perhaps right to wonder whether your credibility would be called into question for future visa applications where you are the sponsor.  There's not much you can do about that at this point, except to hope that the Swiss don't notice.  It might also be a good idea not to make any claims about your prospective guests' plans to leave the Schengen area; that's normally a matter between the state and the traveler (unless the host has signed the formal declaration of sponsorship, of course). If the host has not signed the declaration, then the host's role in the visa application is generally just to confirm the traveler's itinerary and that the traveler has a place to sleep.  The host does not play a significant role in the assessment of whether the applicant will leave the country."
"Why do people in the Marrakech Medina say ""That way is closed""?","You are spot-on: the purpose is to mislead and confuse tourists. The ""don't go that way, it's closed"" technique is a common ""scam"" you will witness in those Moroccan cities which are commonly targeted by tourists. The idea is to get you to engage with the kind person who is trying to help you. In doing so the person will offer to guide you around and will ask you for a fee at the end. Whilst guiding you they will most probably take you to their friend's shops with whom they most probably share some profit. I have seen this happen in Marrakech, Rabat, Essaouira and Ouarzazate. I am pretty sure similar things happen elsewhere around the world though. The best way to deal with this IMHO is to politely decline and from there on completely ignore whomever is trying to scam you. Whilst doing so keep your belongings under control. When I was touring the souks I'd usually keep my money and mobile phone in my front pockets and would never take my hands out of them."

Male using change tables in female restrooms in Japan,"It is quite rare these days (even inside trains) for the changing tables to be in the women's section, usually they will be somewhere in between the two sections, or inside the separate large restroom with the wheelchair icon (yes, you can use it too). If you do encounter such a case, though, it's not different than elsewhere. An apology (shitsurei itashimasu) and a bow are usually de rigueur, but as a foreigner you could dispense with them. When leaving, do the same but in the past sense (shitsurei itashimashita). Try as I may, I cannot find a single Japanese news report of it ever causing a problem (and, in particular, subtantiating any of the stories found on obscure forums such as this one). This Q&A thread on the website of the Yomiuri advises to only do it as a last resort, and even then only after obtaining the staff's permission, which I suppose seems reasonable. You can copy the following on your phone or print it or whatever: In virtually any reasonably modern place, you will be accompanied to the multipurpose room (多目的室) you had not noticed."
What is way to eat rice with hands in front of westerners such that it doesn't appear to be yucky?,"Who are you trying to eat in front of? There's no single answer here. If it's strangers: there is no way. You must always respect local custom in order to meet the standards of etiquette local to your surroundings. Use a fork, spoon, or chopsticks (chopsticks are not local custom in the West but are seen as exotic rather than uncouth). If it's business relationships or customers: use a fork. You could make relationships that allow you to eat with your fingers but it is not worth it; respect local norms and make your business relationships easier. If it's friends, colleagues, or classmates: eat with your fingers and talk to them about Indian norms. They should respect your culture and, indeed, be interested in it. If they're not, stop wasting your time with them. If it's a potential romantic partner: eat with a fork the first time then start doing it your way. You need to signal that you're capable of behaving in public but you should then relax into whatever makes you happy. If they can't deal with your cultural differences, avoid that relationship."
"I am Chinese. Which name is my surname and which is my last name, for a flight booking?","In terms of booking flights, the only thing you need to consider is what your passport says. It will have fields that are also marked in English, such as ""Surname"" and ""Given names"". When you book flight tickets, input exactly what is in those fields, in the corresponding field to what your passport refers to as your ""Surname"", ""Given names"", etc. If that happens to be wrong according to your actual name, local naming conventions, etc, then that is perhaps something the issuing authority of your passport could consider dealing with. However, in terms of booking tickets, the only thing you personally can do is input everything exactly as it appears in your passport, in the corresponding fields. That is what airlines, governments, etc. will want to see, and the absence of it will typically cause problems. "
"When walking on the road, is it safer to walk in the same or opposite direction as the traffic?","From EU traffic rules for pedestrians: So as you said when you walk in opposite direction of the traffic, you can see the approaching vehicles in front of you. OK, you don't see them after they pass you, but at this moment (almost) all danger is past."
"What's the meaning of the sign ""Broken white line only marks the centre of the road""?","In short: It means ""Don't assume any of the usual meanings of a broken line in Spain, except for marking the center of the road"". In long: The meaning is obvious. At least, it seems obvious for drivers in Spain.  In Spain, a broken line means that you can overtake while a continuous line means you can't, and in curvy roads the line changes very often from broken to continuous (and even to continuous for one side and broken for the other) according to circumstances of the road - mostly about visibility but also about intersections with other roads. In roads with that sign, as it reads, the broken line just marks the center of the road and it doesn't show whether you can overtake. Therefore, you must assess if you can overtake using the other rules in road code, which basically fall back to the rule that you can overtake where visibility is enough to make sure that there isn't an incoming vehicle in the opposite direction. If the road were narrower than the one depicted in the OP, the sign would be also warning that we can't assume that every vehicle will be completely in its side of the line, especially for trucks. In that case, there would likely be a speed limitation signal. Addition to address comments concerning why aren't the whole road (or the unsafe parts) painted with continuous line: Those roads are just small roads with little traffic, some of them just upgraded from unpaved tracks. That kind of small roads in some places in Spain used to carry no lines at all. A better improvement could include complete road marks and a lot of traffic signs, but that improvement is nor easy not cheap, and for small roads with little traffic it is not done. Therefore, the road is just an asphalt strip with a broken line in the middle. From experience, I must add that it isn't hard to drive in those roads - at least, lack of continuous/broken line doesn't make it harder than driving in any other narrow curvy road. As any driver knows, you can't overtake if you can't check that there is no incoming vehicle, and you don't need a continuous line to tell that you can see the road more than a few metres ahead because a curve obstructs the view."
How do I convey that I'm ready to pay my tab in Greece?,"In many parts of Europe it is considered rude for a restaurant to bring you your bill without being asked. Meals are expected to be relaxed, unhurried affairs, and for a restaurant to bring the bill, or ask for payment, without being asked is seen as them trying to hurry you out. As such it is absolutely expected that you ask for the bill, or if you already have the bill ask to pay it. Attract the waiter's attention. This is more acceptable in Europe than the US, because generally a waiter won't disturb you unless they think you want something. (The endless ""is everything alright - how is the food?"" questions from North American waiters still faintly irritates some of us European expats.) If language is a problem, then the universal ""mime writing something on your hand"" usually works. Have a look at what others are doing - they may be paying at the counter (though this is pretty rare in Europe). If you are in a hurry, ask for the bill as soon as your last item is brought, and ask to pay as soon as the bill is brought. If you are paying by cash, then leaving the cash on the table is also acceptable"
Can I stay in the airplane toilet during landing?,"One of the steps of preparing the cabin for landing is checking that all passengers are seated and buckled up, no passengers are using the toilets and toilets are locked (it can be [un]locked from outside). The reasons behind checking the toilets for passengers during landings and takeoffs are related to both safety and security. The safety related reasons are obvious, landings can be hard and you sitting in the toilet can be dangerous. Security related reasons are also obvious, the aircraft is closer to the land and most likely over a city, which make the sabotage plans have bigger effects. Once they are sure you are simply doing nothing wrong, they won't escalate it. Remember, the cabin crew will deliver the message to the captain depending on the first impression they get, that impression can be a threat impression, or a a guy with bad stomach impression. The captain will react according to the first call since it is a landing which is considered a critical phase in the airlines business, the reaction can be as extreme as declaring an emergency landing, or as simple as ""tell the guy to hang on to something"". Finally, the reaction will be different from one airline to another, country to another, crew to another. In some countries I would expect the reaction to be extreme in the name of security, while in some others (like in Asia) the crew might be more understanding. In any case, the crew are humans, and they do understand human needs."
"What is this ""bridge"" over the Suez Canal?","There is an entry for it in OpenStreetMap, noted as ""movable bridge"". The government website for the Canal has a gallery for a ""floating bridge"", which suggests it is some form of pontoon bridge. Using this lets us dig around a bit and it turns out that there are a number of different pontoon bridges recently established at various points on the canal: The El-Nasr bridge in Port Said (northern end of the canal) was opened in 2016; this article gives some engineering details and a very similar photo. Labelled on Google Maps here, and you can see it being split open to allow through passage of ships (or possibly it is in the middle of being reassembled). The Abanoub Gerges bridge in El Qantara was opened in 2017. Labelled on Google Maps here. The Ahmed el-Mansy bridge was opened in 2017 at Ismailia; this page has a photo of it being traversed by a container ship. Labelled on Google Maps here. The Google Maps image suggests they are fully rotated against the bank, while the photo in the article suggests middle sections can be removed seperately. Could be it's worked both ways. The Taha Zaki Abdullah Bridge in Ismailia was opened in 2019. This is probably on Google Maps here - it's not specifically named, though. You can see a pair of pontoon bridges pulled alongside the edges of the channels, and on the western bank, a series of individual pontoon units. The Ahmed Omar Shabrawy bridge is in Al Shat district in Suez governorate; opening date not clear. This 2019 statement confirms five bridges were established. I think the last one, Ahmed Omar Shabrawy Bridge, is the one we're seeing here; the others are too far north and can be identified separately on the maps."
Do airport metal scanners occasionally flash a false alarm on purpose?,"Sometimes.  At least in the TSA Precheck lanes in the United States, the metal detectors (Precheck lanes use metal detectors, not body scanners) can alarm randomly to alert the screeners to perform a random check (you can read various anecdotal experiences in this forum thread). Some people report it happening frequently enough to them that they suspect it's less than random, though I know of no definitive proof of this, and the nature of random events is such that some people will feel singled out regardless. In my experience, the TSA screener at the lane can tell the difference between an alarm caused by the presence of metal (they'll tell you to check your pockets or take off your watch or belt or whatever) and one caused by the randomizer. In some cases, they'll stop you and tell you that it's random as you start to check your pockets. If the random alarm goes off, they usually do a hand swab or a brief pat-down or some other additional check; I've heard of people getting sent to the body scanner as well. While the exact configuration of airport security equipment is typically confidential information, it's not uncommon for the manufactures of walk-through metal detectors to offer an optional ""programmable Random Alarm capability."" In the case of one particular model, ""Random alarms are indicated by a pulsed alarm audio and zone lights sequencing from top to bottom."" The likelihood of a random alarm can be adjusted on the control panel. "
Giving First Aid in the USA,"The advice given to me in my paramedic course, and the advice I give my students is along the lines of: Anyone can sue you for anything at any time, for any reason. (They won't necessarily be successful.) If you act in the best interests of the patient, acting as a reasonable and prudent person, you'll most likely be fine. A lot of people that are sued for rendering aid are sued because they try to play doctor (see below), for failing to act as a reasonable and prudent person would, or for negligence (see below). If you're providing basic first aid within your scope of training (or doing common-sense things like controlling bleeding, despite not being trained), you'll likely be fine. Cases of gross negligence and outright malice aside, the chances are extremely slim that anything will happen.
First, we (the responders) don't typically collect any information about bystanders (unless you're a witness to a crime or something). Secondly, you are not a likely target for lawyers.

Can you buy the same ticket at a lower price if you buy it from another country?,"Airlines do sometimes publish fares that are different based on the ""Point of Sale"" (POS), which basically refers to the country in which the ticket is purchased. As an example of why they do this, consider flights between the US and Australia in July.  July is summer in the northern hemisphere but winter in the southern hemisphere, so there is likely to be more demand from Australians visiting the US at that time of year than there is people from the US visiting Australia. As a result of this demand, the airline may choose to increase the price of flights for Australians (who are more likely to pay them as they are headed to summer!) and keep the price the same for Americans who would not be willing to pay the higher charges. So yes, this does happen. Not always, but sometimes. So the next question is how can you make use of this?  The simple answer is that it depends on the airlines involved. Sometimes simply using a travel agency in the country you want to book from is enough. That could be a physical travel agency (eg, via phone/email), or an online travel agency.  Sometimes you can use the local website of the airline that you're wanting to book, or even just their global website but changing the country selection on the website  (eg, United Airlines has a dropdown box on their website to select the country). In general there's no need to be seen to be in the country that you're booking from, so generally no need to use a VPN - although it's certainly possible there are websites out there that do require this. However as you can imagine, airlines generally don't like you doing this as it costs them money!  As a result, over the past few years they have started taking action to stop this from happening.  Travel agents that repeatedly exploit this loophole have received warnings to stop doing it (and can potentially be ""fined"" by the airline on the basis that it is normally against their agreement with the airline to make such bookings). Many online travel agents and some airline have added additional checks to stop people abusing this loophole.  For example, when booking a ticket on the United Airlines website, if the country your credit card is from is different to the country you're claiming to be from, then it will re-price the ticket using your credit cards country.  Unless you have credit cards from multiple countries, then it's not possible to book these flights via their website! Also if your credit card has foreign transaction fees, you will need to factor these into the price - you're going to be charged in the foreign currency so you'll be hit with a conversion fee (often 3% or so) unless you have a payment method that doesn't charge such fees. As far as finding such ""deals"", the ITA Software ""Matrix"" tool will allow you to set the ""Sales City"" which will act as the point of sale (You can also set the currency, which will affect only the displayed price and NOT the point of sale). For example, using that tool for a flight from Australia to the US in July as mentioned above, the flights between SYD-SFO-SYD for some random dates costs US$1,976 if purchased in ""Sydney"", but only US$1,738 if purchased in ""San Francisco"" - so in this case someone from Australia could save US$250 booking on the US site rather than the Australian site (presuming, of course, they could find someone in the US that would actually sell them the ticket - the United.com website would not!)"
How to know if a meal was cooked with or contains alcohol?,"I have never seen such an icon. The only way to know is to ask for it. Common sense is that in a lot of countries where alcohol is prohibited by religion or not really within the local culture, you won't find it in cooking. Now, in other countries where alcohol is strong in the local culture, it will be used in the cooking and will never be specified as it is kind of obvious for cooks, like the use of spice in Asia."
Is there a website listing the location of all the Windows 10 lock screens?,"Windows 10 has added an update in the latest version allowing users to see where the photo came from. In the top-left corner of each lock screen there is now a short description of the location. Clicking the description opens a Bing search with the location's name.  In addition, the ""Like what you see?"" button now shows the location as well:  If you're unable to see the helpful tip, follow this guide from SuperUser. Finally you may try checking Wiki's article on Microsoft Spotlight which lists many of the previously used locations."
Are battery packs allowed in hand luggage?,"There are limits that were introduced by the US Federal Aviation Administration. Those have been used as well by numerous other airlines, for example Cathay Pacific. They generally impose a limit on capacity per passenger and on top of this disallow checking them in, so you must take them into your hand luggage. If a website lists grams of Lithium, use this formula (source): Equivalent Lithium Content (ELC). ELC is a measure by which lithium
ion batteries are classified. 8 grams of equivalent lithium content are equal to about 100 watt-hours.
25 grams of equivalent lithium content are equal to about 300 watt-hours. You can arrive at the number of watt-hours your battery provides if
you know how many milliamp hours and volts your battery provides:
mAh/1000 x V = wh There is additional information available from the TSA and the IATA. Some more information here from Thailand, as of Jan 2015 (sorry, a bit shaky):  Essentially, anything above 32'000 mAh is forbidden, below that and above 20'000 mAh is limited to 2 per person, below that there are no limits, but all only in hand luggage."
Is it possible to enter Russia by train 1-1.5 hours before the visa validity period starts?,"There are things I would try doing and there are the others. Attempting to enter Russia before my visa is valid (or attempt to overstay my Russian visa) even if by a few hours only clearly belongs to the others. The visa is valid from a minute before 00:01 of its first validity date and until a minute after 23:59 of its last validity date. Entering the country earlier (even two hours) is illegal entrance. While the Finnish conductors and even the passport/toll people often seem rather nice (and I have heard one joke around with the passengers), the same cannot be said for the Russian ones. I perceive them as people I would not want to cross. Even if the Russian border personnel does not board until Vyborg (Viipuri), they will know that the train entered their country at 22:00 and that you need a valid visa for today if you are on that train. On an unrelated note: I read it on VR’s (Finnish state railway’s) website (but can’t find it anymore) that if you intend to travel with Tolstoi, the night train from Moscow, you must make sure that your visa is valid for an ‘additional’ day, since the train does not cross the border until well after midnight. So: No, just no. If your visa is valid from day X, do not enter Russia until day X."
Why is it sometimes cheaper to fly within the UK than taking the train?,"One of the big differences between UK and EU rail pricing, is that the UK uses the supply and demand and Willingness To Pay (WTP) pricing model similar to that used by airlines, while many EU train services use a much simpler €/km pricing model. This way, in the UK you get odd things like a short rail journey costing (say) £9.40 single and just £9.60 return; and you get outlandishly high fares for last minute travel on the next train, but reasonably good discounts if you plan your journey weeks in advance and pay for a specific off-peak departure (bit like an airline in that respect). As for air travel, passengers across Europe have become accustomed to the business model of low-cost airlines, and have the expectation of being able to fly many hundreds of km for next to no money, so long as they are prepared put up with all the rules and regulations of the airlines and the airports.  See for example: this story from early 2016"
Are Indians as pushy to one another as they appear to be to Westerners?,"It's not ""Indians"" that are pushy. Not ""Indians"". That makes it sound like everybody. It's ""rickshaw drivers, taxi drivers, and some street vendors in India."" I never found pushiness from regular people other than when queueing up to buy tickets at the train station. Just from people in certain professions, and mostly in touristy areas. So it's not really based on race or nationality, but on profession and opportunity. Yes. It's definitely worse for foreigners / westerners / ""white"" people, but ... You can actually chat to these people. I try to keep a good sense of humour and ask them if they hassle Indians as much and they tell me no because the Indians don't like to pay them much money. They really like it when you treat them like real people rather than just annoyances. It might not make them leave you alone but it leaves you both happier being friendly with them than being adversarial. How to avoid a lot of pushy drivers and vendors. Keep away from the busiest tourist zones when you can be somewhere else. Sometimes you can't avoid it, like exiting a train station, or arriving or departing from a tourist site. But other times, such as getting things done in a city like Mumbai (finding a restaurant, buying supplies, getting the feel of a place) all you have to do is take some road other than the main tourist road. In Mumbai the next street over from the main tourist street I found everybody so nice, nobody pushy at all. The pushy types follow the biggest chances of money. Even if you're in a busy touristy place and you want something, avoid the loud drivers and vendors. They are good at getting people's' attention and then getting their money. But there are also plenty of meek people in India who can't bring themselves to act like this. They might have the next fruit stand over from the loud pushy guy. They might be waiting patiently in their rickshaw elsewhere in the train station grounds rather than crowding around the exit doors. Go to those quiet people instead. The noisy ones see that they've lost you as a potential customer and look for somebody else to annoy. When regular people are pushy. As I mentioned the one place I found non drivers non vendors to be pushy is when queueing to buy train tickets at stations. Toward the end of my month in India I finally learned the trick for this. Be nice and happy and smiley and friendly and say ""namaste"" to people. It was amazing. People suddenly saw me as somebody like them rather than as an ignorant outsider tourist. They filled out my forms for me, they pushed other Indians out of the way to get my form to the ticket seller behind the window! India has a different flow, you have to learn how to go with it. Just because of its unique properties, like the huge population, the huge gap between rich and poor, the poverty of the poor, the crowding, etc, it's not like most places you might travel. For this reason the ways you normally go about things can cause some friction that will make you grumpy and tired. Getting grumpy and tired isn't nice. The best thing to do is to take the opportunity to learn about people and learn about yourself by thinking of new ways to do things that are different to how you would normally behave elsewhere, but work smoother in India and leave you less grumpy and tired. It's not easy, especially when you first arrive, especially if it's hot and humid. But when you finally ""get it"", it's really rewarding and you will fall in love with India!"
How to use public transport in Russia with limited knowledge of Russian?,"While you will generally experience a strong language barrier, the public transport system should be the least of your worries. With a bit of beforehand knowledge it can be an easy, interesting and safe experience during your stay. Airports are traditionally the most foreigner-friendly places in any country. You will find most signs and information in English (and sometimes even Chinese) and many employees will have at least a basic understanding of English. Right after you arrive, you will simply follow the other passengers from the plane to the passport check. In many airports there are many counters and some specifically say ""Only for Russian citizens"" while others are titled ""All Passports"", but in most cases it does not matter in which line you stand. It might be that a woman directs you in which line to stand, in which case it's probably best to follow that. When it is your turn, hand them your passport (and boarding pass when exiting the country) and be prepared to sign your migration card. This is an important document that (the size of a passport page) that will be taken from you again when you leave the country. Don't lose it! When you are through the passport check, take your luggage and head out through the customs channel. There will be many taxi drivers offering you rides, but you should very much avoid driving with one of them. This is a common rip-off strategy where they will drive you somewhere and afterwards extort an extremely high fare from you (10 or more times higher than the regular fare would have been). Instead, try to catch a bus. Most airports are connected to the city's regular bus lines. The stops are often marked with an A (for ""avtobus""). In most cities you can enter at any door and sit down without a ticket. A conductor, who is easily recognizable by her bright jacket, coil of tickets and sometimes electronic validator, will walk around and sell tickets. No need to talk very much: the fare is mostly printed over the door (something like 20 - 50 RUB) and you can simply hand her that amount. To clarify it doesn't hurt to say you want one ticket: just say ""adín"", where the accent marks the emphasis of the word. Sometimes luggage costs extra, so you might need to buy two tickets. You will receive a small paper ticket with 6 numbers. Russians sometimes check if they have a ""lucky ticket"" (счастливый билет) by comparing the sum of the first 3 and last 3 digits: if they match, some people decide to eat the ticket for good luck. You arrive at a metro station. Note that in Moscow buses work differently: you enter in the front at the door marked Вход (entrance) and buy a ticket from the driver and go through a turnstile. You can exit again through one of the back doors (Выход). To further complicate things, this was recently changed in Moscow and you can now enter through any door and validate your ticket electronically at a box near the doors. Most large cities in Russia have a metro (subway). To enter you need either a contact-less card (БСК, BSK) or a token in the form of a special coin. Both you can always buy from a counter (касса) right in front of the turnstile. If the metro uses tokens (like in Saint Petersburg or Kazan for example), it is enough to say ""dva"" (2) and put money into the dish under the window. The cost of one ride is between 40 and 55 ruble and should be printed on or next to the window. For frequent travelers and tourists it is often cheaper to buy a card that has money loaded onto it. The fare per ride is reduced by a considerable amount like that. If the system uses RFID cards, also those can be bought at the counter. In Moscow, they are called ""yedíny"" (united), since the card allows you to drive not only with metro, but also with the regular bus and tram. In some cities (Moscow and Saint Petersburg for example) you can buy tickets also from a machine. The interface, however, is often only in Russian, so it might make less problems to just go to the counter. Credit cards (Visa, MasterCard) are almost always accepted. If you are planning on staying a bit longer in Moscow or know you will eventually come back, you can instead by the Troika card. This works similar to the Oyster card in London: you charge it with some money and can ride with any public transport (bus, metro, trolleybus, tram). Each ride costs a bit less than if you'd just buy single tickets. The cards expire 5 years after their last use. You can buy them at most metro stations from a machine (in English), or everywhere at the касса. When you have your ticket, you can enter the metro system. You will walk through a metal detector and if it beeps, you are sometimes asked to walk to another detector on the side and take out your keys, wallet and phone. Most of the time, however, no one cares, especially during rush hour. You might also be asked to have your bags checked. Simply put them on the xray scanner next to the turnstile and take them after they have been checked. Throw the token into the slot/hold the card to the reader at the turnstile and wait until the light turns green. You can drive as long as you want, as many stops as you want with as many transfers as you want, but you need to pay again if you leave the metro and want to enter again from outside. This means you should make sure you go onto the correct escalator when trying to change stations. Once you are on the escalator that goes outside, you'll need to pay again, since the escalators up and down are mostly completely separated. In the Two Capitals (as Moscow and Saint Petersburg are sometimes called) the metro lines colors and names/numbers. Orientation is relatively easy if you know what station you want to go to. The current station is printed in cyrillic at the platform. Yandex (the Russian Google) has an app with offline metro maps and a navigator (Yandex.Metro).  A map of the metro system with some information in English can often be found between the platforms. Sometimes there is an electronic display showing the next stop, or a LED display that marks already visited stops. Metro trains arrive every 1-5 minutes, there is no schedule but instead a display that shows when the last train left. Typically when the clock shows 2-3 minutes, a new train will drive in. To figure out the direction you need to go, you should have a look at the metro map. In Moscow, often only big metro stations are written to help orientation, while Saint Petersburg has a full list of stations you can reach in a particular direction. Once you found out, hop on. During rush hour it can get very crowded and it is sometimes best to just let one or two trains pass until you find one that has fewer people in it. While you wait, admire the metro station itself! In Moscow and Saint Petersburg they are not just the means to get to sights, but are sights themselves. This is true in particular for the metro stations in the center. Many of them are themed to reflect their name: Sportivnaya station in SPb has Olympic torches as lamps, Mendeleyevskaya in Moscow has molecule-like lamps, Komsomolskaya (Moscow) and Avtovo (SPb) have chandeliers, stucco, columns and golden decoration. Some pictures to get you started.If that is not interesting, there is free WiFi in Moscow and SPb metro systems. The network is called MT_Free. If it doesn't connect automatically, open the browser and type something. You should be redirected to some advertisement, after which it should work.  In the metro you might be asked ""выходите?"" (""vyhóditye"", ""Are you leaving?"") if you are blocking another person who wants to leave. Shake your head and try to move to the side to let them pass. Russians take care of etiquette in public transport, and so should you. Announcements will regularly remind you to offer your seat to elderly, disabled or pregnant people or women with children. If you sit and see someone enter who that description fits to, get up; you might risk an unfriendly remark otherwise and need to get up anyway. Now is the time to observe Russians on their daily commute: in winter, you'll be surprised by the many fur coats (""shuba"") and fur hats. At any time, there will be people trying to sell flexible pencils, passport covers and world maps, soldiers and police officers going commuting and couples going out to the movie theatre. Changes between metro lines involve a lot of walking. Get out and follow the arrows to the color your next line has. Simple as that. Note that stations which are connected by stairs but are at different metro lines mostly have a different name, which can cause some confusion. The purple, blue and orange lines in the Saint Petersburg metro meet at one station which has three different names (Spasskaya, Sennaya Ploschad', Sadovaya) but are all connected by tunnels and stairs. When you are on the escalator, make sure to stand on the right and walk on the left. Otherwise you'll earn eyerolls and ""polite"" reminders to move to the side. Also interesting is that escalators have a guard, sitting at the bottom of the escalator in a small booth and watching everything on a screen. They might sometimes make an announcement to not run on the escalator, to hold onto the handrail etc. When you are out, you should (often, at least) see grandmas selling vegetables, fruits, flowers, scarves and socks. If someone is handing you some flyer, take it; otherwise they need to stand around even longer in the cold. Trams work in much the same way as buses: you get in and pay the fare directly to the conductor in return for a paper ticket. Conductors mostly remember you and will not ask you again to pay, but if they do, just show your ticket. Trams connect major intersections and points of interest and are somewhat between metro and buses regarding density and frequency of the service. Trams have (like buses) predefined stops. This is opposed to minibuses, which generally don't. Minibuses (or ""marshrutki"") are small, privately-owned buses with about 12 seats. This service is the densest and most unusual for most people. To find the route it is advised to use Yandex.Maps, since it is able to use the route data of minibuses (compared to Google Maps, which doesn't offer such routes in its navigation). In many cities, the numbers of such minibuses start with K with 2 or 3 following digits, as opposed to regular buses which don't have the K prefix. Most of them are small, white vans with their respective number printed on the door and a rough outline of the route they will take. Major stops such as metro stations or sights are printed in Russian as a list on the door. When entering, pay the fare directly to the driver. The fare is about the same as for buses (20 - 55 ruble) and is posted either outside the door or above the driver seat in large numbers. Just hand the money to the driver; in some cities you will get a ticket, in others not. Either way, get your change and sit down. If the minibus is very full, people are sometimes not able to move from the back door to the driver to pay. In that case it is common to hand the money to the person in front of you, until it reaches the driver. The same goes backwards with the change and the ticket. This system works astonishingly well and it is likely that you are tapped several times during your ride to help in this money transfer. While you are doing that, it is also useful to check the route of the minibus with Yandex.Maps etc and to make yourself heard when you want to get out. Marshrutki only stop at large intersections or metro stations, unless someone asks the driver to stop somewhere else or someone wants to get in. When you get close to your destination, simply shout ""astanavítye, pazhálusta!"" (Stop, please) and exit. In smaller cities you should close the door yourself, in others it closes automatically. When you hear shouting after you left, better attempt to close it or run away quickly. Note that since these minbuses are often privately owned, you cannot use combined metro-bus tickets (e.g. in Moscow) or credit cards. Here, cash is king. That is again pretty much the same as a normal bus. It gets its power from overhead power lines, but in all other respects behaves like a bus. You again pay at the conductor. Some lines in Moscow especially require you to buy a ticket from the driver. There will be a turnstile a bit after you enter through the front door and you give the appropriate amount to the driver in return for an RFID card, your ticket. When you come from Vnukovo airport, the bus you need to catch will be such a kind. You probably want to buy a ""единый билет"" (yedinyi bilyet). Smaller cities (I'm thinking of Saratov as the only example where I have seen this) might have another interesting system to pay: you enter at any door and there will not be a conductor. Instead, you pay the driver when you leave through the front door. The price is probably written over the door, you just hand them the money and leave. Be careful to leave through the front door in such cases. Trains have a long tradition in Russia: they are efficient ways to cross the enormous distances between cities and are often used by locals. You can buy a train ticket on the English website of Russian Railways (РЖД, RZD). A few things to keep in mind when purchasing tickets: плацкарт:
 Note that bunks 25, 26, 27 and 28 are in one section. I already made the mistake to assume that since bunks 23, 24, 25 and 26 are closer together, it means they form one section. They don't. купе:
 You bought your ticket, what now? Mostly, you just need to have a passport and an electronic copy of your ticket. When you arrive at the train station and found your platform, the conductor will check that you have a ticket. She will just check your passport number in her list. If you have a foreign passport with letters instead of numbers, it might be useful to show your ticket and seat number; that makes it easier for the conductor (проводница, provodnitsa). Once your name is ticked, you are good to go. Find your bed and put away your luggage. Make yourself familiar with the surroundings: bathrooms are often located at both ends of the wagon, some only work when the train is moving. Power outlets can be found next to the bathroom and in newer trains next to every bed. Pillows and matresses should be on the top bunk. Extra wool blankets are very high up in the luggage section. In the front of the wagon will be the conductor you just met. She is responsible for a variety of things: you will get bed sheets from her, she will generally clean the floor and bathrooms and also sell coffee, tea, snacks and newspapers. Next to her door should also be a самовар (samovar) from which you can take hot water at any time for free. If you didn't bring a cup, you can ask for a подстаканник (podstakannik, a kind of tea-glass), it should also be free. These tea-glasses are quite unique and definitely add to your train experience. You can of course also buy all your food before and eat it on the train. In fact, many Russians do exactly this: bring instant noodles, tea and cookies and eat it during the entire trip, especially before the train starts moving. After the train has started moving, the проводница will go to every section, introduce herself and explain a few things: whether the toilets work at stations, where the restaurant wagon is, etc. She will also (again) check your ticket and passport and bring you bed lining. It is common to change into comfy clothes and flipflops and relax - for most of the way there is no mobile reception and while WiFi technically exists on some trains, it almost never works. Now is the time to improve your Russian and listen to someone who will tell their life story to everyone in the train. All night long. Before you arrive at your destination, the conductor will wake you up. Take the lining off and leave it on the bed. Sometimes you might also need to bring it to some bin next to her cabin, that depends. There should be no rush to get out of the train, since they stop for up to an hour at major stations. You can cross the vastness of Russia also often with buses. They are often cheaper but also much less comfortable than trains on the same route. The quality strongly varies between companies and it might be a good idea to read reviews about a certain route first. Such bus services also go to surrounding countries, notable here is especially LuxExpress. They connect most cities in the Baltics and Eastern Scandinavia with comfortable buses. You can buy tickets online and just bring your passport to the bus stop. Smaller buses also cross country borders. Most of the time everyone needs to get out at the border and go through the passport check on foot. In the meanwhile the bus is checked for smuggled goods. After that's done, everyone gets in and keeps driving. As in most countries it is not recommended to take a wild taxi, i.e. one without a proper license and visible registration number. Taxis are quite cheap in Russia and should cost between 150 to 700 RUB for a ride through the city, depending on the time of the day, destination and distance, of course. With the range and convenience of taxi apps, there is really no reason not to use them. The benefits are obvious: the price is clear and fixed beforehand, you can be sure that you get a taxi from a reliable company and have the opportunity to safely pay without cash through the app. A few days ago I have tried Yandex.Taxi (probably the largest of those companies, others being Rutaxi, Gett, Uber and Maxim) and found that it is simpler than expected, even without Russian knowledge. The app interface is in English. There is an option to notify the driver to not call - if it is necessary to clarify anything about the order (e.g. how many suitcases you will have or if you need a seat for children), you can do this via an integrated chat (and a translator app). Payment is handled through the app and you receive a receipt of your payment immediately after the ride has finished. In case there is any problem, the driver can scan the QR code on the receipt to see that you did in fact already pay.
Taking a taxi is often less stressful than public transport and might be a good alternative to get to hard-to-reach places or if it would be too inconvenient to travel otherwise. But be aware that the driving style of some drivers leaves a lot to be desired. Seat belts on the back seats might not always work, drivers might be overworked and tired or generally drive recklessly. Bikes: Most Russian cities are not at all bike-friendly. This can be due to the road conditions, traffic and lack of dedicated bike lanes. Better walk or take a minibus. Many cities have very high sidewalks, deep potholes, reckless drivers and/or snow. Hitchhiking: This was possible and popular in Soviet times, but scams and robbery make this a good way to be left alone without money and phone in the middle of nowhere. Blablacar etc.: Mostly safe, but unpredictable due to driving habits of the drivers. If you are traveling to another city, better use long distance buses or trains instead, they cost about the same and are safer and easier to manage. Also, it's mostly difficult to communicate with the driver to agree on a pickup location and time. I had good experiences the few times I used it, and in some cases it might be the only good option (to arrive at an airport at an ungodly time, for example), but some language assistance is mostly necessary. Google Maps (Android/iOS): Good coverage in Russia, good for routing if you plan on walking or taking a taxi. Needs internet connection, but can cache smaller regions for offline use. Yandex.Maps (Android/iOS): The Russian equivalent of Google Maps, but more tailored to Russia. It can use all means of transport to find routes (including marshrutka) and has a good level of detail in Russian cities. Has no offline functionality but a nice English interface. It is good at classifying businesses (types of food, etc) and shows small icons of popular fast food chains and stores directly in the map. Recent updates now show buses and other means of public transport on the road in real time - you can quickly see which bus is approaching in the distance, even if you can't read the number on the bus itself yet. 2GIS (Android/iOS): A very detailed navigation app for cities. You can and need to download a city and have full access to addresses, business information and opening hours. Some buildings (malls etc) even have their floor plans in that app, you can see on which side the entrance to a building is and can filter businesses by type (for example the kind of food you want to eat). Very recommended for a trip to Russia. Maps.Me (Android/iOS): Offline map that uses Openstreetmap data. Has very high levels of detail, but is not so often useful to find places to get somewhere. Shows house numbers. Can route by walking, car and bus, but the public transport option is quite limited. However, if you are traveling outside of a city in the middle of nowhere, this is the app you need. Magic Earth (Android/iOS): Offline map that uses Openstreetmap data. Very detailed, satellite and terrain map included, and works very well with finding points of interest and navigating to them. Yandex.Metro (Android/iOS): Shows a dynamic metro map of some Russian cities (offline) and can show you where to change to travel between two stations. The map is in Russian or English. Yandex.Taxi (Android/iOS): Very useful to get a taxi if you have to. The price is shown before you accept the ride, you can see how long it takes your driver to arrive to you and you have the option to pay by card beforehand. They might call you to confirm the order, but it is mostly enough to say ""ок"". There is now the option to handle such things by chat. Google Translate (Android/iOS): Translates words and sentences between two languages. Dictionaries can be downloaded for offline use. If an internet connection exists, also photos and speech can be translated. Has functionality for handwriting and showing a translated sentence on a big screen, to make it easy to show phrases to locals. Yandex.Translate (Android/iOS): Again Russia's answer to Google Translate. Has largely the same functionality, but might outperform Google Translate if translating between English and Russian. Yandex.Translate has a nice feature of clearing the input field by swiping left and of showing some grammatical information when translating words (complete/incomplete aspect, informal speech, ...) TripAdvisor (Android/iOS): TripAdvisor is never bad of course. It can give you an idea of what sights to visit and some things to check out. Kiwix (Android/iOS): Offline reader for Wikipedia or Wikivoyage. You can download an offline copy of wikivoyage with travel guides for each region/city/district and learn about sights, tips and their history while you have no internet connection. With these insights in mind and tools in your phone, it should not be a problem to get around in Russia, both in and outside of cities. Не паникуй! Don't panic!"
"What's the opposite of a ""return"" flight?","I would call it the ""outbound"" flight. By the way I'm not sure ""return flight"" is unambiguous. In some contexts (such as when booking tickets) it could easily be understood as the combination of an outbound and inbound flight. (Of course, ""outbound"" and ""inbound"" are also slightly ambiguous -- they could refer to legs going from or to an airline hub, but that's more from the perspective of operations planning and timetabling than from the traveler's perspective)."
Is Seiryu Miharashi Station the only train station where passengers cannot enter or exit the platform?,"Eigerwand on the Jungfraujoch railway line used to be a stop for the trains before 2016. Passengers could get down and move to specially carved windows to view the mountainside. The only other way to access the station except the railway line was a door that opened on the mountain but you can't use that without specialist equipment and climbing skill. As of 2021, the trains no longer stop here. The next station Eismeer may also qualify as its purpose is also to allow passengers the view of the mountain/glacier. I am not sure of there is any access point to the station except the railway line."
How much cash can I safely carry into the USA and avoid civil forfeiture?,"As many answers pointed out, there is no limit amount. But carrying $500 - $600 in cash would not in itself raise suspicion, if you are visiting as a tourist."
How to tell if your flight has an air-bridge or stairs?,"Flights JQ747/JQ748 are to/from Launceston Airport, which does not have aerobridges: Due to airport operating restrictions, Launceston airport cannot provide aerobridges to board aircraft.  All access onto the aircraft is via aircraft stairs or mechanical lifting equipment (Disabled Person Lift) operated by the airlines. airline staff
will provide the assistance required to board the aircraft in an appropriate manner. I would strongly advise you to contact the airline and notify them that you will likely need assistance, and arrive early for check in so you can ensure they're ready. On the Sydney side, Jetstar flights typically do use aerobridges, but these are some bus-only gates as well.  The airline will be able to advise you regarding this as well. As for a generic way to find out, I suppose you could always look at the airport in the satellite view on Google Maps, but even if the airport has gates does not guarantee that your flight will use them.  So, again, contacting the airline is by far your best bet."
Can I travel to the USA while working remotely for my non-US employer?,"Since so many people liked the comment I thought I'd turn it into an answer. What you are describing is done all the time by the US and non-US employees on their vacations/holidays. Technically while you are doing work in while being on US soil you are not working in the US since you're not being employed by a US employer and your travel to the US is not employment related, so apply for a tourist visa and you should be fine. To be more specific I found several sites explaining the differences between B1/B2 and H visas in more laymen's terms, so you can try to read up on that to make your determination: And last but not least"
Why does there seem to be an extreme lack of public trashcans in Taiwan?,"Taiwan's policy, related to trash, is that you are expected to take your trash home and dispose of it properly, that is, using the correct bin for separate collection of different types of trash.
This is part of a rather comprehensive policy on how to process trash, after, years ago, Taipei's streets were lined with trash and very stinky. A podcast called ""99% Invisible"" did a piece on this a while back."
What is shown at an airport arrival board if a flight is missing or has crashed?,"There's no general standard; it depends on the airport's own procedures, how much information is available, and potentially a snap decision made by the airport manager on duty. Here is an article, found by Googling “arrival board crashed”, with photos of arrival boards following some famous accidents. The statuses shown in various cases include Delayed, Go To Info Counter, Cancelled, and nothing at all (blank status field)."
easyJet won't refund because it says 'no-show' but they denied boarding,"As proof your friend could sure use his friends/companions/colleagues eyewitness accounts of his denied boarding, plus his printed boarding pass and transportation tickets to the airport, even though as @chx points out, this may not be convincing them enough. Also worth enquiring with the airport if they have any records that they are able to share in a court case, but I would not expect much from that.  As a strategy I would go for a combination of these steps, if even the last step fails (it takes a while but I have made excellent experiences), I would threaten and go for legal action. Plenty of lawyers have specialized on similar claims and their willingness to take up the case is a good indication of your chances of success.  Also if what you say is true, your friend would have right to EU compensation payments. "
Where is wild camping possible in Europe?,"In Finland/Sweden/Norway/Iceland you are allowed to do this by law as long as you stay away from houses and use common sense like you say. It is literally translated as 'every mans rights' (See also this question on Travel-SE for more information). In the summer these countries are perfect for this kind of holiday and I can recommend it to you very much. In The Netherlands it is not allowed to camp in the nature (at least not during the night) as far as I know, so it is best to find a camping. I assume it is similar in Belgium and Germany but they do have more nature so I could be wrong."
What are the legal consequences for a tourist who runs out of gas on the Autobahn?,"It is illegal to run out of gas on the Autobahn according to the German StVO (Straßenverkehrsordnung) which is the road traffic regulations in Germany. The fine can be from €30 up to €70 depending on the case. The reason why it is illegal is that stopping on the highway due to insufficient petrol can be avoided and is a human error and therefore punishable. Normally stopping on the highway in case of a breakdown has no fee but because this can be avoided and the driver has to make sure it does not happen it costs money. It's worth mentioning that if you are a member of ADAC and call them (equivalent of AA, road service), and you are lucky and they get there before someone like the police gets there, they are able to sell you some petrol and you get out of it without a fine from the police. It's under § 18 StVO (Autobahn und Kraftfahrstraße) German TBNR / FALL / STRAFE 118178 / Sie hielten auf der Autobahn/Kraftfahr­straße. / 30€
118704 / Sie parkten auf der Autobahn/Kraftfahr­straße. / 70€
118705 / Sie parkten auf der Autobahn/Kraftfahr­straße und gefährdeten dadurch Andere.    / 85€
118706 / Sie parkten auf der Autobahn/Kraftfahr­straße. Es kam zum Unfall.  / 105€ English TBNR / CASE / FINE 118178 / Stop (< 3 minutes) on the highway / €30
118704 / Parking (> 3 minutes) on the highway / €70
118705 / Parking (> 3 minutes) on the highway and putting others into danger / €85
118706 / Parking (> 3 minutes) on the highway with a following accident  / €105 Worth mentioning that there is no difference between tourists or locals in that case, meaning either one will be punished. Source"
Traffic light fails to give a green to one's movement even after several cycles -- what can a driver do?,"Some jurisdictions may have laws that specifically address this situation.  For example, in Colorado, CRS 42-4-612 says: Whenever a driver approaches an intersection and faces a traffic control signal which is inoperative or which remains on steady red or steady yellow during several time cycles, the rules controlling entrance to a through street or highway from a stop street or highway, as provided under section 42-4-703 , shall apply until a police officer assumes control of traffic or until normal operation is resumed.  Which basically means, come to a complete stop and yield to cross traffic, proceeding only when it is clear. So you may want to try to look up the law in your jurisdiction. As another alternative, in some places, and in particular in nearly all of the US, it is legal to make a right turn on a red light.  So if you're in such a place, and there is no sign forbidding it, and there is a road to your right, you can simply turn right and then find a different route to your destination. Otherwise, if you have a phone, I would try to call the police.  If traffic is backing up at the intersection, or you see other drivers doing unsafe maneuvers to get out, I would say it's justified to use the emergency number (112/911/999/etc).  They could send an officer to manually direct traffic, or at least to shut off the signal so that it is equivalent to an all-way stop.  That should be much faster than the hours or days that might be needed to make complete repairs."
What is the tipping process in restaurants in the US?,"Normally, the sequence is this:"
"If I've visited Crimea, what country do I list on my customs declaration form?","Ultimately there is no penalty for writing the country name wrong on your Immigration form. The list is there to allow the immigration officer quickly determine if any secondary questions should be asked or to inform customs that perhaps a secondary inspection might be warranted (often used by Agriculture Department to route people for Ag Inspections). Since Crimea currently is sort of a no man's land when it comes to being officially recognized, I would just write down Crimea by itself.  If the Immigration officer feels it should be written as Ukraine or something else, they will either change it for you or ask you to update the form. They will likely be more concerned as to why you were in Crimea, rather than how you wrote it on your form."
Why does the Chinese visa form specifically ask about visits to Turkey?,"It is because of the political situation in Xinjiang. Extremists in Turkey support the indepence movement in Xinjiang (Uyghur and Turkish are related). The PRC takes a very dim view of such actions, and is clamping down very hard. China has a record of dealing with countries it's unhappy with by putting them on a shit list, and adding various requirements, sometimes spurious. France is just recovering from such treatment, started in 2008(?) when then President Sarkozy mentioned Tibet."
Is it OK for an openly Muslim person to travel to the United States post-2017?,"Unfortunately, going through customs, there is a risk that Muslims will be asked invasive questions unrelated to legitimate security concerns. Consider the following two recent stories about ordinary Canadian Muslims denied entry to the United States after having their cell phones searched. One of them was asked about her religious practices and what she thought of Trump.  Canadian woman turned away from U.S. border after questions about religion, Trump Canadian denied entry to U.S. after being questioned on mosque connections Contrary to another answerer, I don't believe the reason we hear about these cases is because they're rare. The people who have the courage to come forward and tell their stories to the media are just the tip of the iceberg. In any case, it's strongly advisable to leave your cell phone at home."
Are sweatpants frowned upon on flights?,"You won't win any fashion contests, but that's not what you're aiming for anyway. I can't tell you anything about East Asia, but I've travelled plenty around Europe (including Eastern Europe). Jeans might be more common, but there's absolutely nothing unusual or inappropriate about wearing sweatpants for a flight, regardless of your gender. It certainly won't make border agents assume you're in a gang. "
What's the 2-minute timer on mobile Deutsche Bahn tickets?,"According to this link (only in German), it is to check if you have bought the ticket just right now or a sufficient amount of time before. The rules usually are, that you have to buy a ticket before you get on the train. Now, with mobile tickets, some ""clever"" people thought, they just need to buy a ticket when they see the conductor, and to ride free when they don't see one. In local transit (especially trams, and more and more regional trains) you don't have a regular conductor in every train anymore, but just ticket checking teams, which go around the city. Obviously they can only cover a small part of the available transit vehicles.
This is most likely the reason why the operators introduced this timer, so that it's visible for the conductor if you have bought the ticket just right now or more than 2 minutes ago."
"Is it true that people ""can just take all the luggage off the airport conveyer belt and leave with it.""?","Many common practices in airports won't prevent a passenger from committing the theft, however they would be very good at identifying the thief afterwards. Airports tend to have full coverage of high quality video monitoring, they can backtrace a person in video to their plane, and they are rather sure about the identity of passengers on every airplane.  In essence, you'd leave behind video evidence that proves the crime and also your ID and address - there is a very high risk of getting caught that would generally outweigh the benefit of getting a suitcase full of clothing and my toothbrush, and if someone would intend to do it repeatedly, then it's not realistic to remain undetected."
Is it dangerous to go to the USA as a Russian now?,"From  a social standpoint, I wouldn't expect it to be a problem unless you make it a problem. The USA is incredibly diverse; people end up here from all sorts of places for all kinds of reasons, including people from countries that are ostensibly 'enemies' of the US. On top of that, as a Russian, you have the added advantage of not being visibly distinctive - it's a lot easier to avoid the attention of bigots and morons as a white person not bound by a religious dress code.  From a political standpoint... Well, I'm not going to speculate. There has been some frightening saber rattling over the past few days - withdrawal of ambassadors and a Paralympic delegation, pulling out of the G8, etc. Pay attention to the travel advisories issued by your own countries state department/foreign ministry, as well as to those in your destination, if you're concerned about factors like travel restrictions, passport refusal or other inconveniences. "
Do Russians smile at each other?,"Yes, it's true. In general, Russians never smile without a reason. No, you will not insult anybody in Russia if you smile. But, in some cases it can be assessed as rude or strange. For example, if you smile at a stranger he or she might think ""Why is this guy looking at me and smiling? Do I look stupid?"" Smiling when you say ""Hello"" is OK.  In addition: don't speak with strangers if you have no business with them. There is no culture of ""small talk"" in Russia. If you start to talk with a stranger about the weather or traffic jams (or whatever), Russians may think that you are a fool or a salesman.  The reason why we act like this is because we respect personal space. If you have no business with the stranger, don't bother him."
Why is international first class much more expensive than international economy class?,"Your question is (I think): why does (US) domestic first class exceed the cost of economy by 50%, whereas international first class is many times the cost of economy. The answer to that is that the comparative services are vastly different. In (US) domestic first class you get a little more legroom, and a seat roughly 50% more wide. In international first class, you will often get far more than a fully reclining seat - a private bed is not unknown. Comparing the plane's floor-plate take is a crude measure, but it would not surprise me if a first class seat took 10 times the amount of space as an economy seat on an international flight. Look at the floor plans here (image not copied for copyright reasons) and you can see the six seats in the back half of the first class cabin of a 747 take about the same space as 4 rows (40 seats) of economy. Calculating very crudely, that would explain an approximately 7 times difference in price. Now look at a US domestic layout (here for example). You can see the 8 first class seats take only slightly more space than 12 economy seats. That would crudely explain a 50% difference in price. In terms of flying experience, there is a world of difference. LAX to NYC in first class is, well, slightly less uncomfortable than economy. However, NYC to LHR (roughly the same time) is luxurious in comparison. Personal opinion: if economy class between domestic and international are roughly the same, domestic first is significantly worse than international business (somewhere between international premium economy and international business), and international first is way out in front in terms of travelling experience (if you have money to spend / burn). On one of the two occasions I've flown transatlantic BA first class (sadly over ten years ago), I was given as an unprompted gift a 200 GBP (then about $350) bottle of claret, simply because I'd had a few glasses on board and seemed to quite like it, and they weren't particularly busy; I am told the experience is now far better. It's been pointed out that some carriers (e.g. AA) now offer certain domestic routes (LAX/SFO <-> JFK/EWR) with full reclining beds in first; however (as if to prove the point) these first class routes come at more of a premium than normal domestic first."
Longest bridge/tunnel that can be cycled over/through?,"The Seven Mile Bridge in the Florida Keys is open to cyclists. The Florida Keys Overseas Heritage Trail, a nearly-complete 106 mile (171 km) cycling path from Key West to Key Largo, and part of the East Coast Greenway which stretches to the Maine-Canada border, is routed over the bridge. (The bridge is actually 10.9 km or 6.8 miles long.)"
Will I be able to travel around India speaking only English?,"I have backpacked around a fair bit in India - I grew up there, by the way - and yet I still mostly had to use English to get myself understood when I was visiting other states.There are 22 official languages1 in use in India. The curious thing is even for Indians it is often English that is the binding thread - the one language that I could communicate in any part of the country I was travelling. Hindi is useful primarily in the north and western regions of India. People will be lot more friendly to you even if you can speak basic Hindi phrases and less inclined to rip you off. Having said that, correct pronunciation in Hindi can be tough to master. It's sort of like learning Chinese - when you don't get the tones right, they won't understand what your 'Chinese' means. While Hindi is not a tonal language per se, it does have elements where tone and stress play a part unlike they do in English. If you plan to go off the beaten track and into rural areas, then I would very much suggest you to learn Hindi phrases and try to get pronunciation right. People in cities can often compensate for wrong pronunciations because they are used to it, but people in smaller towns often cannot. In most situations, they will try to help you though by getting hold of someone who does understand English. Now, for southern parts of India - Bangalore, for instance, as you mention in your itinerary - you will find less people capable of speaking and understanding Hindi, and in addition to the regional language of the state English is the de facto second language. In fact, speaking in Hindi can sometimes be taken as insult in the southern states because it is seen as 'north India' imposing an alien language upon them."
What is the most comfortable way to sleep on a plane?,"While there is plenty of good advice in the other answers, I feel I have some more to offer that is a little less spontaneous. Sleeping on a plane is a learned skill and it is improved by planning, preparation, and practice. You can change the likelihood of sleep from nearly nil to nearly guaranteed, but not if the first time you start to think about it is as the plane starts to taxi. First, the booking. Generally you have some choice here. Should you leave early in the morning, or late at night? At 4pm, ensuring you'll be hungry after a few hours in the air, or at 8pm, when you're more likely to show up having eaten enough to last you through the night? If it's a 7 hour flight and you need to stay awake for 2 hours to get food, you're not getting more than 5 hours of sleep. Pick a flight that either won't require you to sleep much, or that lets you organize the rest of your day to maximize the time you have for sleeping. Also think about whether a glass of wine would help - it's much easier to get one (bought in the airport, say) at 7pm than at 7am. Here is also where you settle window/aisle (I like window because it gives me a wall to lean on and a few more inches of space from my seat to the wall), consider paying for more legroom in a premium seat for $100 or so more, and the like. Second, the packing. NEVER count on the airline for pillows, blankets etc. Sometimes they don't get them. Sometimes they can't give you one until the seatbelt sign is off. Airline pillows are small and weird and most annoyingly, they're slippery and they fall between your seat and the wall. Bring your own. A bed pillow from home, one of those C-shaped things (solid or inflatable), something. I like an inflatable one with a VERY fuzzy cover and a little pocket for eyeshades:  I don't decline blankets or pillows from the airplane though - they are handy for padding the armrest so I can lean against it or over it without the edge digging into me. Continuing with packing, I bring my own blanket in the form of a pashmina which folds very small but unfolds enough to cover all of me (6' x 2' I suppose.) I generally use separate blankets for my top and bottom half, to help the crew see that my seatbelt is fastened and to let me move more freely. If the airline doesn't give out blankets I'll use a coat on my legs. My pillow and blanket are familiar and comfortable, they smell right, and I never worry if they're clean. The eyeshade makes a huge difference also, both in keeping out the light and in telling people you are sleeping and don't want a drink, a newspaper, dinner, duty free, etc. And for me, the sensation of the eyeshade on my face reminds me I am supposed to be sleeping. Noise cancelling headphones and a playlist of relaxing and enjoyable music are also on the packing list. These are better than earlugs in my experience, though I always have a few earplugs in the bag just in case. Over-the-ear can be uncomfortable to lie on, so I use earbuds. Plug into the entertainment system when you board, put them in, go to sleep. If you wake later, switch to your playlist and put your seat back. When you have to put your seat up, switch back to their system. I also choose shoes I can slip off and slip back on rather than ones that need tying. Your laceups can be in your checked luggage. So you chose the right flight and seat, you packed the right stuff and you're at the airport. Eat, drink, go to the bathroom. These are all good ways to pass the time while you're waiting to board. Also bring an empty water bottle with you that you can fill after security, or buy water in the airport. That way if you wake up thirsty you can immediately fix that and go back to sleep. Now on the plane, all you need to do is sleep. Don't put the pillow around your neck. You have so little recline, you don't need to prop your head up. Put it between the side of your head and the wall. Put your ear in the centre hole so it doesn't get squished. Coat over legs, blanket over shoulder and chest. Snuggled up warm and cosy, listening to something you like, with a water bottle in easy reach and a clear ""leave me alone"" sign on your eyes, you will sleep. You just will. And trust me, it is so much better than a book or that movie you never got around to watching in theatres. You will get better at it every time. If you wake up, especially if you're uncomfortable, change your position. Loosen your seatbelt as much as you can and sort of turn on your side. Or move your feet from on top of the carryon you stuffed under the seat in front of you, to next to it. Adjust your blankets a little. Move your pillow more under your chin. Your approach should be that you will do what you need to do to go back to sleep, not ""oh well I tried but I woke up."" Don't worry about what time it is. You won't miss your stop. If you wake up again, then try a third position. You'll find something comfortable eventually. If you feel anxious when you wake up, especially if you're getting caught up in the ""oh noes now I will only get three hours sleep, I am ruining my trip"" then try switching from your playlist to some guided relaxations and meditations. Many airlines have them in the inflight system, or you can bring your own. It's as good as sleeping in terms of refreshing your brain and body, and could (usually does) lead to falling asleep too. Learn from each flight and adjust what you bring and do. You will become one of those people who finds it ""effortless"" and easy to sleep on planes. It's not that easy and then again, it is."
What is the purpose of this cloth in hotel?,"A bed runner is a small, long piece of decorated cloth used to enhance the appearance of an otherwise plain bed.  While some prefer the look solely for aesthetic reasons and would choose it even if it were more expensive than traditional decorative bedding, the primary reason to use one in the hospitality industry is to reduce costs while keeping the room attractive. Plain white linen not only costs less initially, it's easy and cheaper to launder than decorative linen.  Delicate or decorative fabrics often can't be bleached, and are easily damaged by mechanical washing machines - they simply don't last as long.  However, white blankets, comforters, and bedspreads are easy to clean and sanitize, don't fade, and still look good even after many washing cycles. Plain white linen doesn't look as attractive as a fully decorated bed, though. So a bed runner, which is small and only used for decoration, will enhance the appearance of the room while not requiring frequent laundering (only when obvious spots appear), and , being small, are easy and cheaply manufactured. When they do need to be laundered, several of them can fit into a load, and that load can be run on a gentle cycle - the shear volume of bedclothes that must be laundered would prevent large bedspreads from this care, but the relatively smaller volume allows an occasional load of runners to take more time and perhaps a more expensive detergent process to clean without causing delays in resetting rooms. Further, some hotel guests prefer clean white linen - which is easier to inspect and note stains or previous usage - to patterned linen for personal hygiene reasons.  Bed runners add touches of decoration while still exhibiting cleanliness for picky travelers."
One foot in Belgium and the other in the Netherlands?,"This is in fact a completely legitimate photo.  It is from Baarle-Nassau where the borders get really funky.  Indeed, the one house you are looking it is just one of many, though it is probably the most famous.  The exact address is  Loveren 19, Baarle-Nassau 5111, The Netherlands. In a situation similar to that along, say, the India-Bangledeshi border, the actual settlement patterns predate the national boundaries around them.  Treaties in the 1830s followed by the dissolution of the Spanish Netherlands into Belgium and the Netherlands led to this odd situation. Treaties in the 1830s ""clarified"" the situation, but resulted in the pattern you see. The various enclaves even go through buildings in some instances.   Because everything is within the Schengen area, however, it presents no more difficulty than, say, borders that go through buildings in two states (e.g. Myock, NC) within the United States, or even in buildings that straddle the Canadian border. (e.g. the ""Cross-Border Library"" in Derby Line, VT / Rock Island Quebec.) Note: this video has pictures and more information."
What are the yellow stickers with the letter G and one or two arrows on some Japanese streets?,"It's a marker for a buried gas pipeline. Arrow points to where the gas heads to.

What exactly is the Bahnhofsmission? What do they do and who uses their services?,"The Bahnhofsmission (train station mission, mission in the religious sense) is over 100 years old and began as a Christian network to help out young girls moving into the cities who were searching for work and were prone to be exploited for low/unpaid work or prostitution. Train stations were hot points for social problems because they connected and still connect people coming from everywhere. The Bahnhofsmission tries to help everyone (!) with everything (!) without looking at their backgrounds and uses both staff and volunteer workers. It starts by you asking them for a pencil, for a map, or for a warm place and it ends with support if your train is out of order, the train had an accident, or you are the victim of a crime. As a Christian organisation, it is supported by both by Roman Catholic and the German Protestant churches. For this reason, you can expect a religious environment: bible and crosses. As clarified in the comments, this does not mean that they try to evangelise,
they simply want to convince by action, not by words. They will gladly talk about their background and the Christian idea if you are curious and interested, but if you don't want to be bothered with that, they won't bother you.  Logo of Bahnhofsmission Given the extremely broad mission (essentially they are do-it-all) and the different people involved, it is often quite perplexing because you can find beggars, stranded people, and normal tourists. It is also said without a word that more important problems are tackled first, so, if you only need information, it could take some time."
How to book a ticket for an unborn infant?,"I called a cousin who works for an airline at an airport, he explained how to do this in a very safe and efficient way. Infants do not need a seat, airline require a fraction of the price paid by the adult to be paid for the infant (~10%) or sometimes it is free. Hence, just make the reservation for you and your wife and other passengers who need seats, and skip the infant. Once the infant is born and it is the day of the travel, head to the airport a bit early and issue the boarding for the baby on the spot, as I said earlier, airline staff will be happy to issue the boarding because there is no seat required and you can make the payment in the airport. The price should be a fraction of the that specific price you paid. So, no worries at all. Anyway, to his knowledge this is how it is done in the airline he works for and some other airlines, not sure if it is safe to assume all other airlines do it the same way, but according to him adding an infant who does not require a seat is something easy in many airline systems."
Why do many countries in the world still require citizens of states with a high HDI to get visas?,"As a rule of thumb, the worse the visa regime, the worse the country's regime.  It's the tinpot dictatorships of the world (Turkmenistan, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Angola, etc) that make it the hardest to get visas and watch visitors most closely, not because they're particularly concerned about Norwegians stealing their jobs, but because they're afraid that they're actually {journalists, dangerous infidels, disguised CIA spies, etc} out to {steal their military secrets, report on human rights issues, lead the faithful astray, steal their women, etc}.  Or, in the case of the United States, suffering from bed-wetting hysteria about foreign terrorists. China is somewhere in the middle of the spectrum: not particularly bad as far as visas or regimes are concerned, but still pretty paranoid about foreigners snooping about where they shouldn't (eg. Tibet without a tour guide) and with a strong preference for more state control rather than less.  Inertia is also a factor: no bureaucrat ever got fired for imposing more restrictions, whereas letting a bad apple in may be a career-limiting move."
How do you choose a restaurant when travelling?,"There are some strategies that you can use: Prepare: Check websites like Tripadvisor or Yelp before you go there. If you really want to plan, write down the restaurants you want to visit. Based on the ratings and comments there, you should be able to judge if it is an authentic restaurant with a good service. Don't stick to the main street: Very often, tourist places attract tourist restaurants. So to get a more authentic experience, go to the areas where not a lot of tourists go. Sometimes it is enough to just go one block off the main street and you will find no tourists. Avoid obvious tourist traps: There are some hints that can tell you immediately if the restaurant is a tourist trap. As user1187008 pointed out for example, one should avoid restaurants with a big illustrated menu in English (especially, if English is not the local language)
 Use the internet: Try to find local blogs which emphasize of food. For every major city, you will find such food/restaurant blogs. Be spontaneous: Tripadvisor and other websites have apps for smartphones that allow you to check the restaurants in the surroundings of your current location. Ask a friend: As Rory Alsop pointed out, it is always a good idea to ask a local friend for advice if you know anybody at the destination."
Where should I leave my passport and electronics if there is no safe in my apartment?,"You seem pretty experienced at traveling already, but here's what I'd recommend: Barcelona (so I've heard) is a wonderful place, I am envious. I spent 3 months traveling through Europe, but as bad luck would have it, thanks to an airline delaying my luggage, I had to skip visiting Barcelona. But also Barcelona is the #1 pickpocket capital of Europe. This shouldn't scare you though, it's much better than #1 mugging capital, but you're gonna have to stay alert, especially in crowded places. There's a funny Colombian saying that goes ""No des papaya!"" which literally is to ""Don't offer/give out papaya (fruit)"" and it translates to ""don't make it easy for a thief, i.e carelessly flash expensive things, or do things that mark yourself as a potential target for the thief.""  If you must carry a day backpack, make sure it's small, or at least don't overpack it. For a day of just walking around the city, I prefer small ""gym sacks"" that have straps, and just hold stuff like an extra cell battery, cables, map, water, sun screen, etc. Leave your passport at your hotel/rental. In crowded areas carry your bag in front of you. And be wary of strangers that get too close.  Always carry a paper copy of your passport, and scan and upload important travel documents to the cloud. Additionally, you can even create shortened url that points to a cloud-shared item in case you need a copy of something in an emergency (i.e like for example, all my contacts are in my cell/wallet, but if my cell/wallet gets stolen, I'd go to the nearest internet cafe and browse to like https://goo.gl/ + WdcAid and get the info I need). Avoid carrying so much stuff. It weighs you down, you get tired quicker, and you risk attracting more attention to yourself. Since you say you're doing a short-term rental, and no one is supposed to go in to clean the apartment while you're there, you can leave electronics you don't need there.  I think you have a pretty safe place for your things. If you want to be extra safe (or paranoid like me), hide your money or important things in unexpected places, or hide them in plain sight. For example, I've always used an empty deodorant stick container, and roll up most of my cash I travel with ($500-600 max) inside it and place it among my other toiletries in the bathroom (if not shared of course). No burglar is going to look through there. You can use a ziplock bag and put your passport or other important documents in the refrigerator for example. Just don't forget where you're hiding your stuff! Please be safe when abroad. Don't drink too much, or do anything you wouldn't normally do at home. Be aware of your surroundings and overtly friendly strangers at bars, etc. I like to also implement some of the hotel security tips from these guys to make sure my room is safe. It might be overkill, but it never hurts. When out and about, make sure you've planned your route or know more or less how to get there, that way taxi drivers don't rip you off, and you don't look like a helpless tourist holding a map upside down. The site WikiVoyage.org is an amazing resource of info on just about everything you need to know. And they have an offline mobile app, you can preload using wifi."
Can two persons sharing a name travel one-way each on a return ticket?,"The answer is NO.  There are two reasons why you cannot do this, especially on an international itinerary. If you try to change any passenger details on the return only, meaning after they have been verified on the outbound, you risk forfeiting the ticket."
Traveled on an invalid ESTA due to prior N Korea trip. How screwed am I?,"The only way to get a definitive answer will be to apply for a US Visa, but realistically it's extremely likely that the answer is ""not at all screwed"". Technically you did break the rules, and officially, ignorance (ie, not being aware of the rules) is not a valid excuse for doing so. However the fact that you did not actively attempt to mislead anyone, and the fact that you are taking steps to correct the error (by applying for a visa) will almost certainly cause them to overlook the previous indiscretion. Whilst not exactly the same, I have a friend who was affected by the same rule.  He is a UK citizen (from birth) and grew up in the UK, however he was born in Iraq. Like you, he had an existing ESTA from before the new regulations came into place, and attempted to enter the US shortly after they came into effect.  Unlike you, he was actually stopped at immigration and detained as his passport listed his place of birth which clearly made him unable to enter under VWP. US CBP staff were understanding of the situation, and allowed him to enter the US despite not having the correct paperwork - with instructions that he would need to obtain a visa before returning to the US.  He has since obtained a visa without issue (despite this previous incident) and has since visited the US using that visa without issue."

How to search for a flight when dates and cities are flexible but non-direct flights must not pass through a particular country?,"Yes, the ITA Matrix supports the undocumented l: syntax in the routing specifier to search by location. You can use l:nXX to search by ISO country code (n for nation), and then add the negation symbol ~ to invert this. Putting it altogether you want ~l:nUS* to mean, possibly transit at any number of points, but none in the United States. See this thread on FlyerTalk for a little more information."
"Would a non-business traveler ever benefit from collecting air miles, as compared to simply buying the cheapest ticket available?","To directly answer the title question, yes, non-business travelers can absolutely benefit from airline loyalty programs (i.e. earning points/miles as well as status.) Whether it's worth it for you in particular, though, will be extremely dependent on your particular situation and what options are available to you on the routes you normally fly, as well as whether you typically need to take luggage, etc. Since specific examples were requested, I'll use myself as an example. I live in the Southeast U.S. and fly round-trips within the U.S. typically a few times per year and inter-continental round-trips about once a year. While there are sometimes slightly cheaper advertised fares to my domestic destinations on some of the very-low-cost airlines, by the time I add all of the fees and other associated costs of flying one of those airlines, they would often end up costing as much or more than Southwest or Delta. This is especially true due to the fact that the very-low-cost airlines usually have infrequent flight schedules that are much more likely to require me to take an extra day off of work than with an airline like SWA or DL where flights leave about every hour. So, in the end, Southwest or Delta usually ends up being the lowest actual cost to me and both earn points/miles on every flight that don't expire (Delta miles don't expire at all and Southwest points remain active as long as you have at least some account activity once every two years.) As far as redemption value, this again varies widely and will depend very largely on your use case. For me, these two programs are my primary options due to where I live: In the case of Southwest, you typically earn 6 points per dollar spent on the cheap fares and can redeem points at a rate of 70 points per dollar of airfare. If you purchase the ticket with a Southwest co-branded credit card, you earn 8 points per dollar instead of 6. So, without their card, you get a dollar worth of airfare for every $11.67 spent on airfare and, with their card, you get a dollar of airfare for every $8.75 spent. Delta's scheme is much more complicated and can range from much more valuable to much less valuable depending on your situation. For my situation, it's more valuable. With Delta, you earn 5 points per dollar of airfare as the base rate. If you buy the ticket with a Delta co-branded credit card, that goes up to 7 points per dollar. If you additionally have status with Delta, you get an additional 2, 3, 4, or 6 points per dollar based on your level of status. In my case, I get 10 points per dollar total at my current status level (which came entirely from personal travel, not business travel.) Note that there is no bonus or penalty to this for different fare or cabin classes, but you inherently earn more points on more expensive fares since it's based on dollars spent. So, if I buy a $200 round-trip fare, I earn 2,000 'miles' regardless of fare class, distance actually traveled, etc. While miles are earned on a dollar-cost basis, mileage redemption with Delta is (loosely) based on an award chart, with mileage cost depending on region traveled to/from and demand for that particular route (i.e. usually only a few seats are available at the lowest mileage costs on a given flight.) If you book early, domestic round trips usually start at 25,000 miles (sometimes 20,000, but this is less common.) If you book a $200 round trip for 25,000 miles, that's obviously not a great value (less than 0.8 cents/mile value.) However, the 'regions' are quite large, with the entire U.S. and Canada (excluding Hawaii) being a single 'region.' So, if you book a $500 trans-continental round-trip for 25,000 miles, that's obviously a much better value (2 cents/mile, which is equivalent to $1 of airfare earned for every $5 of airfare purchased at my earning rate of 10 miles/dollar.) The best redemption values I've seen on Delta are for long-haul business class flights with 140,000 miles getting you a business class ticket to the other side of the planet that would normally cost $7k if bought with cash, a 5 cent/mile value. So, if I'm earning 10 points per dollar of airfare and redeeming for 5 cents/mile of value, that's 50 cents per dollar originally spent (i.e. $1 of airfare earned for every $2 of airfare purchased!) In my case, this is exactly how I prefer to use the points, as I'm not really a fan of flying economy (and, thus, getting no sleep) on routes that involve 30-36 hours of travel time (20-22 of that actually airborne) each direction. If you only ever travel short distances, always buy the cheapest tickets, and don't earn miles separately from credit cards, then you're probably never going to get up to 140,000 miles. However, 25,000 miles is certainly very attainable for the non-business traveler, since the points don't expire ($2,500 of total airfare purchased at my earning rate.) An extra $500 of free airfare for every $2,500 spent isn't a bad deal at all, even if it takes you a few years to buy that much airfare. An additional aid to those who don't fly as often is that, with both Delta and Southwest, there's no penalty for booking just one way with points vs. booking a round-trip with points. So, using the trans-continental Delta flight example, you could get one way for 12,500 points and just pay cash for the other way and be able to get your first redemption after spending only $1,250 while getting the same value per dollar spent. So, yes, there are definitely cases where it's useful for a non-business traveler to care about points. However, whether that's the case for you or not will be highly dependent on the flight options available where you live, the relative cost of those options, where and how often you tend to fly, and what the terms are of the frequent flier programs of the airline choices you have available. As you can see from just the two examples I've listed, the terms for different frequent flier programs and their relative usefulness to you can vary significantly from one airline to another (and that's before even considering elite status.)"
"Where is this tower, likely photographed in Belgium about 100 years ago?","This is not in Belgium, but in Béthune, France, although not far from the Belgian border. The belfry (the tower) is originally from 1346, but was destroyed during the first world war and rebuilt between 1921 and 1923. You can find it on Google Streetview from almost the same point as your photographs have been taken.  Image source: Wikimedia Commons How did I find it?

And yes, they could take your laptop if they wanted to, or arrest you and sentence you to ten years of re-education through labor camp for that matter -- you're a foreigner at the mercy of a communist dictatorship, after all, and yes, the transit area is still very much legally a part of China.  But I'm still pretty sure you could raise a stink if somebody confiscated an obviously valuable item like a laptop, and the guards know well that there's so much CCTV at any airport security checkpoint that they won't get away with outright stealing anything for their own use."
Does one need a visa to visit Antarctica?,"There are seven countries which have territorial claims on parts of Antarctica: Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, and Norway, which all recognize each other's claims; and Chile and Argentina, whose claims are disputed. In practice, however, all claims are suspended under international treaty, and there are no checkpoints or immigration officers. For most people, a visit to Antarctica consists of a flight over it or a ride on a ship through its waters, neither involving disembarkation and thus both avoiding immigration formalities. Land tourism does exist, and a permit is required. The vast majority of visitors will arrive by commercial ship or helicopter, and the tour operator is responsible for obtaining the necessary permits. You may, of course, need a visa for the country where your tour is departing from. To land on the continent in a private vessel such as a yacht, you would need to obtain a permit yourself from your own government, if your country is a signatory to the Antarctic Treaty System. For example, Britons would apply to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Polar Regions Department; Americans would file the DS-4131 Advance Notification Form – Tourist and Other Non-Governmental Activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area with the Department of State’s Office of Ocean and Polar Affairs Due to Antarctica's extreme physical conditions and remoteness, only a few dozen yachts make the trip each year, and there are special yachting guidelines for Antarctic cruises. For a list of tour operators, see the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators."
"As a native English speaker, which two further languages would give me the most travel utility worldwide?","Assuming we're a) choosing countries at random, regardless of size, population or popularity with tourists, b) choosing languages that let us communicate where English doesn't, and c) ignoring how hard it is to learn the language, I'd probably go with French and Arabic, although Spanish comes close too. And some contenders that don't make the top 4:"
Do countries get the manifest of every passenger that's flying through their airspace? Who knows who's boarded on a plane?,"Details may differ significantly from country to country and ignoring that it in many situations is still possible to fly without having to present any form of ID when checking in, making it possible to fly with a ticket in a different name, in general: If you buy your ticket from some kind of agency and not directly from the airline, the agency will of course know that you bought a ticket for the given departure. If the reservation agency is collecting further data (e.g. date of birth, payment information, passport data, frequent flyer identifications) during the booking process, they will of course also have access thereto. The agency will not have access to the complete passenger list of a flight, just to the passengers booked through that agency and usually not know if the passenger is actually on board the plane or not. All airlines involved in the conduct of the flights on your ticket will have access to the information. The airports usually have no access to passenger data. It is of course technically possible that the airport is collecting and storing your name if you e.g. have to scan your boarding pass when going through security, but doing so will in many countries, e.g. in the EU, be a breach of privacy law. Details may also depend on whether the airport is operated by a private company or the governmental authorities. Airlines are, in most countries, required to file the passenger manifest to the authorities to get a takeoff clearance for a flight. It will differ from country to country to which authorities the manifest must be sent (that can be flight safety authorities, police, immigration, border surveillance, customs) and how the authorities automatically share data between each other. If the manifest must be sent well in advance, it will usually contain all passengers having booked a ticket on the flight. In other cases, airlines may only be required to send a manifest after boarding has been completed with a list of passengers, who are actually on board the aircraft. Airlines are in several countries required to file a passenger manifest before landing when a plane is arriving from abroad. As jcaron already pointed out in a comment, airlines are also required to file a passenger manifest to get clearance to fly through US airspace. As far as I know, the USA is the only country requiring this. In some countries, the authorities may have a much wider access to the airlines booking system with access to all details of a booking and not just to passenger manifests."
Why do consulates take away your passport to issue the visa?,"I can answer this for the UK and Schengen members... In the first instance, consulates take your passport because there are some laws involving how a visa is issued.  Prominent among those are... Paragraph 24, which states... The following must produce to the Immigration Officer a valid passport
  or other identity document endorsed with a United Kingdom entry
  clearance issued to him for the purpose for which he seeks entry:... Paragraph 27, which states... An application for entry clearance is to be decided in the light of
  the circumstances existing at the time of the decision... Paragraph 28, which states... An applicant for an entry clearance must be outside the United Kingdom
  and Islands at the time of the application... (These rules are all found at Immigration Rules) From these it's clear that they need to take possession of the travel document in order to assess its validity. And from Paragraphs 27 and 28 they need to be sure that the conditions of issuance are 'fixed' to a specific date and time.  It means that the applicant has not travelled with the passport in the interval between submission and issuance, and (to the extent possible) the applicant is not in the UK when the decision is made.  In addition, the Entry Clearance Officer has to assess the application. These things cannot be done 'while-you-wait' and holding the passport helps to guarantee that Paragraphs 24, 27, and 28 are diligently observed. There are some practical and administrative considerations that come into play... Those visa stickers are affixed to the passport page by a machine and
there's usually one machine per post. The passports need to be
sequenced, fed in to the machine, and then checked by a human. This
is done as a background task by local hires who may be on shift work
in a batch. Trying to arrange a batch according to whoever showed
up is administratively impractical. In the UK case, they don't like people hanging around the consulate,
they like to make the decision entirely by paper-based evidence (they really do not like to engage the public directly for various reasons not worth going in to here).
Moreover, the security is not staffed up for lengthy queues. So they
use a VFS to ring-fence the consulate from engaging directly with the
public (yes, there are exceptions where they need to see someone but
these are not the normal case). In keeping with the above, most of the world is set up to use the
Visa Facilitation Service (VFS) as a intermediary, the applicant
drops off their stuff and then returns to collect it when they get a
notification email.  The VFS has no decision-making role and largely
acts as a secured courier, so it really makes no sense to have a
queue of people hanging around the VFS waiting for a visa to be
affixed. In places like Nigeria, the passport and evidence may be sent to
their special assessment unit that performs 'deep analysis'. This can
take several weeks and it would not make sense to separate the
passport from the other evidence during this phase. In the Schengen cases where the applicant must report to the
consulate for an interview, it would mean making two trips to the
consulate: one for the interview and one to collect their stuff, this
is thought to be an unreasonable burden on the applicant. Especially in the British case, there is an overarching cultural influence best called: 'this is the way things work' (TITWTW, 'titwah'). This usually operates as a
stand-alone rationale for a lot of things in the UK and visas are no
exception. If you encounter TITWTW, the discussion has reached its conclusion. Other answers in the archives here have pointed out that the
application location is not necessarily the decision location.
Applications submitted in Morocco for example are decided in Croydon
(London suburbs).  Applications submitted in Kabul are decided in New
Delhi (graphic from UKVI presentation). So where would the applicant queue?   And as a final note, yes, it's possible for an applicant to have an ECO come around to their house or office, or for an applicant to show up at the consulate on a while-you-wait basis.  They are very flexible and will accommodate almost anything you want (I attended the Parliamentary debates on this topic and can attest to the flexibility). I haven't checked recently but the last time I looked, those services started at about GBP 15k and upwards from there.  A person can also arrange for a private landing interview at Heathrow (etc) and they will even send someone to small airports like Robin Hood. Note: most of the above are stated as UK specific, Schengen members have comparable or similar conditions. Note: dual nationals (or holders of duplicate passports) always come up with the corner case: can I apply for entry clearance with one passport and simultaneously enter the UK on my other passport?  This is theoretically possible because the IO may not always know that the person has applied for entry clearance using a second passport.  But returning to Paragraph 28, if they ever find out that the person was in the UK during a pending application for entry clearance, the person becomes an illegal entrant for that period of time. That will have grave impact if the person ever tries to get another entry clearance or apply for British nationality, etc. So the bottom line is yes, but you are implicitly accepting the consequences."
Dress for First Class?,"If you've been on a plane before, I'm sure you've walked past first class; nobody cares. If you want to dress up, sure, but I'd prefer to be casual and comfortable."
What are some tips for a child flying alone for the first time?,"For a domestic flight you typically get to the airport 1-2h before your flight. Some airlines have designated terminals, it's practical to be dropped off there. First thing to do is check in, there's a couple ways to do this. Look for the WestJet desks and use the self-serve kiosk to check in, print your boarding pass and tags for your bags. You can also check in online before you get there and print your boarding pass at home, or use the electronic one if the airline provides it. (skip to step 3 if you don't have bags to check) If you have bags to check (that is, more than just a small bag to take on the plane) you'll need to find the WestJet desks and line up. Someone will weigh the bag, tag them and give you a boarding pass. As the name suggests you need this to be able to get on the plane. Your boarding pass will have the gate number on it, that's where the plane leaves from. Start heading there, because you'll need to go through security first. They'll ask for your ID and boarding pass. Your ID can be your provincial healthcare card or your passport.  Once you pass security keep walking until your gate and you're done. Sometimes the gate changes, or it won't be printed on your boarding pass, you can still find it on the screens they have for that everywhere. They'll start announcing boarding by groups when they're ready."
"What does ""K+M+B 2016"" mean in when written on a church wall?","It looks like it is a yearly thing, renewing the old one when the new one is up. In the church I read about it was done as part of the Epiphany Mass. It is a blessing to the house. 20 and 15 being the year, C (K), M, B being the initials of the traditional names of the wise men, Caspar, Melchior and Balthasar, they can also stand for Christus Mansionem Benedicat, the Latin words meaning, May Christ bless this home. I found that on this site which explains more about the custom. And here is an other site, with an other year. As you can see from the sites I linked to, it is not restricted to Czech republic, one of them clearly about a church in the UK while the other is about seeing the letters and numbers on the walls in Germany. In the comments it is mentioned that it is common in Czech republic and in several German speaking areas, and that it is often done by (young) children, as part of the Epiphany traditions.
That is the feast celebrating the coming of the three wise men to Jesus soon after birth, the day of the celebration is January 6th (in the Roman Catholic church at least, and in the churches split off from it.)
And hardly known these days, it also used to be called the 12th day of Christmas and was the end of the holiday season."
Why would a company want me to book a flight via a travel agent if it is more expensive?,There are several reasons why such internal policies exist: Which of these reasons is the one why this policy exists can only be answered by the responsible employees of your institution.
Duty Free in the USA. Why do I have to be given my purchase as I board the plane?,"The laws around duty-free require that you not consume duty free merchandise in the country you're buying them in. If they just handed you the bag, you could then exit the terminal and go home, evading paying duty; people would buy cheap tickets for planes they had no intention of boarding, just to get a shopping discount. By holding the merchandise until you get on the plane, they prevent you from doing that. This isn't specific to the US... I've seen it in various EU countries as well, for duty-free shops located before exit checks. I have never, ever seen a charge for the ""service""."
What's going to happen to my booked AirBerlin flight now that they've gone bankrupt?,Called AirBerlin. They're saying that at the moment they are expecting all flights within the next 3 months to operate normally and that I should check back in one week to get an update about possible refunds and cancellation policies.
My ID was stolen during my stay in Spain. Will Ryanair let me board the flight?,"In theory, it's against Ryanair policy to let anyone enter the plane without a valid identifying document. In practice, you have to try! Do not call their telephone infoline or anything like that, because they will tell you it's not possible. Be sure to contact Ryanair at the airport as early as possible during your flight day. Take the police report with you. If you have some identifying document left at home and it's possible for a family member or a friend to send you a scan of it - it will help, too. Good luck!"
What happens if you swab positive for a drug sample at Canadian airports even if you don’t have anything on you?,"Just because your bag is triggered doesn't mean you will be in trouble. I bought a backpack at Heathrow duty free while in transit to the US which triggered a positive hit on the explosive wand - while it was still in the plastic. It got swiped twice, detected twice, and then the inspector looked at it and just let me through, no muss no fuss. In your case, I would get a copy of the police report as an extra assurance, but I would not worry about it. Many things will trigger positive, such as remnants of poppy seed bagels and inspectors are trained to look for these and make a holistic determination as to the passenger's risk profile."
Does it make sense to use a kayak or canoe in Venice?,"You may, but you do need to know in which canals the craft is allowed. A Danish ex-pat, Rene Seindal, who operates Venice Kayak, as well as blogging, has a great post describing where kayaks are banned, and includes maps to guide you through the canals on which it is allowed. In case the link goes down, here is one of the several maps by Rene Seindal from that blog post showing: ...I have made the reverse map which shows in green the canals where you can go in a kayak and still have a legal way out   The Grand Canal is off limits, as are several others, and then there are many canals with other general traffic restrictions or which lead into a prohibited canal and are too narrow to turn around."
Does declining housekeeping deny housekeepers of their income?,"I actually studied this way back at university. Housekeeping mostly paid by the hour so, yes, by denying service, you are indirectly reducing total billable hours. However, larger properties will use a formula to determine how much housekeeping staff is needed on a day to day basis based on occupancy and trends.  The intended outcome is to only have the number of 'full day' housekeepers the property needs.  The effect of this is you are not denying one particular housekeeper any hours, rather you and the average other 19 (I'm guessing, I don't remember) guests who deny services mean one less housekeeping member of staff needed for that day. If you are concerned about the housekeepers' income, hang your towels, make your bed (they'll finish it up), put you trash in one place and, most important, leave a tip.  Tips are not factored in their wage, as they would be with restaurant staff, so that is fully supplemental and hopefully not taxed. If you do leave a tip, it's best to tip every day since it's entirely likely several housekeepers will service the room during your stay. Now, to be clear, union rules and local circumstances mean there are definitely exceptions."
Why are there ashtrays in the bathrooms on nonsmoking flights?,"Asked and answered on Aviation.SE. Summary: They're required by US federal aviation regulations. The apparent rationale is: a desperate, or unscrupulous, smoker might (illegally) light a cigarette in the lavatory. If they do, it is good for there to be somewhere safe for them to put the cigarette butt. Otherwise, if they don't see anywhere else to put it, they might put it in the trash receptacle, which is full of combustible paper and could start a dangerous fire. There is speculation that the 1973 crash of Varig Flight 820 may have been caused by just such a fire."
What can you do about being forced to sit next to a very large passenger?,"It is not a pleasant situation for both of them - the passenger or the large passenger. It is very uncomfortable for the passenger and totally embarrassing for the large guy. In addition to that, it is uncomfortable and embarrassing for the staff. Unfortunately, there is no one single rule that applies here; each airline has its own policy regarding this. If the large person's body is invading your space and you have noticed this during boarding, make sure to speak to one of the cabin crew members immediately. Make it their problem. You are paying for a seat and it is your right to get a full seat, not a part of one. Remember, the only time you can report this case is on the ground. It is the perfect time for crew or ground staff to find another seat either for you or for the large person, or to find another solution in the case that there are no spare seats. Once the doors are closed and the plane is moving without you talking about it, you have given complicit agreement to this situation and no one can do much about it in most cases. This depends on the airline. Some airlines make large people pay; some others upgrade large people to business or first class for free as a part of their services (the airline I work for does this if no two seats are available in economy class). You could get lucky and get moved to a higher class and leave your seat for the other passenger. Either way, your problem should be solved before the plane takes off. This is an odd and embarrassing situation. Make sure to talk in private with the cabin crew to avoid embarrassing the sized passenger publicly. Depending on the airline, the sized passenger can be deplaned from the airplane or asked to pay for an extra seat. You may also be asked if you would like to wait for another flight! Anything is possible if no extra seats are available."
Navigating the layers of American hotel beds: where are you actually supposed to sleep?,"You put yourself between Sheet 1 and Sheet 2.  All the other layers on top are meant for warmth. It being summer, you may not need them all - feel free to remove any  layers you don't want, and put them on a chair or in the closet. (Pro tip: if you want a little more air flow, untuck Sheet 2 from the mattress.) If somehow you're too cold, there are usually extra blankets  in your closet. The staff will make the bed each day, reassembling all the layers in their original formation. You can expect that Sheets 1 and 2 were clean upon your arrival. Once upon a time, hotels would change them every day during your stay. For ""environmental reasons"" (and also to save money), it is now more like every 3 days, but you can usually get them changed more often upon request. (Sometimes the hotel will give you a little sign you can place on the bed to request clean sheets.) At ""extended stay"" properties (eg Residence Inn), they may only be changed once a week during your stay. The same policy probably applies to Sheet 3 and the duvet cover, but I am not certain; these layers are not always present. As to the other layers, they are typically changed less often. I don't know what the industry standard is, but you can always ask the staff if it's important to you (dial 0 on your room phone). So it would be courteous of you to try to keep them clean. You have found yourself a fancy bed. At cheaper hotels and motels, you usually just have: mattress, mattress pad, sheet 1, sheet 2, wool or synthetic blanket (plain color), patterned quilt or bedspread."
Are there any binational mass rapid transit systems?,Yes - the Basel tram system is mostly in Switzerland but extends into both France and Germany.  There are five stations in France and three in Germany.

Where can I travel for prolonged periods of time while legally working remotely for a company in my home country?,"There's one place where an American citizen can work completely legally and indefinitely on a tourist visa: Svalbard!

"When the road is blocked by animals, what's the proper way to proceed?","The picture is of horses in the road. When I stayed with friends in The New Forest, UK, where free range ponies roam (not actually wild), they often block the road in groups, and nothing apparently will move them. But my friend taught me how: Be gentle, do not alarm them, give them time. Open the car windows, so the ponies can see you, and then Lightly pat the door panel with the palm of your hand continually. This worked a treat, the ponies gradually move out of the way."
How to safely store my locker key in a hostel at night?,In places that I've felt to be a bit dodgier than usual I have done a few things: Sleep in shorts with a pocket and keep the key in my pocket. Thread the key onto a string and wear it around my neck. Put the key and other valuables inside my pillowcase / pillowslip. A good way to not forget your valuables are in your pillowcase is to also stash your underpants in there! Well unless of course it's too hot to sleep covered.
Is it legal to travel with a suitcase full of physical cash (worthless banknotes) from Venezuela?,"It's a really bad idea, so much that I registered just to warn you (I live in Venezuela). When there was a severe shortage of cash the government blamed it on banknotes being extracted through the Colombian border for sale at a profit and ""hoarding"". Arrests were highly publicized, which additionally helped support the conspiracy theory of an ""economic war"" waged from abroad to destabilize the country. Now imagine a foreign-looking type caught with a heap of cash: official news outlets are going to have a field day with the arrest photograph:  Los tres hombres se desplazaban en dos vehículos por la carretera nacional San Félix-Upata. Los cuerpos de seguridad, en un trabajo de inteligencia, frustraron el presunto contrabando de extracción de esta cantidad de papel moneda. The three men were traveling on two vehicles down the San Félix-Upata highway. Security forces, in an intelligence operation, frustrated the presumed extraction contraband of these many banknotes. In a good scenario, you'll spend a few hours in ""the little room"" and be relieved of your valuables by the local authorities before they let you go. I agree that the banknotes are pretty, but please take just a few of each denomination. If anyone asks, it's left over from your daily purchases. General advice: don't come without a trusted local friend willing to accompany you everywhere, preferably in a car. I'm not exaggerating: Caracas has the 2nd-4th highest murder rate in the world, and $100 can feed a family of four for a month. There are official no-go ""peace zones"" for law enforcement where kidnappers take their hostages. -- BTW, the photo in your question illustrates the amount of cash you needed to buy that toilet paper roll before the Bolívar was redefined so amounts would have 5 less figures (1 new ""Bolívares Soberanos"" = 100,000 old ""Bolívares Fuertes"")."

Is it safe and legal to sleep in my car in California (L.A. area)?,"The area you will cover is a bit broad but there are generally rules that you can follow: Now for more details you should provide more exact places you will be visiting and routes you will be taking because between San Francisco and LA is about 400 miles/650km by the shortest route and for example Greater Los Angeles Area is about 85,000 Sq/km with about 18 million people and a large number of individual municipalities.

What can I do when I see passengers without masks on my flight? [closed],"I work for an airline (cabin crew management). We face a lot of passengers who have issues with masks, but we aggressively enforce it. We simply remove those who decline to wear the masks from the flight. If a passenger removes it during the flight and declines to put it on again, airport security will be waiting for him/her after landing. What can be done if the airline does not enforce this while the law requires it? Reputation! go online (it seems you've already done this) and post some photos (if this is allowed where you live), report them to the civil aviation authorities, airport authorities or health authorities (they love to collect fines, airlines hate to pay them), leave comments at the airline rating websites (such as airlinequality.com). Low cost carriers do not have much to offer beside the low prices and the promise of taking you safely from A to B, they cannot afford to lose that. And remember, although the authorities take time to respond, but they usually do. Most likely they will not respond back to you, but for sure they will contact the airline."
I need to fly between two European countries once a month. What is the cheapest way to do it?,"There is no truly practical discount card for regular flights in Europe that I am aware of. You are looking to fly often and this comes at a price. That being said, there is a number of tweaks where you can optimize. If all of this is too complex for you even after some own research and trying, go for a good travel agent. "
Why do I need to report to the police when I visit Indonesia?,"Some countries require that foreigners register their stay with the local police. Normally, if you're staying in a hotel then this is taken care of for you. If you are staying at a private residence then you must do the registration. For example, from Entry Requirements - Indonesia: Registering If you stay in private accommodation in Indonesia (not a hotel) you must register your presence with the local police or you could face a fine of Rp 5 million [~ 375 USD]. If you stay in a hotel you will be registered automatically."
Does a US immigration officer really have the power to deny entry to the country at personal will?,"Following is the official text detailing powers of immigration officers. The key para within this is: (2) to arrest any alien who in his presence or view is entering or
  attempting to enter the United States in violation of any law or
  regulation made in pursuance of law regulating the admission,
  exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens, or to arrest any alien in
  the United States, if he has reason to believe that the alien so
  arrested is in the United States in violation of any such law or
  regulation and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained
  for his arrest, but the alien arrested sh all be taken without
  unnecessary delay for examination before an officer of the Service
  having authority to examine aliens as to their right to enter or
  remain in the United States They have the powers to deny you entry but this again is tracked, recorded and in most situations the immigration officers are very vigilant not  to allow their personal beliefs and apprehensions dilute the facts of the case at hand. It is true that they might not be polite with you or behave in manner showing respect - but when it comes to denying entry - they would be very careful not to be seen as biased or prejudiced. One has ability to contact legal agencies and USCIS in case of apparent misconduct. This would then become a fight which one can take it to a finish if one is committed enough. But yes as mentioned in the question here - there are chances of one being denied entry with no proper reasons which depends on the type of immigration officer one encounters"
What are good security tactics for sleeping in airports?,"While I don't regularly sleep in the airports, I suggest you check out these tips: Whether you are sleeping in the airport by yourself or with friends, it is good to know where security is. Know where their office is and look for video cameras in the spot you decide to stay the night. They've probably seen many airport sleepers before you and they will direct you to a safe spot. If you suspect a problem with airport security, you may want to follow this tip and sleep in the car: Whether you are stuck in the airport overnight or choose to be there voluntarily, there may be a chance that you will be uncomfortable and unhappy with your surroundings in the terminal. If you are travelling on a budget and do not want to fork out for one of the airport hotels, head over to the car rentals hall to find out the cost of a car rental and (assuming you can keep the car in the lot at no cost) sleep in the car. The great part about this is that you can recline on padded seats and there will be no annoying security announcements or rattling luggage carts whipping past your head throughout the night. On the negative side, car horns and screeching tires may jolt you from your slumber. Sure the car rental staff may look into your car wondering if you've had a stroke and the bathroom may be an issue depending on the location of the nearest toilet, but hey, you're saving money here! Very important - remember to check the drop-off hours to ensure a staff member will be there when you ""drop-off"" the car before your flight the next morning! This is easier at larger airports. Also, make sure to check out the stories about the airport beforehand so you know if there are known problems before you face them.  Good luck!"
Refused boarding to New Zealand because I couldn't demonstrate I'm an NZ citizen. What are my options?,"You travelled with your daughter to Russia on Russian passports, but your daughter is a New Zealand citizen with a New Zealand birth certificate. I assume that you have a valid New Zealand visa entitling you to re-entry into New Zealand. You made the assumption that your daughter's New Zealand birth certificate would entitle her to re-entry into New Zealand, but the airline did not accept this when you attempted to check in for the flight from Russia to Korea (with an onward flight from Korea to New Zealand assumably) and refused you boarding. Unfortunately, this requirement is specifically handled on the New Zealand Immigration website: You will need an endorsement of your New Zealand citizenship in your foreign passport. An endorsement is a record that allows a New Zealand citizen to enter New Zealand as a citizen although they are travelling on a foreign passport. That same page also states: If you are overseas, your application must be sent before you travel to New Zealand. From comments, you have indicated that you have had a conversation with NZ Immigration and they have told you to ask the airline to contact themselves but the airline is refusing - this is certainly something the airline is entitled to refuse to do, as their guaranteed information is provided to them via a system called Timatic, which is a database kept up to date providing immigration information for all countries. In your case, Timatic has this to say for a New Zealand citizen flying on a Russian passport: Russian Federation (RUS) - New Zealand (NZL) 29 Oct 2017 Visa or additional documentation is required for New Zealand. I used the Skyteam interface. At this point, you need to fix the documentation problem - the only way you can reasonably do that is to have New Zealand issue you with either an endorsement in your daughter's Russian passport (which you need a mailing address to achieve and this could take a week or more to achieve) or apply at a New Zealand embassy or commission for an Emergency Travel Document. It would seem that applying for an ETD is the way to move forward in this situation, so: If you’re overseas and don’t have a current passport and need to travel in a hurry you can apply for an emergency travel document. https://www.passports.govt.nz/urgent-travel/ This will incur a $500 NZ fee and you need to apply at a New Zealand High Commission or embassy. The relevant portion of New Zealand law which covers ETDs is worth quoting here, as it is actually fairly broad: 23 Issue of emergency travel document (1) The Minister may, on application to the Minister in the form provided by the Secretary, issue an emergency travel document to any person where— (a) there is reasonable cause to believe that the person is or may be a New Zealand citizen; and (b) there is reasonable cause to believe that— (i) the person’s passport has been lost or stolen or destroyed or is temporarily unavailable; or (ia) the person does not hold a valid travel document; or (ii) the person has applied for the issue of a passport and cannot supply sufficient evidence of New Zealand citizenship; or (iii) an emergency has affected the availability of the information necessary to ascertain whether or not that person is already the holder of a New Zealand passport; and (c) the person wishes to travel immediately, but, for reasons of passport security and integrity, the Minister considers that it is not desirable to issue that person with a passport. Passports Act 1992 I have bolded the parts I feel are relevant - in your case, you have your daughter's New Zealand birth certificate, which would serve to provide reasonable cause to believe she is a New Zealand citizen. Alternatively, contact New Zealand government overseas traveller helpline and discuss your issue with them: If you're overseas and need help now, call +64 4 439 8000. With regard to your financial hardship situation, this can be particularly distressing - unfortunately there is little that can be done in this situation. The New Zealand government will not lend you money - they will however help you to contact friends and relatives in New Zealand that may be able to help: As a New Zealand citizen overseas, you have no right or claim to financial assistance from the New Zealand Government. ... We can help by: We cannot: Pay your hotel, travel or other bills, legal or medical expenses or costs of returning a body to New Zealand. Give you money. https://www.safetravel.govt.nz/financial-difficulties As you were denied boarding for insufficient travel documentation, the airline may not be under any obligation to refund your ticket or allow you to use its value against a rebooking. They may also charge you a change fee if they do allow you to use the value. This is dependent on the airlines Conditions of Carriage, and also the local laws of New Zealand and Russia. You may be in a better situation than other travellers however, as you and your daughter are citizens of the country that you are stuck in - you may be able to seek emergency assistance from that country, such as emergency accommodation etc. This won't help you to get back to New Zealand, but it may stop you from starving or sleeping on the streets. Regarding responsibilities in this situation, it is the travellers responsibility for ensuring they have an entitlement to re-enter the country of origin for the trip, and it is also the travellers responsibility for ensuring they have sufficient proof of that entitlement. JonathanReez has mentioned a third option in the comments, in that your daughter may be able to apply for a New Zealand entry visa on her Russian passport - and while this is indeed a potentially viable option, it may not be straight forward or easy to accomplish. Your daughter would have to meet the criteria for a visitors visa on her own merits, and any application may take anything from several weeks to months depending on the visa applied for (current average processing time for a Visitor visa is 20 days for an online application). You may encounter issues as an NZ citizen applying for an NZ visa (even on a foreign passport), as well as any issues surrounding whether she would be eligible to stay in NZ past the visa expiration date without incurring issues on her Russian passport further down the line - that is something you seriously need to discuss with NZ immigration if you go this route. The easiest option there, once you are back in NZ through using this option, is for your daughter to apply for an NZ passport, leave the country on the Russian passport and re-enter the country on the NZ passport."
When to book tickets from travel sites rather than airline sites?,"For domestic flights in the US, the cheapest price is almost always on the airline's website. Additionally, airlines sometimes include other benefits like additional frequent flyer miles, reduced baggage fees etc. for booking directly through their site. Online travel agents such as Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz etc. can sometimes find flight combinations that you cannot book directly through a single airline. This can be useful when there is no single airline (or airline alliance) that serves your route. This is not common for domestic trips, but can happen sometimes for international flights between more minor destinations. There is also the convenience of using a single site with all your information already stored instead of having to navigate a different a airline site every time you make a reservation. This can be especially useful for foreign airline websites which are sometimes more difficult to use and can be troublesome with foreign credit cards. Finally, if you book through an online travel site, they become your ""agent"" and can take care of things such as cancellations, schedule changes etc. You might find it more convenient to speak to an English speaking customer service agent on a 1-800 number than calling a foreign airline which may not have a toll-free number or even a number at all in the USA."
What are the exact reasons why one cannot take a bottle of water on the plane?,"Because it's difficult to tell apart a bottle full water from a bottle full of a chemical like hydrogen peroxide that could be used to make liquid explosives.  There was one hare-brained terrorist plot that apparently tried this in 2006, and because ""passenger convenience"" will always lose out to ""bureaucratic ass-covering"" when it comes to security theater, all liquids of all kinds were banned by the TSA.  (Unless they're under 100ml, so yes, you can take a 100ml bottle of water on board...  if you can find one!) In Japan, they've already got bottle scanners that can identify suspect liquids.  These are increasingly being adopted by other countries, and once they're widespread enough, the liquid silliness will hopefully end. Note that while you can't take a partly or completely filled >100ml water bottle through security, it's perfectly fine to take an empty bottle through security, and fill it up before you board the plane. Or you can buy a bottle once you've passed security."
Moscow (DME) airport arrival 23:55. My Russian visa becomes valid at midnight,"Technically, your visa is not valid when you are scheduled to land so boarding is a problem.  Practically, it will be perfectly valid by the time you reach the immigration counter, so you are dependent on the discretion of check-in staff. Be nice, they will let you board. If your flight lands early then keep sitting in your seat and pretend that you like to disembark the airplane late and then walk slowly and join one of the longer lines at immigration to try to make it midnight before it’s your turn.  I was at DME recently at it  took me 1 hour to reach the counter after coming out  of the airplane. "
What should I do after buying an airline ticket?,"It would depend on the airline and the airport/country but no matter how you buy the ticket, the next big step is what's called “checking in”. This is when the airline assigns you a seat and confirms that you will indeed be flying. In most cases, you can now check in online a few days to a few hours before departure and print the boarding pass at home (or wherever you can find a printer). You can then show up at the airport and present this self-printed boarding pass together with your passport to drop your luggage off and go through the security and police check (where applicable). Some airlines/airports also allow you to use a smartphone app as your boarding pass. Alternatively, it's also possible to check in at the airport itself, possibly for a fee. I have not done that in quite some time (preferring online check-in), but, back when I did it regularly, giving my name and presenting an ID was typically enough for the staff to find my booking. If using some automatic check-in machine, scanning the passport or presenting the credit card used for the booking was sometimes necessary. In any case, you do need to be at the airport in advance (depending on the circumstances up to 2 or 3 hours before departure are recommended) but not to go there in the days before. Finally, note that your ticket should include some confirmation number that you could write down to help the airline find your booking should any problem arise."
Schengen Visa Refusal: Justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable,"When a Schengen refusal notice contains... The information submitted regarding justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable. ...it means the decision-maker has concluded that the application contains serious problems.  This is arguably the most severe refusal reason in the Schengen repertoire; many times when they use this reason it will be accompanied by the final reason... Your intention to leave the territory of the Member States before the expiry of the visa applied for could not be ascertained. To reduce these two reasons to blunt and direct English, it means We have concluded that you are not a genuine applicant and we do not trust you.  This can arise in several ways...   If your sponsor has a history of sponsoring people who have breached the terms of their visa (like overstaying or working illegally) then this is taken into account against you and your sponsor's evidence may be treated as unreliable.  If you have a history of breach (like overstaying), or did not tell them about a change of circumstances, such as a significant change in your travel itinerary, then it's reasonable for them to assume that your fresh evidence is not reliable. If the relationship between you and your sponsor is too distant or cannot be adequately explained, and they cannot understand why your sponsor is willing to commit themselves on your behalf, then his/her evidence will be discounted as unreliable.  Make sure that your evidence demonstrates that there is a clear and strong relationship between you and your sponsor. If you are relying upon a sponsor you met on the internet and they are providing assurances for your financial well-being, and the only evidence you can provide to prove a strong relation is a Skype log or chat room log, it will almost certainly be seen as unreliable.  If your sponsor is making attestations about your intentions, or other third parties are making similar attestations, these will usually be discounted as not reliable.  There is very little evidence to show that third parties will turn someone over to the authorities if they are in breach.  Moreover, many such attestations contain promises that cannot be enforced.  These are considered to be unreliable evidence.  Some countries provide the host with a legally binding instrument having to do with sponsorship, but these have to do with financial capacity and not with an applicant's intentions. This is very common.  If your evidence is low quality or insufficient, they may conclude that it is unreliable.  Examples of this can be a single bank statement such that they cannot get a 'big picture' understanding of your circumstances. Also common are bank statements with irregular and unexplained flows in and out of the account. See ""Funds Parking"" for an example (although the link points to a UK case, it is wholly applicable to Schengen). Young applicants who are just starting out as international travellers may have problems getting the quality of evidence needed to show that they are sufficiently anchored to their family and community.  When this happens the evidence they produce is sketchy and not well documented, hence unreliable.  If you are young and just starting out as an independent  traveller, you may not have accrued enough high quality evidence to prove that you have a durable connection to your family and community. This is especially true if you have not yet established an independent life.  Applicants who are unemployed or otherwise in reduced circumstances will have a very difficult time producing reliable evidence.  These applicants will rely on their sponsor's evidence and are best advised to focus on producing high quality evidence that they occupy an established position in their community and have significant family relationships to maintain. Falling in to this same category are documents without a date or dated too long ago to be of any use in determining the applicant's current circumstances. This can happen when an applicant wants to strengthen their application or to fill an evidential shortfall. To do this the applicant will find a service that provides made to order evidence such as... These often fail when a visa assistant verifies them. When this happens, the evidence (if not the entire application) will be assessed as unreliable.  Remember that if you know about a way to procure counterfeit evidence, they do too.     When an application fails due to ""The information submitted regarding justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable."", the first step is to examine each piece of evidence you submitted with a view to separating high quality evidence from low quality evidence. If the low quality evidence consists of a single document that can easily be replaced with something more substantial, then it may be expedient to make a fresh application with the new evidence. If there's more than one or two low quality documents, it may make sense to wait until your circumstances improve. Yes. You can send them an explanation of why they made a wrong decision and ask them to reverse it locally. It's unlikely to help very much, but sometimes it may work.  To do this, you can compose a letter to the relevant issuing post (including a translation) and send it by post or fax.   Some refused applicants may feel the need to go ""straight to the top"" and complain directly to the ministerial office in the host country. These complaints will be routed back to the issuing post for comment and so the results will be unchanged but further delayed by the bureaucratic overhead. Unless the issuing post has solicited a bribe, it's best to keep things at the local level. A history of specious complaints can damage your credibility. Yes, for more information see this answer.   If you have read this article and think that none of the information applies to your case, then the best strategy is to contact a practitioner licensed in the EU to engage with Schengen applicants. They will be able to examine your evidence along with your personal circumstances and help determine what went wrong. Please also see Justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not provided. The controlling reference point for all Schengen applications is the Schengen Visa Code. Criminal information is exchanged between Shengen member states using the ECRIS technology. Some EEA residence permits are fungible within the Schengen zone, the controlling reference is in Regulation 562/2006. The United Kingdom does not participate in the Schengen arrangement and Schengen visas are not recognized by the UK Border Force.  The United Kingdom, however, does participate as an active user of the Schengen Information System. Schengen Transit Visas are taken up in Regulation 810/2009."
Available help for voluntary departure from the UK,"I'm sorry to hear this, and hope you find a way to rebuild in Nigeria. The UK government has a scheme to help in just this situation: see https://www.gov.uk/return-home-voluntarily Even if you think you do not meet the criteria on the website, I strongly suggest getting in contact with them, as they likely have some degree of discretion. Buying you a plane ticket will be less expensive than paying a security contractor to remove you."
Someone else is booking international ticket for me using their credit or debit card. Do they need to be present physically at the time of check in?,"First of all, it doesn't matter where you're flying from. What really matter is what airline you are flying with, so the short answer is: it depends. Some airlines, in an attempt to fight frauds, may ask you to show the card and if you fail to do so they CAN refuse to embark you. I once flew Royal Jordanian from Milano Malpensa to Amman and I was asked to show the credit card. Since I paid that flight with my father credit card, I didn't have it with me. They refused to embark me and I had to call home and make my father fax a self-certfication signed by him along with a copy of the credit card used to book the flight. Another time I was leaving from Amsterdam to Atlanta flying Delta and I was asked the same. That time I had my credit card with me and I pass the control flawlessly. Always read the conditions very carefully. It's always stated somewhere if they may ask you to show the card or not. If unsure, write an email or call them. Here some examples: Singapore airlines [click on ""What happens if I don't comply with the credit card verification requirements?""] If the booker does not bring his or her card used for the booking at check-in for verification, then passengers on the booking will not be allowed to check in and will be asked to purchase a new ticket using a new credit/debit card. However, the ticket price will remain the same. A refund will then be manually processed for the earlier purchased ticket. Emirates On the Enter billing information page where the credit card details are entered, if the ""Cardholder name"" can be typed in, you would be able to pay for the booking even if you are not travelling. If the ""Cardholder name"" appears in a drop-down menu and cannot be changed, you would unfortunately not be able to pay for the booking unless you are travelling. In some countries, for security reasons, the holder of the credit card
  used to book a ticket or group of tickets must be one of the
  travellers on that itinerary, and will be required to show the actual
  credit card at the airport check-in counter prior to receiving
  boarding passes. Skywards members may make a redemption booking for friends and family,
  and pay for the applicable taxes online with their own credit cards,
  if the country of departure offers credit card payment. Business Rewards administrators may also pay for their organizations
  members bookings by credit card, if the country of departure offers
  credit card payment. Delta  [click on the credit card link] To safeguard against credit/debit card fraud, the purchaser may have to show us the credit/debit card along with a valid photo ID. The time varies based on the billing address of the credit/debit card or the country of travel. If the purchaser is not traveling, they can show us their credit/debit card and ID at an airport ticket counter or another ticket office location, whichever is most convenient. Air France Due to increased credit card fraud problems, Air France does not accept third party payments (the credit card holder not being the passenger or part of the group traveling together). Exception: We allow payments for family members with the same surname. Please make sure the family member you book for brings the personal identifier you specified during booking to check in at the airport or to Customs and Immigration if required (this applies to e-tickets only). British Airways If you have booked directly with British Airways, either through ba.com or a British Airways Telephone Sales office, and you paid with your debit/ credit card you must present that debit/ credit card at check-in. This is to assist the check-in process and to provide debit/ credit card verification. Thai Airways Yes, the check-in counter staff need to check the card number and name on the credit card for reference only. 
  If you are purchasing tickets for family members or other persons with your credit card or Visa/MasterCard debit card, and not travelling yourself, please follow the specified Regulation (http://www.thaiairways.com/en_PK/Terms_condition/consent_form_regulations.page)"
What are the options to travel to Mecca or Jabal al-Nour as a non-Muslim?,"https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Mecca Non-Muslims are strictly prohibited from entering the city of Mecca. Road signs to guide non-Muslims are provided. The minimum penalty is deportation from the country. Documentation will be checked upon entry and anyone not showing proof of being Muslim will be refused entry. As a solitary exception, the Mecca bus terminal (outside city limits) is open to all. More: If you remain on the main highway, there is a police checkpoint just after the exit, where non-Muslims are kept out of the holy city. Actually this is decision of Allah and he stated in Quran: ""Oh you who believe! Truly the idolaters are unclean; so let them not, after this year, approach the Sacred Mosque"""
Can I stop a fellow passenger from using their cell phone during take off?,"You don't have to be too worried about it, since the aircraft is able to cope with this. People are instructed to turn them off in order to avoid some disturbances and parasite noise in the communication between the pilot and the airport. As electronic devices using radio frequencies, they could also in theory cause some troubles to some aircraft equipment's but this is pure theory as all equipments are properly protected now. So even if the phone is turned on, it won't make the aircraft go down. Keep in mind that a lot of people forget to switch on the flight mode (above 30% from studies) and this never caused a plane incident... Then, if you are still worried about it, just report it to the cabin crew. They are here to make this stop..."
Payment instructions allegedly from HomeAway look fishy to me,"Just looking at the domain name: Whereas: A legitimate website normally creates a subdomain (i.e. eu.homeaway.com), or they use homeaway.com for emails but add a slash in their website (i.e. homeaway.com/eu), or lastly might buy a different domain name still preserving the name (i.e. homeaway.eu - though I don't know whether this is an official one). In this case, having a domain like ""homeaway-eu.com"" and using a different registrar seems fishy. I would get in contact with the real homeaway.com by either an email or phone number on their website to confirm any details before transferring money. Otherwise, I would simply say ABORT. EDIT: Also, by looking at the SSL certificate of homeaway.com, these are the official domains allowed to be used with that certificate:"
How can I tell if this Polish villa for rent is a scam?,"It is VERY popular in Poland that you book accommodation directly with the landlord via email or a phone. Most of so called ""private accommodation"" (kwatery prywatne) are not listed on booking.com or airbnb, because prices in Poland are still quite low and the fees would increase it. The website looks legitimate, so I'd say there's no big risk. On the other hand, from my experience, you usually don't pay full price in advance, but rather something around 20-30%, and you pay the rest upon arrival."
Why would you cancel a non-refundable hotel reservation?,"Etiquette generally demands that if you reserve something you're not going to make use of, it's polite to cancel your reservation. Even if you can't summon any desire to be nice to the hotel's owners after being subject to their inflexible cancellation policies, think of it as being nice to your fellow travelers, as your cancellation just might help out someone else who is in need of a room. This is often less true with rooms booked through a third-party booking site like Expedia, but if you call the hotel directly, they can sometimes, entirely at their discretion with no guarantees of success, be accommodating even with non-refundable reservations, especially if you have a good reason (medical emergency, serious travel delays, etc...) and/or are open to flexibility (they may let you shift the dates or apply the cost as a credit toward a future stay)."
TSA broke a lock for which they have a master key. How can I claim compensation?,"If you have travel insurance, you can file a claim for damaged baggage. You should look at a reasonable option to fully repair the damage, which may include buying a brand new suitcase if there is no reasonable way to fix the problem with the lock. You then file a claim for the expenses made to your travel insurance company. They can then say that you must first try to recover the costs from the TSA or the airline, but your insurance will then pay the difference between the total costs and what you have been able to get from the TSA or the airline. "
What does this traffic sign with a crossed-out black octagon mean?,"This is the 5th sign on the ""regulatory signs"" section of the Ontario Drivers Handbook.  As it says there: Do not stop in the area between the signs. This means you may not stop your vehicle in this area, even for a moment. (Used in pairs or groups.) This is far stricter than ""No Parking"" since parking involves leaving your car. In a No Stopping zone you can't pull over to let someone out or pick someone up, for example."
Why is the food so bad on airplanes?,"Consider this: In all of these cases, just as on the airplane: I am not sure I believe all the stuff about air pressure etc changing the taste. I have had some amazingly delicious food when sitting upfront. I think it's just the issues of scale, and of the relative unimportance of food quality, that leave us poking at glop wondering if we really are hungry enough to eat it. I have also had delicious food in economy, mostly within Europe."
Is it legal to bring board games (made of wood) to Australia?,"You can do very specific queries in the BICON - Australian Biosecurity Import Conditions database. As an example, I entered chess board, which it did not know, but it gave me 5 suggested links, of which one was Wooden manufactured articles. My guess is this covers your timber board games. There it says among other things: Each consignment will be subject to an inspection on arrival to verify that the goods are clean and free from any signs of borer holes, live insects, bark and other biosecurity risk material. If biosecurity risk material is found, the consignment will be treated in accordance with a Department of Agriculture and Water Resources approved method, or exported or destroyed at the importer's expense. And biosecurity risk material is defined here. You can dig in deeper for full details."
What does this Swiss black on yellow rectangular traffic sign with a symbol looking like a dart mean?,"Signals with a black border and black text on yellow ground are military signals, as defined in Art 101.8 of the Swiss Road Signal Ordenance (Signalisationsverordnung, not available in english): Gelb-schwarze Signale, ausgenommen die Signale «Hauptstrasse» (3.03) und «Ende Hauptstrasse» (3.04), richten sich ausschliesslich an die Führer von Militärfahrzeugen.7 Die Signale haben einen gelben Grund; der Rand, die Schrift und die Symbole sind schwarz. Die Bestimmungen zum Schutze der Signale (Art. 98 SVG) sind anwendbar. They are only valid for drivers of military vehicles while in active duty.  The meaning of these symbols is the following  (Image courtesy of Swiss Army Logistics Base, not available online) On how to read the sign post in the first picture in general, the general rule is to read from top to bottom:"
"Can I voluntarily exit from the US after a 20 year overstay, or could I be detained at the airport?","There are 2 aspects:  The US doesn't formally have exit controls, so no agency is systematically checking exit documents. Even if a CBP officer did spot-check you, they'd go ""My job is to get you to leave.  Since you're leaving on your own, can I carry your bags for you? Guide you to your gate?"" Retribution isn't coming.   What is coming, is future refusal when you try to re-enter the USA as a temporary visitor. Because you'll have a 10-year ban, and after that, you will have difficulty convincing them that your next visit will be temporary.  Today, they just want you to leave.   As far as the airline boarding -- If you are a citizen of country X, you are entitled to travel there.  You need to show the airline proper proof of that, becuase they have a legal obligation not to fly you somewhere you'll be refused. Your passport issued by that country will suffice.  Of course, beware of situations where you select a route through a third country and they want a transit visa or something.  "
Can a passenger predict that an airline or a tour operator is about to go bankrupt?,"Yes, there were many, many indicators that Thomas Cook was in financial trouble, from analyst downgrades to their share price and their bond rate. But the company had been in financial trouble for years, being slow to address its competition as its bread-and-butter businesses were stagnating. They hadn't paid a dividend since 2011. In terms of operational trouble, I doubt travelers could have predicted that the collapse would come on 22 September, certainly when their suppliers and employees did not. This is true of most major corporate collapses. There is no such thing as announcing a liquidation even a day in advance—your landlord would change the locks, your employees wouldn't bother to show up, the banks would withhold credit card payments, and so on. You're effectively shut down the moment you make the announcement, and that always comes as a ""surprise,"" even when long suspected. So it was with Ansett, Swissair, Varig, Mexicana, and more recently Monarch and WOW air, not to mention companies like Toys R' Us or Northern Rock. If a company can convince investors, creditors, and regulators that it is improving its operations and balance sheet, it may be able to operate for years and years until it records a profit again, or until the day one or more of the stakeholders is no longer convinced the project is viable. Pan Am made losses for 22 years before closing down, and even in its shabby reduced state might have survived for longer without the Lockerbie bombing. U.S. department store Sears, Roebuck & Co. has been in serious trouble for a decade, and in decline for at least three decades. Many analysts, in fact, have called for its liquidation. But in the meantime it has still sold billions upon billions of dollars of merchandise and employed tens of thousands of people. You can order merchandise from them today and expect it be delivered tomorrow—until the tomorrow finally comes when it is not. Thomas Cook is a storied name and the company collected a billion pounds of revenue last year. It could roll over its debt and attract new capital until the day arrived that it couldn't. Even their much-publicized £1.5bn loss earlier in the year is a matter of accounting. United Airlines said it lost a staggering $16.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005 right before they exited bankruptcy protection. If a small local carrier goes out of business, you are stranded unless you have specifically purchased insurance against that scenario. For major airlines, however, there are usually provisions negotiated whereby another airline will honor at least your return ticket, at its convenience. Based on cursory reading about the high-profile collapses I listed earlier, I cannot discern any pattern of who will accept those bookings. You will need to wait for the news to come out when it happens and contact the relevant airlines for arrangements after the fact. As far as unused tickets on a carrier that has ceased operations are concerned, some discussion of protection has been covered in Insurance against airline bankruptcy, WOW air has ceased operation, can I get my tickets refunded?, and What happens to plane tickets in case of airline bankruptcy? Travel insurance may or may not include a provision; you will need to read the fine print to see if you qualify. If you purchased from the airline with a payment card, you may be able to contact the issuer of the card to request a refund, since the carrier has failed to hold up its end of the contract. Additional protections may also apply depending on national laws based on how the trip was packaged and sold."
I just entered the USA without passport control at Atlanta airport,"You went through US CBP Preclearance in Toronto before boarding your flight. This is US immigration and customs, with US immigration officers stationed on Canadian soil, and unless something unusual occurs, that means your flight arrives in the US in the same way as a US-to-US domestic flight, with no need for any further procedures to enter the country.  Since you're a NEXUS holder, your trip through immigration was short and simplified, as the US considers you a trusted traveler with no need to see an officer unless you have something to declare or are selected for further scrutiny.  As for your second question: but how the hell did the security know if i already precleared at toronto airport and openned up the door to separate hallway ? Everyone on your flight went through preclearance, because that was part of the process before you could get to your boarding gate in Toronto. The airline's staff in Atlanta knew you were on a preclearance flight and opened the appropriate doors to direct you into the airport concourse instead of the secure corridors to the immigration hall. If you had arrived in the US on a non-preclearance flight (say, a flight from London), they instead would have ensured that your only path was to the immigration hall, and you would not be able to leave the airport until you went through immigration and customs. If the airline staff does somehow screw that up, there could be substantial fines for the airline and a great deal of trouble and inconvenience for everyone (as occurred during this incident in Chicago)."
Is it normal to walk around an (American) hotel in pajamas?,"In the US, it really depends on where you are staying.   In a big hotel in a city, it would be expected that you wear street clothes or even casual business wear in the public areas.  Granted you could get away with wandering down the hall to get some ice or a soda from the vending machine in your pajamas, but lounging in the lobby or a reading room and such in pajamas would be frowned upon. (though not enforceable unless they have a posted dress code) In a smaller guesthouse, bed & breakfast, inn, etc lounging around in your pajamas would likely not be an issue, as they try to present more more homey atmosphere, not the big city business atmosphere. Overall the fancier the lodging presents itself, the less likely pajamas will be acceptable.  The more casual, more home like they present themselves as, the more likely it is OK."
How to find better food in airports,"If online resources aren't doing the job as you said, then the only logical solution is to find an employee who seems to be friendly, and ask them!  Employees know better, perhaps they even know some secret places that allow passengers to buy from. If they are super nice, they can offer to buy you the meal (using your money) using their discount (many airport food places offer employee discounts), I did that myself (as an employee).  I'd find an empty counter with an employee doing nothing and ask them, or ask the cleaning staff. "
Is it safe to drink the water from the fountains found all over the older parts of Rome?,"Ah, the large noses.  I did last year.  Had no issues. There are approximately 2,500–2,800 nasoni in Rome, supplying citizens and tourists with free drinking water.  The water coming from the nasoni is the same supplied to the city's households and thus safe for drinking.  Further reading:"
Special meals on long-haul flights,"I have requested countless times vegan/vegetarian meals on long-haul flights. Normally they are pretty well organized and you won't have to ask for the meal. My strategy is just to wait and if given the normal food, then I politely remind them I have a special arrangement. In hundred of flights, this has only happened maybe 1 or 2 times. In most airlines, they deliver the special meals ahead of time and only then will they start delivering the normal menus. It is a rare ocurrence that the crew will make the effort of delivering your meal in sync with everyone else [Turkish Airlines however managed delivering in sync pretty well]. I will also add that often in the vegetarian menu, the desserts and breakfasts are far nicer than the alternatives, as they won't give you that terrible egg substitute and you often get real fruit instead of the boring generic cakes. [and I prefer to know what I am eating rather than eating something I do not know how it was made ] The experience may vary because often the service crew/crew does not understand the concept and nuances of vegetarianism, from ovo-lacto to strict vegetarianism. From my experience, in the UK and middle east airlines often they got it right as they frequently have Indian/Hindu customers. Also from the voice of experience, the request has to be done at booking time. By check-in time, the logistics are already in motion and they won't be able to cater to your preferences. As @happybuddha correctly points out, it is always sensible to ask at check in/boarding time wether you have the meal in place or not. However, if there was a fault it will not always be corrected. The process is unreliable at best, depends on the willingness of the parties involved, and of a member of the crew taking the time to coordinate/fetch your meal from the service crew and carrying it by hand to the plane.  You may however have the luck of them having a extra veg meal by some other motive. Once I asked why I was not given my veg meal, and whilst I was told it was not in the system, I was asked if I would not mind having a hindu meal instead. Be aware, when a plane is ""upgraded"" at the last minute, or there is a malfunction and there is a plane change, all bets are off. There is a strong possibility that they won't have time to deal with the logistics and will just load a generic meal for x passengers. If you miss a flight/connection, forget about your special meal. As I said before, at check-in time they won't be able to change meals, even though they may say they will to try to keep you happy - in a small airport/company someone of the crew might be tasked to carry the meal, it already happened with me, but it was a courtesy and it is not a common occurrence. The meals are usually already in the plane, or already prepared to be loaded in the plane by that time. It seems pretty much a requirement in many airlines that any special meal has to be booked at least 48h in advance. Even for non-vegetarians it may be worth looking at special meals - for instance Emirates Airlines and Turkish airlines have a wide choice, including several ethnic choices and sea food. Please do note that in some short-haul flights, you might have hot meals as well if you buy the meal at booking time, like in Cebu Pacific or Cathay Pacific airlines. The price can be competitive compared to having a meal/snack at a restaurant/coffee shop in the airport, and it also can save you valuable time."
Is weed still legal for tourists in Amsterdam?,"It has always been illegal and people have been arrested for smoking it in the open. I always love the faces of the tourists being arrested at Schiphol airport or in front of the Central station in Amsterdam for smoking weed. It is a global misconception that in Amsterdam it is as free as smoking cigarettes on the street. The principle has always been, what is called ""Gedogen"", which means that it is tolerated as long as you don't use it in the open and don't create annoyances. It is the Dutch way of dealing with social problems. It is similar to the so-called ""afwerkplekken"" for street prostitution. These are designated area's where street prostitution is tolerated. When ever there is a social problem that is hard to eradicate, the Dutch approach is encapsulate it in known zones, relieving other area's from problems related to that social problem.   In the seventies the Dutch government introduced so called ""coffeeshops"", which are designated establishments where cannabis use is tolerated. Again recognize the difference between tolerated and allowed.  What has changed recently is the legal status for these coffeeshops. They are now only allowed as a member-only organization for local residents. To get access to a coffeeshop you need to register as a member providing proof you live in the same city. The change of this regulation was guided by the pressure from Belgium and Germany. Border cities like Maastricht, Roosendaal, Terneuzen were like magnets to weed smokers from France, Belgium and Germany, causing problems in those cities and the surrounding countries. This was the reason behind introducing the member-only requirement for coffeeshops. This is also why the weed-pass as it is informally called was first introduced in the border regions and later imposed on other cities like Amsterdam. As Mark already said, again some cities like Amsterdam chose not to spent resources on enforcing this.
Border cities did introduce the legislation to require the member-only status of coffeeshops, with the effect that most coffeeshops did close. "
Hard Brexit and travel for UK citizens into Schengen countries in 2019,"You will certainly¹ not need a visa.  The UK has declared it will not require visas for any EU nationals for short stays, and the EU has declared the same for the UK (see European Commission press release and Brexit preparedness document).    However, from 2021 you will most likely need to apply for ETIAS (an electronic authorisation similar to US ESTA).  This is likely true even if there is a Brexit agreement and possibly even if there is no Brexit (without Brexit, EU law should mean no ETIAS shall be needed). The UK Government has issued a series of notices on the impact of a no-deal Brexit.  One such notice issues specific guidance for Travelling to the EU with a UK passport if there's no Brexit deal (checked 13 December 2018).  This confirms the guidance quoted in legoscias answer, but does not address a system known as ETIAS. Once it enters into force (expected 2021), UK citizens will most likely need to apply for ETIAS, a Schengen electronic system similar to the more famous US ESTA system.  See ETIAS VISA: how will it affect UK citizens: Firstly, anytime a British citizen visiting Europe with a valid passport wishes to travel to continental Europe, prior to leaving home, they will have to apply via an online platform for an ETIAS visa-waiver. After the UK leaves the EU, britons will be exempt from obtaining a visa, but will not be exempt from the ETIAS visa waiver. This travel authorisation, once accepted, will be binding for 3 years for multiple visits with no limit and will become a mandatory requirement for all travelers from elegible ETIAS visa waiver countries from 2021. UK citizens and all eligible travellers who wish to visit the Schengen Zone will need to answer a series of health and security questions when completing the ETIAS online form. It’s extremely important to answer honestly, as all the data provided in the ETIAS application will be checked against a series of databases including Europol or Interpol. This statement from the European Commission (which the same website cites) confirms that according to stated policy, travel in both directions will remain visa free: It would mean that UK citizens would not need a visa when travelling to the Schengen area for short stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period. In the scenario where the UK leaves the EU without a deal, this would apply as of 30 March 2019. (...) This proposal is entirely conditional upon the UK also granting reciprocal and non-discriminatory visa-free travel for all EU Member States, in line with the principle of visa reciprocity. The UK government has declared its intention not to require a visa from citizens of the EU27 Member States for shorts stays for the purposes of tourism and business. So, unless either party changes its mind and breaks with stated policy intentions, you will not need a visa.  However, from 2021 you will need ETIAS. Edit: The day after I posted this answer, The Guardian posted this ""news"" article on Brits needing to pay the ETIAS fee for Schengen travel after Brexit, which is old news because this was already known. ¹Of course, in theory, any government can change any policy at any time, reasonably or not, legally or not.  This answer is accurate at the time of writing.  Any country might suddenly close their borders after you book but before you travel.  That is a risk that always exists for future travel."
"What is this building and where is it? Europe in 1944-45 by a U.S. Army Air Force soldier. France, Germany, Belgium, or Netherlands?","That's the Chapelle royale de Dreux, also known as St-Louis de Dreux.
Dreux is a town about 70 km west of Paris. This chapel is historically important, since the last King of France, Louis-Philippe (reign: 1830-1848), is buried there; the Chapel is the traditional burial place of members of the House of Orléans. As @Andrew already mentioned in his valuable comment (thanks a lot!), the former Dreux/Vernouillet airfield (now Vernouillet Airport) is located just some kilometers southwest of Dreux.

Why do Prague streets use double street addresses?,"The upper number is the ""descriptive number"" (Czech: číslo popisné or č. p.) and is unique within each municipal part (in this case, Nové Město, Praha 1). Since descriptive numbers can be fairly large and since they're generally assigned based on age (i.e. newer houses have higher numbers), they're hard to use for navigation, which is where the second number comes in. The lower number is the ""orientational number"" (Czech: číslo orientační or č. o.). It's unique for each street or square (in this case, Wenceslas Square) and can be used for navigation, since houses in a row should have increasing numbers based on their position in the street/square. Also, for streets, houses on one side of the street have even orientational number, and odd on the other side. The same system is used in other towns and cities in Czechia. The plaques can have different colors, but their position (the orientational number below the descriptive number) should be consistent. See also the House numbering article on the English Wikipedia, section Czech Republic and Slovakia. Side note: while the Czech names for these numbers are clear, I found different English translations. Some translate číslo popisné as ""conscription number"" and some translate číslo orientační as ""reference number"". I have chosen to go with the more literal translations."
"UAE now banning VPN access - fines of up to $545,000? Any workarounds?","tl;dr If you are using VPN for anything other than committing a crime, then there's no problem as per the law. Long answer with personal opinions This law which was announced January, 2016 is mainly targeting criminal activities including cyber crimes and VoIP calls. It also acts as a scarecrow for the general public.  For normal people who are seeking porn or other silly blocked content, no one will bother to prosecute them. I have many friends there and I have personally used proxies there and nothing ever happened, but I wasn't doing any ""criminal"" activities.  I have spent time reading the UAE law regarding this, it's not clear and it's vague. I believe it will be used only against terrorists, or against people who sell VoIP calls in bulk.  In addition to the above, one of the official newspaper in the UAE (in Arabic) quotes parts of the actual law, which I could not find in English, states the following (rough translation): ... A fine of 2,000,000 AED or prison to those who use techniques to get a false IP address with the intention of committing a crime..  This is the only piece of the new law I was able to get online, and it clearly is vague, and it also mentions ""the intention of committing a crime"", which confirms what I said earlier, it's not meant for the general public and their use of VPN to watch porn or something. Some other newspapers have articles about an interview with an official in Dubai police, who clearly was talking about criminals, such as terrorists, blackmailers, etc."
Traveling in Europe Solo - 18 years old. Feasible?,"I suspect your Mom hasn't spent much time in the places you're planning to visit, because the notion that these countries are dangerous is frankly ridiculous. I've spent most of my life living in Europe, including Ireland, UK, France and Germany and have never been the victim of any personal crime. Maybe I've just been lucky, but if you want something a bit more scientific than personal anecdotes, you can use this website to compare levels of crime in different cities. Personally I would be far more concerned about crime in many parts of the US (e.g. Oakland, CA), than the European countries you've mentioned."
"Is tap water in Munich safe to drink? If so, why do locals buy bottled water?","I live in Prague where the water is equally safe to drink and tastes well, however plenty of people still buy bottled water. The reasons are: Different flavors. Bottled water comes in a variety of tastes and levels of carbonation, which is obviously unavailable from the tap. As suggested by long-time resident @Relaxed, this is part of the German affinity towards sparkling drinks. 83% of Germans buy fizzy drinks, so this reason probably explains the behaviour of 4 out of 5 Germans. Not trusting the local water supply. Although studies have shown bottled water isn't necessarily any safer. Old habits. Other regions have water that is not safe to drink or has a strong mineral taste, so people from those regions might be used to bottled water. Better taste. Some people think bottled water has a more pleasant taste. Although this has been shown to be a bias that doesn't pass the scrutiny of a blind test. Convenience. People drink water outside their homes too and buying a bottle is more convenient than refilling one at the tap."
Can a tourist buy a gun in the USA?,"Very simply, no, they can not. In order to purchase a firearm in the US you must be a resident of the state in which you are buying it, and able to prove that residency.  As a tourist is not a resident of the state, they are unable to purchase firearms. There was previously an additional requirement that non-citizens had to have been a resident of a state for 90 days before they could purchase a firearm in that state, but that additional condition was removed earlier this year. Even if you could purchase a firearm, doing so for ""travels around the United States"" would be troublesome as gun laws vary from state to state, so what is legal in one state could be illegal in another. Update: Further information can be found in this Q&A document from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) website."

Can I get a discount on my flight for not being overweight?,"Short answer: No, you will not get such a discount. Longer answer: For any significantly-sized airliner, the commodity they have to sell you is floor space in the cabin, not weight. If you're occupying one seat of the same size, you're costing the airline almost exactly the same as someone who weighs twice what you do. Let's consider some numbers: Assumed average weight of a passenger: 150 lb (68 kg).
Operating Empty Weight of an A330-300: 274,500 lb (124,500 kg).
Weight of the 293 passengers on a Delta A333: 150 x 293 = 43,950 lb (19,940 kg).
Example fuel load on an A333: 150,000 lb (68,000 kg).  (It can carry up to 175,170 lb. (79,460 kg) of Jet-A)
Total before cargo for our fully-loaded A333: 468,450 lb (212,490 kg). Now let's say we double everyone's weight. Adding another 43,950 lb (19,940 kg) adds another 9% to the gross takeoff weight for our A333 full of 300 lb (136 kg) passengers. Also, one must consider that fuel is a major operating cost for airlines, but far from the only one. The other costs for operating your flight include: All of these costs add up so much that fuel costs represented only 27% of costs for Delta in the most recent quarter and they were on the high end. So, our A330-300 full of 300 lb (136 kg) passengers would only increase airline costs by around 9.38% x 0.27 = about 2.5%. Conclusion: Your below-average weight is decreasing airline costs from those of flying an average 150 lb (68 kg) passenger by probably a fraction of a percent. This is certainly not worthwhile for the airline to create such a small discount, especially not considering the business they'd likely lose over people not wanting to be weighed and/or feeling discriminated against and/or feeling that their privacy is being violated. In addition to the title question of whether you can get a discount for weighing less, baggage was also mentioned. The situation is a little different with baggage and actually varies depending on the type of baggage. What you're paying for when you buy a ticket is: The reasons for this are: With carry-on baggage, you're again paying more for space than for weight. There's only so much volume available for carry-on baggage in the passenger cabin, so there are limits to how much any one person can bring so that, hopefully, everyone can get theirs in. No U.S. airline I've flown on has ever even bothered to weigh carry-on baggage. They only care that you have no more than the allowed two pieces (namely, one that will fit in the overhead bin and one that will fit under the seat in front of you.) Some non-U.S. airlines I've flown on have weighed carry-on baggage, but only for safety purposes (i.e. to make sure it didn't exceed the weight capacity of the overhead bin.) In those cases, overweight bags didn't have an extra fee, but were rather banned outright, since it was a safety concern, not a cost concern. With checked baggage, the situation is a little different. As densely-packed as passenger cabins may feel these days, the reality is that they're mostly filled with air. That's not necessarily the case with the cargo hold where checked baggage goes. It still has volume limits, but its weight limits also become significant, since the cargo is packed much more densely than the passenger cabin. With cargo, in addition to the volume limits, there are multiple weight limits at play: In practice, the last of those ends up being the reason for overweight bag fees. If your bag weighs more than an individual handler is required to lift by himself, they'll need multiple handlers and/or special equipment every single time they handle your bag, which can be quite a lot of times. It's for this reason that you'll be charged an extra fee for carrying one 55 lb. (25 kg) bag, but not for two 50 lb. (22.7 kg) bags. Of course, as long as the bags are all under the maximum a handler is required to lift, more bags means more cost to the airline (it takes them 5 times as long to load five 10 lb. bags as one 50 lb. bag, for example.) So, for checked baggage, you're usually limited both to a certain number of pieces and with a weight limit on each piece individually, rather than just a total baggage weight limit. How much you personally weigh is completely irrelevant to the airline's expenses for transporting your baggage. And, of course, again, this is in addition to the fact that the airline would lose revenue from passengers who didn't want to provide their weight, even if it otherwise would make sense for them to consider passenger weight in fares."
Caught in Czech Republic for travelling with invalid ticket,"The stamp on your ticket is so poor, that it is really difficult to read. It does indeed say Aug 27th, but it can very easily be read as Aug 21st:  The stamp actually reads 'P27Ⅷ17', but the uppermost line of all characters is missing, so it could even easily be misread as 21st July (21Ⅶ). The last digit (7) is so weakly printed, that you can barely see it. Even on your stamp, it is pretty obvious that the digits before and after the Ⅷ are different. If you look at the font used by the Prague ticket validators and the digits 1 and 7 properly printed, you can see that if the upper horizontal line of a '7' digit is missing, there is only the rightmost vertical bar left, which can easily be read as a '1'. The digit '1' is however printed with a horizontal bar at the bottom, with a vertical line rising from the center.   It is difficult to say if you ran into real ticket inspectors, were conned or if the ticket inspectors really did make an honest mistake. To avoid such situations, you could have seen yourself that the stamp is very hard to read. Depending on wether you want to waste time or money to solve the problem, you could either have made an attempt to replace the ticket at a ticket office, or bought a new ticket and stamped it in a different validator. The problem had likely been solved if you had let the ticket inspectors take you to the police, but you might have lost even more time."
"Warned by CBP about traveling to the US using the wrong visa, but need to go again soon","Take that warning seriously, it is in their records (and in your interest). But the immigration officer felt that I should be travelling on an L1 instead of a B1 since I am staying for longer duration in the US. That's then the best advice for you, unfortunately we won't be able to better that one. After having assessed your travels and having interviewed you they advised that L1 is the proper category then please go ahead and discuss that with your employer and apply for an L1. There is no point looking to interpret things differently after having been given a clear advice by the most relevant authority. I can spend some time to find some authoritative resources to support my answer but all those resources say that the final discretion to let you in the US lies with the officer interviewing you at the port of entry. The advice that you received was exactly from that very officer. Now I am required to travel to US again for a week in 2nd week of September and I am not sure if this qualifies as a similar travel. I am travelling on behalf of the same organization to visit a different client in a different city and this time staying only for a maximum of 1 week. It does qualify to be the same situation, I wouldn't risk thinking oh he just thought i was staying for too long.  Take their advice without any grain of  salt. My worthless 2 cents? I have stayed for around 63 days this year in the US They are right. 63 days business activity in only 2 trips in only 8 months does seem to be beyond what B-1 entitles an alien. I think the supervisors are going to say the same thing."

"OK we're all nerds here, so really, how on earth should I use a Japanese toilet?","Wikivoyage tells you all you need to know -- and I'm going to quote most of it, since I originally wrote the entry! Don't panic — help is at hand. The first key to solving the puzzle is
  that the actual flush mechanism is usually not operated by the control
  panel: instead, there is a standard, familiar, Western-style lever,
  switch or knob somewhere and it is thus entirely possible to take care
  of your business without ever using the washlet features. (In rare
  cases, mostly with very high-end gear, flushing is integrated; if
  lifting your bottom off the seat doesn't do the trick, look for
  buttons labeled 大 or 小, meaning a big or small flush respectively, on
  a wireless control panel on the wall.) The second key to exploration
  is that there is always a big red button labeled 止 on the panel —
  pressing this will instantly stop everything. Older models simply have
  a lever nearby that controls the flow of a sprayer. Armed with this knowledge you can now begin to dig deeper. Typical
  controls include the following: Oshiri (おしり) - ""buttocks"", for spraying your rear - typically shown in blue with a stylized butt icon; this action can be unnerving,
  but travellers should not be afraid - by the second or third attempt
  it will seem normal  Bidet (ビデ) - for spraying your front - typically shown in pink with a female icon  Kansō (乾燥) - ""dry"", for drying off when finished - typically yellow with a wavy air icon   Other, smaller buttons can be used to adjust the exact pressure,
  angle, location and pulsation of the jet of water. Sometimes the seat
  of the toilet is heated, and this can be also regulated. One
  explanation is that since houses are not usually centrally heated, the
  toilet business can be made a little more convenient by heating the
  seat. To be polite and save energy, you should leave the cover down on
  heated toilet seats. And if that wasn't enough, Wikipedia tells you way, way more than you need to know."
Why did airport security swab my hands with wet paper?,"Often at security they swab my backpack and some of my possessions with a small piece of damp paper. It is supposed to pick up traces of the materials I've been handling. Then they put it in a machine that analyzes those traces. At customs and immigration it's set to detect various illicit drugs (I've seen this on Border Security) but at security I believe it's set to detect explosives. Certain people are chosen randomly for a swab. Since you had no residue on your hands that would require them to inspect you further, they sent you on your way. This wasn't caused by you leaving a ring on. Leaving a wedding ring on is fine."
Why are prices published without tax in the US?,"There is no general VAT in the US but various sales taxes, which means that there isn't a single tax rate that shops could easily include in all prices. Depending on the location, there could be a sales tax from the state, county, city or even other institutions (transport authorities, etc.) so you cannot even set a price and print labels for a state or a metropolitan area, let alone nationwide. Also, displaying lower prices is generally advantageous so as long as they don't have to do it, it would seem retailers have very little incentive to figure a way to deal with all this. Even if one would consider doing it (which is not the case as far as I know), they would just make themselves look bad compared to the competition. To use an analogy, even when several parties really wish to reduce their weapon stockpiles, it's too risky for one of them to disarm unilaterally and find itself alone without weapons when the others still have them (or in this case, display higher after-tax prices when everybody else advertises with before-tax prices)."
Why are balloons prohibited at Amsterdam Schiphol?,"I found this article. Loosely translated: Station Schiphol disallows balloons since recently. The reason for this is that it has happened a few times last year that a kid's ballon hit the overhead power lines, often resulting in smoke and smouldering particles. Because the smoke alarm is very sensitive, because of safety concerns with the long train tunnel, this will set off the alarm very quickly. When that happens, the tunnel and the entire train station have to be evacuated. This leads to major discomfort for travellers who will face delays. I commute by train and remember that Schiphol trains were cancelled quite often because of smoke in the tunnel last year, but I didn't know that balloons were the cause..."

Can I board if my flight arrives 1.5 hours before my UK visa becomes valid?,"Lingering in the passageways (or disappearing into the toilets) at Gatwick for 1.5 hours is a naive idea, it's called ""suspicious behaviour"" in the contexts of both security and attempting to evade immigration control. For them, it means someone deplaned but did not reach one of the other control points and they will check where the leakage occurred with their cameras. Since it's a  suspicious event, they will dispatch a unit to make eyes on contact. The unit may or may not include one of the medical cyclists on call around the clock, but for sure would include at least one security staff. They will make a welfare check and wait outside the toilet for you. Unless you are seriously ill they will conduct an id check and escort you to the primary control point for a more intensive line of enquiry. When it all becomes clear that this was a simple matter of passenger convenience and not a seriously ill passenger, the IO can decide what to do.  Note: the controlling technical reference for this question is Paragraph 31A of the rules, which says... Where a person has arrived in the United Kingdom with leave to enter
  or remain in the United Kingdom which is in force but was given to him
  before his arrival, he may apply, on arrival at the port of entry in
  the United Kingdom, for variation of that leave. An Immigration
  Officer acting on behalf of the Secretary of State may vary the leave
  at the port of entry but is not obliged to consider an application for
  variation made at the port of entry. If an Immigration Officer acting
  on behalf of the Secretary of State has declined to consider an
  application for variation of leave at a port of entry but the leave
  has not been cancelled under paragraph 2A(8) of Schedule 2 to the
  Immigration Act 1971, the person seeking variation should apply to the
  Home Office under paragraph 32. (And note that paragraph 32 is no longer viable) For your more specific questions... Will the EasyJet airlines going to allow me on board? I will be coming
  from Venice. This is dependent on nationality and staff diligence and intangeable factors at (I assume) Marco Polo. The answer is indeterminate. How long does it take from landing to Immigration in London Gatwick? At 22:30 it should take about 10 minutes max; the queue at the control point may be lengthy but no longer than about 20 minutes for a non-EU arrival. Can I stay longer in the airport before I pass through Immigration? See above Can I still see my luggage in the conveyor belt after 1.5 hours? How
  much time before they take away my luggage from the belt? Once the counts at each point have matched they will pull it and store it, but this will take a much longer time for them to get around to it. TL;DR There is no such thing as hiding in Gatwick for any noticeable length of time. One way or another you will need to explain yourself and your options are (1) under suspicious behaviour or (2) passenger convenience. "
Is it a good idea to mention to the USA immigration officer that I'm visiting my girlfriend?,"I was in a similar situation a few years ago. I actually sent an email to US Customs & Border Protection. Their response back then was that they would expect me to be outside of the US for about an equal amount of time to what I had just spent inside before returning.
In my case, I had been in the USA with a visa waiver (as a EU citizen) for 82 days (almost the full 90 days). I stayed home for 90 days and returned.   I was pulled from the line at the airport immigration before making it to the front. I was taken to a separate room and asked a lot of questions along the lines why I was returning again on a tourist visa, whom I was going to stay with, how I was going to pay for all this, etc.
I was allowed to enter the country because I could answer all those questions to their satisfaction. But in this case, immigration was very serious about the matter.  screenshot of the email-exchange:  the important paragraph reads: The Visa Waiver Program doesn't work that way. If he decides to use the Visa Waiver Program (ESTA); maximum stay is 90 days and he needs to allow adequate time between visits. The rule of thumb is if he is in the US for 90 days; should be out of the U.S. for 91 days before returning. "
Are there any rules of thumb for the most comfortable seats on a long distance bus?,"If motion sickness is a consideration
As a child suffering from motion sickness I would always try to sit between or above the wheels. In modern buses you do not see the wheels but the area between the wheels is still the area with the least swaying motions. Forward view
If you want forward view, the front seat on the other side as the driver is great. In some buses there will be several to chose from as they are on different levels.
An other advantage of the front row seat on many coaches (as mentioned by @nsn in his answer) is that there is no row further forward with seats that recline into your face. 
A disadvantage of the front seats, specially in countries with many road accidents, is that you are more likely to suffer, (or die,) if the bus hits something head on.  My last multiple day 'bus' tour was in a 20 seater that was filled with the maximum number of passengers so the 'guide' seat next to the driver needed to be used. I loved it though it had less leg room and no place to store a carry-on bag. The views were amazing. Traveling with a group
But for those who like to hang out together while in a bus, the back seat still offers the best options.
Some buses (the kind that have been used as city bus in the early part of their life) have sets of seats where two face backward, making a group of four for friends, without having to be in the back of the bus. Window or aisle seat
View to the left or the right does make a difference but unless you know where the best views will be, it will be a guess.
I prefer aisle seats, as with those you have pretty good views one way and acceptable ones the other, while window seats give good views one direction and almost nothing the other way. Other reasons to chose window or aisle is the space you get and the fact that others will pass.
Those that need more than average space, for reasons of build, size or because being stuck in a small space is uncomfortable, the aisle seat is the prefered one.
When needing to get up several times, bathroom or just stretching your legs, you will find the aisle seat the easier one, specially when sitting next to a stranger or when your traveling companion is likely to sleep most of the time.
When sleeping, or trying to, in an overnight bus, the window seat allows for more positions to relax, including leaning against the window.
Sitting in the window seat you will less likely be disturbed by people walking past. 
And when in a bus/coach where not everybody is to be trusted, the window seat also gives less access to your things for people walking past.
The trade off is that you have less access to and less control over the items stored overhead. Left of right of the bus
If you want the best views out of the side windows of a bus, check where the best views will be.
Other considerations are where the sun will be, as sitting on the sunny side on a hot day and looking into the glare for most of the day will be less pleasant. This is made less important if the bus has coating on the windows and if it has good airconditioning. Not all buses are build the same, exceptions happen
If there is the option to reserve a seat before comming into the bus, remember not all buses are the same.
In some cases the aisle seat behind the driver is a good choice, if you can see out to the front of the bus. On many buses the view to the front is over the driver and the space for the feet is nice.
In some buses you have no forward view at all and less space for your feet.   My grandmother had a knee that she could not bend. She would request the seat next to the emergency exit as that would have enough space for her to sit. But in some cases the seat was not suitable and she had to change the request while getting into the bus the first time. She traveled bus tours for many years, with a company that made the people move to the next seat after every stop, so that all people got the better and the worse seats. She did get freedom from that moving, but it would not always get her a good seat. Double decker buses, up or down
If you want steady, not too much sway, top level of double decker bus is not good — the movements of the bus will be 3 to 10 times as strong on the higher floor.
Someone suffering from motion sickness should check whether they feel alright on the top floor of a bus. Not all sufferers will need to avoid top floors, and those who suffer in some buses might feel alright in others.   The views are better, specially those from the front seats. And often there are two sets of front seats available.   Extra tips for those who suffer from motion sickness
Watch what you are eating and drinking before and during the trip.
Avoid foods that make you want to burp, check whether you react badly on fatty foods, foods that make you fart (also on the day before a travel) and other foods that might upset the system.
(I would not believe it, but some people claim that drinking carbonated drinks to make you burp helps in not getting sick. Worth trying out if you suffer badly.)
There might be foodstuffs that help you fight attacks, like mints or boiled sweets you suck on. Talk with people in your family if there are more that suffer the sickness as well, as there are bound to be stories of what helps and what to avoid. If there is a vent for the airconditioning you can aim, have it at least at its lowest level and aimed just in front of your face, unless you want it fuller open and aimed differently of course.
When there are only fixed vents, you may want to chose your seat to have one near, as long as the air coming out smells nice.
Also, the seats behind and below the escape hatch when opened will have a better air quality than the average for the bus. For those of us who suffer badly, frequently or violently, warn the driver and ask for him to open the door, when safe to do so, on request.
Sometimes a flow of fresh air will calm down the urge, in other times being able to aim out of the bus will be much easier than using a bag.
And always carry a suitable container to accept more than one time of being sick, or a series of 'just big enough' ones. 
Best if they are easy to close safely and sturdy enough to withstand the liquid. Paper bags are OK as long as you can dispose of them soon after use.
Strong plastic bags will keep much longer. But smells coming out will not help you nor other people around, so close and keep closed unless needed. Most people suffering motion sickness can not read on a bus, some exceptions can read but can not stand being bored. So do test and it may turn that you can read.
Always take something that takes away boredom, like music or a spoken book on headphones, or use your brain to distract you, like dreaming up a story or doing your tables of multiplication."
Will my passport number change when I renew it?,"All biometric passports have serial numbers that change when issued. Per this notice from the Singaporean government, this is an ICAO requirement: https://www.ica.gov.sg/news_details.aspx?nid=12246 And since virtually all passports are now biometric, even those countries (like Singapore) that did not previously change numbers do so now. Update: Here's Document 9303-4 ""Specifications for Machine Readable Passports (MRPs) and other TD3 Size MRTDs"" direct from the ICAO Machine Readable Travel Documents Programme: Field 05/I (Mandatory) Passport Number  As given by the issuing State or organization to uniquely identify the
  document from all other MRTDs [machine readable travel documents] issued by the State or organization. ""Uniquely identify the document"" means that the number cannot be reused for other documents.  And of course it's only a ""recommendation"", because ICAO only sets standards and does not enforce them -- but if countries produce passports that don't follow the rules, they're not going to be accepted by other countries.  In particular, ICAO member states are supposed to ensure that non-MRP passports are no longer accepted after November 24, 2015. And a final nit: the standard above is technically for machine-readable passports, which is not quite the same thing as biometric passports, but the standard in question does document the rules of biometric passports, and all biometric passports are supposed to follow the rule above."
Host telling me to cancel my booking in exchange for a discount?,"Part of the host's contract with booking.com is that booking.com will take a commission fee of 10-25% out of each booking made through them. So if you cancel your booking.com reservation and pay the host directly, the host will get the full amount of your payment, instead of just 75-90% of it, and booking.com gets cut out of the deal.  The discount they're offering is a sort of kickback so that you get a piece of the savings also. However, this sort of thing is undoubtedly forbidden by the host's contract with booking.com, so basically they are asking you to help them defraud booking.com.  If booking.com finds out about this, they'll probably cancel the host's account, and maybe sue them if they've been doing it a lot.    I don't know whether you yourself would be at any legal risk as well, but it certainly doesn't seem like a very good idea to me."
Is the tap water in France safe to drink?,"Tap water (“eau du robinet”) is always safe to drink, unless you have a sign that says otherwise (“eau non potable” is the most common), which is often the case in public bathrooms for instance. Note that in most restaurants for instance, tap water is always an option (“une carafe d’eau”). Whether it’s actually “good” is mostly a matter of taste, and of course it will vary locally based on the origin of the water. Note that if you want to buy bottled water in any supermarket, a large bottle (usually 1.5l) is nearly always cheaper than a small one (way less than one euro for the former, always more than one for the latter), though the smaller ones may be sold refrigerated as well."
"Married in secret, can marital status in passport be changed at a later date?","TL;DR. Don't lie on your application. It is usually much easier to hide info from or convince your family than the government. He should tell the truth on the passport application and take measures to hide the original passport from his family (Show them a copy with spouse name blanked out maybe). Or on the other extreme, if that is not possible and he feels marriage must be concealed at all costs, he may consider putting off the process of obtaining passport till the time is right. There are multiple questions here and I'll try to answer the easiest ones first Can marital status be changed discreetly? No. Indian passports have spouse name in biodata page. If you declare your marital status, the last page of passport will have your spouse name. If your friend's family sees the passport, they will know the truth. Can marital status be changed? With what documents? Yes. If you need to change the status during application just mention it to the person on the counter. If you have a passport, apply for reissue of passport on account of change in personal particulars. In the past, a marriage certificate was required, but it seems this requirement has been done away with. It is possible officials may insist on the certificate. Be aware that if your friend mentions his status as single and later applies to re-issue passport with updated status, an observant officer may notice that date on the certificate is earlier than date of issue of existing passport and then fine him/stall his application on account of deception. Will mentioning wrong status be a problem for him? Yes. General advice given here is to not lie knowingly during application. Apart from the problem of explaining change in status in subsequent passport, your friend may face some uncomfortable questions from a foreign consulate if he plans for his wife to join him in a foreign country later. He will be required to disclose his marital status on most visa applications as well. If he lies there too and his lie is subsequently discovered, consequences can be severe. It may make it harder for them to obtain documentation for children later if they don't have spouse names on passport ( e.g. India requires (Q6 in the FAQ) both parents to be present for minor child's passport or copies of both parent's passport with spouse name added)."
How do you know if a Japanese person means no when they say yes?,"While saying ""No"" in Asia is generally different from other countries in western Europe, I made the experience that - depending on how well you know people and in which environment you are - it is much more difficult to find out what the actual situation is in Japan than let's say in China, Singapore etc. I experienced the biggest differences to the Japanese behavior in Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, India and Vietnam. And before people slam my answer (as before) as not being applicable for the weekend tourist trying to buy a train ticket, please remember that regular business travel to a country is STILL travel and ON topic here. I further consider extended explanations as important to better understand the cultural detail while maybe not all parts of the explanation are 100% usable during every days tourism in Japan. Saying ""No"" in general There are varying levels of issues here depending on your relationship to people (are you a tourist, a customer, a friend, a boss etc) where in general, as a foreigner, you might be treated with more politeness and therefore will have more issues detecting the ""No"". Confusingly, there might be exceptions when Japanese people tend to be more direct and/or forgiving with foreigners in a sort of ""He is a foreigner, he does not know better"" way (Henna Gai Jin). In general I have to say that your presence will be much more appreciated if you can avoid relying on the fact that you, as a foreigner, are seemingly less required to stick to Japanese customs. Please be aware that the more formal the environment is, the less you will hear a ""no"". In any formal conversation, a ""No"" is actually highly impolite. I have a Japanese-Japanese-English dictionary which actually tells people what to say (in Ja and Eng) in different situations in an office environment depending on what they think (in Ja). And in none of the sentences where ""What you think"" is along the lines of ""we cannot do that"" being actually translated as ""No"". The typical answers of decline are ""We have to study the situation"" or other evasive answers. Even the ""Shikata ga nai"" (""We cannot help it"") is extremely rare and normally used only when all are victims to a common adverse situation. Saying ""No"" is something that you will hear only from people who feel superior towards you (teachers, bosses, home-stay parents parents etc), in most direct but still relatively polite form being ""Ya"" (""No"") and much, much more seldom in the often too direct forms of ""Damé"" (Don't do that), ""Muri"" (Impossible) etc. Many Japanese people chuckle when they hear foreigners using one-word statements as above, but also positive ones such as ""Mochiron"" (Of course!) since that's not something heard very often. Situations where people want to decline but may not: First of all, we have to be aware that there are several types of ""No"" in any language: Here the 4 most important ones:  How to avoid the situation in the first place: In that context, there are several behaviors that make you get a better answer in the first place, since you offer the asked person a way out without them feeling obliged to say ""yes"" to something they actually do not want to say ""yes"" to: 1) Do not ask direct questions if possible. If you ask a question where the only answers can be ""yes"" or ""no"", you corner people. Rather ask them for possibilities or general statements. If you need to get to the station, instead of asking if someone can take you, ask them how to get there. If the other person wants to drive you, they will offer, otherwise recommend public transport. 2) Do not mention how much you love something. There is a high risk that people will try everything to get it for you. People might take a picture off their wall or take off their necktie and hand them to you if you start admiring something too much. If you want to make a compliment, rather praise their taste etc. 3) Discuss methods to get something done instead of asking people directly to do something. While this of course is more applicable in a business field, this behavior is the main reason for frustration between foreign companies working with their Japanese subsidiaries. This is a more widespread issue all over Asia, specially in Boss/Employee relationships. Once you know how difficult it is to get something done, you can make an assessment if you really want it done, instead of expecting the other person to you that something requires a lot of effort. Satisfying the boss is seen as more important than the own health in many cases, resulting in extreme cases in Karōshi. How to detect the situation There are several very clear vocal signs and body language from which you can deduce that someone is not able to fulfill whatever request: So here a couple of examples from my personal experience: You stand in the street and look for the closes subway station. You ask someone directly and get some of the above reactions. You see the person thinking, and wait for an answer. The person will eventually send you in whatever direction to get rid of you. Best would be to recognize the signs quickly, bow, say thanks and move on.  You look at someone's property (a necktie for example) and mention how much you like the bird pattern, since birds are your most loved animals and the color is so nice. The risk (unless the person cannot give it away for other reasons) is that he will take it off and give it to you. Better would be to briefly mention it and say the person is always so well dressed.  You are in a meeting in Japan and you have a telco with the headquartes the next day. You think it would be great to have a report from the Japanese team and ask them if they can send it to you so you can use it for that telco. You will receive it the next day and only later hear from another coworker that the team stayed overnight in the office to make the report for you. It would be better to ask if the report is available and if not, how much time it would take to make it. Then you can evaluate if their workload will be warranted for the benefit of the report."
Is it fair to buy a return ticket I know I will never use just because it's cheaper?,"You can do that. since one-way tickets are (almost) always more expensive. Booking a flexible return ticket will also be more expensive than the single ticket version, but you should look into it, since it should be cheaper than the double-return tickets in most cases. But you better make sure that you know where and how to buy a ticket in Hong Kong and how much it will cost you AND you need to make sure which countries require you to have a home ticket before they let you in. You will have to show return tickets on some immigration checkpoints or even airport check-ins. If you combine several stations and not have a valid return ticket, they will not let you travel.  Example: You fly to Hong Kong and stay there past the date of your intended ticket back home. You travel to Japan and then back to Hong Kong with the intention to buy a ticket back home in Hong Kong once you are there. At the check-in in Japan back to Hong Kong they will give you trouble already because you do not have a resident visa and you do not have an onwards trip booked. Due to this issue, you might be better off to buy a flexible ticket where you can change the flight back from the beginning. Unless you can determine from the beginning which countries you go to, where you will buy what ticket and where you need an ticket back home or one for an onwards flight, you will have difficulties planning the trip without running into problems. Or you book the flight back way past the intended return date - but close enough so that you are not indicating to an immigration officer that you will overstay your visa requirements. Then you just buy a new ticket to get back home instead of using your old one.  ** Some more info regarding flexible tickets ** You have to know that for each flight, there are several different tickets with different prices - even if you buy at the same time from the same airline. The price depends on the flexibility of changing the ticket. If you want the cheapest ticket, you can get those, but changes can be VERY Expensive, up to the price of a new ticket. If you want to be more flexible, you will need to pay more for the ticket, but it you will be able to change it for a smaller fee.  I can only recommend you to call a travel agent to help you understand your ticket options. Since most online ticket sales are geared to sell cheap tickets, those often cannot be changed."
Why are California freeway exits painted with disconnected shoulder lines?,"As already correctly pointed out here, the ""before exit"" line breaks are intended to visually warn drivers of upcoming exits in cases of heavy fog.  It is a drastic break that is intended to be noticeable. (More on this below) The ""after exit"" line breaks coincide with the end of the pavement between the exit ramp and the continuing highway.  This may not be intended as a visual signal for drivers as it is not drastic, nor called out as such in the documentation below - although, as @C.M. gives capable witness to in the comments, it still can serve that purpose to alert drivers. The documentation that I am referring to is the California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (CMUTCD).  In reading that, the after-exit line breaks seem to simply be a change in regulated spacing of lines for a traffic lane:  While there is still pavement to safely drive on to the right, space it at distance A.  Once there is no direct paved path to the exit anymore, space the lines at distance B, perhaps allowing space for safety rumble strips. Here is an image from the 2014 CMUTCD, page 662 (orange emphasis added):
 It shows that the ramp neutral (pavement) area should have (when viewed from the highway) reflective markers and then the white line.  After the neutral area, it reverts to the standard highway markings of ""Detail 27B"" (below) where the prescribed order is to have the white line exactly two inches from the edge of the drivable surface (2014 CMUTCD, page 658):
 Finally, you'll notice a reference in the notes of the preceding image to a flare in advance of an exit. This is the legal explanation for the ""before exit"" discontinuities. Here is that full diagram from the 2014 CMUTCD, page 708:
 Note 3 under the image states: A flared Right Edge Line 150 ft in advance of an exit ramp, is recommended where climatic conditions, such as areas that experience heavy fog, may require additional guidance. In areas that normally do not experience these conditions, a continuous edge line may be used. EDIT: I implied above that the placement of the white line after the exit was to allow room for the rumble strips - and while it generally seems so, it apparently is not strictly so... from the 2014 CMUTCD, page 818 - Section 3J.01.02: This Manual contains no provisions regarding the design and placement of longitudinal rumble strips. The provisions in this Manual address the use of markings in combination with a longitudinal rumble strip. And here is the relevant detail figure:
 Relevant text from the note in the image: Note: Edge line may be located alongside the rumble strip (Option A) or on the rumble strip (Option B)."
"If I visit Iran, is there a risk of not being allowed to enter the USA anymore?","The main consequence of having visited Iran before going to the U.S. is that you are no longer eligible to travel on the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). If you have travelled to or been present in Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, or Yemen on or after March 1, 2011, you will need to follow the regular process and apply for a visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. While not being able to travel on the VWP is a hassle, it is likely the only consequence. That you would not be able to visit the U.S. after Iran is improbable (given, of course, that there are no aggravating circumstances).

How many types of Pound Sterling are there and what is the relationship between them?,"Technically the only note that is valid legal tender in England and Wales are England and Welsh bank notes: Are Scottish & Northern Ireland banknotes ""legal tender""? In short ‘No’ these banknotes are not ""legal tender""; furthermore, Bank of
  England banknotes are only legal tender in England and Wales. Legal
  tender has, however, a very narrow technical meaning in relation to
  the settlement of debt. If a debtor pays in legal tender the exact
  amount he/she owes under the terms of a contract (and in accordance
  with its terms), or pays this amount into court, he/she has good
  defence in law if he/she is sued for non-payment of the debt. Practically though: In ordinary everyday transactions, the term ""legal tender"" in its
  purest sense need not govern a banknote's acceptability in
  transactions. The acceptability of a Scottish or Northern Ireland
  banknote as a means of payment is essentially a matter for agreement
  between the parties involved. If both parties are in agreement,
  Scottish and Northern Ireland banknotes can be used in England and
  Wales. Holders of genuine Scottish and Northern Ireland banknotes are
  provided with a level of protection similar to that provided to
  holders of Bank of England banknotes. This is because the issuing
  banks must back their banknote issue using a combination of Bank of
  England banknotes, UK coin and funds in an interest bearing bank
  account at the Bank of England. Source bank of england. So the person who refused your Scottish notes was within their rights. This though is not common.

Sterling notes come in the following forms: Bank of England notes Bank of Scotland notes Royal Bank of Scotland notes Clydesdale Bank notes Bank of Ireland notes First Trust Bank Danske Bank (confusingly) Ulster Bank The above notes should be ok in most countries accepting Sterling.

Scottish Banknotes are legal currency...Scottish Bank notes are not Legal Tender, not even in Scotland.  In
  fact, no banknote whatsoever (including Bank of England notes!)

Who was this persistent person at Shanghai airport?,"IKeelYou's answer is excellent for the general case, but I'd like to add some specifics, since you mention this is in China. This guy was trying to sell you transportation service. This is a very popular way for people with cars to make money, because just getting tags (i.e. current stickers, registration, license plates, etc.) is both expensive and difficult, easily costing ten to fifty thousand yuan, plus there are a limited number available. That's just tags, mind, so it's on top of the cost of the actual vehicle. Having a car in China is both very expensive and a significant status symbol. Technically, he's breaking the law by operating as an unlicensed taxi, but the reality in China is that nobody cares as long as nothing egregiously illegal happens.  Touts in China are aggressive, especially for something as completely fungible as a taxi ride, and especially to foreigners (I'm guessing you aren't ethnically Chinese or are somehow otherwise obviously not a local). Following a likely person (e.g. foreign, relatively wealthy) around to try to convince them to buy is extremely common. The idea is to pester you until you give in and pay for a ride just to shut them up. The best way to deal with them is to refuse to acknowledge them at all. Don't say anything to them, don't look at them, just act as if they don't exist and walk quickly past. If they are really insistent despite this, turn around and say ""No!"" loudly and firmly. Don't be afraid to put a bit of edge in your tone and assume an angry countenance; this will make it crystal clear that you really mean no. As opposed to being polite and friendly (""oh, that sounds nice, but no thanks""), which will be taken as a signal that they should work harder to convince you. Unlicensed taxis are quite common in China; there's nothing unseemly or shady about taking one, though they are less popular than official taxis with the locals, what with being technically illegal and all. However, it's definitely better to take a regular taxi if you're a tourist, have language difficulties, or are generally unfamiliar with the area. Not because they'll kidnap you or some such thing, but because you'll get taken for a ride metaphorically as well as literally; i.e. end up paying a hefty ""tourist tax"". Official cabs have meters and posted signs about the cost, so you know how much it should be (though that's not to say they don't have tricks they can pull to up the price), while prices in an unlicensed taxi are always negotiable (and usually higher than an official cab). Taking a proper cab also means you know the driver has a license, is more likely to know how to get where you want to go, and has at least some skill operating the vehicle. On the other hand, the illegal taxis are much easier to hail and will operate at hours when regular taxis won't. So if you really want a ride right at that moment..."
What citizenship/place of birth would a child born on an airplane have?,"According to the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, Article 3: For the purpose of assigning nationality, birth on a ship or aircraft
  shall amount to birth in the territory of the State that gives its
  flag to that ship or aircraft. However, only about 40 nations (not including the USA) have ratified this convention - and what territory a birth has occurred on is not necessarily what determines citizenship. So in reality, it's a huge mess between: In theory, you may have cases where none of the countries involved would grant the baby citizenship, or where two (or even three) would grant it automatic and exclusive citizenship. In practice, I suspect that in almost all cases at least one of them would grant citizenship, and it's up to the mother which one she applies for - and up to the bureaucrats how difficult that is. A separate question is what the ""place of birth"" on the birth certificate will say - I suspect that's up to the discretion of said bureaucrats, since it will have little importance in most cases. Update:
I recently found an article that has a real-world example. It pretty much agrees with what I wrote, namely the person portrayed got her mother's UK citizenship with a passport note saying ""Holder born on an aeroplane 10 miles south of Mayfield, Sussex."", which later had to be changed to ""born at sea"" to comply with an EU directive. US State Department rules, on the other hand, would list the place of birth as ""in the air""."
"Why is this bathroom symbol in Germany ""00""?","According to the legend this tradition was started by hotels in the 19th century. Unlike today there was a single bathroom for a whole floor. This room was at the beginning of the hallway and not a real guest room. Hoteliers therefore used the room number ""00"". Other common explanations include the shape of an opened toilet seat but as far as I know that question has not been finally settled yet. The hotel explanation seems like the most likely one."

2.1. The lighting must be uniform with no shadows or reflections on the face, eye-glasses or in the background.
2.2. The subject’s eyes must not show red eye.
2.3. The photograph must have appropriate brightness and contrast.
2.4. Where the picture is in colour, the lighting, and photographic process must be colour balanced to render skin tones faithfully. Submission of Portrait to the Issuing Authority
Where the portrait is supplied to the Issuing Authority in the form of a print, the photograph, whether produced using conventional photographic or digital techniques, should be on good or photo-quality paper. Compliance with International Standards
4.1. The photograph shall comply with the appropriate definitions set out in ISO/IEC 1974 – 5. The last of the points above is probably the most important as far as ""why"" - ISO/IEC 19794 defines standards for Biometric data interchange formats, with part 5 specifically being Face image data. According to the ISO/IEC 19794 documents: To enable many applications on variety of devices, including devices
that have the limited resources required for data storage, and to
improve face recognition accuracy, this part of ISO/IEC 19794
specifies not only a data format, but also scene constraints
(lighting, pose, expression, etc.), photographic properties
(positioning, camera focus, etc.), digital image attributes (image
resolution, image size, etc.)."
Leaving my passport at the embassy to receive a visa but it is my only identification document,"Official advice is that you should carry your titre de séjour with you at all times but it is not a criminal offense not to have it (you cannot be punished for that, not even by a fine). The police does however have the right to keep you for up to 16 hours to ascertain who you are and whether you have the right to be in France (which you have, as you hold a valid long-stay visa, even if you are unable to present it). That would obviously be a major inconvenience and is the main risk in your situation. Realistically, a check is not particularly likely but possible, and having copies of your passport and some receipt of your visa application should help. While the police could make your life unpleasant for a few hours if they really want to, the only purpose of this procedure is to give them time to obtain a removal decision against people staying illegally. So if you can convince them it's not your case or the préfecture can confirm they have a record of your visa, there is no point in keeping you any longer. In the unlikely event that it comes that far, note that you have a number of rights while the police is holding you to check your status: You can ask to see a lawyer, a physician, an interpreter (if you do not speak French) and request that a friend or member of your family (only one person, though) and your consulate be informed of your situation (these rules are specific to the 16-hour vérification du droit au séjour but do not apply to the four-hour verification after a regular identity check, which is a distinct procedure, even though the latter can lead to the former). Additionally, you should not be restrained unless you behave dangerously or uncooperatively and you should not be mixed with people who are suspected of a crime (garde à vue). At the end of the investigation, the police officer in charge will write a report (procès-verbal), which you do not have to sign if you don't agree."

Why don't airlines have backup planes just in case of an emergency?,"Many airlines have one or two spare planes parked somewhere to prepare for unexpected technical issues. The more flights you have, the more likely there will be one aircraft stuck on the ground. Airlines and aircraft manufacturers call this Dispatch Rate. It is the rate which measures how often a flight is delayed or cancelled due to technical problems of the aircraft. Yes, it is. But one also has to take into account the opposite: not having a spare plane. It is not really a problem if the flight is only partly booked. It is really a problem if it's holiday season - every flight is nearly full, and annoyed passengers hate waiting for any minute longer. You either schedule the delayed passengers to a much later flight, which almost guarantees anger and negatively impacts the airline's image, or you move them to the next flight, then move those in the next flight to the second next flight, causing a cascade delay. Neither is satisfactory. Not to mention, pilots and flight attendants need to be scheduled as well. There is only a limited time slot which a pilot is legally allowed to fly before the company must relieve the pilot from duty. If the crew is forced to stay, the accommodation cost is paid by the company. The company also has to find another crew to replace them as well. Needless to say, this gets costly very soon. Obviously, if the company only has one aircraft, then the opportunity cost of the wasted spare plane is really high, since the fleet utilization is only 50%. Now, if the company has 100 aircraft, then the chance of at least one of those planes having a technical issue today is higher. If we assume a dispatch rate of 99%, we can expect one aircraft to be stuck on the ground, so we can keep a spare plane, making the total fleet size 101 planes: 100 scheduled planes plus 1 extra plane. You don't keep one spare plane for every flight. You keep one for the entire fleet. One advantage of booking with a large airline is that they have spare planes around. If there is a technical delay, the delay is usually shorter, since the airline can easily rotate its aircraft with only minor impact to its schedule. If it is a small airline, say with only 7 planes, and all 7 are dispatched on routes, the company has no choice but to wait until maintenance is completed. For example, SouthWest has ~700 planes; they're all even of the same model. This allows the airline to rotate a flight to a different plane without re-assigning the flight crew and without re-seating everyone in the cabin. The major hub is where the airline is based. It is where most of its flight crews are based, and where major maintenance work is carried out. Maintenance tasks are not fixed in duration- some finish early, some late. Therefore, airlines do allow some flexibility in maintenance schedules. This flexibility can be utilized to resolve unexpected delays. On the contrary, it does not make much sense to station an extra plane at a remote destination. Some destinations may not even be equipped to service that type of aircraft. If a plane breaks down far away, the only choices are to fix it asap, or fly in an empty plane to get the passengers out. These are referred to ferry flights by pilots, and they are not uncommon."
Can I travel back to my homeland after being granted German refugee status?,"If you are a refugee, as defined by the UN convention, then no, you can't return to your home country without losing your refugee status. After all, the fact that you dare to return means that 1) the situation in your country has improved so giving you refugee status isn't necessary anymore, or 2) you lied to authorities in the first place to get refugee status. However, there are many people who come to Germany as refugees, are not granted refugee status (as per UN convention), but are still allowed to stay for some time (""Duldung""). Reasons for this may be If you have one of these, there might be a chance you can return after visiting your home country.  Also, there are cases when refugees returned to their home country for a short while, and did not lose their refugee status. This article http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/fluechtlinge-machen-urlaub-in-heimatlaendern-was-an-der-meldung-falsch-ist-a-1163448.html from Aug 18, 2017 cites the BAMF (Bundesamt für Flüchtlinge, federal office for refugees) with  Anders als Asylbewerber, deren Verfahren noch nicht abgeschlossen sind, dürfen anerkannte Asylberechtigte, Flüchtlinge oder subsidiär Schutzberechtigte nach europäischem Recht mit diesem Aufenthaltstitel auch Auslandsreisen unternehmen. Reisen in den Verfolgerstaat seien kein Erlöschensgrund, könnten nur im Einzelfall zur Aberkennung des Schutzstatus führen. in English (translation mine) In contrast to refugee candidates, whose proceedings have not ended, accepted [refugees] according to EU laws are allowed to travel abroad. Trips to the originating country are not a reason to cancel [the status], and can only lead to revoking the protection status in special cases. The article also says that things depend on the reason of the trip, going for a holiday is a lot more problematic than visiting a terminally ill relative. So, if you have an important, urgent reason to travel home, you might be able to do so without losing your status. But check with an immigration lawyer first, and do not, under any circumstances, try to cheat the system; you'll be in a lot more trouble in case you're found out. And since authorities are closely watching potential ISIS supporters visiting middle eastern countries, it's almost impossible not to be found out.  Also, with the current political situation (right wing AFD gaining 15% in the elections, mostly by being anti-refugee), the government just can't afford any ""I had a great time in my home country, now returned to enjoy German social security"" reports. So don't expect any leniency from authorities. A good starting point to get legal advice seems to be https://www.proasyl.de/asylberatung/ (I am not affiliated with them in any way) - they give free advice, help with finding a lawyer, and if you need a lawyer but can't pay for one, may provide financial support, backed by donations. They will advice you by phone as well as email, and they speak English as well as German. Googling for ""flüchtlingshilfe rechtsberatung"" will provide many other helpful links as well."
Is there a reason for heavy doors in hotels? [closed],"They're fire doors.  They have a fire rating, that describes how long they can survive a fire burning on either side of them.  This fire rating means a fire in a room will give safe passage in the hallway outside for a significant period of time (perhaps an hour or more), or allow a fire to rage outside in the corridor while people in the room have a period of safety.  They are required by fire codes in various countries. Similarly, larger apartment buildings in many countries have similar fire code requirements. You'll notice doors on stairways and in other locations have similar traits, and for the same reasons.  These doors must always be closed, or must have some sort of automatic mechanism that will close them automatically in the event that a fire alarm is triggered."
Is it prohibited to lie down (and fall asleep) on a commercial flight?,"This is not prohibited. Technically, you should do it while wearing your seat belt, but I've never seen this enforced except during takeoff and landing, or during turbulence. Last year I was on a Delta flight from Atlanta to London during a severe winter storm, in which almost all passengers missed their flight (due to cancelled inbound flights, or road conditions in Atlanta).  Because of the high number of cancellations, nearly every passenger (there were fewer than 50 of us) aboard the 767 had a row to themselves, and the flight crew encouraged us all to lay down and sleep."
How do I know whether an airline seat upgrade at gate was free?,"It'd be fairly unlikely that they don't quote the price to you.  Here's your ticket (whispers to themselves, that's $10,000).  If no monetary value was quoted to you, it was free.  If not, you've got a fight on your hands and a potential PR problem for the airline. You could always call the airline before HR and ask them what class of ticket you received, and the cost of the ticket? If the cost has remained in economy levels, you'll have an idea.  Quote the PNR (6 digit confirmation code) and your name/seat numbers, they should be able to find it."

Which countries can punish you for doing drugs elsewhere? [closed],"As an avid watcher of Border Security, I can tell you that when cocaine or other illegal drugs are detected by a swab (I never saw any swabbing for pot), this gives them a good reason to search the heck out of your bags, but if you aren't carrying, that's an end to it. I saw this at the US border, Canadian border, and Australian border. The Canadian border officers repeatedly said ""we don't care what you do on your own time, just what you're bringing in, were you around people doing x?"" but I did notice that saying ""yes, I was"" didn't stop the search or actually seem to be of any benefit to the traveler, except perhaps establishing them as honest and co-operative. At the land border, smelling pot on a person or their possessions definitely led to thorough searching of vehicles. So for a lot of countries, the ""answers"" in the comments above are generally true: as long as you're not carrying, they won't care that you used it before you arrived. (Side note: the lack of caring is not related to whether or not it's legal where you used it. Border officers are famous for not caring AT ALL about the laws elsewhere, only in their jurisdiction.) However, this is not a general rule. Singapore can (and apparently does) do drug tests on arrival and arrest people based on blood levels. “Any Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident found to have abused controlled drugs overseas will be treated as if he/she had abused drugs in Singapore,” the statement read. “CNB conducts enforcement checks at Singapore’s checkpoints and will take action against those found to have consumed drugs overseas.” - Singapore Central Narcotics Bureau (The government of Canada later added that they feel this applies to foreigners also.) Also from that article, since you asked about a quarantine period: According to the Mayo Clinic, cannabis can be detected in urine three days after use for an occasional user (three times a week), 10 to 15 days for a daily user, or more than 30 days for a heavy chronic user (multiple times a day). For a blood test, it is typically detectable for one to two days, but can increase with more use, and saliva testing it is detectable for one to three days for occasional users. That number rises to 29 days for heavy users, according to Heathline. Most of the articles I found about this included phrases like ""the most serious anti drug policies in the world"" or ""famously strict drug policies"" so don't assume Singapore is typical. There might not be any other countries doing it. But -- there might. Also, back in your own country, if there are drug tests related to employment, child custody, security clearances or whatnot, nobody is going to care ""but it was legal where I was!"" If it is illegal where they are testing, there will be consequences for testing positive even if you didn't break any laws."
Too many countries to apply for Indian E-Visa?,"I've run into the same problem a few years ago (but at least got halfway the alphabet), searched around the internet and couldn't find a definitive answer to the question. Which is probably why you are asking as well. I resorted to listing a selection of countries using as strategy: When I was searching around for a definitive answer, I observed two things: Which leads me to conclude that you probably shouldn't overthink it. But a definitive answer from official source would be nice, and I'm sure you will not accept anything less as the correct answer."
Tipping for takeout food in the USA,"No. You don't tip unless it's a delivery charge. For example, if you order takeout food and have them deliver (especially common in hotels), then you'd want to tip the driver.  From Wikipedia: Tips are also generally given for services provided in golf courses,
  casino, hotels, concierge, food delivery, taxis, spa and salons. If you're going to the restaraunt or venue to pick up food, then you don't need to leave a tip. From Wikipedia: Tipping is not required for fast food restaurants, take-out orders,
  and coffee houses."
Do celebrities require work visas for every country they visit?,"If you're a celebrity organizing a world tour you are guaranteed to have dozens of crew members or partners resolving various issues with logistics in every country. Remember that visas aren't the only barrier - you need legal contracts, booked venues, insurance, transportation, backup plans if something goes wrong, advertising, security, accommodation, etc. And not only would the celebrity in question need a visa to travel, but also everyone else in the crew as they're essentially short term employees in a foreign country. So the answer is yes, even big time celebrities need a visa (or an equivalent, such as an EU passport for EU countries) for every country where they perform. But no, that's not a big deal for them. And keep in mind that celebrities can be refused a visa as well, just like normal people: British authorities denied rapper Snoop Dogg a visa for a series of planned concerts, publicists for his tour said in a statement Saturday. A spokeswoman for the Home Office said she couldn't comment on an individual case, but did point out that foreign citizens could be barred from entering the country if there were concerns about their presence."
"Is it possible to insist on having your ID checked at the police station, not in the street in Austria?","Yes, for every problem with the police, you can insist to do it at the station. (except some pretty much impossible situations where any delay brings harm to people etc., but at the same time checking your ID is more important than helping them ... this won't happen to you) But I wouldn't choose this as first option automatically.
Normally trivial things like showing your ID might extend to several hours (with a bit of bad luck).
Getting a car to get you to the next station, waiting there if something is more important, doing the full course of bureaucracy, (maybe) getting an additional questioning and a call to your hotel etc.etc. (depending on the mood), paying a fee for the additional effort (it's not because they don't like this behaviour, they have to collect it for certain things), and being released in front of the station again instead where they met you first...
If you insist on the station, make sure they know that you have everything necessary but don't trust them, instead of being here illegally.   Easier would be to ask for their ID first. They are obliged (too) to show it on request, and to show it long enough that you can read it carefully. Scammers usually show you something not withstanding closer inspection, so they don't want you to look carefully, So even if you don't understand German, look at it. If looks like eg. a drivers license (which has the english words ""drivers license"" on it too), it's clearly wrong. ... I didn't find a good image of the real thing, this has to do. On the backside, there is more information like the name etc.
Additionally, if they are uniformed but without weapon clearly visible on the belt, it's a fake (happens often enough to mention it).   If they refuse to show their ID and/or to take you to a station (real refusing, not just a ""is this really necessary"" - thing first), call 133 and get some more authentic ones.
If they show some authentic looking ID but you still have major doubts for some reason, call too and tell them the number of the ID (together with location and what they're doing) to check it. But, the most important thing: Don't worry.
It's not like there are thousands of such scammers waiting for clueless tourists. And real, non-uniformed policemen checking IDs is not as common as some media are telling.  "
"What's an easy way of making my luggage unique, so that it's easy to spot on the luggage carousel?","This technique is very widely used in Vietnam to distinguish the millions of scooters everybody rides, which are in a range of a dozen or so makes and models so every parking area would have a few just like yours. Such is the demand for disambiguating decoration that there are ""Dán Keo"" shops and curbside vendors almost on every corner! The exact same principles apply to confusable luggage as to confusable bikes. The materials may differ. It's surely a lot easier to decorate a piece of luggage than the complicated curvy surfaces of a scooter.

Is a 13-hour layover in the middle of the night enough time to go see Buckingham Palace?,"As you've got to make the journey between airports anyway, I say make the most of it.  Sleep on the plane if you can and see the city at night.  I'd pack in one backpack (hand luggage strapped on top) and do it on foot, but taxi/bus/night tube (Friday and Saturday) are other options. The last tube train from Heathrow is at 23:35 (T4) or 23:42 (T5), a few minutes later for T123.  So you should have plenty of time to clear immigration, retrieve your luggage and get the tube.  There's also the TFL line train but that goes to Paddington station which is 3 km from Buckingham Palace).  You can check for planned/emergency issues online at Transport for London's website. If you get the tube, you can go to Hyde Park Corner, less than 1 km away from the Palace. In the morning I used to quite often get an early train out of London Bridge to Gatwick.  Currently that looks to be 05:35, getting in at 06:04.  That should be plenty early enough for most flights but you'd need to check. Assuming you're happy to walk through the night you can see a lot of London. Here's a quick 10 km route suggestion I threw together.  It takes in Buckingham Palace, Parliament Square (but not Big Ben/Elizabeth Tower which is being repaired), the Embankment, Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden, the Strand (you could night-bus this bit), St Paul's Cathedral, the Tower of London and Tower Bridge. Here's a picture in case I carelessly delete the route
 Night buses from Trafalgar square will get you to many places but they're not very frequent.  I've deliberately omitted airport buses in the interest of maximising your time in London.  The tube and regional trains aren't all that expensive, and are much quicker; they're also less much affected by traffic, though there are rare delays in the middle of the night. An alternative is to cycle all or part of the route - at least if you have a fairly small backpack.  There are several bike hire schemes in London.  The official (Santander-sponsored) scheme is well regarded.  It has its own sightseeing loop suggestions.  I rode a route similar to the walking route I suggest above yesterday (as part of a much longer ride). The most significant difference was probably to make good use of the Embankment cycle path.  Cycling in London, at least in my limited weekend experience, compares favourably to many UK cities."
Is there a way to tell in which direction a London Tube train will pass the station platform?,"For the most part, tube trains travel on the left. So, if you have a reference to the other platform, you can deduce in which direction the train will be travelling. On a few of the older cut-and-cover lines, we have two tracks running down the middle with platforms on either side (i.e., you can look across the tracks and see the other platform). For example, this is true at Monument, Sloane Square, Fulham Broadway, Cannon Street and many other stations on the Circle/District lines. Here the trains travel on the left. At smaller, newer stations where there is only one line, the platforms are usually in the middle of the two tracks. Sometimes there is a single ""island"" platform (e.g., South Kensington) but on the deeper lines the platforms are separated, in their own tunnels: either way, the principle still holds. Again the trains travel on the left, so you can use this to infer the front of the train. At big stations where many lines intersect, it is harder to follow the principle; sometimes the trains switch sides or the platforms are optimized for connections between different lines. A close look at the actual track and platform arrangements illustrates these patterns as well as some of the notable exceptions:  General rules: As a result, deep tube trains generally run to your right as you stand on the platform facing the tracks, while sub-surface trains run to your left. Exceptions: As a result, deep tube trains sometimes run to your left (Bakerloo at Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Circus, and Embankment; eastbound Central trains at St. Paul's) and sub-surface trains sometimes run to your right (westbound Circle and District lines at Mansion House; Northern line at Bank and London Bridge). At the platform you may be able to spot the the clear (""go"") signal lights (white for deep lines, green for all other lines) located at the driver's end of the platform. This is probably only going to be illuminated when the train is already there, of course, but you may be able to see the light regardless. In the end, once you do a journey quite often you will automatically find yourself going to the most optimal part of the train and it becomes second nature. If you are only doing it once, it probably is not so important."
"How should I ask for a ""pint"" in countries that use metric?","Just ask for ""a beer"". I don't think you'll find a completely universal approach that fits all cultures perfectly. However, in the continental beer cultures I'm the most familiar with (Dutch, German, Czech, Austrian, …), there's typically one dominant ""size"" of a beer that everyone gets. What exactly that means differs a lot by country or region. Asking for ""a beer"" in Prague will get you half a liter, while doing the same in Düsseldorf will only yield a ridiculously tiny glass. Apart from that, ""large beer""/""small beer"" seems to be the usual way to distinguish between different sizes. But again, what is a ""small beer"" in Czechia can often be a ""large beer"" in the Netherlands."
Leaving major cities during COVID-19 pandemic,"Travel of this sort is either permitted or it's not. If there are restrictions on travel in your area you should follow them. If there are not then it's allowed. For example, if you were in Italy or France on this day (March 21 2020) then such travel would be forbidden - it's not essential travel. As I understand it there are no restrictions on internal travel in the US - but that's the situation today and it could be different tomorrow. You should also listen to the advice of medical professional about what is discouraged. Anything you do that increases contact increases the chance of spreading Covid-19 is going to make the overall situation worse - and most kinds of travel will result in increased contact. If your medical professionals are asking you not to travel unnecessarily, don't do it."
Can a hotel cancel a confirmed reservation?,"Can a hotel cancel a confirmed reservation? Yes. The best you can do is report to booking.com and hope they get them to honor the original amount. This behavior is unfair however hotels and airlines sometimes post wrong fares. When they discover it, the decent ones honor the wrong fares.  Cathay Pacific error sees $16,000 flights sold for $675  Thanks to a glitch, $16,000 first-class seats sold for $675. Errors
  like these are more common than you’d think. The airline quickly addressed the problem but agreed to honor the
  heavily discounted fares. However many times the organizations that don’t care about customer service refuse to honor the fare. You don’t have much recourse because you’re not going to file a lawsuit about it, neither can you force them to give you a room when you arrive there. "
Tipping in Denmark,"That's easy: Tipping simply doesn't happen in Denmark. All of the places you list have posted prices that include all applicable taxes and enough profit to pay the entire staff full wages. (One example: It is common for credit-card terminals in taxis to allow you to enter a tip amount before you key in your PIN. However 19 times out of 20 the driver will push the ""cancel tip"" button himself before he even gives you the keypad. Some drivers may opportunistically hope for tips from passengers who're obviously tourists and may not be aware of local customs, but it's neither normal nor expected)."
Can I wear a bulletproof vest while traveling on British Airways from Heathrow?,"Short answer: Yes, it appears you can, I wouldn't.  Longer answer. I certainly can't find anything that would prevent you from doing so, there's similar threads over on FlyerTalk and Yahoo! Answers where people come to the same conclusion. Additionally there's at least one case of it actually happening.  However, as noted it those threads and the comments, you're going to attract a lot of attention during security where you will have to remove it. Just having a vest may not be that unusual but actually wearing one through security is almost certainly going to get you pulled over for additional screening and questions.  If you opt to put it on after security or on the plane itself I can see a few problems. One, although I've never worn one, I can't imagine they're the most comfortable things to wear and that doesn't sound like a recipe for a pleasant flight. Secondly, if it's obvious it may concern other passengers and the airline would be within their rights to ask you not to wear it. Finally, I'm assuming these are reasonably bulky and it may actually cause you problems in an emergency situation, another reason the flight crew may ask you to remove it. I know we have a lot of airline staff that post here so maybe one of them can come along and say how they'd react.  You say:  It makes sense to wear it in case someone try to hijack the plane. No, it really doesn't. The chance of a hijack attempt is astonishingly unlikely (and even less likely for hijackers to have firearms). Even if it did happen is a vest going to help much? Either the hijackers plan to land and ransom the plane, in which case it generally makes sense to not shoot the passengers. Or they plan to crash the plane in which case a vest is not going to help much. Or the shooting ruptures something causing the plane to depressurize and crash anyway.  And, in the extremely mindbogglingly unlikely case that someone starts shooting on a plane you'll most likely to be sitting down and your head will be more likely to be in the firing line ... unless you're planning to engage with the hijackers which is a bad idea and is probably just going to get you beaten up or worse.  Assuming this is a normal commercial flight then it will be as safe as any other until it lands and the passengers are off-loaded, otherwise it wouldn't be flying. If you're really worried about your destination I would choose to put on the vest after landing before leaving the airport but I can think of few places that this would be necessary that would also have normal flights still running to them.  Note, my advice might be different if your fear is based on a direct threat to you personally (i.e. because of who you are or what you do) rather than just a generically dangerous destination. But in that case you should probably be engaged with private security and asking them these questions. "
"Recently naturalized American visiting the UK, previously denied visa. Apply for entry clearance?","To answer my question myself after my experience from two subsequent visits: Is this better than applying for entry clearance ahead of time,

I just got released from detention at Heathrow after being held for Six hours. The whole ordeal was a nightmare which was one missed phone call away from ending disastrously. Ultimately I chose to fly in directly to the UK from the USA, abandoning the entry via Calais in France. I landed at 7:30 AM and after a couple of questions from the clearing officer (including have you ever had any problems with immigration anywhere which I answered honestly with a yes including recounting my first refusal 19 years ago), I was promptly perp walked to a cordoned off area in the immigration control hall in full view of arriving passengers. After stewing for about twenty minutes, the I/O came over, asked me a couple more questions and took the number of my friend I am visiting. Unfortunately my friend was at work and did not pick up the call after two tries (I believe this was a major cause of my ordeal). I was marched over to the fingerprinting room and my mugshot and fingerprints taken, then returned to the cordoned off area. I sat there about another hour before another I/O came for me and escorted me to the detention room, confiscated all my electronic equipment and belongings etc and locked me up. I remained there for another two hours before two different I/O's came for me, asked me to get my bags and went through the bags in detail and inventoried everything. Back again to the detention room for another hour, then one of the I/O's came for me to an interview room. I was interviewed for about thirty minutes with all kinds of probing questions. Fortunately I had a printout of all documents required for a visa interview and remembered the advice here to be exceedingly polite. After the interview the I/O said he was going to his Chief Immigration Officer to make a final decision. I asked him how is it looking and he said he couldn't give me an answer, then relented a bit and said don't worry too much, I will be back with the decision. I was returned to the detention center and I started thinking about how to request temporary admission. After another thirty minutes he came back and said, I have good news for you. We finally reached your host/friend and your answers all tallied with his except a couple minor discrepancies. We have thus decided to land you. I thanked him for his professionalism throughout the ordeal (the second I/O had been yelling at an Iraqi girl who was also in detention for not having a transit visa while enroute to Canada, making her burst into tears, she had been held from the previous day and was going to be there another day or more while the storm in the East USA cleared) and was on my way.  Attempting a visa free entry is asking for unnecessary trouble and rolling dice stacked against you. Heed Gayot Fow's advise from the answer below and get entry clearance before traveling. DOCUMENTS I CARRIED ALONG I had the original visa refusal letter from 2015, three months of current bank statements from each of my three checking accounts plus brokerage account , three months of mortgage statements, signed invitation letter, marriage certificate, return ticket, CASH plus credit cards (they did say they prefer debit card to credit card because it's access to your own money and not a loan unlike a credit card), previous international hotel stays spanning the time from my previous refusal to now. DETENTION CENTRE The detention centre was not pleasant although it was clean and big enough. There was a television and books We were not segregated by sex, so we had both males and females in there.One man was sleeping and snoring like a locomotive and disturbing everyone and he clearly had not taken a bath in a few days. I confess I could be viewed as another crazy since I couldn't sit still and was milling around trying to do tai chi, shadow boxing, and talking to myself etc to keep my mind off my predicament. The female guard did comment later that I talk to myself a lot. Another woman was on the only allowed public phone for about three straight hours preventing other detainees(including myself) from receiving vital incoming phone calls. There were two mattresses on the floor I guess for long term detainees. You get a drink and a bun and you're told you could be held there anywhere from 15 minutes to 24 hours without a specific time. Basically, you don't want to be there UPDATE 2 - July 8 2017 Visit Followup visit after first visit in March. Today at Belfast airport I was detained for about twenty minutes while the border officer left her terminal at the primary control point (PCP) and went to review my profile/files at the secure control point. My trip today was once again as a non-visa national without obtaining advance entry clearance. I was asked the standard what are you visiting for, how long are you staying, and then have you ever had any problem with UK immigration after which she took my passport and issued me with the form IS 81, asked me to take a seat, and went off into their offices. After the officer returned, she apologized for holding me up and explained it was because of my entry clearance refusal back in 2015. Without request, she went on to say she would request the stop indicator flag on my profile be removed. There was no interview except the initial questions and they also did not ask for any documents.  My experience makes me believe unless I somehow get the stop flag removed, subsequent visits will be always involve relatively short detentions while they check their system. UPDATE 3 - July 3 2018 Visit Experience was like second visit in Belfast. Detained for about fifteen minutes. Officer went to check record at secondary control point, came back and let me go after an apology and said he had also recommended Home Office remove the stop flag on my name however I am not counting my chicks on that. UPDATE - March 3 2019 Visit I was just admitted into the UK for the first time today after my complaint to UK Border Force last year. I spent the standard one minute on my landing interview at immigration control like most other travelers. This confirms that the flag on my profile has indeed been removed and eliminates any future mal-effects stemming from my original entry clearance refusal. UPDATE - November 2019 Visit Successfully used e-gate after it was expanded to American citizens and citizens of other Five Eyes countries."
Where is this photo of a group of hikers taken? Is it really in the Ural?,"I dug around in the photos posted by that same photographer on Shutterstock, and found this landscape image.  The peak in the landscape appears to be the same peak as in the photo of the hikers.  In the images below, I've circled five of the features that I'm basing this on. 
 The distinctive snow-capped peak in the landscape photo is obscured by cloud in the photo of the hikers.  Note also that the clouds in the photo of the hikers cast shadows that make parts of the mountain terrain appear to have different colors than they do in the full-sun landscape photo. The landscape photo is captioned by the photographer as Upper Svaneti, Georgia in the Caucasus Mountains. This photo, again by the same photographer, shows the same mountain peak and is captioned Ushba.  The Caucasus Mountains are not in the Ural Mountains (or vice versa.)"

Where in the world can you tour a live nuclear reactor?,"You can do that in Switzerland: Something else along the same lines is the ZWILAG, the temporary storage for radioactive waste. I visited that one and it was quite interesting."
What are the best ways to avoid data roaming fees when travelling abroad?,"My personal experience has been that it's best to get a SIM card for each country I travel in. Local providers almost always have the best deals, and buying SIM cards is relatively inexpensive.  Especially in Asian countries (where I have more travel experience) you can easily pick up SIM cards at shopping kiosks almost anywhere, and the rates are really very cheap compared to where I live (New Zealand). Data roaming from international providers is also very expensive; as an example with my New Zealand cellphone provider in China I would pay $US25+ a megabyte, whereas buying a local SIM card it cost me $US8 for 250 megabytes."
Is it culturally acceptable for an American to visit the memorials in Hiroshima and Nagasaki?,"Here's an excerpt from Wikitravel: Although many visitors, especially Americans, may feel apprehensive about visiting Hiroshima, it is a friendly, welcoming city, with as much interest in Western culture as anywhere else in Japan. Tourists are welcomed, and exhibits related to the atomic bomb are not concerned with blame or accusations. Bear in mind, though, that many hibakusha [the survivors] still live in the city, and even most of the young people in Hiroshima have family members who lived through the blast. As such, the average Hiroshima resident isn't likely to relish talking about it, although you needn't shy away from the topic if one of the chatty fellows around the Peace Park brings it up. Despite this and @MeNoTalk's comment, another interesting story by Kate Berardo on Culturosity.com demonstrates that you can't be certain that no one will care or direct resentment toward you, but the circumstances of the story suggest it may have been a little bit of bad timing and luck on the author's part. Besides, it was really just a few angry words with a sidelong glance; nothing an American traveling abroad shouldn't be prepared for almost regardless of where one chooses to go. Regardless of what some others might think, my opinion as an American FWIW: if you want to go to learn about the consequences of the bombings, go with an open mind and sympathetic attitude – I will if I'm ever lucky enough to get the chance. There is a museum in Hiroshima dedicated to memorializing the victims and promoting peace. One of their English newsletters describes a visit from American students positively, demonstrating a welcoming reception by the museum staff and local students. If you want to visit Hiroshima to appreciate the rest of the city as well, more power to you. It certainly has much more to offer than war history. I'm sure the same is true of Nagasaki. I would only advise against going with an attitude like this guy's; I suspect few will be particularly eager to hear contentious opinions about the bombings from an American perspective (especially not an ignorant one). Make your mission one of learning and receptivity to the local culture and perspectives, not one of ""truthiness"" or ""keeping it real"", and you should be fine. You've already got the right kind of attitude in asking open-mindedly and cautiously about how your presence might impact others; keep it up, and go in peace kimosabe. [BTW, I would welcome any general counterarguments from the community. I'm not sure I'm the right guy to answer, having never gone.]"
Canadian living in Dubai - visiting US to see ill parent. Visa Off has put a 3 mnth ban from entering. Can I appeal? Should I apply for a visa,"Did he give you any paperwork about a ban? Quoting which section of USA immigration law? If he didn’t (which he likely couldn’t because it doesn’t exist) then there’s no ban. For all intents and purposes he was grouchy and was just blowing hot air and lecturing you how to live your life. Ignore him.  Immigration officers are vested with the power to deny you entry and the bans which follow (typically 5 years for Expedited Removal) are by law (and in the law books), not arbitrary. There’s nowhere I have seen that an immigration officer can just ban you for a period of time determined by him. This is a country of laws (at least most of the time). On subsequent trips have all your documentation printed out showing your strong ties (which you mentioned) to your home country. You don’t need a visa for anything. Unlike UK visas, USA visas only give you the opportunity to present yourself at the border/airport for admission to the country. You’re able to satisfy that with your Canadian passport. A great suggestion by Phoog is to if possible fly through Abu Dhabi and go through preclearance. That is preemptive and reduces the chances of encountering such issues after a long flight. Reference Expedited Removal of Certain Applicants for Admission The expedited removal order bars reentry for 5 years following the
  removal, or 20 years in the case of a second or subsequent removal,
  unless the alien obtains advance permission to reenter the United
  States."
As tourist in China do I have to fear consequences for having publicly liked South Park?,"Note that at the time of this post, to the best of my knowledge, there has been no palpable proof that the celebrity was indeed banned from entering China, or that the purported ban is related to him ""liking"" a post on Twitter. This uncertainty is reflected by a number of online news sources that use such ambiguous words as ""says"" or ""claims"" to describe the situation. For all we know it may be a PR stunt, or a less headline-worthy statement that some of his upcoming concerts in China were suddenly canceled unbeknownst to him (which would be a much more believable claim). Generally speaking, restrictive government regimes tend to be very selective in applying their own laws and policies. As long as you are not the loudest voice in the crowd and don't bring along any South Park (or Winnie the Pooh, for that matter) paraphernalia, you should be fine. (Most likely you will be fine either way, but if you are nervous about the trip, it's best to stay on the safe side.)"
Why is air travel between South American countries so expensive?,"I would like to add to @Willeke's answer by questioning your initial premise: This makes the whole trip to these otherwise cheap countries no longer attractive cost-wise, and I feel it is even more expensive than traveling around Western Europe for 3+ months. You presume that being a cheap country means air tickets must also be cheaper. To analyse that, lets take a look at the costs of running a single flight in the United States:  Which means that it isn't significantly cheaper (and potentially even more expensive) to run a plane in South America compared to the rest of the world.  Then you may ask why you're able to get dirt cheap tickets in South East Asia and the answer is volume. Asian airlines are able to run dozens of flights per day between the most popular city pairs, while the number of passengers traveling internationally in South America is relatively low. The most popular route in South America (Rio to Sao Paulo) is dirt cheap, with flights available for as low as $75. If the number of passengers traveling between Rio and Santiago was the same I guarantee you could get excellent deals for that route as well."
Travelling as unmarried couple in Dubai,"Various online sources (Lonely Planet, Tripadvisor, USA Today, Dubai FAQ) seem to agree that as long as you don't start making out in public and telling people that you're not married, or attract the attention of the police in other ways, you'll be breaking the law but are very unlikely to get into trouble.  People in general, and hotel staff especially will just assume that you're married and not ask for evidence. You might want to practice referring to each other as ""my husband"" and ""my wife"" though :)"
Why are the shops open in Geneva today (on a Sunday)?,"In Geneva, following a 2018 vote, shops are allowed to open on three Sundays during the year. France has had similar but more permissive regulations for years (with some nuances between regions and large supermarkets constantly pushing the limits) and concerns about losing business to the competition just across the border in Haute-Savoie or Ain is an additional reason for Geneva in particular to allow this. In neighbouring Vaud, the details are left to the municipalities but shops do close on Sunday for the most part (including this mall, which is actually very close to Geneva). Apparently, this particular Sunday was chosen as it is the end of the first school week. Unsurprisingly, the other two Sundays are in the weeks leading to Christmas."
I'm an Indian married to a US citizen and live in the US. But my parents are not aware of this. How will this affect their visa application?,"The DS-160: Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application does not ask for your marital status. It will ask the applicant if they have any immediate relatives in the US, for which they will answer Yes. It will then ask for your surname, given name, your relationship to the applicant (e.g. child), and your status in the US (US citizen, permanent resident, etc). These are the only questions on the visa form that will be about you."
"Are dual nationals (non-US citizens) also affected by President Trump's ban on Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen?","Note: this answer applies to Canadian citizens specifically, as in the case of the OP.
See the answer by @chx for what seems to be the situation for everybody else right now. As long as you travel on your Canadian passport, you are fine according to the Canadian governements' travel advisories for the US updated on January 29, 2017 - navigate to entry/exit and scroll down to dual citizenship: Holders of Canadian passports, including dual citizens, will not be
affected by the Executive Order on Protecting the Nation from
Terrorist Attacks by Foreign Nationals issued by the White House on
January 27, 2017. Although the Candian Prime Minister has tweeted that the US national security advisor, Mike Flynn, has explicitly excluded Canadian dual citizens, there is a lot of uncertainty on the ground - so even if Canada may be an exception, it may be prudent to wait a few days for clarity before boarding a plane, if possible.  Senior officials have been working to seek clarity for Canadians from the US Department of Homeland Security and US Department of Transportation, amongst other counterparts. I instructed our National Security Advisor, Daniel Jean, who was in touch over the course of the day with NSA Flynn to seek further clarification. NSA Flynn confirmed that holders of Canadian passports, including dual citizens, will not be affected by the ban. We have been assured that Canadian citizens travelling on Canadian passport will be dealt with in the usual process. As we receive new information, we will continue to share on this and other channels."
How can I locate a missing person abroad?,"Ideally the authorities should be contacted when a person is believed to be missing. Now whether you want to do that now or later that's up to you and the family, but I would definitely check with them first. Once you make the decision to alert authorities, I would first alert the US Dept. of State: U.S. Citizens Missing Abroad If you are concerned about a U.S. citizen relative or friend who is traveling or living abroad, you may contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate, or call our Overseas Citizens Services office in Washington, D.C. at 1-888-407-4747 (from outside the United States and Canada, call 202-501-4444) They will then check with the local authorities: Our embassies and consulates abroad can use the information you provide to try to locate the individual and pass on your message. We can also check with local authorities in the foreign country to see if there are any reports of a U.S. citizen hospitalized, arrested, or otherwise unable to communicate with those looking for them.  The more information you provide about the individual, the better we may be able to help."
What section of an airplane offers the smoothest ride?,"It varies a little depending on the type of plane, but in general during flight over the wings, or slightly forward of the wings gives the least amount of movement - especially for planes where the engines are mounted on the wings (rather than on/near the tail). Take-off/landing is a little different.  For take-off there's not a lot of difference - the nose of the plane leaves the ground first so there's normally a sharper movement at the front as that occurs, but the front is also off the ground earlier so potentially less bumpy for a short period of time. For landing, the intention is for the rear wheels to hit the ground first, followed by the nose wheels.  Presuming that happens, the front is much more smooth, and feels less of the bounce as the plane initially hits the ground.  In a bad landing the nose wheel can hit the ground around the same time as the other wheels, which causes a shock at the front of the plane worse than what you'd normally feel at the back - but that's pretty rare. Of course, the other way to answer the question is that the ""smoothest"" ride is in whichever part of the plane First Class is - if only because the seats are more comfortable (and the alcohol is free!) so you won't feel the bumps as much as in economy."
How much electronics and other valuables can I bring duty-free when going to India?,"Here's what customs rules in India state (the 'free allowance' referred to is for personal items, and the duty-free allowance of alcohol cigarettes): One laptop computer (notebook computer) over and above the said free
  allowances mentioned above is also allowed duty free if imported by
  any passenger of the age of 18 years and above. So obviously, your friend who was carrying two laptops (one work, one personal) was stopped. Technically, the customs officials were correct in trying to charge him duty on the second. Note that specifically for Indian citizens returning from work abroad are allowed to bring back 'items of professional use' but computers do not count as 'professional use' items as they can be repurposed by anyone. Apart from that, passengers above 10 years old flying in from most countries are given a duty-free allowance of items worth INR 45,0001 as long as they don't fall into one of the restricted items list such as alcohol / cigarettes. The ambiguity lies in whether a tablet would be considered a 'laptop computer' or not because it's not defined within Indian customs law. You do have the INR 45,000 limit (which your iPad may or may not fall within) which you could claim this under, but that won't leave headroom for your watches. It all boils down to what customs official inspects your baggage. I have been waved through most times without my baggage getting inspected (at any airport - India or outside, so I should count myself lucky!). Chances are if you look like a working professional, you will be stopped for inspection. They might be less likely to stop someone like me, because I usually wear my university logo clothes when travelling. Also, if you're carrying seven watches, chances are customs officials will think you're carrying them for the purpose of reselling, and thus more likelier to make you pay duty on those items. Again, this is anecdotal evidence from what I've seen on how customs officials behave in Indian airports. 1As of Aug 18 2015, reference"
Can I have a watermelon in hand luggage?,"There are two potential issues here: Airport security and customs. For airport security:
In the UK, ""Liquids include liquid or semi-liquid foods, eg soup, jam, honey and syrups"" and ""Liquids in containers larger than 100ml generally can’t go through security even if the container is only part full."" Exemptions (e.g. essential medical purposes) don't seem likely to apply here. Watermelon is less dense than honey, so an agent might use that to classify it more toward the ""liquid/container"" side than the ""solid"" side of honey, and honey (>100 mL) is not allowed.  It is also less viscous than some honey. Edit to clarify: criteria used in practice for classification is a different question than that of what more scientifically-based criteria agents perhaps should use.  In the US, the TSA lists it as approved for carry-on in their ""Can I Bring"" app.  Although this is the result for the explicit query ""watermelon,"" the response does have a disclaimer that ""Liquid or gel food items larger than 3.4 oz are not permitted in carry-on baggage"" so if an agent decides that a watermelon is a non-empty container capable of holding 3.4oz of liquid or gel, they might use their wide discretion to tell you it's not allowed.  For customs:
Although generally speaking when entering Germany, ""The import of food and animal feed for the consignee’s private use or consumption is permitted in principle,"" other readers traveling to other countries should consider whether or not they're allowed to transport fruits and seeds across national borders.  Rules are much less restrictive for travel within the EU. "
Is the 5 euro coin accepted anywhere?,"It is indeed a (national) collector's coin. It is legal tender in the country where it was issued, but not elsewhere in the eurozone. Even in its country of origin, I could imagine that many people would be surprised to receive one or perhaps even refuse to believe that it is genuine. And looking at the photos you can find on the web, I must say that their design is strongly reminiscent of old Franc coinage, which would only add to the confusion. I can add that I have been living in the eurozone since it was created and even worked as a waiter for some time (during which time I have seen many banknotes and coins…) but I have never seen such a coin. By contrast, €2 commemorative coins should be accepted and do circulate widely."
How to politely ask people from East Asia to give way? [closed],"To deal with the situations you faced, I will share some tips. If all she does is nod or say something like ""Ah~~~"", then it is likely that she either doesn't understand English, or is so obsessed with the smartphone that she doesn't hear what you are saying. Then you should just step in to check what you want while putting your hand forward. She will likely start to stagger while watching her smartphone. If you want to get off the train, just keep saying ""sorry"" multiple times all the while stepping into the exit. Many people understand that you want to get off in the context and will likely make an empty room for you. Although you might feel that it is not you that should feel sorry, saying Sorry would work better than Excuse me. This is simply because most people, especially those who are not good at English, are far more accustomed to hearing the former than the latter.  Honestly, I feel with you. My biggest pet peeve is a group of people walking in front of me all on a horizontal line to block the entire pathway. I usually just force my way into the group to pass through it, in case you wanted to know."
Wrongfully held at Italian passport control for over an hour (EU citizen): can I get financial compensation?,"Can I get financial compensation? Can you first quantify in euros how much damage you suffered from detention? If yes, consult a lawyer asking if there is any rule granting you compensation. If no, you can't demand anything. Quantification can be done by any means, like missed connection and suffered costs. Despite any formula, you need a monetary result. I've already got an email address to send a complaint to. Yes, you can politely address the issue to the manager. I hope they gave you a real, official and monitored address. Border officers look for exceptions to the norm, because that is where the cases they are paid to find usually dwell (cit. @JimMacKenzie) The problem here is that the immigration officers were simply doing their jobs and were alerted by important alert flags that you have raised with them during primary inspection. Since you had 3 elements of suspicion, questioning was a bare minimum. You did not mention yours and the officers' behaviour in the conversation. You politely but firmly demanded to be allowed to enter Italy according to Schengen rules. Okay, let's assume politely... but when a person firmly claims a right on legal standings, I would immediately summon my manager or my legal office! It is my assumption, from the interpretation of the question, that you were just standing on your legal point without trying to explain the particular situation. Particularly because you were allowed a connection in KBP without a transit visa. I think (again, it's my thought) you just repeatedly answered them ""Why the heck do you need a passport when I am European?"", instead of cooperating with the police explaining how your situation was special on your favour. During your detention, they might have done additional checks without telling you, like criminal records, arrest warrants etc., just to make sure there was no reason to drag additional attention on you. They could have even phoned the Swedish embassy to clarify, or their legal team. Who knows. In the end, you were rightfully released as expected. There was no reason to hold you indefintely, but it took them some time to determine you are welcome. Following is mere speculation. To help you understand why it was important in such a situation (not just a Swede entering Italy without a passport, but the above 3 flags all together), let me try to enter the officers' shoes and provide examples. You are a passenger standing next to me with a Swedish ID card after a flight from Ukraine. Could you have bribed someone to let you board the aircraft's illegally (even along the baggage?) and then emerge at destination? That might explain your lack of boarding cards. Investigate! Could you have given your passport to someone looking like you to continue traveling on your name? Investigate! Is it possible that your passport has been recently confiscated, but not your ID, under a criminal prosecution in order not to leave the country? Call embassy, investigate! Yet again, that is speculation. In the end, I hope that you will have a polite written conversation with the officers' management. You will unlikely get real apologies for what happened, but maybe they will explain to you why your situation demanded additional attention at the airport."
Is it socially/culturally acceptable for Indian/Sri Lankan people to visit the Oktoberfest?,"Oktoberfest is a major international tourist festival in a modern, progressive country. No one will question your attendance, no matter how you look. The only reason it would be awkward is if you told everyone that you didn't like German beer! [The only suggestion of racism I could find was where an Asian customer was asked to move from a table at Hofbräuhaus, and then a white person sat down. The allegation was strongly denied by the Hofbräuhaus: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11097315/Munich-Hofbrauhaus-denies-accusations-of-racism.html However, even this shows you will not be the only Asian in town.] There's no special dress code: you don't need to dress as a traditional Bavarian—that's just something some people do for extra fun. Normal jeans and tee-shirt will be fine. It is true that the festival attracts mostly white Europeans—it is a giant beer festival, and white Europeans have a long history of celebrating outdoor, public drunkenness, but strangely not everyone thinks this is a good idea: I think it is not so prevalent in many other parts of the world and many cultures resist this idea. But certainly there is no reason why you cannot attend and enjoy. It did not take me long to find pictures on Google Image search of those of Indian extraction enjoying themselves at Oktoberfest, but I suspect that the images are not selected by the media because they do not portray the ""Germanic"" heritage associated with the festival."
Canadian overstayed in the US for 14 years. Can I leave to Canada and return back to the US? [closed],"First and foremost, you really need a lawyer here. Looking for Internet advice in your situation is probably as ""helpful"" as trying to perform appendix self-surgery using Google search. There are two reasons for this (and this is why you need one): You said you never paid taxes so I assume you earned income in US.  Assuming you also did not file a tax return, this is a separate - and more serious - crime here in USA than overstay, as one can get in jail for a year for each year tax return wasn't filed. The issue here is complicated because of statute of limitation and other factors involved. A competent attorney might strike a deal with IRS on your behalf, so it is important to get one. Since you were unlawfully present in the USA over a year, you may be  inadmissible to the USA for 10 years (this means you cannot enter the USA for 10 years after your departure). This applies to Canadians as well according to this article. Since you came in much earlier, an immigration lawyer should be able to tell you whether those new rules apply to you or not, and - as a result - whether you are subject to ten year inadmissibility. If you are found inadmissible, this inadmissibility can be waived IF you are married to the US citizen, but only if it causes extreme hardship to one: (v) Waiver.-The Attorney General has sole discretion to waive clause
  (i) in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse or son or daughter
  of a United States citizen or of an alien lawfully admitted for
  permanent residence, if it is established to the satisfaction of the
  Attorney General that the refusal of admission to such immigrant alien
  would result in extreme hardship to the citizen or lawfully resident
  spouse or parent of such alien. No court shall have jurisdiction to
  review a decision or action by the Attorney General regarding a waiver
  under this clause. Understanding what is considered ""extreme hardship"" and making a case to prove it is something which should be left to a legal professional. Thus please get a lawyer ASAP."
I didn't do any exit passport control when leaving Japan. What should I do?,"I called the immigration office at KIX, and apparently, as of about a week ago, they are using automated facial recognition gates to quickly check out people staying on temporary visas, so I will not get a stamp.

Longest uninhabited road segments,"There are some very remote roads in northern Quebec. The James Bay Road (Route de la Baie James) is one option. Located in northeastern Canada, in the province of Quebec, the James Bay Road runs north from its beginning at Matagami to Radisson, 620 km (388 miles) away. It is a very remote road - there are no towns along the road (except at either end), and only one place to buy gas in between (at km 381). Source: Wildwood Canada ...It is paved for its entire length. This road was originally built to carry loads of 300 tons, so the road has mostly gentle curves and hills and wide shoulders. However, there are sections which are very bumpy, and even if you drive at the posted speed limit of 100 km/h, you could wreck your car on some of these bumps if you don't slow down. Some of the worst bumps have no bump sign! You may encounter logging trucks during the first 200 km or so, but they're not much of a problem as the road is paved. The James Bay Road is open year-round. There is only one gas station for the entire length of 620km, at Km 381. There are no other facilities whatsoever for the entire length of the road. You need to check in at Km 6. Radisson has most services, but remember that it is still a small town, of only about 300 people. Source: Wildwood Canada The Trans-Taiga Road is another, which is accessible from the northern part of the James Bay Road(!): This is an extremely remote road, leading 666 km east almost to Labrador, with no settlements or towns aside from Hydro Quebec's settlements for workers (these are private and are not open to the public - they will kick you out). At the far end you will be 745 km from the nearest town! This is the farthest you can get from a town on a road anywhere in North America! This second road is a gravel road - in theory you could probably do it with a bicycle, but in reality, you probably wouldn't want to attempt it without a ton of supplies and a means to call for help.

Can I eat a beef burger in India?,"Cows are considered holy in Hindu religion, not India as a whole per se. North/East/West India are primarily Hindu-majority regions and thus you're highly unlikely to find any beef, except perhaps at dodgy places in Muslim-dominated parts of those towns. Dodgy places because in those three parts of India cow slaughter is frowned upon and you don't find organised slaughterhouses for cows. While Southern India has its own conservative Hindu population which do not eat beef, it also has proportionally higher numbers of Christians and Muslims - historically because Christianity was brought in by sea traders. Beef is not as uncommon in South India and you will certainly find it some restaurant menu (typically ones that are not under a Hindu owner's management). This is generally in upscale restaurants or hotels bars with a significant foreign visitor clientèle. You'll never find beef products in chain restaurants such as McDonald's, Pizza Hut, Domino's etc. (For instance, there's no Big Mac burger in Indian McDonald's restaurants; instead, they have a 'Maharaja Mac' which is about the same size but with chicken patties.) Chain restaurants across India are primarily owned by a handful of companies based in North India. This was somewhat of a big issue in 2001 when rumours spread that beef fat was used in making French fries. You might come across signs in restaurants to this day which state 'Beef and beef products not sold here'. Since the availablity of beef is so restricted, I can't think of how you'd end up eating it in a public place. Nevertheless, it isn't illegal and if you do acquire beef then you can cook it in your own home too. In state of Kerala, situation is totally different. A significant percentage of people, including Hindus eat beef. It is unlikely to find a non vegetarian restaurant not to serve beef. Likewise, Kerala style non vegetarian restaurant in other states will most probably have beef. It will be usually marked as meat only. For example, if you see 'meat roast', 'meat masala', read it as beef roast and beef masala. Ask discretely to waiter to confirm and enjoy. :) Best beef burgers can be found in burger places in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram. Update:  Wiki: ""Legislation against cattle slaughter is in place throughout most states of India except Kerala, West Bengal, and states of the North-East"". Effective date: On 26 October 2005. "
"""5 = 1€"" for souvenirs in Paris, why do they write the price this way?","They write it this way to create confusion.  This attracts more potential customers to engage with the seller, since people conclude that the price is lower than it actually is.  This technique is a variant of bait and switch: First, customers are ""baited"" by merchants advertising products or services at a low price, but when customers visit the store, they discover that the advertised goods either are not available or are not as good as expected, or the customers are pressured by sales people to consider similar, but higher-priced, items (""switching""). Here, rather than attempting to steer the customer to different higher-priced items, the seller asserts that the customer has misunderstood the (intentionally confusing) sign and that the items on display are actually more expensive than the customer believed. In this case, the fact that the intended audience is foreign helps, since people may accept the ""unfamiliar"" manner of writing the price on the assumption that it must be an unfamiliar French convention. As noted in a comment, the practice may be more of a fraud than a bait-and-switch, although I could not readily find any images on the web to support this assertion.  The more common way to express a price for several items is, for example, 5€ les 2, as in this image, meaning five euros for two pieces. As noted in another comment to Willeke's answer, the incorrectly-drawn euro sign may also be an intentional mistake to provide a scammer with (not so) ""plausible"" deniability.  It could also help to select more vulnerable people. Willeke's answer also deserves your upvote because it notes that the confusion created by the sign can provide opportunity for pickpockets, whether they are in league with the vendor or not."
Hotels on the Las Vegas strip: is there a commitment to gamble?,"I have spent a couple of short vacations in Las Vegas, touring the area during the day, having dinner and people watching in the evening. I have never encountered a requirement to gamble. What you will face is an extremely sophisticated system for encouraging gambling, and encouraging losing more money than you intend. You will not get from your room to a restaurant without being exposed to multiple opportunities to gamble. Once in the restaurant, Keno runners will be there in case you want to place a bet. Sit at a bar, and there will be computer poker screens set in the bar top. There are no time cues in casino spaces, so people tend to stay longer than they intend. Personally, I just don't gamble in Las Vegas. An alternative that works if you do want to gamble is to set aside a definite amount of money you can afford to lose, and stop gambling once that is gone."
What happens if you cannot pay for a hotel?,"In many hotels you can just drop your keys in a box on your way out (or leave them in your room) and the charges will go to the credit card on file. Should you become aware that the card won't work, one approach would simply be to stay as long as you had intended, pack your bags, and just leave. Undoubtedly the hotel will call or email you within a few days looking for their money, and you can sort it all out then. Nobody detains you, there's no talk of police or fines or jail, you settle your bill and that's that. What if you discover the problem only as you are checking out? Pretty much the same approach. You try a few things - another credit card, offering them a debit card, and so on. If one of those works, great. If not, you put your stuff back in your room and leave the hotel to go sort it out. (Dragging your stuff around while you settle a problem would be a pain, so you want to leave it, and it makes them feel they have a hold on you. But it's in your room and you have a key, so really they don't, right?) If you're sure you can't sort it out anywhere in this town, and it's a large hotel so they can't really track your coming and going, you can go out for a while, then return to your room and leave with your stuff, leaving the key, and sort it out over the next few days.  If it's a small hotel, a B & B almost, that will see you every time you come in or go out, then just plain leaving is a little more problematic. They could try to prevent you from leaving. You will have to be open with them. Try all the possible solutions. For example, in Canada we can email each other money, so I could ask a friend to email me money, which would go into my bank account, then pay with a debit card all in about 20 minutes (after locating a friend who is willing to help of course, and with a device available for getting my email and clicking links.) Or the same thing, but I go out to an ATM and withdraw cash if the hotel doesn't take debit. If you try all these solutions in front of them - emailing and calling people, calling your credit card company and so on - they may begin to trust you that you aren't trying to rip them off, and let you leave to sort it out at home.  It is going to boil down to whether people believe you are trying to cheat them, or really had a problem. A business traveller in a large expensive hotel will have a lot less trouble than a backpacker in a small hotel. I don't think any authorities will lend you money; the best they might do is vouch to the hotel (for example that you really were robbed) so that you can leave and pay the bill when you get home."
"Is there a 'minimum daily spend' in Bhutan, and does it vary on citizenship?","Yes, seriously, although the US$65 ""royalty"" is actually included in the US$200 ""daily package fee"".  However, that's the group rate (3 or more people), you get socked another $40/30 per person if you're traveling solo/duo, and another $50/night/person if you're visiting when it's neither midwinter nor monsoon (March-May, Sep-Nov). Bhutan explicitly wants cashed-up tourists and not penurious backpackers, so the rates are high.  The only exceptions/discounts are: The alternative is to wrangle an invitation from a Bhutanese citizen or organization, but obviously this requires actually knowing someone, there's no Russia-style invitation letter mill.  Volunteering is one way in, but the competition's pretty tough."
Do I need to pass customs if I enter by swimming over a body of water?,"You can only pass through customs (or immigration) through designated ports of entry. This means that unless you have a special pass (for example, ship crews have special passes), you need to go through the customs and immigration process.  This is a burden on you as the traveler. It does not matter where you start the journey. Your status in the destination country/territory will depend on your current nationality. For example, if you are allowed to legally reside and visit a country without a visa, you will not be an illegal alien (to prove this though, you'll have to provide documentation - like a passport). However, there will still be issues with your departure as your arrival was not legal or documented.  If questioned by police you will most likely be detained and deported for illegally entering the country. As for goods (customs), it is more restrictive as each country has their own rules on what goods are allowed entry customs free, which goods need to be declared and which goods are forbidden. In either way the burden is on you to make sure your travel is legal and authorized even if you don't need a visa to travel to the country; or your port/manner of entry was not through the normal channels."
"What is meant by ""personal impact and articulation skills"" in the context of border entry?","Personal impact and articulation refer to a person's physical appearance and behaviour when they present themselves to the immigration officer, and the way they answer questions.  As noted by phoog's response, immigration officers have a very short amount of time to determine whether a person complies with the immigration rules, and whether the person is credible with their responses. This document, though a bit old, reports on a study on the immigration officers' decision-making process during a landing interview.  A person's presentation at the immigration officer forms a key part in determining whether the person should be further questioned: Officers might also take into account how passengers behaved at the desk;   their dress, appearance and general demeanour were also seen as possible ""clues"" to their plausibility and, therefore, the need for questioning. (page v) The section on ""Passenger's presentation of self"" from page 15 provides some examples of behaviours which may trigger further questioning (i.e. poor personal impact and articulation skills): men in suits or shirts that are much too big, wearing ties with knots that suggest the passenger has never worn one before; men in suits but not 
  wearing socks; and people in ill-fitting shoes However, there is an overall caveat: Sometimes it is more of an overall impression that the [Immigration Officer] responds to, including how comfortable passengers seem, how they speak and communicate, how open they are, as well as how they are dressed.  It  is  this  combination  of  factors  that  leads  an  IO  to accept or question whether  the passenger is genuinely what they claim to be. Officers vary, however, in terms of how much store  they  place  on  the  passengers'  behaviour  and  appearance.  Some  admit to forming a quick  impression, which puts them on the alert. Other officers, however, were much more circumspect, claiming that appearances can be deceptive. People who look ""very shabby"" can turn out to be well educated  professionals, such  as  university  professors; men in the  building trade may choose to  dress up for travel because they wear jeans the rest of the time; passengers may dress particularly smartly  because  they  are  visiting  relatives. [Chief Immigration Officers] in particular stressed  the  importance  of  not  judging  too  much  by  appearances.  Although  an  officer  may  form  some  impression  of  the  socio-economic circumstances of a passenger, this may not be correct, so officers should concentrate on their questions rather than relying too much on the external impressions."
"In US rental car terms and conditions, what exactly is a ""regularly maintained road?""","One of the comments nailed it: ""they mean don't take our rental car to Burning Man.” - Eric Lippert And Burning Man is easy - flat, hard, no chance of off-roading damage. People still pay. Note how in the link, some rental agencies play them for suckers, and they can - words are nothing, rental car contracts are clear, and only paper matters. Paved roads only, is what Hertz's vehicle guide says, fine print end of line 1. The exact language is ""Use of rental vehicles off paved roads is prohibited"". It's not an or with ""regularly maintained roads"", it's an and.  This is a legal maneuver, mainly about a liability shift.  This is fairly routine in EULA-style contract law, to stack the deck in their favor.  Courts will support it if it's not unreasonable or unfair.  They make it a breach of contract to exit paved roads. They know you probably will drive it on unpaved driveways and maybe roads.  Your argument is ""it's a perfectly harmless gravel driveway"".  Their argument is ""if it's so harmless, how'd you manage to break the car?""  The point is to utterly deflate any argument you could possibly make. Why don't they say ""driving on unpaved roads is at your own risk""?  Because they've litigated a lot of these, and they found that language doesn't work and raises the cost of litigation.  Making it a violation of ToS makes it clear-cut.  Remember, the TOS only has effect if you damage the car or get it extraordinarily dirty.  And even then, you have the recourse to argue that the gravel road was an entirely properly groomed highway in good order and the accident had nothing to do with the road.  When the facts plainly show that, they are unlikely to invoke the TOS rule, not least because it would not be conscionable to do so and courts would spank them if they did.  That saves you from unfair misapplication of the rule.  They want an airtight case if you ""rack up the car"" by driving where it doesn't belong.  The TOS as written does that. "
Where and why are there metric road signs in Arizona?,"That photo looks like I-19 in Arizona, America's only metric road (more from Atlas Obscura).  Congress passed the Metric Conversion Act in 1975, the last time the US had a serious metric system push, and various tests were carried out to start the conversion process. I-19 in Arizona was one of the test sites. After widespread opposition (""Forcing the American people to convert to the metric system goes against our democratic principles"" is a quote from Chuck Grassley in 1977, and the guy has not mellowed out since then), the Metric Board was eventually disbanded. But the locals like it: Our bosses at the Arizona Department of Transportation have tried to change I-19's signs back to miles before. The signs have to be replaced periodically anyway. But businesses along the highway say doing so would make their shops harder to find, since the exit numbers would also change. They tried to change the signs back to miles as recently as 2009, but there was local opposition that put the plan on hold. The issue came up again in 2014, still without any change."
Why can't we use the toilet when the train isn't moving in some countries?,"I don't know specifically for the country you are in, but in many countries, this is because the toilet empties directly onto the tracks, even in countries with relatively modern trains. Even in the UK, some trains still do this (I found out when searching the Railway UK forums) Another reason is because toilets on trains require pumps, and in the station there may not be sufficient spare power to allow the toilet to flush correctly.
This may be vacuum pressure or electric pump, depending on the type of train and toilet."
"Is ""departure time"" when the plane leaves the gate or when it takes off?","In general, the departure and arrival time are considered the time that the parking brake on the plane is released and applied respectively.  For most major airlines, this is actually recorded automatically - the moment the brake is released the 'departure' time is recorded, and the moment it is re-applied at the destination the 'arrival' time is recorded. On departure the parking brake is only released once the entire plane is boarded, the jetbridge/stairs have been removed, and the plane is ready to actually start taxiing (although in practice it might not actually taxi at that time due to any number of factors including other planes blocking it). On arrival, the parking brake is set only after the plane has arrived at the gate, and before the seat-belt sign is extinguished and the jetbridge/stairs are bought to the plane, and before the door is opened. In some cases a slightly different definition is used.  For example the European Union ""EU261"" compensation uses the time that the aircraft door is opened as the arrival time. So in the example given, the flight is at most 1 hour and 10 minutes delayed - although it could be less if the plane was ready to taxi before it actually started doing so. In general, the exact length of a delay on departure is not all that relevant.  What is generally seen as far more important is the arrival delay, which will frequently be significantly less than the departure delay."
Can I take an AVR development board on a plane?,"The TSA guide says that ""Realistic Replicas of Explosives"" are not allowed, and yours kind of qualifies. Of course it lacks a critical component, namely an accelerant and/or explosive, but good luck convincing airport authorities anywhere in the world. The best thing that comes to mind is to disassemble partly the components, particularly the analog ones -- keypad and cabling, mostly (hopefully not everything is soldered) and pack them separately. The rest would look much more like a harmless circuit board, and you can transport those without anyone making a fuss about it (I've done this previously with various hardware components both in my checked and hand baggage). If that's not possible, then you should contact the airport security in advance and explain your situation. If you are forward about it with and show them and explain what you are carrying, you should be fine. Security personnel would probably want to look at it with bare eyes, so make sure it's easily unpackable.  Got a somewhat related anecdote as well: some 20 years ago, my mother travelled from Moscow on a business visit and had bought me a toy -- a fairly large moon lander, equipped with faux antennas, lamps, and ""remote"" controls with cables. She packed without much thinking in her handbaggage, but without the box. At the security scan at the airport, the security personnel became visibly agitated and reached for their guns until my scared to death mother showed them what the bulky box with doubly suspicious antennas and cables really was."
Refuse to answer questions at border control,"The Home Office was asked in 2015, what the legal basis for such questioning is. Here is their answer. Assuming that you are an EEA national, Border Force officers can ask you any 
  questions that allow them to establish your identity and nationality. This may include 
  questions about your travel history. The EEA Regulations 2006 specify that an EEA 
  national must produce a valid passport or identity card to establish their nationality and identity however if does not specify how the Border officer should establish the validity of these travel documents. Questioning EEA passengers is one of the ways that Border Force officers can quickly verify if a document is likely to be valid. I think it is fair to summarize that general questions about your recent travel history and other matters relating to your identity are fair game. This might include your place of birth, place of residence, et c. You may be entitled to decline to answer more invasive questions. I am a British citizen returning to the UK. I didn't feel like telling a complete stranger about my life so I just gave some short snippy general answers. I think that is a very British response. As a pragmatic answer, I suggest you use the e-gates, because there you (usually) don't have to talk to anyone. These days I leave my earphones in from plane seat to home, and the airport staff get the message that I don't want to talk. Is it acceptable to just tell them its none of their business and walk away? It is not acceptable to walk away. In principle you, as a British citizen, do not need anyone's permission to enter the UK, but you are not going to get very far until you have satisfied the Border Force that you are a British citizen. From personal anecdote, I once declined to answer ""Where have you come from today?"" on the basis that I could not remember. (It was a long week.) The officer looked more sympathetic than suspicious. If you are unhappy with the questioning you receive, you can ask to speak with the Border Force Duty Manager for the terminal in question, although this is unlikely to expedite your entry."
How to use toilet paper,"Well, there is a website dedicated to this! It illustrates the process: Here are the steps from that site in a nutshell: You have to remain seated for the whole wiping process. Start out with a decent size wad of tissues, three balled-up squares should be enough. Reach around and behind your butt, and lean into the opposing cheek. Start wiping with the pointer, middle and ring fingers. Use moderate pressure and wipe at a cautious speed from front to back. Repeat this step with the same amount of tissue until the amount of remnants on the paper decreases by fifty percent. For the second step, the amount of tissues should be reduced. Two crumbled squares should be enough at this stage. Follow the same directions of step 1 (with the reduced paper amount) but using more pressure with each wipe. Continue until the amount of remnant on the tissue decreases to a small amount. The paper in the step should be decreased to one folded square. This really is sufficient. Repeat the same direction from step 1, but now you should be using significant pressure. As you pass over your anus, relax the sphincter and slightly press the pad of your middle finger into the opening, continue the progression from front to back. Repeat this step until there is very little to no remnants transferring onto the paper. The final step which is often ignored, is to use a wet wipe, repeat step 3 until absolutely no remnants remain. This step is to ensure fresh, thorough clean that is second only to a bath or shower. This will reduce any staining, odor or itching that may occur later. Flush, adjust your clothing, wash your hands with soap and water. Also, this video explains it well. A tip for your friend, always take a bottle of water when using a toilet with toilet paper only. This way things will be easier and much more like home."
"Why are some airplane seats numbered ""DEK""?","I have never before noticed this, but a quick check over several airlines at Seatguru confirmed that other airlines do that as well.  The logic behind this is that the letters A and K will always be window seats. The letter K is chosen, because it's the highest that you can go in a normal airplane with 10 seats across (An A380 for instance). I is omitted because of it's resemblance to 1. Note that Avianca does this even for the smaller airplanes, where you'll have ACDK. B and E are omitted so that C and D are always aisle seats. This is also maintained on the bigger A330, where numbering is AC - DEFG - JK.  Just to illustrate, here's are the seat configuration for all their planes: So A and K are window seats; C, G seats with aisle on the right; D, J seats with aisle on the left; B,E,F middle seats.  It's a little illogical on the other side though, I don't understand why they use J instead of H, would make more sense to put a H, then if they happen to buy bigger air planes, they could just fit in the B and the H. There's a little bit more information on this on Wikipedia."
How can non-Caucasians avoid suspicious looks when traveling in the West?,"I can't say that I completely understand your situation (I am, after all, of European descent), but you should not be surprised to find out that I have indeed been treated sometimes differently for being Eastern European (and proud of it!), and the thing that I found works best is to just ignore them and pretend that you don't know what they are doing. Acting in a way that reinforces their stereotypes won't help, neither is being defensive, so be very polite (the more annoying they are, the more polite you should be) with the people you meet and try to ""behave like them"" in certain situations.  In 99% of the time, the prejudices stem from the fact that they have never (or rarely) seen a people of your ethnic descent in vivo, and all their opinions towards members of certain ethnic groups come from mass media and other prejudiced people.  All being said,here are some things that might help: Appearance. While people of ethnic origin other than European are common for many European countries, clothing style is pretty much uniform all over Europe. Traditional clothing is virtually not seen, and wearing it would definitely cause more raised eyebrows than it would otherwise. Please note that I'm not trying to denigrate the clothing style of a particular culture, but the train of thought of many people goes along the lines of looks different->is different->is unknown->I don't like them.  Behaviour. Be polite with people, even if they are annoying jingoistic pricks. Smile at them when making inadvertent eye contact.  Language. If you are in the presence of people that don't know your language, try not to use it when you are talking to your friend and other people are also part of the discussion. I always switch automatically to English in such situations, even if the people that don't understand the language are a minority. This shows consideration to the others and demonstrates you don't have second thoughts and are not talking behind their backs. Of course, if it's only you and your friend, you can talk in any language you like, but as soon as another people join the conversation, it's common courtesy to switch to English (or other language common for the group you are in). Of course, other people should be doing exactly the same when you are in your presence, but sadly this won't happen nearly as often. And now, some of my favourite personal examples of overturned stereotypes: I have a friend of Iraqi descent who is a fervent Catholic, has been to Jerusalem more than a few times and goes to church regularly. At the same time, another friend of mine of Bosnian descent is a Muslim, although you can never tell from the way he looks and behaves. And finally, yet another of my friends from Ethiopia made a furor at a certain defense contractor company when he appeared with dreadlocks and baggy pants on a project presentation, and proceeded to blow their minds with his competence. They were utterly confused and later my friend told me that this was one of the most satisfying moments of his life."
What time is used on board a cruise ship?,"From at least one authority on the topic: Whether clocks stay set on ""ship"" time or are changed as the vessel
moves through time zones depends on the ship, the itinerary, and the
time of year so it'll depend on the company you use, and the zone of the ship and where it travels during the tour. Most ships adhere to the time zone they are in and clocks are set
forward or back to adhere to local time. Passengers are also advised
to change their watches to the 'correct' time—there is usually a
reminder card on your pillow before you go to bed. However, not all
ships do that, particularly in the Caribbean! Some ships stay on
""ship"" time, which can be different from ""island"" time. So the best authority is the ship itself, and they'll know from experience that people get it wrong, and will do their best to ensure you don't miss the boat. From friends who have travelled on a cruise ship in the Mediterranean, breakfast and lunch could be literally 'whenever we wanted' - there was often a buffet. Disney, for example has seating times for dinner that you can request, and for breakfast, say, on their ship The Wonder: Breakfast times vary daily, so please check the Personal Navigator—the
Disney Cruise Line daily newsletter detailing all there is to see and
do—for specific dates and times while onboard. So yes, times can change, and meal times can change accordingly as well, so in the end you'll have to check with your operator and whether they have any special time-operations on the ship you're travelling on."
Would it be ok to eat rice using a spoon in front of Westerners?,"It depends on how you define ""western countries"", but if you think of Western Europe + UK + US/Canada, please rest assured that nobody would care whether you use sticks, fork, spoon or hands (well, this one is a bit of stretch) to eat your rice. So yes, this is ok. If you don't get a spoon, please ask for one. Please also note that not every kind of rice could be eaten with chopsticks; certain types of rice (typically those used in soups such as Georgian ""Harcho"") are non-sticky, and I can't imagine eating it with anything else but spoon."
What to do in Las Vegas without having to sin?,"Las Vegas has a wonderful (and inexpensive) sinless side. The costs of running it are subsidized by the gambling industry. You can wander around looking at beautiful buildings and imitations of the Eiffel Tower, pieces of Venice, a circular escalator, amazing fountains, a fake volcano with nighttime ""eruptions"", and so on. All free visit wildlife from flamingos (free) to sharks, dolphins, and tigers (not free.) You may be irritated by the amount of money that has been spent for no purpose that could have fed, vaccinated, or educated children the world over. You may be offended by the behaviour of people who are busy sinning as much as they can. I especially disliked (after dark, on the strip itself) the people wearing Tshirts advertising how quickly ""girls"" can be ""sent to your room"" and the driving billboards featuring nearly naked women in lascivious poses. Many of the street-level touts were engaging passersby trying to sell them things. They focused mainly on men who were alone. My daughter and I were invisible to them. We just walked from place to place as quickly as we needed to and ignored the subculture of the streetcorner, or observed it anthropologically. If you can abide the ambience on the strip, there is plenty for you to do that isn't sinful at all. Check the las-vegas tag here for more details. I have been on three business trips, and a leisure trip with my twenty-something daughter (a chef) and while we did have wine with dinner we did nothing else that is on your list of things not to do."
Hotel booking: Why is Agoda much cheaper than booking.com?,"Booking.com uses the Agency model, this means the website is a place where hotels list their offers and booking.com gets a commission with every booking done through their website. On the other hand, Agoda uses the Merchant model in addition to the Agency model, meaning that in some cases they actually buy the hotel rooms from the hotels directly (in bulk), then offer them at a competitive price. I think they do that a lot with Asian Hotels.  That's why sometimes Agoda is cheaper, other than that it's just a psychological effect because they show prices per night and tax-exclusive, which gives the impression that their prices are less.  One more thing, Booking Holdings (the company that owns both Booking.com and Agoda) is doing a great job, they are doing a business trick where people think that both sites are major players which are competing with each other, so customers think they must choose between one of them, whatever customers choose the company earns money. This is called ""self-competition"" in the business world. It's also called ""The Illusion of Choice"" (thanks to @RyanfaeScotland for pointing that out)."
Taming the nightmare of public toilets in the UK,There is a website that I was hitherto completely unaware of that aims to cater for this need. Great British Public Toilet Map For tourists with smart phones it would be useful as it geolocates the nearest ones in their database (or allows manual search) and provides a facility to add crowd sourced toilet locations along with pertinent details. These details can be used as search criteria via the preferences menu Free Accessible Open Now Male Female Baby Changing Ones lacking crucial features will come up red.
Why does my phone's GPS not work in China?,"Long ago I took a fairly simple GPS (coordinates only, this was before the idea of a GPS with a map existed) to China--and found it couldn't cope with all the tall buildings.  In a large park it would work.  Once I managed to get a fix with it sitting on a windowsill high up in a building but at street level with buildings around I never got enough satellites for a fix."
Are there still any advantages to using an Oyster card for travel in London?,"Weekly travelcard: Contactless weekly travelcard is only from Monday to Sunday, so if you arrive and leave mid-week, you might get better rates if you still get an Oyster card, and buy a weekly travelcard on that. On the other hand it might still be cheaper if you don't intend to travel every day for 7 days to just use your Contactless and use the daily capping rates. Also, if you start your journey after 9:30 every day inside zones 4-6, and do this at least twice in a week then you're eligible for the (not really advertised) reduced off-peak day rate, which you get as a refund. Getting this refund to an Oyster card as a visitor is usually not possible, as you have to get back to the UK and touch in, but for contactless they can simply just refund to your card, even when you're long gone.  Boat services: There used to be a difference between Oyster and Card fares on the Boat services as only Oyster was accepted for discounted fares, but as of 2017 both Oyster and Contactless users can get the discounted fare. Buses and trams: There used to be some slight differences on some heritage bus services where Contactless was not available and there were some bus/tram connections in South London where the Oyster price was slightly cheaper than the Contactless one. As of 2017 these differences have been abolished by the new Bus Hopper fare. Banking costs: See @JoErNanO's answer about potential foreign banking costs associated with Contactless cards"
How old does a child need to be to sit separately from parents when flying?,"There's no definitive answer to this and it will vary by country and airline. This is what the UK Civil Aviation Authority says: http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?catid=2207&pageid=12706 From a safety point of view children (it doesn't specify an age) SHOULD be seated CLOSE to their parent/guardian.  The reasons are many but if you imagine a decompression for example, where the oxygen masks deploy, you want someone to be able to fit the mask to the child.  Parents may not trust a random stranger to do this for their offspring. If there was an emergency evacuation, you don't want parents having to move around the aircraft trying to get to their children to ensure they are evacuated etc. Once the child gets to an age where they are responsible enough to look after themselves in the event of an emergency, then you can consider this to be reasonable.  This will vary depending on the child to some extent but perhaps age 12 would be reasonable. Of course if you have 6 children as we do, you will invariably be separated by at least a row or an aisle, we always try to seat the youngest ones closest.   In the past airlines (at least the ones I've flown with) would always try to seat families together but now that a lot of them charge for reserved seats they are less helpful in this regard."
"Should I just not bother to ""reserve"" rental cars anymore?","When you reserve (say) a compact car, they may give you a larger or better car but they will generally only charge you the lower price (unless they get you to agree to an ""upgrade"" it's on them). I once got a convertible for compact price, for example. If you just show up at their door they have no incentive to discount the cars they may have available and may charge a higher price than the one you get by shopping around. If you enjoy haggling maybe this is a feature, but I like to get in and out.  So if you care about the cost, it's a benefit. Even if you don't care about cost, they are obligated to give you some kind of vehicle and not just tell you that their cars are all rented.  With some rental companies you can apparently save time- avoiding the desk and associated queue (and potential up-selling spiels) entirely by reserving in advance with their loyalty program. "
"What is the last point where one can throw away fruits if one has indicated ""not bringing any fruit"" on the US customs form when flying to the US?","It will depend on the exact border post. In airports you're likely to have a bin somewhere between the plane and passport control. When taking the bus you might not have a big enough bin until you're past immigration.  However at the end of the day it doesn't matter in the slightest. If you have some fruit with you, simply mark yes on the customs form and dutifully show it to the customs agent as you hand back the form. If they want you to dispose of it, they'll tell you where the closest bin is. If they don't, you can keep your fruit and enjoy it later. It is absolutely legal to bring any food products to the border as long as you openly declare everything.  Source: bringing food at least 10 times over the US border. "
Is there any advantage to checking in for a flight before going to the airport?,"Well, it'll depend, but yes, there are certainly advantages. Often airlines have bag drop only, if you've checked in online. They'll still check your ID, but it saves you lining up with all the others who still need to go through the check in process. By checking in early, you're less likely to be bumped - flights oversell regularly, on the assumption a certain percentage won't make it.  As a result, if you really want to make sure you get on the flight, you check in ASAP. If you've got status, it gives you more time in the lounges, to eat, drink and relax.  It also gives you time to shop, if that floats your boat. On some carriers (less these days as many charge), by checking in early you have the opportunity to ask nicely for an exit-row seat - usually you can't check in to these online as they have to make sure you're fit and able to comply with the crew in an emergency, so they give them to people in person at bag-drop/checkin. Some airlines use checkin time as a tie-breaker for upgrades. Generally these days they're stingy and only give it to people with status, but all things being equal, if you checked in first, you may get it.
But perhaps the most important - for international flights - things go wrong. Your taxi doesn't turn up, there's a failure on the train line, you forget something at home and have to go back - all of these have happened to me.  By doing things ahead of time, it's one less moment of stress at the airport, and gives you that extra time you might need. And importantly, if check in has closed when you get there, it's too late to check in, but if you've checked in ahead of time, you have a boarding pass in your hand and can still go through security and try to make your flight."
Can you bring an empty water bottle with you on the plane?,"I always have one or two plastic bottles with me. I empty them before I go through security and then re-fill them from a tap in the restroom in the waiting area.  I've done this many times, and security never asked about the empty bottles, and even if they do you can explain what they are for."
Any railway stations more than 1 change from London?,"Here are a couple of candidates: Whitby and other stations on the Esk Valley Line.  The only mainline connection to this line is Middlesbrough, which currently has no direct service to London (it is planned to begin in 2021).  See comment below. Thornton Abbey and other stations on the Barton line.  It looks like connections would be through Grimsby Town, which also has no direct London service as far as I can tell. Incidentally, these are both in England."
What additional costs can I expect when visiting a restaurant in the US where service is included?,"""Inclusive of service"" should mean that you are not expected to tip. That doesn't mean that you can't tip if you want to, especially if the service was good. The US restaurant business is pretty much wedded to tips, and they will be appreciated no matter what. However a Michelin 3-star restaurant should be paying its wait staff a decent wage, with or without tips. Yes, there will be sales tax on top of the price (unless you are in a state where there is no sales tax)."
How to adapt to Western Toilets from Indian-style toilets?,"Raising your feet up about 20 cm and leaning forward helps a lot.  It puts your body into a position more like squatting, aligning the tubes for more productive pooping,  but your weight is still firmly supported by your buttocks on the seat.
If you don't have something to rest your feet on, just raise your knees by going on tiptoes (up on the balls of your feet). I found this out when my children were young, and we had a small one-step stool handy. Edit: See LINK Paragraph 8, for confirmation. (Thanks Commenter!) Update (Sept 16, 2016):  This Squatty Potty is apparently now a thing! "
Attending an academic conference is what type of travel in Portugal?,"Annex II of the Schengen Visa Code (EU regulation 810/2009) includes a non-exhaustive list of “supporting documents” that sheds some light on the categories. Here are the most relevant bits: for business trips: (a) an invitation from a firm or an authority to attend meetings, conferences or events connected with trade, industry or work; […] (c) entry tickets for fairs and congresses, if appropriate; […] (e) documents proving the applicant’s employment status in the company; for journeys undertaken for the purposes of study or other types of training: (a) a certificate of enrolment at an educational establishment for the purposes of attending vocational or theoretical courses within the framework of basic and further training; (b) student cards or certificates of the courses to be attended; for journeys undertaken for the purposes of tourism or for private reasons: […] for journeys undertaken for political, scientific, cultural, sports or religious events or other reasons: invitation, entry tickets, enrolments or programmes stating (wherever possible) the name of the host organisation and the length of stay or any other appropriate document indicating the purpose of the journey; Those are just examples but it's clear that “study” is definitely out, it means something quite different and you won't have any of the documents listed. Both “business” and “cultural” could fit, the former seems pretty safe especially if you are employed by the university where you are pursuing a PhD (do submit documents to that effect). If you are still unsure, you could also simply check “other” and write “academic conference” to prevent any misunderstanding. It's important to be forthcoming about your purpose and to submit as much relevant documentation as possible but, unlike some other countries, the Schengen area does not have strictly defined visa categories. The category is there to help processing, your visa will not mention “business” or “culture” and it won't be checked at the conference or anything (this does happen in some other places like Colombia)."
Can I read my Gmail while traveling in China?,"My experience with China's internet has been to have alternative solutions ready if you need access to Google's services. You can use Google's Transparency Report for China to determine the current status of Google Services in PRC. Currently, it is difficult to access Gmail, and many other Google services, in mainland China. If Gmail is a critical service to you - have a backup plan. Here are some solutions that have worked for me and others. Have your Gmail forwarded to another service such as Microsoft Outlook or Protonmail. If Gmail is inaccessible, you can check the other service for email. A VPN/Proxy Server is also another solution that others recommend - but China has occasionally blocked VPN traffic as well. However, again it is another option to consider. Note that as of early 2017, China has started blocking VPN providers and is reportedly attempting to ban all VPN providers in the near future. Keep friends / family informed. Let them know there is a possibility that you may lose access to email. Have access to other means of communication like SMS or other secure messaging applications like WhatsApp or Signal."
I am a citizen of one of the countries listed in the US travel ban. Can I travel outside the US?,"The travel ban in its current form does not apply to US permanent residents (holders of green cards): source. Given the current administration, what might happen in the two weeks you're gone is impossible to predict, but as the policies stand now you should be allowed back in.  (Although it seems quite unlikely that green card holders would be denied entry categorically given the backlash against the initial ban, which did apply to them)"
Is it dangerous to go to Île de Noirmoutier using the pass?,"Passage du Gois is a natural passage with a length of 4,3km (2.58-miles), located in the Atlantic coast of France in the Vendée. Part of the D948 leading to the island of Noirmoutier floods with high tide, and is accessible only during low tide, 1½ hours each before and after the lowest tide. If you miscalculate, there are refuge markers which you would have to climb; your vehicle is another matter. 

 For safety, the current time and the time of the next low tide are indicated at the entrance.

Will getting a refund from an ESTA scam site cause me to be blacklisted from the US?,"Update: the Customs and Border Protection website now says: You may also have a third party, such as a relative or travel agent, pay the associated fees for each application. CBP is not responsible for third party fees.  Your application will not be submitted for processing until all payment information is received. Apparently they currently have no problem with these third party sites handling your payments - the advice given before implied that these sites were violating the CBP's terms of service. The FAQ's now additionally say: I have seen other websites that are assisting travelers in applying for their ESTA application. Is there a benefit to using one of these other sites? No. Use of a private service to apply for travel authorization via ESTA will not expedite approval. Third party websites that provide information about ESTA submit ESTA applications for VWP travelers are not endorsed by, associated with, or affiliated in any way with DHS or the U.S. government. and There are third-party entities already working in VWP countries that charge a processing fee to assist travelers in completing the ESTA online form. The implementation of a government-based fee for ESTA is likely going to result in additional confusion to [... truncated] The Department of Homeland Security worked with the travel and tourism industry to inform international travelers that the original ESTA program online application form was free. DHS and industry will continue to promote the official U.S. government ESTA website and discourage travelers from using the third-party organizations to complete the easy ESTA application. This will increase the likelihood that VWP travelers will know where to find the correct internet address for the official U.S. government ESTA website and that the only ESTA fees required will be those collected during the online application process. This new advice places the earlier advice into the context of having been cheated. The directions and implications remain the same - only use the official site - and if you don't and get charged extra, you may dispute it - but it could jeopardize your travels. The official US Government site recommends disputing the amount over $14, (in spite of doing so jeopardizing your future visits): https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1164/kw/esta/p/0/c/0 I've been charged more than $14 for submitting my ESTA application,
what should I do? There are a number of third parties that have established websites
that charge a fee for submitting your application on your behalf.  If
you have used one of these third party sites, we strongly suggest you
use your reference number to confirm with the official  U.S.
government site to ensure that your ESTA is in our system.  We
recommend you do this because we have no way of knowing if the
information passed through the third party website to us is accurate.
If it is not, you may have a problem when you arrive in the U.S. ... CBP cannot refund the money you paid to a third party website, however

In standard grey on dark blue text at the bottom of the scammer's front page: ""Legal Disclaimer: ESTA.US is a private information website not affiliated with the United States Government."" Whether it really creates any value for anyone is questionable, but a sucker is born every minute. The official website is good enough for government work: https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta but it looks like a phishing url - the fake site looks even more official/professional. The US Government site seems to back the idea that these people are being scammed and that these sites create no additional value. I hope he gets his money back by disputing the amount over $14. How exactly can he prevent the scammer from reacting to the partial
chargeback by submitting their own chargeback to the $14 they
forwarded to the government? The site says bad things will happen ""if
the $14.00 charge submitted to the U.S. government is refunded"" but
provides no information on how to prevent that from happening I am not a lawyer, but I have some business law training. What I would presume, based on the context, is that the intermediary opens the account pretending to be the individual, which is against the terms of service of the US Government site. If the intermediary attempts to charge-back to the government, the issue would seem to be between the intermediary and the government, since the applicant has followed the government's advice. I think it very unlikely that the government, knowing that there exists this bad-faith intermediary, and providing advice, would then penalize an applicant for following its advice. However, see the response below - it appears our short-sighted government bureaucrats would rather you save your $17 and jeopardize your future visits than visit, inject money in our economy, and create jobs. I have submitted this question to the government's official site. We'll see what they say, after they've had a few weeks to respond. Here's their email response: Response Via Email (CBP ESTA Officer) 09/01/2015 02:05 PM Hello, If the company you used to submit the ESTA cancels the fee with ESTA
after you cancel the charge with them this will create a charge back. If you were charged more than $14 USD per application, you have gone
to a third party web site. A third party business charges a fee to
submit an ESTA application on your behalf to the official website.
These businesses and web sites requesting additional fees are not
endorsed by, associated with, or affiliated in any way with Department
of Homeland Security or the United States Government. If there is a

application fee payment transaction with your bank or credit card that
may inadvertently result in a withdrawal of the fee for any of your
previous ESTA applications - will cause an automatic denial of your
current ESTA. The account will then be posted as a ""chargeback” and
incomplete account. This means that you will NO LONGER be able to
re-apply for a new ESTA and all subsequent ESTA applications will be
denied. You can continue to monitor the application up until the date of

Status:   Solved At the beginning of the email, which I received the same day, Recently you requested personal assistance from our on-line support
center. Below is a summary of your request and our response. If this issue is not resolved to your satisfaction, you may reopen it
within the next 7 days. Thank you for allowing us to be of service to you. Perhaps someone else can get further with this bureaucracy than I can, given my limited time."
Luggage was stopped by customs (we learned about it after our flight),"The most important thing in this situation is to get documentation about your luggage as soon as possible. No matter what the airline says, the only thing that matters is what they write. As this issue might be continued within the legal system (lawyers, etc) you should start gathering documents you can show to the judge. As I see it, the most important questions are:   After getting this information from your airline, you should consult with a lawyer. Even if customs stopped your luggage, they must inform the airline about it - so you need to find where the communication stopped. It may be that your airline will blame the local transporters (the Airflot company or even Pulkovo's staff). In that case, you would need to get written documents from your airline, and perhaps sue the responsible company. The laws about these requests say that the Russian company must give an answer in 30 days, so you should start this as soon as possible. If you decide to sue some Russian company, please be aware that financial compensation for moral damages are less than the material damage you incurred. So if you don't have documentation of your financial losses, you will spend a bunch of money for nothing."
"what is the official procedure if you answer ""yes"" to any of the US visa (DS 160) ""are you a terrorist/slaver/bodysnatcher"" questions?","The Department of State has an operating manual and it contains many sections regarding different areas of foreign affairs, including the issuance and revocation of visas. In sections 300, grounds of eligibilities and ineligibilities are cited, usually based on requirements imposed by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Some procedures are unclassified, others are still redacted. INA 212 or 8 U.S.C. 1182 lists groups of foreign nationals ""who [...] are ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the United States"", in which section you will find many provisions corresponding to the questions asked."
"Dec 30, 2016: India demonetized all Rs 500 & 1000 notes. What do I do with my leftover cash?","Exchange them for another currency (or denomination, if you want to and can) as soon as possible.  If somehow that didn't work, your only choice would be to physically send them to a friend in India. (If you have one you trust enough.) You could send it by mail or courier, using a tracking number. Your friend would then deposit them into their bank account. (And hopefully wire you something back :) ) Of course, this assumes the amount of money you have is actually significant enough for it to be worth the trouble. The more time passes after this announcement, the less likely it will be that money changers are going to take them. According to the announcements, Indians are being asked to deposit all these notes into their bank accounts (or change them, if it's a rather small amount) by December 31. The idea seems to be that people with a few thousand in honest cash can do this without issue, but someone with 10 million of black money can't. The Indian Prime Minister said today: ""Black marketeers and traitors who use black money will not be able to
  move large amounts of money and 500 and 1,000 rupee notes will become
  worthless pieces of paper. Those citizens earning honestly and with
  hard work, their interests will be protected.” Modi emphasised that citizens who had 500 and 1,000 rupee notes need
  not panic, as cash could be deposited at banks or post offices until
  the end of 2016. He said: “These steps are a part of our battle
  against corruption, black money and counterfeit notes. The ordinary
  citizen who is struggling, will be strengthened … There is no need for
  you to rush to the bank tomorrow, you have 50 days.” Emphasis mine. The effect this will have in India is that as the days pass, fewer and fewer people will want these 500 and 1000 bills anymore. Everyone who has them (provided it's a reasonable amount that won't attract the attention of tax authorities or law enforcement) will go and deposit them in their bank accounts. As we approach December 31., businesses, etc. will start dealing in lower denominations and/or the new replacement notes. Update, November 9th: This is already happening. From my local supermarket today:  So, these old 500 and 1000 notes will get less and less popular as time passes, and eventually the only ones who will take them will be Indian banks. And after December 31, even the banks won't. The notes will then be mere pieces of paper. It's a bit difficult to say how exactly this effect will play out with money changers abroad. But if you have a significant amount in Indian Rupees, I'd suggest you try and exchange it for another currency as soon as possible. As @mts pointed out in a comment, the link from OP says: People who possess Rs.500 or Rs. 1000 currency notes after December 30
  can exchange it at Reserve Bank of India by providing a declaration.
  This is till March 31, 2017. This is useful, and will probably reduce the drasticness of the effect. Even if you're going to India before March 31, though, this sounds like a rather inconvenient thing to do. Also, I'm not sure whether or not people who are not Indian citizens will be able to do this. That's speculaion, though, but in any case, I wouldn't put my money on this (literally.) I would try to change the notes as soon as possible."
What is the closest airport to the center of the city it serves?,"San Diego, California and SAN: about 1.5km from downtown to the airport perimeter, and just over 3 km to the main passenger terminal."
Is it illegal to take a piece of the Berlin Wall?,"Edit: The new answer by Jack is quite excellent! However, unless doing something like that, then: There was a lot of leftover debris while the Berlin Wall was being demolished. That, however, was a long time ago and parts of the Berlin Wall are now being intentionally maintained* as a historical monument. Therefore, removing pieces of it without permission can now only be described as vandalism.  Vandalism is a crime in Germany and punishable by fines, and/or anything from a few weeks to two years of imprisonment (depending on seriousness and history) according to German Penal Code (§ 303 StGB). Also, as @PeterM says in a comment, you may consider it just a ""pebble"", but this is an important historical monument, and it could easily be partly ruined if (hundreds of) thousands of tourists took a small piece each over the decades. Also, different people may have different opinions on what constitutes a ""small piece"". 

I've been asked in several comments to explain why I consider removing pieces from the Berlin Wall to be vandalism.The definition of vandalism is: The act of deliberately destroying or damaging property. Looking at this definition, I think it's self-explanatory that whenever you remove a part of any structure without permission, then that's vandalism. In the case of the Berlin Wall, it's also probably serious, because there's a risk that a large number of people will do it. That is, of course, not to mention the fact that the Berlin Wall is one of Europe's most important historical monuments, and carefully maintained as such. (At least parts of it.)* = If you seek out one of the obscure parts of the wall (these may not be considered monuments, I'm not sure) you may find a piece of it that's already broken off and lying on the ground next to it. Maybe you could somehow manage to confirm that this was indeed once a part of the wall. Given such a lucky find, picking it up and taking it might not be illegal. Anyway, instead of going through all that trouble (confirmation, etc.), Jack's answer is probably a safer bet.  Related: How can I determine if there's a way I can legally take home a piece of a particular landmark? "
What on earth has yet to be explored?,"The ocean floor. Any other unexplored spots pale in comparison with about 75% of the planet's surface covered by oceans, of which hardly anything deeper than 100m has been meaningfully explored. There are literally millions of square kilometers about which we know nothing except a very coarse-grained depth profile. There could be a hundred sunken Atlantises and thousands of bizarre bottom-dwelling species nobody has ever seen. "
Are 500 Euro notes accepted by banks in Spain?,"Stores They are practically very rarely accepted. Not sure about how legal that is, but some stores even explicitly put signs they don't accept 500 EUR bills. e.g. like this one (although this one is not from Spain):  Banks For banks - I would be surprised if private banks where you don't have account, would go for breaking 500 into five 100s for you.
Probably only the national bank would do that - not sure how that works in Spain and how available are they."
I may have broken ESTA rules without knowing. What to do now?,"So now, what are my risks? None. Are you going to walk up to an immigration officer and say some years ago I broke immigration rules that US Immigration does not know about? They will think you are probably going insane. Your violation was not willful and clearly you are remorseful. What would be the potential implications on my situation to my green
card application? Virtually none. Unless once again you go and rat out yourself. Why would you do that?"
"On a plane, who has the right to the overhead bin?","You have no right to the bin above your seat. For those exit rows where you cannot put anything beneath the seat in front of you, flight attendants will generally try to help find some space somewhere for at least your small personal item, but any passenger may be required to check their bags rather than put them in the overhead bin. It is entirely possible that the airline didn't enforce the bag limit, but the overhead bins can easily fill up even when the limit is strictly enforced. If every passenger, or even most passengers, brings a regulation sized carry-on on a full flight, it is obvious that many of the bags will not fit in the bins and will have to be checked. In some cases, overhead bins may be marked as reserved for first class or premium economy passengers (or safety equipment, or pillows and blankets). Even in such cases, cabin crew may fill these bins with other bags in an attempt to accommodate as many passengers as possible, and a late-boarding passenger may be caught out with no space. It is hard to imagine that they are likely to remove and check someone's bag so you may have that space. Overhead bin space is typically first-come first served, and at some point, they will declare the bins full and start checking bags (sometimes even before the bins are actually full). Note that if your bag must be checked, you should ensure you remove any essential items (medication, passports, keys, etc...) and any valuables, along with any hazardous material that cannot be checked, namely spare (uninstalled) lithium batteries including external power packs.  Boarding as early as possible (which, on some airlines, could require frequent flyer status or paying an extra fee) will help secure you overhead bin space."
Can I fly with white powder in a transparent bag?,That bag would show orange color on an x-ray machine which is the color for organic material (on most machines) and it would be very obvious even between layers of clothing which are also organic but would show a different shade(powder bag would be a very dark shade of orange). If I looked at your bag for a fraction of a second I would most likely pull it out for physical inspection and then it really depends on the person who would deal with you and ask questions. The amount of time you spend there really depends a lot on your profile (like it or not but that is how it works) and the answers you provide if your bag gets pulled out for further investigation. My advise to you would be to carry your coffee powder in the manufacturer's packaging. Keep it sealed if possible.

United Airlines joined my first name and middle name on boarding pass. How to correct this?,"There's nothing to correct. This is very common with airline reservation systems, and everyone handling your boarding pass should know what it means."
"So what can I do to avoid being ""that"" passenger with bad hygiene?","Lots of options! Starting with the ones that require no forward planning: Ask an attendant if they have disposable wet wipes available, or ""hand sanitizer wipes"". Many if not most airlines do, and some even give them to everyone to clean their hands before or after eating (seems to be particularly common in Asia). Even those that don't do this will often have a small supply available on request: they're useful for parents, germophobes and people who are ill or travel-sick (as well as the self-consciously sweaty). Then lock yourself in the lav and use them to freshen up. This is a favourite item for ""10 things you didn't know you could ask for on a plane"" type list articles:  If you forget to pack your own sanitizing wipes, ask a flight attendant since they usually have them on hand. Some more options when you can plan ahead before a long, complicated or hot and bothersome journey, in order of decreasing easiness: Bring chewing gum, and/or one of those travel toothbrush/tiny toothpaste sets, often sold at airports, sometimes not unreasonably expensive. For example:  Bring your own pack of wet-wipes, to make the self-cleaning process easier and reduce any embarrassment of having to ask an attendant for one (though trust me, they won't bat an eyelid, they've see so much worse...)"
Which European cities are connected by convenient night boat?,"One popular overnight ferry close to where I live is a DFDS ferry from Newcastle to IJmuiden (Amsterdam). Both cities have plenty to offer for short trips and the fare is quite cheap if you get an off season deal and are a foot passenger travelling in a group. Last time I got it, it took around 14 hours overnight. Alternatively here is a map of some of the major European ferries. Simply Google the route and you will find the operator. Unfortunately, there wont be many overnight ferries because of the short distances between land. "
Why are there so many nonstop flights from London to Geneva?,"Geneva airport punches a little above its weight (population) because the city hosts many international organisations (it's the UN most important location after New York and was the League of Nations seat before that) and some banking and other services for the rich and famous. Many powerful wealthy people from Europe, the Middle East and Africa have villas on the lake shore or in Divonne-les-Bains (that's in France), shop in the rue du Rhône and get treated at Geneva hospital (it can see half a dozen heads of state or government a year and allows you to arrange anything from a private room to a private wing during your treatment). This accounts for the good service by the main Middle Eastern carriers and also for flights to some obscure destinations (although most have disappeared in recent years). But I don't think this is the main reason for low-cost short-haul flights to European destinations. In the last decade, the number of those has increased a lot, with a low-cost pier (longer walks and no jet bridge) catering specifically to them, presumably with lower fees than other gates or large hubs like Zurich. For flights from random cities in the UK, the main factor is probably that Geneva is just a convenient location to fly to to skiing resorts in the French, Swiss or even Italian Alps. In season, there is a long row of shuttle bus operators to all the main resorts in the Northern French Alps waiting just outside the main exit. Another detail supporting this theory is that many flights from London (but also from other places in the UK and some in the Netherlands or Scandinavia) are seasonal and/or limited to the week-end. In fact, according to Wikipedia, there is an entire terminal which is only used during the winter charter season.  Finally, “EasyJet” is actually several distinct companies. The largest one by far is the British company, which created the brand. But there are smaller airlines using the same brand, including EasyJet Switzerland. It's actually the remnant of an earlier venture, which was partly bought and rebranded as an EasyJet franchise. It is based out of Geneva Cointroin airport, making it EasyJet's second hub after London-Luton and accounting for 40% of the airport's traffic according to Wikipedia."
How do I get an engagement ring past security/customs in an airport without alerting my significant other?,"USAToday actually wrote an article on this a while back.  The key points were: Keep it in its box, safe and secure.  (It may actually make it clearer on an xray) Avoid wrapping the box. Security may ask you to unwrap wrapped packages. Attach a small note - eg ""Engagement ring inside, please be discreet"". Put it in a clean sock or similar, as an extra visual layer of protection, but will still be easily identifiable on an xray Put it in your carry-on (you don't want your checked luggage going missing with it) Fill the rest of the bag with books, magazines etc - but NOT toiletries or other items that may prompt a security search Keep an eye on security, and if they stop your bag, try and distract her with a task while they check it (get her to find something, or buy something) In terms of dollar value being a problem, it may be worth keeping a receipt to show value in case of any doubt (some countries limit the value of gifts or items you bring in)."
Who compensates my UK train ticket when the train in the ticket didn't exist?,"After a little bit of digging, it looks like the problem you ran in to was indeed the responsibility of Southern Railways. Hidden on the relevant National Rail engineering works page it states Services between East Croydon / Clapham Junction and Watford Junction / Milton Keynes will not run between Shepherds Bush and Watford Junction / Milton Keynes Central. Please note, these services have been suspended due to a shortage of train crew. Customers should use alternative routes. More details can be found here. Customers should use alternative Southern service to / from London Victoria, London Underground services by any reasonable route between London Victoria and Stanmore, and on London Northwestern Railway bus services between Stanmore and Milton Keynes Central via Hemel Hempstead. As MadHatter states in the comments, you should thus be able to claim compensation from Southern via Delay Repay."
"Overstayed my US visa for over 9 years, never got deported, can I return as a tourist?","I know somebody in a similar situation to you: she lived illegally in the US for some years, and many years later she wanted to return as a tourist. Although she would otherwise have been eligible for the Visa Waiver Program, her local US Consulate recommended that she apply for a visa because of her history. She got a visa and visited the US without any problems.  When applying for the visa you will be asked whether you have ever overstayed in the past; you can answer yes to this and still get a visa, but if you lie and get found out you almost certainly won't."
Why do airlines offer flight itineraries with unrealistically short layovers?,"Airlines, in conjunction with airports, set a minimum connection time (MCT) for combinations of flights at a certain airport depending on a number of factors, such as whether one is international and the other domestic. The airline will offer you any flight that meets MCT and typically shows flights with either the lowest total duration or lowest cost first. Due to schedule padding this is usually sufficient even if it seems unrealistic. I've had very short connections at huge airports and due to schedule padding have arrived half an hour early and could stroll to the connecting flight. Airports typically want you to have a longer connection as they're likely to gain additional revenue from the passenger from shopping and eating, so I don't believe they will want to shorten this. Airlines typically don't gain additional revenue for any particular length of connection, but do run the risk of revenue loss if they have to compensate passengers (e.g. EU261/2004) or risk rebooking losses due to leaving with seats empty and risk delays due to having to unload luggage in some cases. Overall, I don't think airlines have much incentive at all to have risky short connections, but do so mainly as a convenience for the passenger. Edit: Unless you're connecting with the exact same aircraft (unusual), the two flights are independent and there is no revenue gain due to minimising the connection time. I believe the other answers that mention this are actually referring to turnaround time."
How does overbooking work with reserved seats?,"If the flight is very full, you typically can't reserve a seat. You would get a message like ""Seat reservation is currently unavailable for this flight, please select a seat during check in""  This can ALSO happen during check in: you may get a boarding pass without a seat on it and you are instructed to ""have a seat assigned by a gate agent"". Even an assigned seat is no guarantee. If some VIP with high status and expensive ticket shows up last minute, they may bump lower class passengers.  On full service airlines you can reserve a seat for free during the
  booking These days are mostly gone and the distinction between ""full service"" and ""budget"" has become blurry at best. For example, Lufthansa group now charges $35 per segment for a seat reservation (trans Atlantic). United Basic Economy is way worse and restrictive than, say, Jet Blue. The full service carrier have joined the race to the bottom. Ironically, it's rarely cheaper and the harsh restrictions almost never justify the minuscule price difference. In fact, a flight I booked this week was $300 MORE expensive in Basic Economy than in regular economy. "
Why is my bag never one of the first on the carousel?,"The main reasons on why the OP's baggage never arrive one of the first fall under two broad categories - priority baggages and when you check your baggage. Flight class matters As the OP has pointed out in the question, the order for a baggage to be loaded on the luggage belt (or their equivalent) may depend on the flight class you are flying on. For example, American Airlines's priority baggage delivery states the following eligibility: This service applies only to: First Class and Business Class customers Virgin Atlantic's introduction to Premium Economy states (emphasis mine): Skip the queues With dedicated check in and bag drop, we'll fast track your airport experience. You’ll also enjoy priority boarding and, where possible, your bag will be one of the first off the plane when we arrive. Frequent flyer status also matters Also as @jcaron pointed out in the comments, it can also depend on one's frequent flyer status. As an example, oneworld Emerald and Sapphire members gets priority baggage according to American Airlines and Cathay Pacific; Star Alliance Gold, and SkyPriority members also get priority baggage handling. These benefits are usually offered regardless of which class one is flying in. So it is possible for someone travelling in economy to have their luggage delivered first on this basis, despite deplaning after the OP. ...but it is not a guarantee. While a common school of thought says baggage operates on a LIFO (last in, first out) system, there is an old discussion on here that questions if it is actually always the case. In some cases, some operators could use a FIFO (first in, first out) system. This can perhaps be achieved if e.g. the origin airport uses the right cargo door, and the destination airport uses the left cargo door (Boeing 787 do have cargo door on both sides, though I am nowhere near an aviation expert and this is pure speculation). Lastly as @RoboKaren points out in a comment, ""LIFO is confounded by the use of baggage carts or by cargo units."" They make the ordering more random, and in this case the first class of reasons will then assume a higher precedence. A footnote on flight class: It is unfortunate that the OP seemed to have rejected his own proposed reason due to a false premise - while it is true that an average non-economy passenger should arrive at the luggage belt prior to an average economy passenger, not all does so on a regular basis due to a variety of reasons. As an anecdotal example, I have travelled on a non-economy class for a few times, and every time I got hold up slightly in the immigration queue (as I am subject to immigration control on where I am travelling), and arrived the luggage hall finding mine and a handful of priority luggages going round and hundreds of passengers from the same flight waiting, perhaps impatiently."
"What do ""Fragile"" stickers on checked baggage do?","Think about what your luggage goes through from the time you check it until you get it back. It travels on automatic conveyor belts. In many situations, it must be shunted from one conveyor belt to another. This is done by machines, not humans. The machines cannot see the ""fragile"" tag. It is moved from conveyor-belt to dolly by a human. The human may, or may not, notice the ""fragile"" tag. It is packed in the cargo hold by humans. Depending on the orientation of the item, the human may, or may not, notice the ""fragile"" tag. When they pack it in the cargo hold, they may put other bags on top of it. It spends some time outside, exposed to the elements. No matter how many fragile tags you put on, there will come a point where your suitcase must make its way up the conveyor belt into the aircraft. If it is raining, snowing, cold, or hot, it will be exposed to the elements at this point. It spills out of an automatic conveyor line onto a rotating baggage carousel. As it rotates on the carousel, other bags may fall on top of it. Other passengers may pick it up, thinking it's their bag, and handle it. When they discover it's not theirs, they may, or may not, honor the ""Fragile"" sticker. Oh, and let's not forget: It flies through the air, at 40,000 feet, at 600 miles per hour. It may encounter bad weather or turbulence, causing intensive shaking of the contents for a prolonged period of time. When all is said and done, it's a miracle anything gets anywhere unscathed, ""fragile"" sticker notwithstanding."
How did this currency exchange work?,"This transaction is written up as the opposite of what you describe. It's written as them selling 50,000 yen to you for $537.93 plus the $9.95 ""service charge""1, for a total of $547.88, with you tendering $547.88. This was caused by an error in how the teller processed the transaction. The teller will have a significant discrepancy when they end their shift and attempt to reconcile the amount of cash they actually have with what is expected.2 This was probably caused by the inexperience of the teller and/or poor training. Any reasonably experienced teller would have known that the big ""Total Due:"" number was what they should be collecting from the customer, not what they were to pay out to the customer. Based on the numbers you provided: You Googled that your 50,000 yen was worth about $450, or 111.1111 yen per $1.3 Assuming they use that number as the actual market rate and have the same difference (18.1624 yen/USD) between it and both their buy and sell rates, they would have sold you USD at 129.2735 yen per $1. This would have resulted in a base of $386.78. They would have then charged you a ""service charge""1 of $9.95 for a net to you of $376.83. Thus, due to the teller's error, you received $171.05 more than they would have normally paid you.4 Airport currency exchange booths are notorious for providing poor rates for currency exchange. Just like many/most things in an airport, the deal you are getting is not nearly as good as you might get by shopping around outside of the airport. There are a good number of other options. What's available near where you happen to be is something that you would need to search for. Sometimes, the convenience of exchanging currency in the airport is something which is worth the price. However, as you did, you should know approximately what the real value is of the money you are converting and judge for yourself if the convenience is worth the cost. 1. I have a hard time not putting their ""service charge"" in quotes when they are also charging more than a 30% spread (the difference between their sell and buy prices, not each individually to the current market rate). A currency exchange spread is generally used to safeguard against short-term fluctuations in the market, not long term (i.e. how long it takes them to re-sell the currency, not hold it for a year). Usually, such a large spread would be the service charge. Using such a large spread to limit their risk in holding the yen is not remotely justified by the historical level of volatility in the exchange of yen. You have to go back to February 2013 to see market rates outside of this range (November 2013 to get below 100yen/$, but it was just above 100yen/$ in mid to late 2016). Thus, one can only consider this wide of a spread as a service charge in itself (i.e. it's primary purpose is to make them more money, not to guard against volatility). 2. From this transaction alone, they will have 100,000 yen more than expected and $1,095.76 less USD than expected. Both of these are just double the actual currency transaction, as the issue is that the exact opposite took place than what was entered into the system. Note that this will be the discrepancy vs. what the system expects the cash will be, not what they would have had if the transaction had occurred correctly. 3. 111.1111 yen/USD is probably a bit high, but it's what the ""about $450"" from the question works out to. Exchange rates have varied between 108.79213 yen/USD and 112.15677 yen/USD over the last month, but was below 111 for almost all of that time. The current rate is 109.66 yen/USD. A Google search will provide you with places where you can get historical exchange rate data and graphs. 4. Remember, these numbers are based on the assumption that the exchange's spread is centered around (likely) the actual market rate on that day (for which you only provided an approximate number). Thus, the calculated numbers should only be considered approximate."
Is there any list of countries I should not visit if I want to go to the US?,"There is no list published by the US government as mentioned in other answers, but I know people who were refused US visas in different US embassies/consulates because they have visited one or more of these countries: The list could be longer, and visiting one of these countries doesn't mean you will be refused; but, it matters, because they have a field in the visa application about the countries visited in the past 10 years. The guys I know were asked questions such as ""what's the purpose of visiting"". The rejection/approval totally depends on the interviewer and/or your answer. I have noticed the younger you are the higher chance of getting refused, if you visited one of these countries. I guess they believe the younger you are the easier your brain to be washed with anti-US stuff. Also I have noticed people who go to the US on regular basis they do not get refused! Usually these people have family ties. The last thing I have noticed is people who are from those other countries might have better chances of getting the visas while people who visited those countries might not get it! I also think the same logic applies for people who need electronic visas, where no interview is required, except from the customs guys upon arrival. Anyway, as long as you already obtained the visa, then the chances of being asked again at the immigration/customs are low. BTW, I work for a multinational company, many of the employees are required to have a US visa for business trips (hundreds) and that's my source. Also, I have been to all countries in the aforementioned list and I was asked the reason behind my visits but I always was granted the visa."
How does the taxi scam work at Luohu station in Shenzhen?,"It happens that I am a native of Shenzhen, and indeed we avoid those ""illicit vehicles"" (or ""black cabs"", hei che 黑车 in Chinese) at all costs. The perceived risk is that they might demand exorbitant fees from you when you eventually arrive, or are half-way. Only God knows what will happen if you refuse to pay them anyway. It might be keeping you inside the vehicle, throwing you off in the middle of nowhere, or even kidnapping, or even worse than that. ADDENDUM: There are actually two types of ""black cabs"". The first type do not conceal that they are operating extra-legally, and demand high fares (up to 5-10 times of normal cab fares) upfront. Those usually do not expose you to too much risk (of course, unless you refuse to pay after the ride), besides rudeness, dangerous driving and overloading. I have never had good experiences with those vehicles, though (the vehicles can be very sketchy and overloaded), and I recommend against them unless absolutely necessary. The second type of ""black cabs"" are what you have mentioned. They claim to be metered taxis, but are in fact not. (Many of them operate using junk taxicabs which have been retired, purchased from the black market, or using modified cars with rigged meters obtained from the black market, and with fake or forged license plates.) Those are outright illegal, and are known to extort passengers for exorbitant amounts of money. If you refuse to pay, they may lock you up inside the vehicle or throw you off in middle-of-nowhere (forget about getting another taxicab); personal injury is also not unheard of. The police can't do much about it, because of the large amount of operators involved and the difficulty to track those vehicles. Avoid those at all costs; if you ever get in to one of those vehicles, you basically can do nothing but pray for the best."
Button for pedestrian traffic lights in Germany,"There are three similar cases. There have been examples of the first case where the button has no effect and the green light comes according to schedule anyway. Either this has been done as a placebo to keep pedestrians from crossing at a red light, or the traffic lights of the intersection are not configured as originally inteded and the button wasn't removed."
What time zone do trains in Russia operate on?,"All trains in Russia for years have operated on Moscow time. It's only slightly unsettling when you get to your train in Yekaterinburg and find out it's not there, but the upside is most of Russia is ahead of Moscow in terms of timezones, so worst case you'll arrive early, rather than late. However, it now appears that is changing as of August 1, 2018 (source): Tickets for journeys from 1st August, which can be purchased from 4th
  May, will be printed to display arrival and departure times in local
  times, however, tickets before this date will still show arrival and
  departure times in Moscow time.  Train stations will continue to have clocks that display both Moscow
  and local time for the current time. Seat61 confirms this: RZD (Russian Railways) has announced that for travel dates from 1
  August onwards it will abandon the long-standing practice of using
  Moscow Time for trains throughout Russia.  It will finally switch to
  using local time, with the difference from Moscow Time in brackets,
  for example (MCK +5), in its timetables and on its website.  Phew! This is for intercity trains. Local commuter / suburban trains (eg in Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg) operate on local time."
What does YCWCYODFTRFDTY mean?,"Actually, various sources on Google told me ""Your curiosity will cost you one dollar for the Royal Flying Doctor thank you""
.

 The Royal Flying Doctor Service provides routine and emergency medical services to remote rural communities throughout Australia. Here's one source, scroll down a little way. Edit:  it was my understanding that the RFDS was entirely funded by donations but it seems this is not the case. I've removed that reference from my answer, but don't let that stop you donating!"
Can I travel from Germany to England alone as an unaccompanied minor?,"My answer will be about how to get help in a ""complicated situation"". Other people have already explained that you need permission from your parents to travel; and the police will return you to your parents if they notice you haven't one. While we do not know you situation, there are a number of ways to get help to resolve a difficult situation. Even if you don't know any adults that you trust, or if you don't want to call the police. Many Germans speak English quite well. If you do not speak German (or do not speak well), you can still try any of the numbers below and try to speak English. If it does not work, just try and call again. I didn't answer the original question. Other people have already done that, and I agree that the original plan will most likely fail. I felt it was important to give some concrete leads on where to find help, other than a generic ""just talk to someone""; and to make clear that you can call somewhere anonymously if you need to - even if this is somewhat out of scope for Travel SE."
"I'm from Mumbai, India. I want to travel to Europe as a tourist but my salary is low ( €190/month)","I'm sorry, but you are not in a financial position to travel around Europe right now, and you would be well advised to wait until you have a larger income or savings to fund your trip. 190 euros/month is 6 euros a day.  Not only is this insufficient to travel, but in much of Europe it's not enough for a single meal if you're eating out.  Generally speaking (it's a wide area with varying prices), a realistic rock-bottom backpacker budget in Western Europe is around 50 euros/day, meaning you'd want around 1,500 euros -- that's 8 months' salary for you -- saved up. The only way you could possibly make this work now is if you live at your friend's place (so no accommodation costs), cook all meals at home, and stick to free attractions reachable on foot/bicycle from their place.  This would be incredibly limiting and unlikely to be worth the considerable expenses of flight tickets, visas etc, and it's highly unlikely your visa would be approved if this is what you claim to do."
Have I been “Required to leave the UK”?,"This question is asking if you were deported, removed or ""required to leave"" the UK because of illegal entry or overstay. If it applied to you, the Home Office would have served you with paperwork (e.g. an IS151 form) stating that you were being removed, deported or required to leave (which ever the case may have been). You were actually admitted to the UK, albeit for less than six months, and provided you didn't overstay and the Home Office didn't explicitly ask you to leave via paperwork, you should answer No to this question."
What is the longest stretch of the Autobahn that is guaranteed to have no speed limits?,"I didn’t find any maps that included the actual lengths of stretches, but I found two that at least tell you the speed limit (or absence of one). I entered the legs into Google maps to get their lengths. I found one map on autobahn-speedhunter.com from 2012 (according to copyright) and another from autobahnatlas-online.de (link to the second map’s colours’ explanation; solid blue streches have no limit) from 2009. The autobahnatlas map is from 2009 and no longer maintained due to the work involved. The speedhunter one relies on input by users to report new (or removed) speed limits thus it may or may not be entirely accurate. To the best of my knowledge there is no official source and documentation of the beginning and ending of speed limits. Contestants for longest stretches with the validity caveat given above, taken from the autobahn-speedhunter map: Note that I have the feeling that the map is not entirely accurate; e.g. autobahnatlas mentions speed limits in the Landshut area on the A 92. Many people have confirmed similar issues with the A96 (a 120 km/h section in the centre around Memmingen), and the A5 (speed limit around Rastatt). I don’t know whether your information will get any better than this, though. Traffic-wise, I would assume the A20 and A31 to be the ones with the least other cars and no significant lorry traffic (although most of these stretches are probably empty at 3 a.m. as Gayot mentioned). The A20 especially was criticised as being just some tarmac in the countryside without any cars travelling on it. Other answers have already said this, but it bears repeating. Be especially careful when driving at very high speeds, especially if you are not familiar with the car! Deceleration is quadratic with respect to distance so if ‘some idiot’ decides to pull over into the left lane at 130 km/h and you shoot in from behind you’ll have some serious braking to do. Worse if there was a curve. 90 % of all drivers think that they are among the best 10 % of drivers. Go figure."
"What is the easiest place to cross the US Rocky Mountains, going to Oregon, in a large truck?","Avoiding hills is simply not an option.  Mountain driving is a lot like a roller coaster. The truck works really hard going up a long, long uphill, and then on the long downhill, gravity takes it and it goes like a rocket.  Mountain driving is all about controlling this.  On mountain driving, especially with trucks, you will often find yourself needing brakes just to avoid exceeding the speed limit. This is a huge problem.  ""Why?"", you say.  ""I can push the brake all day.""  Maybe, but it won't work for long. Brakes are made for stopping at red lights, not descending long grades, and they will overheat, warp (which means a $400 bill on a car replacing them), fade (meaning they will lose braking power) and stop working, and you're a juggernaut.  Happens all the time with trucks, and that's why they have runaway ramps.  If a cop catches you smoking a truck's brakes down a grade, he'll pull you over and find a way to stop you from driving further.  For him, it's easier than spending all night at a fatal accident.    Enter the gears you never use on your shifter - P R N D 3 2 1, those. You have noticed when you lift off the gas on your car, the car ""feels a little bit draggy"", like it's actively being slowed down. If you select a lower gear (and you can select them while moving), it will become more draggy.  Quite a lot more draggy the lower you go.  That is for descending long hills.  The way I explain this is to downshift enough that you don't need to use your brakes at all. When you need to use a little bit of accelerator pedal to keep the vehicle at desired speed, you're in the zone. That keeps you safe.   Since you're trying to spin the engine to slow the car, this is a great time to blast the A/C on full, as this is ""free"" and won't overheat the engine.  With modern automatic transmissions, it's easy - just put it in top gear and push the gas until you're at the top of the  hill. (then downshift.) However, there's a different gotcha -- this will make the engine much warmer than you're used to.  Running this and air conditioning too can overheat your car/truck.  So you have to keep a close eye on your ""Engine temp"" gauge. First, you must know what ""normal"" looks like, so you must learn to watch it ordinarily.  Then, on up-hill sections, keep an eye on it. If it climbs a little bit, no big deal, but if it climbs any more, turn off the A/C immediately -- most likely the overheat will cure itself.   In a pinch, it also helps to blast the heater and open windows (thanks Saaru). This heat comes from the engine and gives it a small bit of additional cooling. Don't get heatstroke! Utah is the loudest about this, but other states agree: they really don't want you driving drowsy, and they hate cleaning up fatal accidents.  If you are starting to nod off, pull over somewhere reasonable and safe, and take a catnap... often an hour will suffice, your body knows. Cops who see you asleep will be happy to see it.  Generally any viable route is going to take you through Laramie, Wyoming.  From there, does the vehicle handle wind well?  If so, proceed west on I-80, which was built through a terrible wind area. Otherwise take US-30 west via Medicine Bow, paralleling the original Union Pacific Railroad and rejoining I-80 near Rawlins.  Wyoming is desolate, so be careful with fuel.  Continue west on I-80 via the Wasatch range, paralleling the Union Pacific the entire way. It's the best route, and it's flatter, which is why UP chose it.   Once in Utah, you'll hit a branch at Echo where I-84 turns northwest.  Take it.  It's your way anyway, and it's much flatter - still following Union Pacific.  (Staying on I-80 will go an hour out of your way and put you on Parley's Summit, the worst grade on the entire 3000 mile length of I-80 - you certainly don't want to learn downshifting here!)  Congratulations, you have crossed the Rockies the easy way (the Union Pacific way). From here, the only sensible road is I-84 west (actual northwest) - some time around Boise you should be planning your route into Oregon proper. "
What is the cheapest regular-priced scheduled flight I can book and fly?,"Internal flights within Cuba are heavily subsidised by the Cuban government. Here is an image I took at Holguin airport of the sales desk for flights to Havana. The flight costs $187MN, which is $6.67CUC or so (the form of Cuban currency that can be converted into other currencies). This works out at £4.46 or €5.33 (about $6 USD)."
How does Expedia manage to sell a room significantly cheaper than the hotel itself?,"Hotels have revenue management departments that seek to maximize profit for the hotel by selling rooms at different prices through different sales channels. The hotel may well have sold the room to Expedia for that price (actually, less than that price, since Expedia needs to take its commission) (or, as Tor-Einar Jarnbjo notes, Expedia could be taking a loss if they gave the hotel a guarantee).  It's important to make sure the prices are exactly comparable. Sometimes rooms are significantly cheaper if they're 100% prepaid in advance (non-cancellable or stricter cancellation policy). There can also be differences in the room type, package offers (such as breakfast), and sometimes amenities (I've even seen a charge for WiFi if you don't book directly with the hotel).  Many hotels, including Hyatt, have a best-rate guarantee program if you book directly through them. They'll match a lower price and give you a bit extra. The hotel would rather get your direct booking (and not have to pay a commission to the agency website). If you see a better deal online than what the hotel offers directly, it's usually worth contacting the hotel to see if they can match or beat it themselves. "
How should I tip if the food is good but the service from the waiter/waitress is terrible in the USA?,"Tipping is for the service, the menu price is for the food.   If the service is bad, leave a small tip.  This will show the wait person that you didn't forget to tip, but felt that their service was undeserving. On the converse, it is important not to leave a poor tip if the food was bad but the service was good.  The wait staff can not make the food better and should not be punished for that.  If this is the case, I would probably not go back to the restaurant again.  I can get a better/different waitperson next time, but the number of chefs is much more limited."
Do you have a GPS signal on board a plane?,"Unfortunately the plane body does an excellent job of blocking GPS signal.  In general if you're in a window seat you will be able to get a signal by holding the GPS near the window (or, for example, on a tray table) - but if you're elsewhere on the plane it's very unlikely you'll get a signal. The exception to this may be the new Boeing 787, which is made primarily of Carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). Not only does CFRP allow for larger windows (which would allow a greater visibility of the sky, and thus more GPS satellites), but it's likely that the GPS signal would pass through the aircraft shell better than on conventional planes. Keep in mind that not all airlines allow passengers to use GPS receivers in flight (they are technically ""radio receivers"" which are often not allowed).  Be sure to check with the specific airline and/or the flight crew to confirm that you are allowed use one."
What street foods can I eat in Italy?,"The single best street food that you can have in Italy is pizza al trancio i.e. a slice of pizza on the go. It doesn't get more typical and local than this. You find this in both bakeries and dedicated pizzeria al trancio. Some cities cut slices out of round pizzas, others out of rectangular ones. In both cases, you walk in the shop, pay a couple Euros, and leave with a steaming slice of pizza.  Second in our list is piadina which is a warm flatbread sandwhich-type concoction originating from the Romagna region. Fillings vary, although you'll typically get ham and cheese versions. Why get a basic sandwhich when you can get a true Italian piadina?  Third is focaccia, which is a simple bread-like product made with pizza dough and some other magic, depending on region and city. You can have them plain, with herbs, olives, tomatoes, or even filled with ham, cheese or whatever you find. Like in the case of pizza, both bakeries and dedicated shops sell them.  Where you find focaccia, you're likely to find pizzette (literally: small pizzas) too. Get a bunch of these and fight your hunger.  In pizzerie, and some bakeries, you'll find a variety of fried products such as arancini, supplì, crocchette, and olive all'ascolana (stuffed olives) (all pictured below in the order they appear). These first are a rice-based dish originating from Sicily, whereas the last are typical to Rome and other southern cities. Crocchette are mash-potato-based and are found mostly anywhere. 


 Typical in Rome is pizza bianca, which is something between bread, pizza and focaccia (see the image below). Most bakeries will have some. The best thing you can do is to walk into a place that sells both bread and sliced-meats and ask them to fill it up for you. Such a place is called a negozio di alimentari or drogheria in Italy. There you go, this is my secret to eating cheap when touring Rome: get pizza bianca and fill it up.  Also typical from Rome, although originating from Ariccia, is porchetta, a spit-roasted pig. Eat a porchetta sandwich and you'll never forget it.  Fried-fish shops (friggitorie) are a somewhat recent trend, but their availability is increasing around the country. You'll typically get a takeaway cone of oil-proof paper filled with fried fish for a couple euros. Beware that those calamari are scolding hot!  Panzerotti are another bakery product, which look very much like a small calzone, only fried. Although originating from Puglia, these can be found in many other regions in Italy. Indeed, Luini in Milan became famous with these.  Pizza and gelato? It's as if I were compiling the most possibly stereotypical representation of Italy. Turns out though that these stereotypes are awesome! As you roam around Italian cities, you'll find them scattered with gelaterie i.e. ice-cream shops. No, none of that pre-made industrially-processed Algida garbage. In Italy you'll find real hand-made ice cream in a million different flavours, shapes and decorations. Don't forget to ask for whipped cream on top.  Every city has their own patisseries, most of which you can eat while walking. Look for a pasticceria i.e. a patisserie shop and ask for the typical desert. In Napoli that would be a sfogliatella, in Sicily maybe a small cassata or a cannolo, in Rome why not try Pompi's famous tiramisù (patisserie images are shown below in the order they appear)? 

 Other patisseries like cornetti (italian version of croissants) and bombe fritte can be found all around the country (patisserie images are shown below in the order they appear).

Why is public transport from/to the airport so expensive?,"Airport transportation is expensive because it can be. The price isn't included in the facility charges because public transport facilities are rarely under the same management as the airport terminals are, and their interests are not necessarily in sync with each other or with passengers. Travelers are captive. In Washington, the bus agency (WMATA) raised the fare for the express bus to Dulles Airport from the standard $3.50 to $6. What are you able to do about it? Nothing, really. The other airports in the region are not comparable in terms of flights, and the next cheapest alternative from Dulles is a $14 bus that only gets you halfway to the city.  Most travelers are on the road for business, and business travelers are relatively time-sensitive and price-insensitive. Soaking the business traveler, after all, is why the sticker price of a Y or B fare can be ten times as expensive as a highly restricted S or L fare.  As noted, there is rarely true competition among airports or other facilities, so they would have no incentive to push ground operators to lower prices as a differentiator. Travelers aren't a voting bloc, and visitors obviously don't vote in the local elections, so they have no political recourse. Indeed, politicians rather take advantage of this situation, passing stiff taxes and fees on hotel rooms, shuttle operators, and car rentals on visitors who might rather be thanked for contributing to the local economy. The reward for seeking lower cost options is relatively low. What's a $25 train ride after a $750 flight, even if the train ride is only ""worth"" $10? After an intercontinental flight, how much energy do you have to chase that $15? Perhaps you'd find the will if you did it every day— but you don't. Airfares prior to the advent of LCCs were quite high, and there was a perception that air travel was for the well-off who would pay for the privilege. I believe this perception lingers in the public, at least in much of the American public, which makes it easy for public and private charges around airports to remain high without fear of scandal. As Mark Mayo suggests, when an airport is situated distant from the main population or business center, and/or the local cost of living is high, the above factors may be magnified. As he also notes, there are often workarounds for the frugal, although they may entail more circuitous or time-consuming routings. One can also choose a more convenient airport, although my #3 and #4 come into play; because the airfare dominates our mental energy, we will actually fly RyanAir, and into HHN instead of FRA, to save a few euros, despite its considerable inconvenience. Moreover, airports like CGH, LIN, or DCA are largely restricted to short-haul flights and often entail a premium for their convenience and popularity with locals, so an intercontinental traveler would need to add a risky and/or time-consuming connection for a cheaper bus ride to the hotel. Getting the nonstop to GRU, MXP, or IAD would seem the superior choice to many, train fare be damned."
"What is the meaning of the swastikas at Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek museum in Copenhagen, Denmark?","Regarding the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek: The collection is built around the personal collection of Carl
Jacobsen (1842–1914), the son of the founder of the Carlsberg
Breweries. According to the same source, parts of the museum were originally Carlsberg's private villa. The rest of what is now the museum then formed around the villa. The Carlsberg Group's official website states: The Swastika is an ancient symbol of prosperity and goodness
in Sanskrit. In 1881 Carl Jacobsen made it the symbol of the beer
produced in his brewery 'Ny Carlsberg' which was a competitor to his
father's 'Old Carlsberg' brewery. Carl had a profound interest in
ancient Greece and Rome where the symbol was also often used. In 1940 Carlsberg stopped using the swastika symbol for good. Apparently, the particular type of gates referred to in OP are from 1882. As you suggest in OP, this was certainly before the Swastika had acquired the negative associations it presently carries (in the West.)

Why don't American traffic signs use pictograms as much as other countries?,"The US has never signed the Vienna convention on Road Signals, which is what is used everywhere in Europe. Neither have Canada and Australia, who mostly follow the US standards on the road-signs. As mentioned in the comments, US road signs are mostly verbiage rather than pictograms, and there's an implicit expectation of English reading proficiency at some minimum level as part of driving requirements. There may be some historical reasons for that (mostly exclusionary/discriminatory, unsurprisingly), but the fact now is that change is nearly impossible. In the US the population is very conservative (in a sense that it is averse to change), and is very loudly protesting any change even if it is objectively for the better (e.g.: loud protests against about, well, any change happening in the US). In fact, coming up with a unified standard within the US was a long process that was only completed in the 1970s and required explicit threat of withholding money from the States by the Congress (and still some States have slightly different rules than others). See here. I mentioned the pedestrian crossing lights in the comment - they used to be ""Walk""/""Don't Walk"" verbiage, but are now a ""Walking person""/""Standing person"" pictograms. That change started in 1971 with the introduction of the pictograms in the MUTCD, and was only completed in 2009 with the removal of the text signs from the code. That was just one sign changed. In addition to Canada and Australia that use similar standard to the US, many other countries didn't sign up to the European convention (many in Africa, South America, China) - see the Wikipedia article. Many of them use a mix European-styled and US-styled signals, but almost all use pictograms (comparison table)."
Why do Indian citizens need many visas?,"I believe the answer is immigration, immigration and immigration (real or perceived). In Europe at least, visa requirements and enforcement measures are motivated mostly by the risk that the people in question would try to enter the country and stay there illegally (and of course all the political posturing around that risk). It could be argued that immigration is generally a net gain for a country (cf. your point about talented people) or that the risk of illegal immigration is overblown or entirely the result of an overly restrictive policy regarding legal immigration but none of this changes the politics. Just to provide some direct evidence of all this, the following is from the preamble of the Schengen visa code: In accordance with Article 61 of the Treaty, the creation of an area in which persons may move freely should be accompanied by measures with respect to external border controls, asylum and immigration. […] As regards visa policy, the establishment of a ‘common corpus’ of legislation, particularly via the consolidation and development of the acquis (the relevant provisions of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 and the Common Consular Instructions, is one of the fundamental components of ‘further development of the common visa policy as part of a multi-layer system aimed at facilitating legitimate travel and tackling illegal immigration through further harmonisation of national legislation and handling practices at local consular missions’, as defined in the Hague Programme: strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union. […] It is necessary to set out rules on the transit through international areas of airports in order to combat illegal immigration. Thus nationals from a common list of third countries should be required to hold airport transit visas. Nevertheless, in urgent cases of mass influx of illegal immigrants, Member States should be allowed to impose such a requirement on nationals of third countries other than those listed in the common list. Member States’ individual decisions should be reviewed on an annual basis. This is only one example but it's explicitly all about immigration. I think the other considerations (reciprocity, passports) only factor in tangentially. Note that until now the EU has not really been insisting so strongly on reciprocity, so that US citizens still enjoy visa-free visits to the whole Schengen area despite the fact that after years of discussion there are still several EU countries whose citizens are not eligible for the Visa Waiver Program. Similarly, some or all EU citizens enjoy visa-free (or visa-on-arrival) access to countries such as Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia and most of South America so reciprocity is clearly overemphasized as an explanation."
Can I exit and reenter a UK station while waiting for a connecting train?,"I can't answer precisely without knowing the full details of your journey and ticketing. Leaving station premises, even when changing trains, constitutes a break of journey*. Some tickets allow break of journey, and others don't. Advance tickets in particular (those that have to be bought in advance and are only valid on one particular train) don't allow a break of journey; there are also some more flexible tickets that forbid it too, though most flexible tickets allow it. Break of journey can also be restricted sometimes by your route, if you do it at a station you're only allowed to be at thanks to certain routeing rules for instance. Breaking your journey when you're not entitled to do so may lead to you being required to pay the difference between your advance fare and one that would have been valid but allowed break of journey, which could be quite substantial: 16.4. If you start, break or resume your journey at an intermediate station where you are
   not entitled to do so, you will be liable to pay an excess fare. The price for this will
   be the difference between the amount paid for the Ticket you hold and the lowest price
   Ticket available for immediate travel that would have entitled you to start, break or
   resume your journey at the station concerned. (National Rail Conditions of Travel). However, having said all this, it is very likely that even if your ticket doesn't allow break of journey, they will very likely take pity on you if you explain your situation to the gateline staff. In all likelihood if the station has barriers you will be allowed out (bearing in mind that using station facilities outside the barriers, if they exist, does NOT constitute a break of journey), and if it doesn't, in all likelihood there will be nobody there to stop you (even if they perform a revenue blockade they will likely not be doing this at the entrance to station premises, but the entrance to platforms instead — people will need to be able to enter the station to buy tickets after all!). I did, however, want to write an answer which explains what the actual rules say. * The National Rail Conditions of Travel, since they were ""simplified"", no longer contains a definition of Break of Journey, but it's generally assumed that the old definition from the Conditions of Carriage likely still applies."
"Car rental vs. buying a car for 1 month, when visiting the USA?","Buying option For a one-month trip, I do not recommend buying and selling a car.  Although it probably could be done, let me address some of the complications with that first, then I'll discuss rentals: Rental option There are much cheaper options for rentals than the one you quoted.  A quick look at kayak.com shows that a rental from LAX (Los Angeles, CA) and drop-off at LGA (New York City, NY) a month later can be had for as little as $1792 including tax. Of course that does not include fuel, and likely does not include extra insurance.  You also may or may not be able to take this vehicle into Canada.  Different rental agencies will have different policies (and possibly extra costs) for taking it into Canada.  You'll just have to ask. This rental option may take you over your $2000 budget, but you might be able to cut corners by renting multiple vehicles at different times during your stay.  If you'll be staying in L.A. for a week, for instance, maybe use public transport while you're there, and only rent a car at the end of your stay for the next leg of your journey.  You can also count on a more reliable car. If you pick a nation-wide rental company, they might change your car along the way in agencies and you have customer support if you have any mechanic problem. You also drive a quite recent car."
Are drivers from mainland Europe likely to end up in an accident when driving in the UK?,"Are there any statistics showing the likelihood of mainland Europeans crashing in the UK? (my emphasis) No, not that I can easily find,  The Scottish government publish the following: Tourist activity does significantly boost road accident numbers in the rural tourist areas of Scotland and visitor drivers, including foreign drivers, are involved in a measurably greater number of accidents in the
case study areas. Tourist Road Accidents in Rural Scotland Note the second point there. It may be important to distinguish between ""tourists"",  ""foreign drivers"" and ""UK visitor drivers"" - It isn't immediately obvious if the authors include Welsh, English and Northern Irish tourists in ""foreign drivers"". The fourth bullet point suggests not. It is also worth noting that driving on rural roads in Scotland is very different from driving through London in the rush hour. The report draws this useful conclusion: The data revealed that foreign drivers appear to have
  difficulty remembering which side of the carriageway
  to drive on. This may occur when no other traffic is
  around or when they come to the end of a single track
  road and rejoin a two lane single carriageway, or at
  view points and resting places So, drill yourself to pay extra attention in those situations :-) There are some other UK statistics that might be used to produce some measure of the additional risk - if other data could also be found. For foreign truck-drivers, the accident rates on motorways are eight times higher. A third of accidents involving foreign lorries happen on motorways – nearly eight times higher than the national average rate for the UK's 70 mph highways – with experts blaming drivers unfamiliar with UK highways, driving on the 'opposite' side of the road and often blind-sided. Daily Mail For foreign drivers in general, there were 18,865 accidents in the UK in 2006 giving rise to insurance claims. Insurance claims involving foreign EU drivers in the UK have grown every year from 2001 to 2006 according to data from the Motor Insurers Bureau (MIB). Since 2001, collisions involving EU drivers have risen by 61.4% from 11,685 to 18,865. AutoCar quoting Motor Insurer's Bureau Unfortunately these figures are insufficient to work out the increased likelihood of foreign drivers having an accident in the UK - I think I would need to find numbers of drivers (and/or road-miles traveled) for each group)"
How does the Schengen 90/180 rule work?,"Prometheus's answer was originally correct but the Schengen Borders Code has been amended by Regulation (EU) 610/2013 to counter the court's interpretation. As of October 18, 2013 your stay should be “no more than 90 days in any 180-day period”. In particular, you should have been present less than 90 days during the past 180 days when leaving the Schengen area. Information about this is available on the website of the the EU commission along with a calculator. Also note that the new rules are in principle not applicable to citizens from the following countries: Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Mauritius, and Seychelles. For these countries the old rules still apply because the visa waiver agreements still contain the older definition. In any case, the rule always applies to a person. It does not matter if you have several passports, Schengen visas or nationalities."
What regulations should a European driver know when driving in the US?,"The other two answers pretty well covered things, but here are a few more notes: Additions (2011-07-19):"
"My home country claims I am a dual national of another country, the country in question does not. Problem?","The Dutch government does not have any special authority to declare you to be (or not to be) a citizen of Belgium. Based on what you tell, it seems likely that the Dutch authorities had you registered as a dual Dutch-Belgian national based on your parents saying so when you were born -- apparently your father was unaware that Belgian nationality law had changed in 1985 so that you would only inherit his Belgian citizenship if your birth was reported to Belgium within 5 years. (At the time your father inherited his Belgian citizenship, simply being born to a Belgian father was enough). Ordinarily there would be no reason for the Dutch authorities to attempt any independent verification of this information. In other words, the do not make any unilateral ""claim"" about your nationalities, but just kept a record of what they were told by someone who presumably knew. Since, since 2014, the Dutch civil registry does not store information about additional citizenships of Dutch nationals anymore, there is probably nothing you need to do to correct this mistake -- except that if the information surfaces in a different context you'd want to set it right with the organization it surfaces with. In any case, it is hard to imagine that this administrative mistake could cause you any travel problems in particular. When you need to fill out forms that ask for your nationality, simply state the truth -- that is, Dutch not Belgian -- and there'd be no reason for a third country's government to care about the fact that some administration somewhere that is neither them nor Belgium once had the mistaken impression that you had Belgian citizenship."
"What's the right answer to ""Check, Savings or Credit"" for an overseas card in Australia?","At point-of-sale terminals, cheque and savings transactions are processed through the domestic EFTPOS debit card system.  As far as I know they only accept locally issued debit cards. Credit transactions are processed through the relevant international card scheme (Visa, Mastercard, etc).  Despite its name, they accept both debit and credit cards issued under the scheme."
Am I supposed to respect traffic signs that are upside down (in the USA)?,"Yes, any sign posted in the US is intended to be followed unless it explicitly has an X over it or it is covered up. Most likely the top screw of this sign has come loose and no maintenance has been done to fix it. Typically signs that are meant to not be respected are covered with black plastic or a board so they aren't even legible. However, yellow signs like the one in the picture are advisory and following them exactly is usually not obligatory."
"Was I scammed by BoraJet? They cancelled the flight, promised to pay for another ticket - it didn't happen","Here is a goverment site in English version that you can fill a complaint form. It is dedicated for passanger's rights. The passanger rights regulations (sorry, I could find only Turkish version) says that you have the right of compensation, if I understood right, it is 100 Euro. Assuming that you provided them your contact information without fault, you are dealing with ""MADDE-6"" (the cancellation of flight) and it links to ""MADDE-8"" (the compensation). Direct link to complaint form."
