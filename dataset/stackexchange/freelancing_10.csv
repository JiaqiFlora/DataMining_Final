How do I get my first job at a freelancing site?,"I absolutely understand what you mean. A couple of years ago I faced the same dilemma. No matter how low I bid, I could never get a project. But as of today if I bid on a project, 90% of the chances are that I will get it. Thanks to more than 110 Five Star Ratings. I was almost on the verge of giving it up but then someone gave me some advice which helped me get my first project. So how did I manage to do it? A. Create a proposal where you explain why you should be picked even though you are new. It could be some thing like Dear XYZ I have been in this industry for XX years and such jobs are my daily practice. This is my first time on this site and hence you can see that I do not have any ratings/testimonials to show you. I can assure you that if you work with me once, you will always work with me for these kind of projects. Now you mention stuff here on why the employer should choose you.... Attach a sample and tell the employer that it can be delivered the moment he chooses your bid... B. Submit samples of your previous work Don't just submit any sample. The sample should be relevant to the current project you are bidding on C. Submit working sample of the current work. If you do not want to do that then attach a video of the working application. I use CAMTASIA to record a video to show how the completed project looks like. Trust me this almost will seal the project for you. Start with these 3 and you will see results very soon."
Tracking hours you are working for clients,"I approach things somewhat differently.  I answer customers via email, guaranteed responses free of charge that take less than 15 min free of charge.  My reasoning here is that this gives me a chance to give them some ideas, whether I can do more for a charge, and then if I need to, I can throw more sales work at it (unbilled) to flesh out what is involved and make a bid.  Often little requests for help/tech support can be cases where a trained eye can see larger problems lurking and it is good for both sides to be on the same page here.  I do try to batch these up however so that there are few interruptions and the fact is that customers usually don't like to call me for these things anyway so it works out well for everyone. This being said, and this is a total conflict of interest because I am the most active developer on the project but I use LedgerSMB for my business management and accounting, and I use the timecard functionality there (to track time allocated per project, each project attached to a customer).  I can then use the program to generate sales orders and invoices from the timecards.  This also allows me to run an income statement of a project to see what my profit margin is etc. Time tracking is almost never exact, but I usually don't have more than three projects I work on any given day, so I do timecards once a day.  If I were working on many more I would probably do timecards both at end of day and just before lunch."
How do you make family understand that you need to stick to a schedule?,"It sounds like your wife may be a bit bored. She obviously wants to spend some time with you, but you also need to be able to focus on your work so that you get paid. One possible solution, one that may possibly get her excited, is to give her something important to do.  While she may not be a web designer or a programmer or have the skills to do whatever it is that you do for a living, there's generally a lot of administrative type work that goes along with freelancing, such as taxes, putting together invoices, tracking expenses, etc. So you can possibly save yourself some time that you would otherwise spend on these activities by delegating them to her. The advantage of this solution is that you get to spend time together while you work, make her feel like she's an important part of the process, and get done with your work even earlier so that you can then spend more quality time together. Everybody wins. Of course, you still need be clear that you need to be able to focus if you're working on a challenging problem. "
"Hourly billing, is it appropriate to include time to research if you don't know how to do something?","This is a good question that I'm sure many people face when starting out. You need to decide on your pricing model first: are you billing by the hour, or by the project? There are advantages and disadvantages to both, but it essentially comes down to your skills, and what the client is willing to pay. I have seen many animation or graphic projects (I call these ""creative"" projects) where they attempt the hourly rate, but the client never agrees to pay those ones! These are where you have a project billing. Then there are other IT related jobs I have done that were by the project, but should have been by the hour. I learned my lesson quickly on this particular incident... If you don't know something, you need to figure it out before you start the project. This should be done in the discovery phase of your proposal. Do not invest too much un-paid time into research for one single project; if you do research it should have value in many future projects, otherwise you're wasting your time. When I research stuff, I am always asking myself, ""How can I implement this for other clients?"". If I can't, then it usually gets billed in, either with the project or my hourly rate (agreed upon in advance). Remember, during the discovery phase, you need to be the expert by asking all the probing questions, so that there are minimal revisions later on. For creative projects, there will always be revisions, and that needs to be accounted for in your quote. For my IT jobs, I quote how many hours it should take in a perfect situation (i.e. all the cables work, the program disks are all available, all the usernames have been given to me, etc). I then estimate any possible issues I may have, and add the cost in. I then pad it with 25-50% markup for anything outside the scope I may have missed when evaluating the client's needs. I give them this price, and mention that it may be lower, it may be higher; if it's higher, then there are serious issues that need to be addressed before I bill more then this amount. This also shows the client you understand they work for their money too, and you don't want to screw them. The best thing to remember though, is that your research needs to be compensated. If you can use it with other clients, great! Don't bill the full amount to the first client to ask you to do something, but include parts of it in future projects. If you are researching for just one client, and don't feel it can be used elsewhere, then you must absolutely bill the client for it! Having said that, 99% of the time, you can use the skills you learned researching for other projects; there is always the exception that proves the rule though."
"How can we prepare for ""getting hit by a bus""?","Without wanting to sound too cut throat about it, I would say that this is firmly the client's problem and not yours. It is in their interest to ensure that they have source code in a location that they can get hold of it and that they have full access to everything that they require to access the system.  If you're concerned about this and want to show due diligence towards your client in regards to it, you could make use of one of the cloud platforms, such as Amazon Web Services or Windows Azure, to host the website, and ensure that someone within the client's organisation has login details. Likewise you can use a cloud source control provider such as Bitbucket to ensure that they can access the source code at any time. This is unfortunately a risk in any organisation that relies on a single individual to build a website/software system."
Where can I find good contract templates?,Master Service Agreement templates: Statement of Work templates:
"At what point is it no longer a ""Free Change""","Here's my insight. Working as a freelancer makes you control your time more thoroughly and prioritize the projects and tasks you are currently involved in.  So, for me, ""marking"" the project as complete means that me and my customer should sit and discuss our future plans: are we going to make updates (software updates, bug fixes, other improvements), what if the customer needs my technical support etc. And, of course, it's your time and should be billed."
When is it ok to ask a client for more money?,"Most people have trouble estimating projects, especially when they are new. When estimating, we tend to think of the project on a very high level and fail to take into account the details involved in figuring a good target estimate. The most logical solution is to prevent this problem by focusing on improving your estimation techniques: To create a good estimate, first break down the project into high level sections that you know will be part of the project. If you're working on a website with a front-end and a back-end, for instance, then you know you have a client-side front-end portion and a server-side backend. For instance, I would break down the front-end by pages, then break each page down by component, then break the components down into work that needs to be done on the front-end and work that would need to be done to populate that front-end with any data.  I'd then gather an estimate of how much time it would take to complete those components. Once completed, I'd look at my spreadsheet. Any tasks that take longer than a day, I revisit and break them down even further.  Ideally, I try to break down each task into subtasks where each subtask takes about an hour or two. By breaking down tasks into subtasks that are measured in just a few hours, I most likely uncover additional details and scope that I would otherwise overlook had I just used my initial gut feeling. Lastly, add an additional 30% for bugs and other problems that may occur, just in case. As soon as you think you might go over your budget, tell your client immediately. If it's still early, you may be able to clarify the scope and negotiate a higher rate on the contract. Explain to the client what part of the project scope you overlooked, and offer to bill for the additional time at a lower rate. If they refuse, then you can decide whether or not the time you've already invested is worth writing off, and if it's worth losing the client. In cases where there would be a huge hardship, you may just want to terminate the project. However, if you know there's going to be more work, or if you know you won't go over your budget by too much, it may be wise to just simply eat the losses, knowing that you'll have more work later and an opportunity to learn from the mistake. No matter what, it's still important to explain that you may have underestimated so that the client isn't surprised by higher estimates later on."
How do I calculate pay rate if I've never freelanced before?,"When you are self-employed or working a freelancing job, there's more to your compensation than simply take-home pay. If you work in a non-freelancing position, you most likely receive health and dental benefits, vacation time, retirement contributions, and your employer pays taxes for employing you. As a freelancer, all of these benefits are items of compensation that you must supply.  What's more, there's administrative tasks you're responsible for that will involve your time and expense, such as tracking hours, billing, filing taxes, marketing costs, advertising costs, and more. When I first started freelancing, I spoke with some colleagues who also did freelancing on the side. They suggested I ask for 3 to 4 times more than I would normally receive.  This has worked out quite well, and these clients have approached me with more problems they've needed help solving. Every job is different though, so be sure to include any costs in the rate so that you cover your expenses and bring in enough income to survive the slow periods when there isn't a lot of work."
How much payment should be required up front?,"There are a bunch of ways people do this.  One way I have seen is for clients pay a retainer and then be billed out of that (of the balance goes to 0, the project stalls until the retainer is refilled).  In general larger consulting businesses can more easily do this than freelancers but once you have a name for yourself, this may be an option. Others range from full billing in arrears to milestones, to 50% down and 50% on completion of a singular project.  These have different benefits and costs, and it is important to think through these before hand. In general I have found that most customers are willing to pay at least 50% up front.  The question usually comes down to what you are willing to take on in terms of the dynamics with the customer.  These include the risk of projects which may have to be delayed or abandoned.  It's a lot easier to decide a customer is too much trouble and to inform them that you are cancelling the project when they haven't paid you than it is when they have."
How can I start freelancing and get online projects to work on?,"(A bit on my background: I'm a PHP developer, and I do all my hourly contracting through oDesk - I have been doing that for quite a while now.) First, getting started can take some time. Not having a reputation / experience contracting is similar to not having a reputation / experience being a PHP developer. Don't be discouraged; I mention this, so you won't feel like you're taking a step back when it's hard to secure a project, or if you end up bidding at a lower rate than perhaps what you're used to making in traditional employment.  Just like you built up experience in your field, you'll need to build up experience in freelancing. But that certainly can be done.  Here's what I'd suggest. Be quick to respond: face it, on the freelancing sites a public posting will get a lot of responses. Use whatever tools are available to be one of the first responses the client sees. In the past, I'd use an RSS reader to track job feeds on oDesk. Give away the secret: in your bid, explain to the client how you'll implement / build / program whatever it is they're looking for. If it's a Twitter application, let them know why they want to use the streaming API instead of the REST API. Give them enough information that they feel like they should use your response to evaluate the rest. Find the right jobs: this is doubly important for oDesk, where you're limited to a fixed number of bids per week. Set up searches that either identify jobs that match your experience well, or jobs that generally have fewer bids and you're able / willing to put in the work so you become experienced enough to respond to those jobs in a knowledgeable way. (Again, oDesk search + RSS feeds can be great here.) Bring your own clients: do you have clients outside these online marketplaces / platforms? Transition them to billing through the platform you like best. That's an easy way bring a local reputation online.  Avoid the bottom: it may be tempting (all the while frustrating) to try to be the lowest bid. Don't do that. Yes, if you're starting out with no reputation as a contractor, you may need to bid lower than you'd want - but don't get caught up in trying to compete on price. This isn't a reverse eBay where the lowest bid wins - there are plenty of clients that ignore low bids, because they understand that reflects at least something about quality. Those are the clients you want.  The first three are what I did to establish my reputation. Anymore do I rarely bid on jobs; generally I just respond to requests (called interview invitations on oDesk). Still, when I respond I try to give the potential client a detailed response that illustrates I am the contractor they want to use.  The fourth is what I wish I could have done, but I started out my freelancing career online. I hope that's helpful."
"Dealing with ""friend"" who won't pay after delivery despite signed contracts","Is this a script from a soap opera?  There's far too much discussion taking place. Business is business and not friendship. Ignore anything not directly related to the business. All the back and forth trying to get the other to ""understand"" your position is, frankly silly. All you should be stating.. ""We have a contract. Pay me."" When he/she replies.. reply with, ""We have a contract. Pay me."" When he/she asks to go to coffee... reply with ""Okay, will you have a check for me?"" When asked to complete more work, reply with ""I'd be happy to after I'm paid for previous work."" Just stop trying to plea with him/her to understand. He/she FULLY understands, they just don't want to or can't afford to pay you. Every single thing you state should be asking for payment or facilitating delivery of payment. Who you are, what your ""Dreams"" or ""goals"" are, how much ""alike"" you may be, etc. are all completely 100% irrelevant and stalling tactics.  Stop being a ""friend"" or former friend and start running a business. If you had a boss... and this client wasn't paying, what would the boss do? Simply put.. file suit, small claims or otherwise... or, write off the money as lost. And if it were me... I'd write off the person who refused to pay me as well. ""Friends"" don't stiff ""friends"" out of paying for agreed upon work when a contract made it clear there was payment due. This person is not your friend. Relevant link: Mike Monteiro: F' You Pay me! WARNING: it does contain adult language. (It's a conference where Mr. Moneiro speaks, discussing issues with payments, contracts, those that won't pay, how to handle it, etc.)"
Fixed price or per hour for a web developer?,"Your best course of action with these kind of clients is to try and get the main scope agreed up front. You can then give the client a fixed price quote, based on how long you think it will take you. I would also be inclined to add on a contingency of maybe 20% to account for the inevitable small changes that they will want to make.  You will also need to make it clear that anything that falls outside of the agreed scope is chargeable on a per time basis. This is why it becomes very important to get as much scope agreed as possible before you start the work. If there are grey areas that you can see, ask for clarification and get that agreed in writing. It will save a lot of pain down the road."
Best approach to finding clients in your own city?,"About Me: I used to work as a Operations Manager with a BPO 4 years ago but I realized that if I worked from home, I would earn triple the salary that I was getting as an OM. So one day, I finally decided to take the plunge and start my own freelancing venture.  Now when I look back, I am happy that I took that plunge... Lot of books will tell you what needs to be done but honestly none of those helped me 4 years ago when I decided to start my own. If you are really serious in becoming a freelancer, here are some unconventional tips which comes from experience. My advice is based on KISS which is ""KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID"" If you still need any help, you can contact me and I would be more than glad to get you started... like I have done with others in the past."
How to get over the discomfort of asking for money?,"[tl;dr: Clients are paying for more than a task to be done, they're paying for you. Understand that, and make that product unique, valuable, and worth every penny.] Here are a few things to keep in mind: Your time is limited: When you're working hourly, the client's not just paying for the work to be done, they're paying for you to do it. A subtle distinction maybe, but a good client (the kind you want to work with), understands that each freelancer brings more to the table than just the completion of a task. They readily pay a higher rate because you're easy to work with, communicate well, can grasp the work quickly, etc. At that point, your rate is not based only on the kind of work you do, it's based on your reputation / availability - and the fact that a client wants you to do the work, not just the work to be done. Be worth it: If you continue to feel guilty, make sure you really are providing the best service available. Are you billing hours to figure out things that it's reasonable for the client to assume you already knew? The higher your rate, the more careful / sensitive you'll need to be about that.  Figure out why your clients are happy paying your rate. Perhaps it's because you're faster than what they've worked with in the past. Realize that there are (depending on local law) various advantages to paying more hourly instead of hiring someone full time - and that's reflected in hourly rate higher than weekly salary / 40 hours. Don't do everything: I had a client that needed a web application fixed. He was very happy with my work. It was completed quickly, and (to him) it was obvious that I was more competent than the developers he'd hired in the past. Once the application was fixed, he also needed someone to edit content on his side (change field names, etc). There's no way he should have a senior developer do what anyone with a basic knowledge of HTML and PHP could do. I told him as much, but (see the first point) he wanted me to do it.  And that's fine - if the client can actually afford your rate. But if you feel guilty that someone who can't afford it is paying you (at a senior rate) to do something that could be done by a far junior freelancer - stick to things that require your experience / knowledge, and find them someone else to do the rest. (If you want your relationship with the client to continue, make sure you find them someone competent.)"
Should I bill my clients for bathroom breaks or other various interruptions?,"I have a simple rule, that guides me on anything related to invoicing the client: the ""sunshine test"". Imagine at some stage in the future your client figures out that you've charged him for X, i.e. although it might have been buried in some other item on the final bill, suddenly there's sunlight shining upon it. Then ask yourself the question: Could I, without hesitation, tell the client why I put this on his invoice - and feel confident that s/he would agree? If the answer is yes, I'll charge, else I won't. And if in doubt, I won't charge. So in your example, I would not charge for these ""events"" if it's a few hour project. If we're talking about a multiple day project payed by day rates, I sure would (assuming we're talking about a few minutes and not hours and hours) - would I work on site with daily rates, I'd have these breaks, too. Other examples where the sunshine test helps: Okay, now let me switch my toggl back to the project and continue working! ;-)"
How to make the jump from normal employee to higher level freelancing,"The obvious answer: Quit your job and don't apply to other jobs. I was in the same boat as you [literally: 6 years, degree, co-op] and have only been freelancing for a short period of time. I quit my job and moved to a new location due to other circumstances. I was initially looking for remote jobs since it was possible that I could be moving again shortly. None of the remote jobs actually worked out for me. In the meantime, I posted ads in classifieds stating my services are available, and I am now working with a few clients. To answer your other questions: How many years of experience is required? I think anyone could start freelancing at any experience level. How do I get started? Let people know you are available. Look in your local classifieds for work. Have a strong social network presence (LinkedIn). (and of-course, quit your current job) Is it just the age thing? Nope. I tried getting some contracts, and I have a hard time finding time on craiglist by just posting my resume. How do I become a contractor and still make full-time wages? It's definitely not easy at first but it is definitely possible. I recommend starting by showing people your skills, having recommendations. I thought the biggest barrier was not having a portfolio, but there are people out there that are willing to take risks and will value that you took a risk in quitting your job. Good Luck! The main reason for saying 'quit your job' is that, if this is something you want to do, you have to just do it. The motivation and learning will come. If you are already in a nice cushy job, you definitely won't be making the jump."
How can experienced contractor survive outside Elance/oDesk/Freelancer?,"I have never used any online freelance service to acquire work. Ever. Not even for one project. Without any direct experience as a worker, they all seemed like a less-than-ideal business venture for me to make market-level money.  I have hired workers from guru.com and have ultimately never been impressed. The hoops one has to jump through make the entire process highly non-customer-friendly. My personal opinion is that good clients aren't using these services and good workers are impossible to discern from the herd of hobbyists. And I know there are good workers using these sites. I've been freelancing for over a decade successfully. While my field (design) is different than programming or development, I have several friends who are developers and pretty much work the way I do. I don't seek, and rarely accept, the small ""one-off"" clients. If they want something quick and easy and then they are done, they aren't the clients I want. That is not to say I don't do these types of project. I will. But I'm fully aware I'm doing this project just so I can earn an extra $XXX quickly to pay for xxxxx. I consider these type of projects as ""bonus"" projects. I never go looking for them and most often turn them down. But if I need a bit of extra cash I may do one here or there.  What I really want is long-standing, good client relationships. I want clients that have ongoing needs. Clients that will repeatedly return to me for more work. Clients that are continually exploring marketing avenues and different ways of pulling customers or clients and continually update, and improve their products or services. I want clients as invested in maintaining their brand and products as they are in making money.  Actual location means nothing in the digital age, especially for certain types of work. I live in a fairly small town and I constantly have enough work. If I had to actually survive on the local market here, I don't think I could.  All that being posted, the local market can be a goldmine for connections.  If I'm doing a simple project and need support from a developer, I contact those I know. In many cases this leads that developer to retaining the client I initially needed support for.  If I'm in need of marketing and list management services, I contact those I know who do that. And again, often this results in that marketer retaining the client I needed assistance with.  I do this whenever needed and in turn, when they have a client in need of my services they contact me. This often results in my retaining their client for the services I provide. Note I'm not referring to sub-contracting the work. I refer the client to these people for the work. I make nothing for the referral except ""good will"". I could choose to sub-contract these sort of things. However, if doing so I then become a project manager and am responsible for the work of others. I'm then dependent upon my ability to translate what the client wants into terms the sub-contractor can use and understand. It's much easier to step away and let the client deal with the service provider directly. I may be forgoing some income in doing this. However, I gain a lot of return referrals. Those referral greatly surpass any possible income I'd generate via sub-contracted labor. These referrals are not competing for my services, they are services which are needed in addition to my work.  If you don't know anyone in tangent fields, start looking. I'm in the US, so obviously this answer is biased in that way. I have no knowledge of foreign markets and what may or may not work in them. All I can post is what's worked for me. Online services reduce you to a username, not a person. I know almost no one that feels any sense of obligation, loyalty, or even cognitive remembrance of a user name. Even reading this answer, you may remember the content of this post but a month from now you probably won't remember who posted it. This is where online services kill your business. You want people to remember you, your name, your work. Not that they ""hired some guy on freelancer.com"". Only direct, face-to-face interactions or specialized services tend to lead to this. TL;DR: In short, you need to expand your circle. Look for those tangent services that would be used to support your work. If you are a developer, look for designers that need development help. If you are an app builder look for designers or developers who are in need of apps or look for marketing professionals who coordinate all this. Those are the relationships you want. They will lead to better clients who are repeat customers. And repeat clients are how you can effectively sustain a freelance business without the stress of constantly looking for work."
How can I mitigate not being part of a big team?,"I know my finances are sound, but how can I reassure the client that I am not going to disappear tomorrow You can't, because there is no guarantee. You could get hit by a bus tomorrow and you and the client need to be prepared for the possibility. How can I word contracts so it doesn't look like a single person but isn't being deceptive You shouldn't. The client should know that it's a one-man show and if they know they shouldn't care if that is shown on the contract—on the contrary, the contract should reflect your situation, otherwise you might get yourself into real trouble. As an example: big companies are usually not dependent on one employee and they can carry out the contract even if one of the key employees can't continue with the project, but you should negotiate a force majeure clause that lets you void the contract with no or minimal penalties if you get hit by a bus and break both your arms. Is it ok for me to ""hide"" that I am, ultimately small time even though I pour my heart and soul into this? Personally I think that trying to give the impression that you are more than one person is not ok, especially if you are selling your personal skills and commitment. Companies are accustomed to hiring individual talent. It's better not to give false impression if you can't live up to it if need be (""You broke both your arms? Can you just pass the project to your coworkers? No? But you said you were 100% sure your company could meet the deadline!"") It's somewhat different if you sell something like an online service through a web site where you might not want to emphasize the size of the content provider."
Client wants to pay a percentage of revenue generated by website,"Don't do it.  If there were actually a prospect of the site making any real money (thus commissions being worthwhile) the guy wouldn't be offering to pay you in commissions. He's offering this payment structure because he knows the return on commissions will be far less than any standard fees you may want. In general, those offering this type of structure don't have enough faith in their own business model to pay for your services up front. If they did, they'd realize in an instant that paying any fees you have directly would be more cost effective than giving up commissions. TO be fair, many would-be entrepreneurs may also see the commission structure as ""Hey! I won't have to pay him/her anything until I start making money."" It may not be a malicious offer, however it's generally not a good offer unless the site/project is already making money and there are already figures for what your commissions would be in place. If he insists upon a commission structure you need to alter it to ensure you get paid enough to compensate you at least a little. A flat fee per month plus commissions. But even then only do that if you really want to do the project. It may be better to lower the initial project fees and supplement that with commissions. For example... standard project fee minus 30%, then 5% royalty on all sales. Working solely on commission creates an unstable client relationship in my experience. If the site makes no money, you make no money. What if the client wants you to spend 60 hours changing the site in order to increase sales? You'll be doing all that for free. What if the site merely trickles in sales and your commissions are less than $50 a month? Are you going to feel it's worth spending time to improve the design in order to increase your commissions? Realize that this may be a ""hobby"" for the owner, a simple secondary income venture, while in most cases it may be your primary job or source of income. So your needs may be much greater than your clients. He may be okay if the site goes 6 months without making a dime. Would you be? If you really want to get into commission-based payments for a business site you should be treating the site as any investor would. Because, make no mistake, he's asking you to be an investor in the business. Not in terms of venture capital or direct money input, but investment in terms of your time and work. However, that's still an investment position.  What's the business plan? 
What's the anticipated user base? 
What's the cost of user acquisition? 
What are the monitization methods? 
What's the rate of user decay? 
What are the projected sales for the first month? quarter? year?  
What type of products is the site selling?  
What's the current market demand for those products? 
How are sales for the current (ebay) system? 
How much time, each month, is anticipated to be needed on your part? 
How long can you expect to wait before you recover your costs? 
Do you like the business? 
Is it something you want to be involved in? 
Are you willing to work without payment in order to try and improve your returns?  Most web designers/developers get approached with ""partnership"" or commission structures regularly. These ventures do not pay well 99.9% of the time. If you think you've got the something in that .1 percentile, go for it. But be aware the odds of you getting paid even your base rates are stacked against you. As for ""knowing he's paying you the right amount"".... as an investor (because that's what you would be) you should have the right to view sales for any given period and those amounts. Put that in a contract. If he's unwilling to do that, then don't walk, run away from his offer."
Too many projects and no one to outsource them to - how is this possible?,"Probably, everyone who's in freelance/outsourcing business have had these problems. I'm not thinking my answer will contain an exhaustive list of your possible mistakes, but here are several ones that caught my eye when reading the question.
Prepend each item with ""possibly"", ""IMHO"", ""YMMV"", etc. A bit of philosophy to answer a question raised in a comment. This is a pure opinion. There's no ultimate answer on how to keep with own tasks.
My (a bit idealistic) understanding is that if I'm getting paid for a job, the job is mine. I can outsource it partially, but I can't avoid personal involvement, quality check, etc. Think of a large company (call them A) outsourcing at a subcontractor (B). B well may have different quality standards (not necessarily weaker than A's, but anyway). In order to place A's label on a product they have to be involved, e.g. run their own testing. This is why you may find cheaper ""copies"" of electronic equipment labeled B (or illegally labeled A). Chances are that you will find absolute copy, but out of a shipment of 100 items, say 5 would fail, while the A's quality allows maybe 1."
"How should I respond to requests to work ""for exposure""?"," This is one of the most prominent red flags which indicates a bad client, in my opinion. It's really not that complicated. Sorry, I do not work pro bono or without payment on request. There's no need to explain any further. If they are persistent.... Unfortunately I do not work for free. Like anyone with a mortgage/rent and the desire to eat regularly.... I expect financial compensation for my work. ""Exposure"" won't pay my bills. If you are actually open to a barter deal.... Another ploy is to ask then for an equal amount of product/services to your fees.. i.e if they sell dog food and are asking for a $6,000 project to be done only for ""exposure"", assuming you have a dog...  ask them for $6,000 worth of dog food and watch how they waffle and waiver. This only works if they already have a product/service.. never let them agree to give you something ""in the future"" or ""when the product is in production"", etc. Because they'll back out or conveniently forget. You can pretty much forget about ""getting a paying client"" out of any such request. If someone offering this proposal had any intention of ever paying for any service, they wouldn't ask you to work for free. If you won't work for ""exposure"", chances are they will go find some other person who will and take advantage of that person rather than pay you anything. If they tell you they will pay after they see you won't accept ""exposure"", they'll low-ball the payment or be very slow to pay, or simply promise to pay and never send a check — knowing that chances are you won't legally follow up on any non-payment. The simple truth is, say ""no"" and move on. Don't waste your time further. There's no need to negotiate or converse further. Good clients never offer such structures. Seriously, never. Because good clients will value your time and skill and will understand that your abilities are worthy of compensation - even if their budget is low, a client worth speaking with won't ask for anything free. It's one thing for a client to state ""that's higher than we can afford"" after seeing a quote/estimate. It's an entirely different matter for a client to approach you and ask for something free. The next red flag would be when they promise you ""a lot of work in the future"" if you help them out with this project by completing it for ""exposure""."
Unprofessional to leave before project ended for better paid project?,"Is it unprofessional - Yes.
Should you skip a lucrative opportunity - probably not. Now, these two things are in collision, as they always are. The only thing you can do here is work the lucrative job in regular work hours, and do the bargain job after that (probably late afternoon and night). So paid jobs are done in the prime time, and low-paid jobs after. Before you do that, you should explain to your friend that you gave them an extra low price cause you are friends, and that you got a lucrative opportunity (2, 3 times more money) and that you have to prioritize that.  They should understand this, though they will not be glad. They may offer you the same money to keep you focused on the job, though they probably won't.  But plan your time carefully, because you MUST NOT leave project unfinished. That's the most unprofessional thing to do and you must not get used to it. The only case you can leave the project if work conditions are horrible (interpersonal relations), but never because at some point you gave them your work for small money.  PS. I am in the same situation. Gave the client 2.5 lower hourly rate cause I was out of work. After that I got 2 lucrative projects, and now I am doing his project a couple of hours at night. I explained to him about this, and he did not complain. "
When is it a good idea to start considering an LLC or incorporation?,"LLCs were created for just this scenario: you're an individual or small business who wants to enjoy the protections being a company or corporate entity entails without becoming a full-blown corporation. An LLC allows you to operate as an individual without putting your personal assets at risk. You pay taxes as an individual (in the US anyways) but enjoy protections against lawsuits and other risks operating a business brings. Given that the costs of establishing an LLC can be trivial depending on the state you incorporate in, it's better to set up an LLC and protect yourself than to take on personal risk."
Non-US citizen freelancing in the US remotely,"From poking around the IRS website (http://www.irs.gov) it appears as if you will not owe income tax in the United States. I am not a lawyer or a tax professional, so I can't definitively answer this for you.  Most of the information is about nonresident aliens working in the US or having a US spouse. However, you may find something applicable in this publication from the US Internal REvenue Service.  http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p54.pdf Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad because there is a section discussing tax treaties. You may have to write (email) the IRS directly with your question.  But from where I sit, it seems to me that the US company hiring you is treating you as a business entity (i.e. a Sole Proprietorship), so it would be handled as a company doing business with a US company. If your hiring company does not send you a tax form showing your US income, you are very likely in the clear. edited to add I discovered this paragraph in the publication noted above (on page 16). I think you are NOT obligated to file or pay taxes in the US (emphasis mine):  The source of your earned income is the place
  where you perform the services for which you
  received the income. Foreign earned income is
  income you receive for working in a foreign
  country. Where or how you are paid has no effect
  on the source of the income. For example,
  income you receive for work done in Austria is
  income from a foreign source even if the income
  is paid directly to your bank account in
  the United States and your employer is located
  in New York City."
What do web developers charge for site maintenance (not changes/updates)?,"Okay, after reading all the answers and comments here, I would like to add a few additional points to my answer. First off, as freelancers we normally trade our time for money. So it seems natural to base the price of a monthly service off of how much time it takes us to do it. And that might be fine if you're just getting started, but like Joe (OP) said, how should you charge for something that took you time to setup, but doesn't take any time to continue running, like a cron job? I think the answer (as hinted at in the comments of some of the other answers), is to look at the value you're providing. Or another way of looking at it: what does the client miss out on if they don't buy your service? There are plenty more, that's just scratching the surface. What's not on the list? ""Joe must be at his keyboard at least x hours per month"" They could care less about the mechanism of how the benefits are delivered, all that matters is whether they get the benefits. Okay so what should you charge? That depends on two factors: What I charge and offer in my maintenance service:
$150/month for the following: I chose $150/month because I figured maybe once per year each client would need some extra attention to resolve a plugin conflict, crash, or something similar. So the months where everything went smoothly would help subsidize the one problem per year, and they don't get stuck with a $1000 repair bill. The last 3 components of my service are mostly automated, but help to round it out and make it look more enticing. "
Do you fix hourly estimation or accept your mistake and do for free?,"I either contract for a fixed price and stick to it - and only those jobs that can be well defined - or contract for an hourly rate and expect the client to stick to it. They can't have it both ways. If you're going to protect them from the cost of an over-run, make sure you've covered yourself for it. The client can choose anytime to reduce the scope, stop the project entirely, or limit me to billing no more than X amount per week. The point of a fixed price is to protect the client's budget and I take the risk, charging for it in my price. The point of billing time and expenses is to allow the client flexibility in the scope and direction of the project, protecting me against changes and unknowns, for which the client takes the risk but with the available ""outs"" I noted above.  Once, when I had to discard some work through my error, I credited the client some hours at his request to retain his good will, but I normally expect to be paid for hours worked if that was the upfront agreement. As an analogy, I once owned an old house. When I'd put jobs out for estimates, the contractors understood ""estimate"" to mean what I would call a ""bid"" - an upfront agreed-upon price. And I'd ask them ""Is this a bid or an estimate?"" It was always a final price. Old houses being what they are - with each task bound to expose another task needing doing first - and the contractors being neighbors and/or people I might like to hire again, I'd offer to let them take the job on a time & materials basis. I'd ask for an estimate but with the understanding that it was just that, an estimate, but that they'd bill - and I'd pay - their labor and materials cost. They were almost always relieved to not have to allow for unknows, and I usually got jobs done for less, but in any case, for the real costs without just-in-case padding. You and your client choose the working arrangement that best seems to fit the job, and then stick with it. If it really starts looking likely to go south for either of you, sit down and re-negotiate."
What's the smallest unit of time I should charge for when clients request minor changes?,"If I intend to charge at all for a minor thing, I charge a minimum of 15 minutes. Like you, I traditionally won't charge for anything exceptionally minor. However if the requests become more frequent, then I can't allow my workflow to be interrupted repeatedly for many ""minor"" things.  In my experience, there's no such thing as a ""30 second"" or ""1 minute"" change even if a client thinks that's all there is to it. It always entails navigating to files, changing things, updating server files if needed, then the communication back and forth with the client. This easily takes 15 minutes for even the smallest thing.  A retainer is also a good idea. Average the time needed for these changes and approach the client with a monthly fee which allows for XX minor changes, or XX hours of work."
How do I put freelancing in my CV?,"Well you cannot just put freelancing since it says nothing to your future employer.  Employers don't care whether you worked as a freelancer or in multimillion company. They care only how much you know and how much extra profit you can bring to his company. Having this in mind, I would make a list of all project I did in 4 years, describing each technology I used with URLs of such project. This will mean more to your employer than zillion of sweet words.  When I employ someone for positions higher than junior L1, then I ask him/her to show me the list of all projects they took part in. In a matter of 1 hour or less, I can know how quality this person is.  Just a few days ago, I reviewed our new employer who showed me a list of 10 apps he did so far. After I reviewed them, I concluded that all these apps are easy or medium complexity and this person cannot get level higher than junior L2.  Don't be afraid of showing your works to your employers. Show them even your own projects, even if they are not yet published. The more you show, the more they will know of you and your qualities.  Good luck!"
How can I discipline myself as a freelancer?,"I don't worry about it much to be honest. I concentrate on deadlines not every minute of my day. I choose to work to live, not live to work. I do not focus on billable and non-billable hours. That's too much like a 9 to 5 job. I know I need to make $XXXX this month. If I have 1 project which does that, that's all I need. If I have 4, then I have to complete all 4. If I don't have enough, I need to do some marketing. If I have more than enough, I'm in great shape. I have never looked at things such as I need 300 billable hours this month. (This may be due to the nature of my freelancing compared to yours more than anything). I may work 2 hours one day, then 14 the next. It all greatly depends upon any deadlines I have and how I feel about that LCD glow on any given day. The worst part for me about being in a career which focuses heavily on computer use, is the computer itself. I generally do not feel well when I spend too much time in front of a computer. This is especially true if it's constant, steady, and predictable. I purposely started freelancing to get away from the ""stare into a monitor for 8 hours"" employment positions. If I schedule my days to do just that, I've lost my focus and subsequently motivation and zest for the work. John Cleese stated it best in his ""Creativity"" speech when he stated all creativity requires a period of play, but play must be scheduled for creativity to be effective (I'm paraphrasing). I look at five must have important things which need to be accomplished every day: Those are my 5 priorities. As long as those 5 items are met, I'm free to do anything else I please.  It's up to me to figure out that a project needs XX hours to complete (which I've quoted) and I better put in X hours in this week if I want to be ahead of that curve. If I feel like working more, outside the scope of a quote, I will. But if I feel like stopping when a project is at it's expected delivery state, I stop. I often complete things early and simply let them sit until the stated delivery date. This took some time before I started figuring out that it was actually better to not deliver something too early even if I thought it was complete. Delivery dates are stated and set, if I constantly finish early, and the client knows it, I'll find expected future dates start getting tighter and tighter until it's a problem. If I state it'll be done on the 15th and I finish it on the 12th.... I won't deliver until the 15th. Working this way gives me a couple advantages: I'm not completely apathetic about billing. I generally have enough work to move onto something new once a project is complete so I don't generally have a lot of time to spend fussing and fiddling with a project that has been completed. If you find you aren't completing one thing to move onto another, perhaps you need more work? Or perhaps you should refocus and put that time into marketing and other self-promotion areas? In the end, this may not seem like a very disciplined method for freelancing. But it has worked very well for me. The discipline comes in by knowing that in order to complete a project I must work XX hours. Where those hours fall, I'm free to decide. The operative part of freelancing to me is free."

"Is it unprofessional to approach a business, unsolicited, based upon technical problems you see on their website?","I think there are some factors to consider. The general ""aggressiveness"" of your marketing strategy: As Scott pointed out in his answer, you might offend or insult people with your offer. This is however no general excuse not to try it. Of course, there may be vaild/commonly accepted reasons for being upset, but people could also dislike your offer because of your surname or your hair cut. Generally, they won't tell you why. So you have to decide for yourself how much of the risk you want to take. You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs. You can choose the eggs, however. Minimizing the risk of being seen as unprofessional. There is a wide variety of approaches you can try in your case. You should use some common sense and some ""stakeholder analysis"" to avoid bad feelings. I think that you need a (truly) honest story that the person you contact can relate to in order for your approach to work. For example like the block quote below: Disclaimer Hello, I'm from $nearby and came across your website searching for a local
  dealer of $x. Unfortunately, I had trouble $doing_y on my mobile
  device and could not find the information I needed. I wanted to mention this
  because I am web designer myself and I care about user experience;
  it's important to the success of a website, so take this as a friendly
  hint.  If you see eye to eye about this, I suggest you contact whoever
  you have in charge of maintaining your website; they should be able to
  handle fixing this.  Hope this is helpful to you. Sincerely,

What does an LLC's limited liability really protect you against (if you are sole owner and employee)?,"An LLC protects you from personally from all creditors, whether they be customers, shareholders, or other parties. Liability for business activities is limited to the LLC's assets; yours are protected. Nolo's LLC Basics describes this well: Like shareholders of a corporation, all LLC owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims. This means that if the business itself can't pay a creditor -- such as a supplier, a lender, or a landlord -- the creditor cannot legally come after an LLC member's house, car, or other personal possessions. Because only LLC assets are used to pay off business debts, LLC owners stand to lose only the money that they've invested in the LLC. This feature is often called ""limited liability."" As you will see if you keep reading on their web page, there are exceptions to the limited liability, such as unfair, illegal, or fraudulent activity. These are, however, exceptions. The fact that a bank asks you to personally co-sign a loan is a demonstration of the strength of the LLC's protection: the bank knows that if your LLC defaulted, the bank would otherwise be limited to collecting only the LLC's (insufficient) assets."
How to estimate the hourly rate for senior developer?,"In North America, the 'average' consulting rate (according to the Wall Street Journal) is around $62 per hour.  If I look at Craigslist in certain high demand markets, I see rates offered for contracting, and those run from $60 to $80.  This would be for Java, C#, SQL Server, etc.  Data Warehousing, Business Intelligence, ERP, and Oracle pay better rates. Good places to look in CL are Toronto, Ontario, which posts about 100 listings a day.  Toronto is a pretty expensive city.  Indeed.com is an amalgamator, and they sometimes post annual salaries - however they can make horrible mistakes.  I saw an IT Director for a school district offered $250,000, which was due to a misinterpretation of the annual salary terms posted on the original site. How this translates into Euros I can't tell, but generally if you have a feeling you're priced out of the market your feeling is probably right."
Should I use a written contract when working for small businesses?,"The contract is basically your safety net. It protects both sides. Without a contract in place, it would be difficult to enforce payment if the client decided not to pay you. Equally it would be difficult for the client to enforce delivery if you decided not to deliver whatever was agreed (or worse still, decided to delete/take down whatever had been delivered, post payment).  It sounds like you've been fortunate so far in that all of your clients have been happy to pay you whatever was agreed between yourselves and there have been no disputes around payment. In the event that a dispute appears on the horizon, having a contract in place that is signed by both parties ensures that both sides are duty bound to honour their agreement. Presenting a client with a professional contract before commencing a project also demonstrates to the client that you are a professional outfit, which will enhance your reputation in the long run."
How to build passive income instead of just selling work hours?,"Whilst not truly passive, if you are a web developer then offering maintenance/hosting is a great way to boost income and build up a stable monthly income. Another great way is to create a product. For designers and developers the likes of codecanyon and themeforest can be very lucrative. Edit to answer a few points: Hosting - Too cheap and requires a significant number of clients. - why does it have to be cheap? I charge significantly more than my clients would pay elsewhere but they like having everything in one place so don't mind paying that much extra. Support - Clients prefer to pay only when the problems arise. - this is where you need to be a salesman. Make your ""emergency support"" or ""hourly support"" quite high to make it worth your while and explain the value of taking out a monthly support agreement to your clients."
How can I advertise myself?,"A few words of advice from someone who has been self-employed for a long time. First advertising is effective to the extent people knew about you before, unless you have very well-targeted advertising.  When I started out, I spent a fair bit on advertising but the only thing that got me a return on investment was, believe, radio advertisement aimed at individuals and small businesses. On the other hand my initial PR efforts made me a lot of initial customers. First: Work on your presence So before you start advertising yourself, you want to improve your presence generally.  You get out of this (and the resulting advertisement) what you put into it.  If radio stations offer a package for an interview and advertising (if you are trying to reach end users) this may be helpful.  Talk to them.  If you are involved in open source projects with reasonable profiles, work on making sure you are known there.  For example I do a lot of PostgreSQL-related blogging because that drives traffic to LedgerSMB.org, and then when people start using that software, I am usually the first person they come to looking for support. Next, how does your advertising fit into this? Advertising, done well, is a way of supporting this presence-building effort.  It is not the entire effort, or even the central aspect of it.  It is instead how you build that last piece in.  When I go to conventions I look carefully at the target audience, and I divide my advertising into three sections: What will get people to stop and talk to me? What can I give them when they do? What can I given them beyond that which may drive business later? For example when I went to the Malaysia Government Open Source Convention a couple years ago, I put a lot of effort into my marketing and it paid off.  First I offered to make my booth available for marketing PostgreSQL as a database (and thus I got support from the PostgreSQL community including marketing material).  Then I selected marketing material there specific to governmental use.  Then I put together the LedgerSMB stuff that I figured I could give out separately if the chance arose.   Unfortunately I made a critical error[1] and so I missed the major target market but I did get significant interest and traction and I got two smaller gigs from peripheral markets. So this material I would give away were the advertising materials.  Some of which I prepared (glossy fliers) and some were prepared by others (success stories about the French government's use of PostgreSQL). None of this would have worked if I was not reasonably well known in the PostgreSQL community.  I thus basically took my presence and I build advertising around it. Putting it all together Classic, traditional advertising materials are relatively helpful once people know who you are, or once they get to meet you.  Advertising thus works better for larger companies who already have brand recognition than it does smaller businesses.  In general, as a freelancer or consultant, one of the best things you can do is create original content which showcases your knowledge.  You can then reference this in advertising materials and incorporate what you can do into them.  Remember, you are not selling yourself so much as what you can do, and nothing shows what you can do like what you have done. Your existing presence and reputation is the foundation on which you build your advertising.  The advertising then further boosts the presence. [1]  The Malaysian Government wants to deal with Malaysian-owned businesses.  I should have come in partnering with an existing local business already but instead I came in by myself."
How to deal with 'Scope Creep'?,"I would advise following approach: Define the scope of the work (which means ""what will be delivered""). With an ongoing project like this you probably won't be able to do this retroactively (because you definitely do not want to damage your good relationship with the client).  But, you can do it for future requests. I.e. ""<module>, that will have following functions and settings: <here goes your list>, admin will interact with it this way: <description of admin gui> and users will interact with it this way <user gui>"". Define what is not in scope - This is actually very important, because as you gain experience, there will be many future enhancements you can anticipate, and you can decide with the client if they are in the scope or not. If the client decides to add these enhancements later, that is clearly change request and you will have less difficult negotiations to cope with. When you hit a grey area like you just described, ask the client to pay, but first tell him what the change means for you. Imagine talking like this: And so on. In the end, if the client is honest and not just trying to take advantage of you, you will arrive at a compromise, and you will get at least some money for the extra work. If he tries to rip you off, you know that you have to be strictly formal next time, not giving him any chances (and maybe not giving him your best, because that is reserved for clients who appreciate your work and are honest with you)."
How do I estimate the cost of building an Android app?,"You are not charging enough: listen to your friends!  You should have looked around for jobs similar to what you do and found out how much others were being paid.  Don't feel that your work is worth much less because you are a newbie, because the client will take it when you release it to him and earn much, much more. The client is correct in saying you can't raise the price after starting work. You can only raise the price if the client is asking you to add in more work that you did not previously agree upon before.  That is how contracts work, all over the world. If you have a good product, don't sell it outright.  Put it on the Play Store so it will keep on making you money forever."
Charging more for emergencies because of the client's negligence?,"Pricing can depend on whatever you like. To me, the fact that it is an emergency means that you are free to charge a special ""rush"" fee or whatever you'd like to call it. Just make sure to tell him up front that this fee will be in effect. He has a right to know before you begin any of the work.  Personally my pricing depends on a variety of things, including the timeline, my interest in doing the kind of work requested (charge more for yucky work), and how the work might benefit me professionally (charge less if I will learn something on the project that will help me find other work, for example)."
Best way to get clients as a freelance web developer? [closed],I have never gotten a single client from any web-based crowd source site. Ever. All my clients have come via word of mouth. Networking in real life is far more valuable than anything online in my opinion. If you network properly all it takes is one or two of the right contacts and you'll have all the work you need. Look at it this way.... you can float in a raft in the Atlantic ocean (the internet) hoping you are seen and deemed worthy of attention. Or you can throw an inner tube into the pond in your local park where you are sure to get stares and attention.
"On a long contract, when is it ok to ask for a raise?","""Raise"" is a term for full-time employees, whose salary depends on other factors (e.g., years served, position, etc), not actually on amount and quality of work done (don't kill me, there are many exceptions here). Being a freelancer, you are most likely bound with terms of a certain agreement. Any amendments to that document are subject of a mutual agreement. You haven't specified why are you willing for ""raise"". As I said, years served is not an argument for freelance job. So, let me theorize and look in what situations you may require for raise review of the contract terms. In any case, you should bring those arguments to a meeting and mutually agree on any contract changes. See below what if your changes are rejected. So you have your arguments and you have scheduled a meeting for changes. What's now?
Don't panic. You, as well as your client, are willing to get the job done with best possible quality and at lowest possible cost. If you are not just asking something for yourself, but instead demonstrate that you two are ""on the same boat"", struggling with the same problems, your client will be much more compliant to your requests and suggestions. As a freelancer, you are an independent business entity. You take full responsibility on any consequences happened due to your decisions. As well as your client! If you suggested a contract change and they rejected it, you actually have two ways: In any case, remember that reputation is the hardest to earn and easiest to lose."
Do you spend lots of time on a website for your freelance company?,"In my experience, a website will - in itself - give you nothing. Clients are only found by actively seeking them. When you have lots of face time with a potential client, a website should make no difference. However, a website could be helpful as a supplement, as it allows a short chance encounter in which contact details were exchanged, to perhaps become a selling opportunity. Having said that, if a website is created - who should it target? The technical professionals or the non-technicals who make hiring decisions? Targeting both is not always as simple as it sounds. Finally, if you work with IT - especially programming - it could be viewed as strange if you have absolutely no web presence. That is actually the reason I have a very basic website with contact details, picture and CV/resume."
How can I measure the credibility of a Freelancing website?,"I asked myself the same question 4-5 years ago when I started freelancing. I will tell you what I did and how you can avoid the same mistakes that I made. Since I do not do marketing for any freelancing sites I will not mention any specific names (as such recommendations would be against the rules of this group). I first used Google to see which freelancing sites are on top, based on my search terms. It turned out that Google does not tell you which sites are the best for a contractor or a client, it simply tells you which website is better ranked in their indexes (and we all know what SEO experts can do). So after I received the results, I tried the top 5-6 freelancing sites of today. I created accounts, filled in all the requirements, and after that I was able to find out the credibility by following these rules. You will see that usefulness and credibility is largely based on your own experience with the website and the number of ways you can pull money from the website. The general look and ability to navigate the website.
In my case it turned out that those websites whose UI are easy to navigate, not confusing and offer a minimum learning curve, turned out to be better than confusing ones. Obviously, those websites paid more money for UI experts. Number of ways you can pull money out of the website.
When I started, PayPal was not available in my country, and getting ahold of the money I earned was a pain. Those websites which offered more ways to withdraw money turned out to be more reputable. More ways mean that their contractors come from 3rd countries, and the reason US, UK, Canadian, and Australian clients visit these sites is to hire affordable contractors. The quality of contractor's profile pages.
This counts if you are a contractor. The more information you are able to learn about the contractor the better the freelancing website is. They make profits from the clients (who bring in money), so if you are confused about how to find the right contractor, or how to see his profile, leave that website immediately. Number of bids on projects.
A high number of bids (over 50) on most of the projects usually means that the bidding policy is bad. If you're a client, you will easily be spammed. If you're a contractor, it will be harder for you to get the first job. Statistics.
A good and reputable website will have a statistical page where you can see what kind of projects they offer, average prices, etc. I see this increasingly over the last year, and I would not trust a website which does not have this. Do they rip-off contractors?
Some websites take money from the contractor as soon as the project is accepted. This is a rip-off IMHO and as a contractor I would never work on such sites. Number of 3rd party tools they offer.
Again, the more 3rd party tools a website offers (SVN connection, multimedia capabilities, connecting popular services which can help your work, etc.) the more reputable they are. All these tools cost money, and it means that they can afford them. Support service.
The more support channels they offer (tickets, live support, forums, email, etc.), and the quicker that they reply, means that the website is reputable. In my experience, this means that money I invest there as a client or earn as a contractor is pretty safe. Resolution policy.
Very important for both clients and contractors. The more ways they offer to resolve problems, the more reputable they are. Internal forums.
Reputable websites will have their own forums. Take a few days reading the posts and you will understand the main issues other people have using that website.  In general, don't trust forums too much. Authors of those articles are sometimes paid by competitors. Also, someone else's bad experience usually means that they were careless, not necessarily that the website is bad. In the end, no matter what I tell you here, gauging your experience with a selection of websites is the most important thing. The rule of thumb is: ""Start with small projects until you find out if everything is as shiny as they promised""."
How to work as a pet sitter with low self-confidence?,"I disagree with your premise. Most people who would hire a pet sitter care about their pets. Unbelievably low prices sends the message you aren't that good, or may have nefarious intentions. People who care about their animals won't risk it. Price will be a factor in their decision, but it probably won't be the main one.  So don't set your prices unbelievably low, try for the lower half of the typical range. I don't know how to address your main issue, but I will tell you that many of us struggle with self-confidence, and faking smiles and small talk is not unusual at all. That doesn't solve your problem, but hopefully knowing you aren't alone helps a little. If I were you, I'd look for opportunities to meet people with pets who might need your services, where the social interaction required will be minimal. Perhaps start hanging out at a dog park or volunteering at an animal shelter. Build up your confidence slowly. Don't try too many new things all at once. I think you can get there, but it will take lots of patience. Don't give up!"
How to get paid and figure out if I want to keep this client,"TL;DR: In any case, I would suggest to stay positive. Try to turn the things like you are not raising a conflict of interests by asking something for yourself. Try to convince your client that you have the same goals, to make the job done at minimal cost and maximum quality. Also, resolving an existing problem prior doing anything else seems to be a good idea to me as it will help you both keep your face and avoid loss of reputation/respect. You have actually done a good insight into the problem. Let me focus on the following ideas: You have highlighted what's wrong with the client, but you did not look what you have probably done wrong. Think of it for yourself and learn from it: Get to a mutual agreement of how you wrap up the work done in the past. I would not go ahead with any future tasks without it. From my experience, I'm not really surprised by a client who does not like emails and prefers phone calls. Schedule your communication in a way that satisfies everyone."
Freelancing while being employed,"Time management is an issue and you have to figure out how to meet with customers if working a standard schedule full time.  The larger issues are legal. You want to read over your employment contract a few times looking at the specifics of: Moonlighting clauses.  When I worked at Microsoft, the contract said I had to have their permission to do any work outside Microsoft and that this permission needed to be renewed annually. Non-disclosure agreements.  Make absolutely sure that the domain you are freelancing is sufficiently removed from your formal employment that this is not an issue. Non-compete agreements.  Again, if you are freelancing in a different domain and not competing with your employer you are much safer than if you are working for your competition. Depending on the specifics of your employment contract there may be other issues as well but these are the most common and serious."
Why should I not provide free services to friends when freelancing?,"It depends on the tax system that applies to you, but there can be consequences, and they can be very severe. Generally economic activity is defined as oriented on profit, so giving anything for free could qualify as self-promotion or donation. In Poland, for example, only some costs of the company spend on promotion can be considered as tax costs. So in worst case you could end with tax office refusing to acknowledge, for example, 50% of your expenses as tax costs. You would end up with fine and penalty percentages. With donation, the danger is even greater. There was a case of baker who was giving the unsold bread to charity for free. He was told to pay the VAT from the bread that was given for free (from the price it was normally being sold - but the tax officer is free to estimate the basis price as he/she wants). With penalty percentages the sum was so big, that he has become insolvent. However, the obligation to pay VAT was only in case of wares, not services, and the law has changed recently, but in other countries the regulations may be even stricter. There is also a potential consequence if you receive something for free. It could be interpreted as income and you would have to pay income tax from the value estimated by tax officer. Assuming, analyse your local law, consult a tax specialist and be sure you exactly want what you are doing before issuing €0 invoices."
Upwork taking 20% of my money. Alternatives,"Agreed! Upwork charges a hell of a lot of the Fee. On the top of that Freelancer had to pay withdrawal fees, currency conversion fee, bank fee, etc. and the actual amount which a freelancer receives is very small. So, strategy is to deliver good work, make your clients happy and take them out of Upwork with mutual agreement. Upwork charges a Payment Processing fee to clients as well, which can be a plus point for you to convince them. Other alternatives can be:

"How to respond no to ""Are your rates negotiable?""","I simply state, ""Sorry. Pricing is set and rates are non-negotiable.""  I haven't run into an instance where that offended anyone. I may not get the work but, if they won't pay my rates, I don't see that as a problem. You aren't required to explain anything to clients in terms of your business structure or calculations. Actually going into too much detail is a bad thing and conveys a lack of confidence and the need to rationalize your business practices. This leads to a definite perception of a weak negotiator. "
Do I risk anything if I shut down a product that hasn't been paid?,"The easiest thing is to shut down all, but what if the client is sick or something. Chances are 90% that they don't want to pay you, but there are still 10% which you need to consider. This is all true if you expect more work from them and if you really like the project.  Do you have a direct contact with the client? Do Skype call to his mobile and see what is going on. Send them email with read recipient. PM him via some messaging service.  Be kind and let them know that you have not heard from them X days and that you want to be paid. Ask for an immediate reply, any kind of. The most important thing is to tell them that unless they reply in Y days, you will be forced to shut down their web service. If they still don't reply, push them another reminder 3-5 days before the deadline. If still no replied, then shut down the service.  If the client has a really good reason for not replying, he will appreciate such conduct of yours. "
Staying in contact with clients when I have a different sleep-wake rhythm (being a night owl or living in a different time zone),"You're absolutely right assuming that your problem has very close relation to the problem  of different time zones. So the answer would be much like the answer to the other question. Here are some ideas I found useful for myself, but YMMV, as usual: There's no silver bullet. Phone, email, and instant messengers co-exist specifically because they solve communication problems in different ways, so sooner or later you need all of them. I find sudden phone calls the biggest plague for effective communication. It should be eliminated at all costs. How? Let's think why your client is suddenly calling you. Don't they have other things to do? The answer is — because they worry you are no longer there, or you are behind your schedule.
Or, maybe, your client is a big company, and they have a dedicated person (call them Alice) responsible for communication with freelancers. But wait, Alice has their own boss (say, Bob). Bob may have entered Alice's room and asked, ""hey Alice, what's up with our freelancer?"" If Alice does not know, it's a big red flag for me.
Plus, she will certainly try to call you, and you wouldn't be ready for a report! It's your obligation to prevent it, by making sure Alice knew what you are doing at any given moment. Don't let Alice to call you. If that happens exactly when you are sleeping, you are screwed, not Alice or Bob. It's just a personal opinion, but I always let people know when I'm awake and when I'm working. I make it clear that:"
How do I invoice my client correctly in the UK?,"I am currently a student with no registered business etc You are required to register (link) with hmrc as self-employed in this case - and while you are at it (assuming profits are below the threshold) register as exempt from Class 2 National Insurance. Failure to register will result in a fine if (when?) you get tagged... What is required on a UK invoice is kindly explained by the Government itself (link) which includes the following provisions (copied/pasted for completeness): You must clearly display the word ‘invoice’ on the document. You must
  also include: If you’re a sole trader, the invoice must also include: I'm not VAT registered so does that mean I only charge for my hours *
  standard rate and not add 20% for VAT? If you are not registered for VAT, then VAT is irrelevant... you do not add it to your invoice - although this does mean you cannot reclaim any VAT you are charged on your purchases. So your invoice value is (as you say) hours x rate. If you do become VAT registered, VAT would be chargeable on future invoices (not retrospectively) as an additional 20% of the invoice value."
How to handle silly requirements?,"In my experience, when prospective clients specify technologies, they're coming more from a place of having heard of others using them successfully, rather than of having considered the use case and made an educated and informed decision. I talk to them about why they chose the tools they did. If their reasoning is sound, awesome. If not, I remind them that they hired me for my expertise and that my job is to choose the most appropriate tools."
Should I point out design flaws to my clients?,"Purely from a due diligence point of view, you should always point out these issues. Presumably you are working together for an end client who has requested your combined services (either directly or indirectly) and wants a usable website which has been designed consistently. Nobody wants to use a website that provides an inconsistent experience and it reflects badly upon you professionally if you have allowed obvious inconsistencies to make it through to a production website.  Every website that you build and deliver for a client acts as part of your marketing portfolio that showcases your abilities to future clients, so it is in your interest, both contractually and morally, to ensure that every project you put your name to has been built to the same high standards. Reputation takes a long time to build up, but once it has been, it holds a lot of sway and can keep you in business and get repeat work with existing clients, which is gold dust in this industry."
How many hours a man day really is? (programming),"I'm a software developer who has been practicing the pomodoro technique for the last few months, in part to show me how long I actually spend performing tasks, but also to find out how much productive time I actually spend during a day. Even on a day that I have a well defined task to work on and no distractions (Skype and email are switched off, etc), when starting at 8am I found myself having to work through until around 7pm to complete 16 blocks of focused work, which isn't even actually 8 hours if the breaks in between focused work blocks are discounted.  So to actually work for 8 hours requires, in my experience, 10, 11 or even 12 hours of time to be spent. Given that a standard working day is 8 hours, then 6 hours is more than most people are able to spend being productive. Most of the organisations I've worked for quote between 6 and 7 hours to be a standard working day, in terms of billable time. The quote I provided for this project was based on a working day of 8 hours, so I have been working 11-12 hour days to ensure that I worked productively for the client for the stated 8 hours per day. "
How to convince the client that you'll report hours truthfully?,"Frankly, this asks the wrong question. Even if you can verify hours worked, how can the customer tell you aren't ""dragging your feet"" - working slowly to increase your billable time? Or using some other nefarious tactic? Good business relationships rely on trust. You need to trust them, and they need to trust you. If you are starting a relationship with a new client who does not trust you, you are starting from a hole that you are unlikely to climb out of. Instead, you must start the relationship with a default position of trust. You must trust that they will behave as a honest and responsible adult, and they must trust you to do the same. Then both parties must do nothing to make the other party regret this trust. This means: Of course, if either party sees evidence of dishonesty or bad behavior, then this is a different story. But a project will not be successful if one party distrusts the other party. And acting like it is reasonable for the other party to mistrust you when you have done nothing wrong does not help. They may have been mistreated by someone else, but that someone else is not you. I agree that charging on a per-project basis can reduce this fear (I use this approach myself), but it doesn't really solve the problem. There still can be disagreements about scope that translate into questions of integrity.  Don't fall into the trap of assuming that their concern is reasonable. Treat them with respect and integrity, and expect that they treat you the same way."
Judging sincerity of freelance job offers,"Wasting a day hoping for work to arrive if you have other work lined up is on you. Don't start any work before you have a signed contract. If they sign a contract, the likelihood that they are serious is already much higher than before.  Ask for early payment for the first piece of work. Once they start paying you, the likelihood that they are serious is already quite high. Edit to address Addendum of question: If you don't want to have the overhead of a written contract that was prepared by a lawyer, you can simplify, although I won't generally recommend that. You can just write down the essentials in an email: The description of the work and the amount and form of compensation. If they confirm, that is a legally binding contract. If you cannot agree on the description of the work and the amount and form of compensation, then you are not ready to start the work. Compared to this minimal contract, the primary advantage of a proper contract with multiple pages is that it also has a clause that limits your liability so you don't suddenly need to hand over everything you own to your client."
The client is asking for too much work for the money,"May I guess. He approached to you saying if you do this for bargain, you will get more work? Yes you will get more work, 5 times more complex for 50% more money - $150 in your case. Any serious client will let you first do 1 project, and only then he will talk about more work. Because if they immediately say that they have more work, even a bad contractor will push 110% to impress them in the first project. So I'd say these are clients looking for cheap slavery work.  I would refuse saying that for $100 I can only do X, Y and Z, and for more, I have to recalculate my price.  But be careful if you're on rating systems like oDesk cause they will most likely give you a bad feedback. "
How to know when you are a competent enough programmer to charge clients,"The question really boils down to: when can I consider myself ""competent"" enough in a skill that I can take money for it. And the answer is really simple: You can take money for it when someone is willing to pay you for it. Especially with something like programming, you will never know everything. And things are changing very, very fast.  So instead of worrying about whether you know enough, instead focus on finding projects that will allow you to use this new skill in a more limited fashion, and build on that experience as you go. Even very experienced programmers learn new things with every project. So long as you aren't taking on gigantic projects that are nothing but javascript, you will be fine. And obviously, don't portray your experience to prospective clients dishonestly."
I failed to reach the deadline,"Your client is a person, too. They have been late or missed deadlines at some point in their life as well. Unless you have a really aggressive client, they should understand that things happen. And if they are extremely upset about it.. they might not be the type of client you wan to keep around. I take a very relaxed approach to communicating with clients. Not to say I take my time, but rather I just talk to them like I would any other person. ""Hi XYZ, I'm having some issues with ABC and I won't be able to make the deadline. I'm researching the issue now, but what's the absolutely end date we can push the deadline to? I apologize for the delay but this was an unexpected issue that popped up. Hopefully I can figure this out sooner than later."" Of course you should communicate in your own voice.. but I don't see a problem with just being straight forward with them. I know I appreciate honestly a whole lot more than I do someone who keeps me in the dark."
Is it appropriate to ask for a referral fee when sending work to another freelancer?,"Sole-proprietor, web development LLC owner here. When I have too much work or jobs that aren't quite in my expertise, I'll generally sub it out to a 3rd party. A bit different than straight out referring my client to the 3rd party because I still play point man and have control over the end result of the project - the 3rd party works for me, I work for the client. My ""referral fee"" is some small percent above the 3rd party's price, enough to pay for my time managing the project. If it's a job that I have no interest in managing, I'll generally refer them to a 3rd party ""in good faith"" that the 3rd party will send some work my way when he/she can. Like you said, there's certain places that willingly offer a referral bonus to you (I know an excellent videographer that'll send me 15% of the project if I make an in-person introduction with the client), but if they don't offer a bonus, are reluctant when you mention it, and you can't find anyone else to refer the client to.. Feel at ease that you didn't have time to work on the client's project anyways. Also, don't be afraid to tell clients that you're a couple weeks out at getting to their project (say it upfront, don't wait until after they agree to the project). Most people are fine waiting a little while, especially  if the outcome happens to go a bit above and beyond the requirements in some way."
Do I need a formal business plan to run a successful freelance business?,"If you already know what you want out of your business and how to go about it, you already have a business plan. Perhaps not formalized and written down, but one nonetheless. There are several things you can get from putting it down in writing: These are all tangible benefits for your business strategies - of course, you can easily have a successful business without the above and the simpler the business model, the less the need to formalize the business plan (for example many one man IT freelancers are just one man contracting - but is that a business?)."
Filing taxes quarterly,"According to the IRS, all self-employed persons are generally required to file quarterly self-employment and income tax payments that are based off your estimated yearly earnings.  There are exemptions to this rule, as outlined on the IRS page for self-employed individuals, for those that don't make a net profit. As for working another job where you do pay taxes, if you're still self-employed in another job of your own making then you still need to pay the quarterly self-employment and income taxes.  This is known as having a part-time business by the IRS which still falls under the umbrella of being self-employed."
Should I lower my per hour rate to be competitive with overseas firms?,"If you were invited to bid on it that may have been for a reason. This may sound bad, but I find 'foreign' market developers to be very straight forward in how they work. And not in a good way. If you ask for XYZ, you only get XYZ. The problem is XYZ may not be what the client needs. As a qualified and higher paid developer I may suggest a different path to solve your problem, where as a lot of overseas developers will literally build what you ask them to. So to directly answer your question; No. I have never lowered my hourly based on a clients location and have worked with clients on every contient except South America. I have several clients in Cape Town that happily pay my hourly because they understand its for a reason.  Don't be afraid to explain why you charge what you do!"
How to combat the isolation which can become prevalent when freelancing?,"The first few years I was freelancing, I was so happy to not leave the house every day and be around people because I really prefer to be alone. Then I realized that after a while I was TOO isolated. When I did see people, I felt awkward because I was out of practice. And it helps to be around other people sometimes. So here are some things I do to combat this: I like @ChrisForrence's gym suggestion, too."
Can a Western IT software developer make it in online freelancing?,"I believe that being a 'Westerner' definitely works to your advantage for many reasons.
Let me share part of my experience on the subject, as a freelance developer who started in London, then moved on to other 'western' countries. I had no portfolio, having done only bar work since I left Uni, but I was really motivated. First, as you said, the market is flooded by low-rates developers, asking as little as $3/hour. But the quality of the work they provide, and the heart they put in it reflects the rate they offer. Think about it, if they were skilled enough to ask 10 times the rate they offer, they probably would.  Most of the time, when you put an ad on Elance (now known as Upwork), you receive instantly a dozen of generic replies, often in broken English, and obviously copypasted from a defined set, maybe triggered by a keyword like 'WordPress' or similar. Here's how to take advantage of that: 1. Choose the proposals carefully, and personalize your reply. Take some time to read the proposal, and start thinking about how you'll solve the client's problem, instead of copypasting a list of your 'skills' that he/she doesn't know anything about. Find something you're interested in doing, and be enthusiastic in your reply. At the beginning, I used to choose only challenging proposals, that I knew I could fix, but didn't know exactly how. I was doing a bit of research on Google, then explained my 'plan' to the client. Often, the actual solution I ended up using was different than the original plan, but it didn't matter, I had made a difference by showing some 'care' in my answer. 2. Emphasize the fact that you do speak English perfectly. This is a bit controversial, but once the client will have struggled his way through 10 replies full of spelling/grammar mistakes, your proposal will be a breeze of fresh air to him. Remind them of that discreetly in your answer. I usually use almost informal language, to further distance myself from the 'Dear Sir, ...' answers, and I always mention the fact that I do speak good English.  TL;DR: Make your answer pleasant to read, and you'll score more points. 3. Your rate shows your worth, so don't undervalue yourself. Once again, you want to set yourself aside from the pack. There always will be clients who will choose Price over Quality, but my advice is that you should avoid them, or your hours and stress levels are going to skyrocket, and you'll be back behind your office in no time. If I'm unsure what the client is looking for, I don't give a rate right away, and ask him to clearly to pick 2 out of these 3 things: speed, quality or price (Project Management Triangle). Be daring, and it will pay off, you'll make strong relationships with good people, who will reward you fairly and value your work. That's what I appreciate the most about freelancing, you're not stuck with a nasty boss, ever. That being said, you can set your rate a little bit lower at the start, if you want to build a portfolio quickly. Remember however that you will most likely build long-lasting relationships with your clients, so it'll be harder to up your rate later. If you do all those things, your portfolio and feedback will quickly match your big mouth (which remains your best asset as it shows confidence), and you'll learn which proposals to answer, and which to avoid. By being 'different' in your approach, you'll become the go-to guy for all your previous clients, and there will be no more competition for you. If you have it in you, it is definitely worth it. "
Marketing yourself with limited time,"Having an active LinkedIn profile can be a massive help. You can tag your connections to put them into groups and then send a message to the entire group. There is a limit of 50 recipients, above which LinkedIn won't send the message, so if, like me, you've got bags of recruiters connected to you, or a network of potential clients, you can easily reach them all with just a handful of messages."
Can you perform/receive freelance work anonymously?,"You can. At least when you are a writer or a programmer you can do it. Some of the most popular options as of now: As of now, none of the above platforms requires their users to reveal their identities. Whether these options give you pseudonymity or anonymity is another matter. The first option, i.e. wiriting Everipedia, seems to me more pseudonymous than anonymous. If needed you would than use non-KYC ways, such as Bisq, robosats, or localmonero to convert crypto to FIAT. When spending crypto for goods directly, without the FIAT step in between, you should be using Bitcoin's lightning or Monero in order to preserve your privacy. The former is accepted through Bitrefill."
Should bug fixing of a finished project be free?,"For projects with big budgets, fixing the bugs and the maintenance can be included in the price since you can add more time for you and your team for the ""testing phase."" But often you can get stuck doing smaller budget projects, or get rushed finishing the project, or the client asked for so many revisions that there is actually no time left for this; that testing phase cannot be done properly.  One thing that can be done when this happens (or before in fact) is to give that responsibility to your client; if you are rushed to finish a project or cannot be paid to put the time required to test your code properly, he should do the tests, and then tell you what's wrong. You can give your client a certain period of time to do this; then everything after this period will be charged at hourly rate. Of course if it's a minor bug or something created by obvious negligence, you should probably simply fix it. That's a fair option you can offer to your client and you can offer this when signing the contract. Think of it as an extended guarantee; as you said software often have bugs but they are also built over a long period of time before being released, and with a team reviewing each others' work. There's also many version of it; your client bought a 1.1 version in a way if he had a small budget or little time to give you to develop the app.  You can include some maintenance for an extra fee, and there's probably other benefits or extra services you can add to that maintenance other than fixing bugs. Another option is to guarantee them a lower hourly rate for 6-12 months to fix bugs or for maintenance if they decide to simply go with the ""1.1"" version low budget option. This way they won't be scared to be stuck with an app that doesn't work properly and will probably prefer to test it themselves to save a few dollars. The way you can also present it is to tell them ""if they ever want to tweak something or add new features, it will be at a lower rate."" Otherwise, you can offer as second option a certain amount of hours included in the price for these things and lower that hourly rate a little bit.  Eg. Your first option without maintenance should have a hourly rate a bit higher than the second option with the maintenance included.  The benefit for you: by doing this, you already introduced honestly the option of fixing bugs and gave them the freedom to choose, you offered maintenance and you also welcomed the client to come back to you for more work.  With these info, you can think of a system that could work for you and that lets you client freely choose what he wants. Next time ""bugs"" will happen, it will be less difficult for you to decide what to do; you'll also know what's fair for YOU and for your client too. And you'll always get paid one way or another. Note: I'm not a dev, but I do projects management and that's how I deal with that kind of issue. Maybe you will get better answers from entrepreneurs working directly in software or website development."
Why am I not getting hired on UpWork/oDesk?,"Where do I start? Why I almost didn't read this question? Why most of guys on this group probably skipped reading your question? Why I would not hire you based on this bid? Clients have 3s to like or dislike your bid. I spent more than 3s reading it and there is no way I would contact you or read your full application.  Go to Stats on odesk. What does it say about the ratio your bid was opened/read? Below the average? Where should you improve? Read tutorials on how to attract clients. There are zillions of tutorials on the net. Learn how to be neat and pay attention to details. You showed neither of this in both your question and your bid. Portfolio was not bad thou.  PS. Do you have another picture for your profile? more professional one, not like you're ready to go out. "
Client's budget is higher than expected,"Inform your client that you can save them 4-5K if they go with your recommendations and hand them a breakdown of how you view your side of the budget against their needs. Bear in mind that the client might have a different idea about how they view the product (and any costs involved), so be clear with them about what you're supplying and what service they require. There's no real ethics at play here - just be realistic about your pricing in terms of giving value to the customer and also giving yourself a reasonable profit."
Is it appropriate for a prospective client to require me to purchase third-party tools?,"My perspective here is similar to this question: Is it appropriate to include time to research if you don't know how to do something?, as both tackle the issues of who should pay for something that may only be relevant to a single project, but may also be legitimatly expected of a contractor.  In your field, are those tools standard? If I do 3D modeling for product prototype, I think it's acceptable for a client to assume I have one of a few industry standard CAD packages. If I work on the Microsoft stack, I think it's appropriate for a client to expect I use Visual Studio, or at least can interface seamlessly with developers that do. Outside of this client, are those tools useful? Using the 3D modeling example, if a client expects me to have the same package they use internally - and there are (as I understand it, and let's just go with that for the example) a few CAD packages used industry wide - I think it's also appropriate to ask the client to cover a portion of the cost, somehow tied to how useful the package will be for other clients in the future. Are those tools completely project specific? If this is the only project that the tools will be useful for (because they're for niche use cases, needed for legacy issues, etc) I think it's acceptable to expect the client to cover the cost, or provide the tools directly. To your specific case, if the client seems to understand your concern about the cost it maybe worth asking why they want you to purchase the tooling, instead of providing it for you. It could be that they don't / can't license the tools easily for a contractor to use. Or it could be that they can't purchase software that is installed on systems they don't own (internal IT policy). If for some reason it needs to be purchased by the contractor, and the tools are very project specific, I'd tell them there will be a $4000 setup fee (or similar) and that will go to the cost of purchasing and setting up the tooling. If they balk at that, you could offer to discount the first 4 months of hours (or however you're billing them), to offset some of that cost."
"Can one make a living just by working through Elance, Freelancer, oDesk, etc? [closed]","Geographically, it depends on where you are.  I'm based in the US and answering from that point of view. I've been a full-time freelance UX designer since mid-2012.  I began by looking for projects on Elance and oDesk.  I was requested for several projects before I made my minimum rate public.  Over several months, I probably wrote about 5-10 proposals which took a lot of time to put together.  Each proposal had a fair rate of, at the time, $50-60 an hour.  (My rates are now higher.)  That's a fair rate for designers in my area (I'm currently in the Washington, DC, metro area), which I had verified with other designers via a question I asked on Quora.  I wasn't charging too much for someone who was first starting out. Yet I wasn't winning any of these projects either.  Some of these projects seemed to be posted by the clients as a way to not hire anyone yet but just explore the possibilities and find out who they could hire for the job. The tipping point for me, however, came after I wrote a long, detailed proposal (which took several full days to write) on a project where I met the job description's requirements very well.  The rate I bid was either $54.89 or $58.89 an hour; it's been over a year, so I don't remember which.  I thought I could get the project.  What happened? The client hired not one but two freelancers for the job.  Between the two of them, they didn't have the skills that the job description asked for, let alone my skill set.  But they were bidding only $2-3 an hour.  That rate is impossible to live on in the US, where the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour and some jurisdictions are higher than that.  (As of this writing, there are also currently proposals to raise the minimum wage.)  If working for $2-3 an hour as a designer doesn't sound like a problem, consider this: if I'm working for that rate and I go to a fast food restaurant in the US, the person taking my order is making 3-4 times as much per hour as I am and doesn't have nearly the skill set that I do. So as a design professional, I had to answer this question: How would I get work that actually paid me in line with my credentials (bachelor's degree from a top university in the US, 5 - now close to 7 - years of work experience, almost 2 years in UX design) and gave me a rate that I could live on?  And what would I advise others to do if they live in other countries where the cost of living is much higher than what most oDesk/Elance/... projects can pay? The solution was this: I stopped looking for work from these bid sites.  I picked an industry and learned how to do prospecting.  And, while I've unfortunately had to do a lot of free work over the past year to build my portfolio, I have had more than enough work over the past year.  I got most of that work from one prospecting email. The prospecting course I took was Warm Email Prospecting, offered about once a year through International Freelancers Academy.  (Full disclosure: I am a student of this class, but I'm not affiliated with the group that offers it.)  I'd recommend subscribing to IFA's email list to find out when the class will be offered again.  The course costs hundreds of dollars, which isn't cheap but it is a good investment for freelancers who don't have a background in selling or prospecting.  As freelancers, selling and prospecting are skills that we need to have on the side to run a profitable business. What picking an industry will get you is domain expertise.  That will let you charge a higher rate than you would get working for just anyone who would give you a project.  Why?  You would be able to speak that industry's language and understand their business and their company's specific problems better than someone who only brings the technical skills. Once you have picked an industry, make a list of companies in that industry which could use your skills.  Many job openings or opportunities for freelance work are not made public.  It is better to know - or find out about - specific people you can contact at the companies."
"Which is the most honest or ethical way to bill, hourly or fixed price?","Unethical people can be unethical completely regardless of any payment structure.  Pricing high does not instantly make someone unethical. Perhaps that price for the three week project is accurate even though experience allows the work to be done faster. There are simply too many variables here to answer in any sort of definitive manner Here's a scenario....  Bob has 20 years experience and charges $500 an hour.
Chuck has 2 years experience and charges $50 an hour Both are presented a project.
Bob estimates it at 10 hours totaling $5k.
Chuck estimates 100 hrs totaling $5k.
Both provide the client with a flat rate quote of $5k and 2 weeks to complete. It actually takes Chuck 86 hours to complete the project.
Bob takes 9.5 hours to complete it. Because experience allows him to estimate with slightly more accuracy.  It would sound as though you feel Chuck is then unethical if he invoiced for the agreed upon $5k because technically, based on the stated hourly rates, he should invoice for $4300. Or you feel Bob is unethical because if it only took him 9.5 hours he should somehow not charge his standard hourly rate... or that everyone should have the same hourly rate (which makes absolutely no sense). I don't understand how that would be logical. And I don't understand how, if the client agrees upon the $5k why it's even an issue.  Hourly rates are never hard quotes, at least for me. Hourly rates are always estimates.  In my field (design) hourly rate work is reserved for edits and maintenance, not projects on the whole. Flat rate (or value-based) pricing is always a much better pricing model in my opinion. There are solid reasons you should fire your hourly rate which I won't go into here. However, one thing is certain hourly rates are a sure way to ensure you lose money as you gain experience.  We all know those clients that freak out at higher hourly rates but have no issue paying larger invoices. If both Chuck and Bob quote the job at $5k and the client is happy there's no issue - ethical or otherwise. However, it is doubtful that Bob get any work if he quotes the project at $500/hr for 10 hours and Chuck quotes it at $50/hr for 100 hours. Bob can't spread out the 10 hours needed over 100 hours and it makes no business or financial sense for Bob to lower his hourly rate to match Chuck. The easiest, hardest to discover, way of over billing is to bill hourly then forge or fabricate the actual hours needed to complete something. I would hazard a guess that this is the most used unethical manner of pricing.  Flat rate pricing ensures the client knows what they will be invoiced before a project begins. If that figure is agreed upon, and the work is completed on time and in satisfactory condition, everything else is somewhat irrelevant. To me, if you deliver a solid, complete project, on its scheduled deadline, there's really very little way one could be unethical with flat-rate or value-based pricing."
How to setup client ownership of domain name and hosting,"Most often what I do is send the client a link.... Hi Client, Here is a link to the hosting package you'll need:
  (insert link here) Please follow the steps to sign up, including paying for the hosting. You can register your domain at the same time, so it should be a simple one-time processes. This hosting provider is one of the best I've found. You get unlimited email and FTP accounts, a control panel .. (etc. etc. etc.. about the account - this is done to combat the ""but I heard GoDaddy is good"" arguments) By having you do this rather than myself, it ensures you get the notices about renewal or issues with the account rather than relying on me to act as a middleman to relay such information. This also ensures that you are in control of the accounts and you don't have to be concerned about unauthorized access due to users you aren't aware of. Once you are done signing up, you'll receive a ""Welcome"" email from (company). Please forward that email to me. It will contain passwords and log in information I need in order to upload files and set up the web site. Thanks! With that, I wait for the ""welcome"" email.  While developing the site, I host the dev site on my servers until everything has been paid. Once payment is received, I upload everything to their hosting account. I'd recommend not providing hosting yourself unless you don't mind being the IT person for the client and dealing with the off-hour phone calls about email not working or some other random web issue. Moved comment to answer:
Once you start reselling hosting for clients you become IT support for them. You get calls for email problems, calls for any downtime*, calls for every little hosting issue. If that is your business model and you WANT to deal with that stuff, fine. But if you do not want to deal with all the IT support associated with hosting... simply don't have anything to do with hosting other than recommending a service."
Building my online portfolio as a web developer with limited projects,"The best advice I can give, as this is precisely the issue that I faced, is to build yourself a website that will act as your portfolio and let that website itself act as the showcase piece that shows off your talents.  You can include a projects area in which you can add screenshots to those websites that you are comfortable showcasing and (very importantly) that you have permission, or can get permission from the site owners, to showcase. I was threatened with legal action from a former employer because I included screenshots of their website on my portfolio without their express consent. Don't place yourself in potentially difficult situations simply to highlight some of your work.  Alongside each project (with or without screenshots) you can detail your exact involvement and achievements within the project. If you build the website yourself from scratch, rather than simply using an off-the-shelf CMS package, you can ensure that it is built to the standards that you set yourself professionally. You could also use it as an opportunity for self-learning new technologies/frameworks that may be required for upcoming client projects. If you can't actually get decent screenshots for specific projects you could include a section that talks about the technologies/techniques that you have used or the development process that you go through when building sites for clients. Anything that will convey how you can provide value to potential clients. I would also advocate (if you don't already) including a blog on the same site. This is particularly useful as you are a developer, because it allows you to write articles that convey your interests and expertise. It should also draw traffic to your site which will enhance your overall web presence. You can either build the blog yourself, which could be useful if you're planning to build something similar for a client, or embed one from a 3rd party - there are plenty around, many of which are free."
"As a new freelancer, how can I improve my communication with the clients?","Since you are training yourself as a freelancer, you are also training yourself as a project manager, finance manager, negotiator and boss. Freelancing is just a group name for 5-6 roles (I think that once a guy told me that I am doing the work for 6 men). So besides training your coding skills, you'll have to train other skills as well.  One of them is customer or client relations. No matter you work $100 or $10k job, you must act like it's $100k job. Such conduct will not only make you look Pro in the eyes of clients, but will also train you to become better freelancer (thus earning more money).  So even with low-budget clients, you must behave the same if you want to actually earn something. Don't be intimidated by the price of the project. So do this: You are also true that having good specs in low-budget project is utopia. So the solution is to gently force them to use PM software which will make your life easier. "
What's a fair price to charge a client for backups that only I have?,"Careful.  What you're proposing (charging some amount extra simply because you're the only person who possesses a backup) sounds quite close to extortion.   Bear in mind that the data that you have is actually the property of your customer.  If you made and retained the backup 'incidentally' without their knowledge or express consent, you likely ran afoul of all sorts of copyright/IP laws, technically speaking.  And if you try to force them to pay you to hand over data that technically you should not have in the first place, you can expect those technicalities to become very real problems if your customer is even remotely competent.   So what's the fair price to charge for a backup that only you have that you created and retained without the customer's knowledge and consent? $0. What's the fair price to charge if you actually did have their consent?  Whatever your contract says.  Though likely they would have paid you for your time to create the backup, and not for the handing over of the backup data itself. And what's the fair price to charge for helping them install your backup data (if they ask you to do that for them, which they probably will if you hand the data over for free)?  Whatever your normal hourly rate is when doing comparable work."
"Can we charge ""being late"" penalties to the client?","I solve this by never giving 100% of my time to one client at once.  Say, for example, client A comes to me with a project. I quote that project on how long it'll take at 10/20 hours a week (25-50% of my time).  Then, when client B comes along, I allocate to them another proportion of my time (25-50%, depending on when they want it done), and start on it immediately. No client ever gets more than 50%. At the moment, I have multiple clients ranging from 5-50%. In total, they add up to 125% (or 50 hours). However, I almost never work that much because very often clients will be slow. I usually find I work 40 hours a week on average this way.  Another advantage is that my rate goes up as I get busier. Hours 0-5% are much cheaper than hours 100-125%."
Client Threatening to Contact Permanent Employer?,"I would drop them asap. Their behavior is not magically going to change in the future as the contract goes on. Their threats are not an acceptable way to conduct business at all and if they threaten you now even when no money has exchanged hands, how much more so will they when there is money on the line. I would walk away and not conduct business with them further."
Is it OK to Ask For a Credit Card Before Beginning Work?,"To address your direct question, no, it's not a great practice. To think of it in terms of risks, I would not want to risk my clients' credit card information being stolen (because I would likely be liable for that!) A more common practice is to require a deposit, or a percentage of the total fee due upfront before any work is to be completed. This ensures that, no matter what, you've at least received something for your time. Also, the client is motivated to follow through with the contract, since they've already paid money to you. Another practice is to require payments upon certain milestones, or well-defined break marks in the project. Work would not begin on the next milestone until payment has been made. Is it 100% reliable? No. Does it ensure that you at least get something for your time? Yes."
How to find good jobs on freelancing sites,"When you say freelancing, are you talking about working part time from home, or working for a period of weeks or months possibly on the clients site? I've been a contractor/consultant since 1994 and based on my experience, more money and more work is available if you are prepared to work on a clients site. It will also pay considerably more. I've been in management for about ten years - my last development contract was PHP,Javascript and a little MySQL back in 2004 or 2005 and doing a 40hour week my invoice was around 10,000 to 12000 GBP a month. Where to look? I see jobs on stackoverflow, linkedin and jobserve.  I think you are US based and I wrote an answer to a question that might interest you here:

Determining when to turn down business,"Believe it or not, I often find if a client is overly prepared they might be difficult to deal with. I have to remind those clients that I do this for a living, and they are in a completely different industry which has nothing to do with building websites. This is pretty subjective but some other red flags I see often are: But past all that the real problem here lies with you, the freelancer. If they are changing scope and functionality, then you either need to bill them appropriately or assess if you built the scope out correctly. It happens to all of us from time to time.. we think we have a solid grip on what they want built and end up being off target. No shame in it, just gotta deal with accordingly."
Should a contractor charge a higher hourly rate for a shorter term contract? Rules of thumb?,"I do charge a higher rate for shorter work.  This is especially true for contracts.  I figure I have more non-billables going into shorter work.  In my experience this is fairly typical of consulting businesses as well.  Other firms I have co-worked projects with have offered similar steep discounts for longer-term projects of up to 50% as well.  While consulting is not quite the same as contracting, a consulting perspective here can be of help in understanding what some of the issues are. The way this is typically done however is not raising the rate for short-term contracts but offering a long-term discount.  Ideally your initial asking rate should be what you would charge for a one-day contract, and you can offer discounts for longer projects.   For longer projects I have been known to offer up to 50% discounts (meaning my initial hourly rate can be as much as double what I would charge for a long-term big project).  This way long-term customers are happy because they got a discount, while short-term customers do not feel like you just jacked up your rates. Edit in reply to Luke's excellent points below It is true that dependability of income is important but it isn't the only thing to consider.   There are also a lot of expenses you have to pay to get a contract rolling.  These may include reviewing a contract with a lawyer if you want to, but also things you have less discretion on such as showing up for interviews and other parts of the ""sales process."" You can't charge for any of that, and so if you have a lot of small gigs that is far less helpful than if you have a few big ones.   Optimal is probably a steady flow of low-grade long-term contracts where you can work a different contract each day, and when one ends, you still have some availability to do sales channel work without being out of income. Another point is that you have a lot more negotiating power if you are not entirely relying on recruiters.  If you have other customers already, then you can more easily "
How should an independent contractor's resume differ from that of a candidate seeking a permanent position?,"First, let's put this in perspective. A resume is simply a brochure you hand a specific target market.  It has its own conventions, formatting standards, etc. but in the end it is just a piece of advertising material and ideally one piece among many. Likely your resume will go to a different target market and be read differently if you are are seeking employment (and that includes contract-to-hire) vs if you are seeking freelance consulting work, so like all advertising material you need to focus on your message and your audience, and you need a pretty good idea of what that audience is and what message will be receptive. So with that in mind, I don't think there are hard and fast rules.  However a general consulting resume is likely to be longer (beyond the 1 page rule) unless it is targetted at a specific gig, and it is likely to be supplemented by a much larger presence than a job-seeker's resume is likely to be (this is also a reason for longer length btw).  Additionally some contractors (those seeking contract-to-hire work) are likely to benefit from writing standard employment resumes, while those seeking short-term expert-level jobs will benefit from writing longer, consulting resumes (and then possibly paring down the resume for a specific sales lead). Again, the importance is to write a resume with a specific target audience and message in mind.  There is more variety among contractors than there is among job-seekers, and so while a general set of guidelines is impossible, the standard marketing rules apply."
What should I look at to determine whether or not I should charge by the hour or by fixed price?,"First, I usually do hourly up to x hours or just hourly, but I do some fixed bids too. In general fixed bids are preferable for a customer if the scope is very clear, and they are preferable for the consultant if the price is higher than the hourly would be.  I would say that most of my fixed bid work brings me more per hour than my hourly rate.  What I am doing essentially is saying that I will accept the risk of cost overruns for an up-front price, sort of like insurance.   Sometimes they go badly over, but enough of the time they don't that I am ok.  This is particularly helpful where cost overruns are rare but can be quite costly. If I agree to drop to per hour, generally the estimated goes down, but the customer assumes the risk of cost overruns. For example, I charge the same to migrate databases from previous versions of LedgerSMB to current, per database, as I do for one hour of consulting time.  This normally takes me half an hour or so, but there are cases where a customer has done something that causes significant problems with data integrity checks and can take five or ten hours to fix.  Billed hourly then most customers would pay half what I charge for this, but a few would pay up to 10 times.  The fixed bid lets me spread that risk around and give the customer a guarantee that might otherwise not be available. On the other hand, longer, open-ended projects are typically billed hourly."
"Project based freelance project requiring multiple unexpected ""redos"" from client","At the bottom of all my quotes I have this wording: We are here to provide an excellent customer experience. Because of this, we encourage input from the Client during the entire process. However, any major or significant changes requested during development, will carry along with them a renegotiated fee based on the new scope of the changes. We understand and encourage you as the client to voice your opinion and request to make any and all changes that you feel is in the best interest of your project. However, you as the client must also understand that in doing so, this may mean a considerable amount of work for us to make any major changes to the layout and design of your project. To recap, please note that our agreement does not include a provision
for “significant project scope modification” after the Client has
signed off on his/her chosen design. Some examples of significant
project modification at the request of the Client include: developing
a new structure to accommodate a substantial redesign at the Client's
request, recreating or significantly modifying the company graphic at
the Client's request, replacing more than 75% of the text at the
Client's request, creating a new navigation structure or changing the
link graphics at the Client's request, or significantly reconfiguring
the Client's shopping cart with new product, shipping, or discount
calculation if an e-commerce enabled site has been selected by the
Client. Then the challenge is to recognize when a major scope change is happening, and stop to renegotiate. If you're like me...you're just focusing on your work and suddenly you realize you just did a bunch of work for free and you're like ""Face Palm!"" I use a project manager on large projects to help with this. :)"
How important is a prompt reply in the freelance world?,"If your reply is simply ""I'm overloaded with work [... etc]"", should it really take two days to send out? As a (part-time) freelancer, I don't have the problem of being overloaded with freelance work (not yet!), but when coupled with all of my other responsibilities, it does get demanding.  I will say though that when I'm on the other end and hire contractors, if I leave a message to say I'm interested in having work done, I typically expect a call back within 1-2 business days. 3 is pushing it, depending on the service. If that doesn't happen, I assume they are  A) Unprofessional or  B) Too busy to provide me quality service at this time.  Time will tell if it's A or B. Eventually, if they do return my call, I still may ask for a quote from them if the work is still available, and may even go with them for this project or a future project. I understand some companies have busy seasons (landscape companies for example), and being busy myself I understand if small shops are overloaded at times. Your response time would ring in right on the edge in my book. It would be a -1 though just to hear that you'd have to follow up with me next week. If the response is a 2-3 day period, I would expect the consult pretty much at that point in time, and not have to wait a business week just for a quote. As a remedy, perhaps set some time aside during the day for following up with prospective clients. A 24 hour response time to touch base with them to schedule a future consult could go a long ways, and if everyone has the time right then and there you could do the consult then. The key word here (obviously) is schedule, a prompt reply to schedule a future meeting can keep your foot in that door, because rest assured that client is (at least should be) contacting other companies/freelancers that provide the same service, and don't want to wait a couple of days just for you to say your too busy and will call have time back next week. It's a microwave world now, coal burning ovens are a thing of the past. Calling and scheduling a meeting with them would at least hold them off from committing to another company until they've heard your offer.  Of course, it could go the other way; if your reputation precedes you, they may even want to wait for you to have the time to do their work, because they've heard or know just what kind of work you produce. That being said, if you're too busy to provide quality work, you're too busy to take on the client at this point in time. It would hurt to turn down a client, but you should at least follow up with them quickly, perhaps the time frame for completing the project does line up with your future schedule, and if it doesn't then you've made a great impression and they may contact you for further work (nothing wrong with being a backup). "
How do I determine which type of contract to use?,"I used to be an IT contractor for many companies, so I will speak from the service area: I always start each with a verbal agreement, just so we can get an idea of what needs to be done. In this time, I write down what I interpret their requirements/requests to be, any questions I want to ask about certain aspects of the project, and how much time I believe I would need. Once this is done, and all questions have been answered (again, writing down all the information, or recording with a voice recorder), I can put it into a written form. In my statements of work, I always leave some leeway on time for ""unforeseen interuptions"", including emergencies (personal, family, work, etc). I don't add it as a separate item, but I include it in the labour charge, as that is usually what it would come out as. If I believe I need parts, I can add an approximate cost based on past projects, or leave it blank stating that I would get prices later and get the client to confirm. Remember, your Statement of Work should have EVERYTHING that you, the contractor, and the customer want to have completed, with a list of possible costs. It's easier to ask for more money just in case up front, then to go half-way through a project and then explain why you need more. Depending on where you live, you may need to also charge extra taxes or fees for programs such as Worker's Compensation while on site, and you should also have liability insurance against any mishaps that happen, whether your fault or not. I include this all in the statement of work, and make sure that the client and myself sign it. We both then take a copy, and we can start on the work."
Desktop software for time tracking,"Toggl works for me for several years. It is an online service but they have a desktop app (as well as Android/iOS apps); Their desktop app detects the inactivity and asks you to keep or drop this time. The basic functionality is free and I like their online reporting features. They also allow downloading CSVs with your time and tasks; I used to write programs what took this input and created the invoices in the client-specific format, so there is a room for automation of your lower level bookkeeping. As to the tracking the time wasters, I use RescueTime (paid version); I set up a few messages what pop up when the trigger is met, like: ""You spent a hour today reading news. Maybe you are updated enough to start working."" and so on."
Who owns the result of my contracted work?,"This has bitten many people involved in work-for-hire situations. I feel like this is kind-of a cop-out on an answer, but honestly, it depends a very great deal on what kind of work you're doing, and I think Harvard Law School's Professor Terry Fisher has already answered your question with incredibly elaborate detail in Lecture 6 (entitled, The Mechanics of Copyright; in 3 parts) of his universally available CopyrightX MOOC, so I'm just going to refer you there for now. There are several other examples of situations like the one you describe throughout the other lectures too, but I know he talks about work-for-hire situations in that lecture."
"How should I deal with clients wanting to meet me, although I work at home?","I, and other freelancers I know do a lot of meetings at coffee-shops. Also, I constantly see a part owner of a designer firm I know, who has a large office, also doing meetings in the same coffee shops. In Canada it is also very difficult to get home insurance (if you give full disclosure) if clients come to your home, or even if they don't but you are incorporated & work at home. And, not giving full disclosure is kind of silly -- if you ever needed to make a major claim, they would have the grounds to deny it. So, if clients insist, tell them you are unable to meet clients at home because it would invalidate your home insurance. It is probably true, and you should find this out In BC, Canada I was only able after much searching to find one company who would insure me: BCAA. I like to occasionally meet clients at my home office because I have pretty cool setup, and I also frequently pair program at my home office. But I would never do it if my insurance didn't explicitly cover it. Another place to consider meetings are University spaces during the times they are less busy. Universities have lots of large, airy, spacious study spaces with power outlets and decent tables/chairs. On off-hours they are often nearly empty. A freelancing colleague of mine who does not like to work at home rents an ""enterprise"" space. This is a very common thing for non-tech businesses -- it is a space divided into lots of tiny offices that you rent, with a shared meeting room, kitchen, mailing address and optional answering service. They are inexpensive. I believe he pays $400CAD / month for a space large enough for three people to work in (I work there sometimes too). Smaller spaces are available for as little as $300/month."
How to approach local shops to offer them my service?,"Rather than any of the notions you list, I would start by getting to know them. Because you want to get to know the owners, you want to think about where the owners might hang out. For example: Is there a local chamber of commerce or other general-purpose business group in the area? Or there might be a general trade organization many participate in, like a restaurants association or retailers group.  Once you know that, you'll want to find a way to participate in meetings. With a chamber, you can simply join and attend meetings where your prospects are likely to be. Other organizations might have conferences or other events where vendors can meet prospective clients. Attending meetings regularly, meeting members and telling people about what you do will open the door to this type of conversation much more easily than cold interactions with strangers.  I've seen this work for other folks who develop websites. But don't expect 10 new websites from a single meeting. This takes time and regular attendance to be successful. "
Can learning a new technology be a paid task for a client?,"If you do not know how to build an iOS app...  And if you know none of this, because you couldn't possibly until you learn how to build an app, how could you ask a client to pay for something without knowing what the costs would be?? Are you expecting the client to just write a ""blank check"" so to speak and ""hope"" he/she gets a solid app in the end, after who knows how long? What if it takes you a year to learn things? What if after a year you still don't have a solid understanding of security issues? What if the client was expecting the app in 3 - 6 months? What if a ""team"" could have built the app in 6 weeks? Think about all that... now do you honestly think it's a good idea to ask the client to pay for you to learn? (Note: I know nothing about building iOS apps, but I could surely learn the basics and slap something together in a week. Something fairly functional and attractive in a month. However, building something for commercial purposes, in a solid, reliable manner, in any profession/environment often takes months of learning, if not years.)  In short, no. it is not ""okay"" to ask a client to pay you to educate yourself. He's/She's not your employer. To be frank, even just asking will make you seem really inexperienced and unprofessional. Employers may often pay for education because they reap direct rewards when their employees learn. It's an ""investment"" in the employee. But in a freelance situation, your client doesn't receive much of anything by paying you to learn something new. You would be essentially asking the client to pay you so they could be your ""guinea pig"". You get all the rewards and the client is left crossing their fingers hoping that you ""learn"" the correct stuff you need to learn. In most cases, the client is interested in a solid final product... so hire a team as you were asked to do.  I applaud you for wanting to learn... but delving into an entirely new language or environment is never something for which the client should be paying.  I should add that in the tech world learning is a constant and ongoing thing. It is not unheard of to get a client who wishes to use a specific API and you would need to learn how to adapt to that API. Basically.. you know PHP... but need to adapt your PHP to work with a client-requested API you've never used before, that's common. That's generally okay if you explain to the client that you are unfamiliar with the API they want and will need to educate yourself about it. You aren't learning new things as much as you are learning how to translate what you already know. However, this is markedly different that ""having never built an iOS app, I want to try."" Learning brand new, never before explored, technologies is something you should do on your own. "
Firing a client due to difficult ongoing work relationship,"I have terminated a few contracts and I have always agonized about it. However, termination goes smoothly because the client usually hasn't gone through the mental anguish over the project that I have. They usually are pretty calm and professional about it, despite whatever shenanigans happened during the project.  I always use the timeline as a reason for termination and that I have other clients waiting. Usually I give a good amount of notice before terminating and usually time it around the invoicing cycle. Not only is giving notice a professional courtesy, but it also prepares them for the work that is involved in closeout, which includes final payment. So far, I haven't left money at the table in termination, but I am willing to take that chance. I'd hate to lose the opportunity for better clients because I stayed in a bad situation.  For the agony I have had in deciding to terminate, I am rewarded with the great sense of relief that it is over. We are freelancers and our work is ""at-will"" and the only person coercing us to stay is ourselves. "
Should I give the finished work to a client before or after they paid me?,"Always after. You've got to protect yourself. The way I'd recommend structuring a project - and make sure you explain this beforehand - is to request a 50% upfront deposit (or whatever amount suits your project). You can say that you need the deposit to secure the project in your timetable which is a great way to get people to pay quickly. Then you make sure they know that the remaining amount will be required on sign off of the project, but before any open artwork is released.  Again, a great way to get your invoices paid quickly.  If you give the work before receiving payment I guarantee most clients will take their sweet time paying :)  In your case I'd suggest sending watermarked images for sign off and releasing the high resolution ones as soon as payment has hit your PayPal account. Hope this helps!"
How can I edit my cover letter to get more clients?,"[Bit of background, I've done contract work exclusively through oDesk since 2006.] As far as I see it, the single most important thing you can do in your cover letter is tell them how you'll solve their problem. That's really what (in most cases) they're looking for. They only care about your past work, your experience, or how well you're rated in terms of how it relates to their specific project.  So don't make them do the work of relating those things - show them how your experience makes you a good match for their project by laying out what you'll do for them. If they're looking for a WordPress developer to write a custom plugin, take their description and give them an idea of how it would work, Maybe it would be best implemented as a short code, maybe best as something else. Give them a comparison and recommendation. By just listing your experience and portfolio of sites, you're leaving it up to them to determine if you're a good fit for their specific project. Don't do that, show them they can be certain you're able to complete their project. When you do this, you'll become how they measure other contractors. Using the above example, did anyone else explain that there are roughly two ways to implement what they want in WordPress?  Now you're the leader by default. Another way to look at this: pretend they're already selected you as the contractor. What are the first set of questions you'd ask them as a client? Ask those questions in the cover letter."
Finding the first client [closed],"This is always hard to find work at starting  no matter how intelligent you are ... but you can get slightly easier if you have created any project to show , and contribute in some open source which would be good and you  can tell about this either to client or to company(in case you want to do job ) and its easy to get clients by friends/family  references "
Why anybody would work without a contract?,"This is a common scam on Upwork. Well, not a real scam, but here is the thing: You CANNOT rate him before he finished the work. So if he is not sure he can finish the work, he will work on it, but without accepting the offer. So if you are unhappy, or he is not in the mood to finish the contract, you CANNOT DO ANYTHING about it. And if you are happy, he will accept the contract because he knows that you will give him good rating.  DO NOT work with such guys. You have no idea if this is not a real scammer who can ruin your server.  DO contact support and report such behavior. There guys are inventing new things every day so let Upwork deal with them, and you do not work without a contract. "
How do I estimate the cost of building an mobile app?,"There is no formula for magically determining the number of hours a task will take based on complexity.  Rather than agreeing to a fixed price, you might want to break your project into milestones and give an estimate of the number of hours between milestones, and charge hourly. This is most important especially when you consider the fact that as you finish your milestones, your client is probably going to be asking for changes.  If you do fixed price, you can't recover for such changes.  If ultimately the client is in charge of requirements then you want to avoid the client having the ability to make the work take much longer without you having any ability to receive reasonable compensation for your work."
"Whilst employed, can I open a freelancing website account?","As someone said, you should consult your lawyer. He will read the agreement you both signed and then see if they are right or wrong. Most companies sign binding contracts with their developers which do not allow that their employee work in the same branch. For example, if your company develops slots machines, then you are not allowed to do such coding after the work. But you are allowed to do game coding or mobile apps coding since these are not related areas.  Of course, the only thing that matter is what you signed in your contract with them. Now, speaking honestly, you did not do anything wrong since you never did any job. But you may have talked with their competitors and most companies will punish such acts.  Ask you lawyer to talk to your company and offer that they punish you (percentage of salary) if you did something which is illegal. It's pretty harsh just to fire you.  And in the end, if you are a developer and good developer, then seek for another job. This company of yours looks like a horror company. If they punish small mistakes like that, then they do not appreciate their workers. Of course, I am speaking this in case this is your first mistake and you are usually a good worker. In such case, I would leave this company asap but consult the lawyer just to know if they had right to fire me. "
How do I keep up to date with the industry when I spend time working alone?,"There's a few things that can really help with keeping up-to-date with the world from a programmer's point of view. If you (for example) have a stack using PHP, nginx, mysql and redis (and a server company)... follow their blogs.
Follow them, and keep up-to-date with improvements, new features, quality-of-life improvements, and so on. Heck, follow them on twitter (it's the fastest resource I've seen besides nagios for alerting you to an issue on the internet). Working from home is very, very isolating. I often have to take breaks and go outside (the horror) due to burnout and feeling isolated. But you don't have to go outside; join an open source community on freenode IRC, for example. Start helping out, if you'd like. I have a website and server setup that practically bleeds money. I've been working on it since 2009, and it has been the largest single source of new knowledge about programming for me. It's gotten me jobs before, and it gathers about 90,000 views/day. I wouldn't have it any other way. And it's pretty much just a place where I code for fun (it's a radio station). Do something that interests you, and make it big. It doesn't have to gather a community; it could be something neat that you want to experiment with. Answer questions on things you care about. It might just help you learn a best practice (or something new) about what you work with. You could probably set yourself a challenge to hit 3k rep in a tag, etc. Try to keep everything you work with up-to-date with the absolute latest versions (and pay attention to breaking changes, or new features). This will not only keep you up-to-date with the industry as a whole, it will actually put you ahead of it. Companies are notoriously inefficient with updating their software.
(Note: this is only really true for backend web development unless using JavaScript libraries or the like)"
I have a meeting with a potential client tomorrow and I have no idea what to do,"First off, calm down. Nothing good comes from those who panic, and don't think things thoroughly!  Now that you're calmed down, I want you to Ask a Duck. Pretend your duck is the client, and they are asking you questions about a website. What seems important? Write it down! What seems like an asinine request? Ignore it! You may look silly, but I promise it will help! For websites specifically, I always have the client be prepared for the meeting. I let them know that my time is valuable as well (never leave out that part!), and that they only get one hour of free consultation to a website with me, so it's cheaper for them to come up with the general guidelines. On paper, with a pen or pencil, they should have a rough layout of what they want, and how the pages should flow (menu wise or link wise). They should be able to describe the type of content they want on each page. Now, do they need to know the colour scheme already? Have all the stock photos? Not yet. That can come later. Your job is to understand how they want the website to work, then estimate how long it would take. But, have them do the most work with doing a quick design first on paper. DO NOT HAVE THEM DO IT IN MICROSOFT WORD! They will likely spend too much time on it, and it will make it harder for you (as the designer) to implement it from a Word document. Mostly, it will take them too much time. Tell the client that you need this BEFORE you meet, so they are prepared, and have an idea of what it is they want. The first meeting is supposed to be quick, so visuals help. It also cuts down on you doing all the drawing, and just hoping that the client likes it!"
Does freelancing experience count in the business world?,"I wasn't sure whether to post this as a comment, as it's not a direct answer to the question, but it is relevant(ish)... Your experience prior to the job is valid (whether freelance or otherwise) and will certainly be considered by prospective employers when assessing your CV. On the other hand, and making an assumption, if the role you have been employed in is a Graduate Role, then your under-graduate work (no matter how valid or relevant) may well not be considered, as HR departments can be notorious box-tickers! [*]  Personal Experience has shown that I've been required to complete probation at every permanent role I've had - even with 25+ years in the Big Wide World, of which 12 were ""full time"" freelance, and several others were/are part-time freelance. Probation is a two-way process, which allows you to see if you fit into the company and its culture, as well as the company assessing you. I certainly wouldn't take offence that you've been asked to undertake a probationary period... if they thought you were not up to the job, they wouldn't have offered you it! [*] Off topic anecdote: in 2008, I was asked by the MD of my then main client to take on a full-time permanent role within the company. After some negotiation, we shook hands on a deal.  Then HR got involved, and amongst other things, I was required to submit two references (even though I'd been working with the company for several years). My first two referees were rejected as being inappropriate - the Managing Director and the Engineering Director :)  So I had to get two people I hadn't spoken with for nearly five years to act as referees..."
How do I deal with clients who ask me to change the design every few days?,"I send them a bid for additional work.  ""Sure we can do that.  It will cost $x more.  Would you like me to get started?"" The basic point is that you are the expert in your work, and in your business.  The customer is the expert in what the customer needs.  What you are doing by treating the change request as an RFQ (Request for Quotation) is to push back and protect your own investment while leaving yourself open to do what the customer needs done if they need it that badly.   Now I have been known to just do it when the amount of work isn;t very large.  But when it is more than a small change, or if it is happening frequently, then I start using it as a negotiating point for more money. This is also important because it puts your business in a more positive/professional light, while still respecting your customer."
Retainer Agreements,"A retainer is a fee payable in advance for ensuring your availability to serve a client, and comes with a service level agreement. For example the agreement should include: Any time (or tasks) spent over and above the agreed X is billable, as are expenses incurred - both usually in arrears.  I would expect that the retainer carries a premium over what it covers - after all, they are in effect paying for you to be ""on call"""
How to not burn bridges when turning down a contract,"If you've been a freelancer for awhile, and even if you're just getting started, you most likely have a network of contacts, who you know professionally or privately, who may very well be looking for freelancing work themselves and who may also have the skills the potential client is looking for. Keep in mind that these organizations are looking for solutions to problems, and many times it doesn't really matter who solves the problem, so long as it gets solved. So if you already have a good relationship with the organization, then it's likely you can help them out by making it easier for them to find someone who can solve their problem. If you play your cards right, you could become the go-to person whenever this person needs help from a freelancer, and by building your network in this manner, you'll also build your reputation and may be able to gain referrals from other freelancers and these clients."
How do freelance web developers approach security and liability?,"I'm a freelance web developer and security researcher, so my experience may be a little biased. In general, web development is a pretty insecure mess. More experienced developers are generally seen as more security-focused programmers; you first learn to program, then you learn to program well, then you learn to program securely. In general, if your client is focused on security, recommend that they have an independent security audit as part of the signing-off process. This will be a team or individual who will do analysis of code, general penetration testing, and so on, and you'll be given a report of things to fix before final sign off. This should be worked out beforehand with your client, and you should be sure to include an indemnity clause in your contract for what you have created. I'm not a lawyer, but this is from my contract: I can’t guarantee that my work will be error-free and so can’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised myself of them. Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Original Source - Contract Killer 3 As a web developer, your responsibility is to plug any obvious holes. This can be found on OWASP (the Open Web Application Security Project), in their top 10 vulnerabilities, but for brevity, you need to mitigate the following things: In addition, regardless of where you are in the world and what data privacy laws are, make sure you adhere to the most strict privacy laws in the world (most EU states) if your application collects sensitive data. Separation of Concerns in all aspects of your app should be adhered to; just following most privacy laws leads to reduced data leaks."
Is there any benefit of taking skills test on freelancing sites?,"As someone who has hired people to write copy for me, the tests can be useful. I want someone who can write good English straight away. It is a pointless exercise if I hire someone and then have to fix their English!"
How to back out of a freelance project that has gotten too big?,"she still owes me for the work I've done How long has she owed you and how much? If she's past due on a payment, or owes you thousands, that could be enough reason to stop right there. But should I refund her any money because I'm quitting? Not unless you had a formal agreement to do work that you haven't already done, or she paid you for work you haven't done yet. If you aren't leaving her in an extremely bad position, probably don't worry about it. What should I do? Tell her you appreciate working with her and are glad you were able to help her build her site while growing in your own experience, but now you are moving on to bigger things and unfortunately don't have time for this side project. If she knew you were a student she should have been expecting you to eventually leave for a real job. She sounds like the type who loves to exploit college students and she'll probably try to pressure you into doing more work for her at the same rate. Just say no. It will be very easy after you get your first paycheck from your internship!"
How to convert employment opportunities into consulting jobs?,"When I receive recruiter emails, I politely respond with my situation (I work from home, do hourly consulting, won't relocate, always have people knocking, etc.) and say if that doesn't work for them, then I won't be able to help them. The responses usually come in two forms: The second one, for me, has turned in to a consulting gig more often than not. It fulfills what codenoire says about not wasting time, but also confirms that it's actually a full time spot. A real recruiter will get paid more for full time placement so, of course, they won't lead with consulting opportunities. A team of real employees just needs to get work done. If their recruiters are failing, they'll need to fill in regardless. If you're the right person, they'll usually appreciate the simplicity of a consulting agreement over hiring, anyway, especially since it's gives them flexibility down the road. Incidentally, unlike what codenoire says, all my contract work is 10-99 based. All my work is done in the state I'm located at; my clients are never in my home state, though. Video calls have almost completely removed the need for on-site visits. (Unfortunately, I enjoy the occasional work trips.) I hope this helps."
Should I work for free for non-profit organizations?,"This is somewhat of an opinion-based question. So, my answer will be primarily opinion-based as well.  Pro Bono means for the good of all. There are many non-profit or not-for-profit organizations which are not ""for the good of all"" but rather the ""good of our select group"".  It's important to first realize that many non-profit organizations still make a profit. The difference is their tax status and the idea that they reinvest the profit into the organization rather than distributing dividends to shareholders or owners. That does not mean they have no money. Many ""non-profit"" organizations pay their employees very handsome salaries. You may be interested in the salary studies for nonprofit executives (view the PDF link at that page). I'm generalizing here. There are non-profit organizations which are solely focused on their mission. But I feel it's a common misconception that ""nonprofit"" means ""no money"". My point is many nonprofit organizations are merely businesses with a special tax status. That does not mean they can't afford to pay for services just like any other business. They all ask for reduced pricing or free work, but the reality is they have funds they could allocate if they saw the need as important enough. This is no different than any client I've ever come across. That being posted.... I have donated services. I have worked at reduced pricing for some organizations. I have worked at full rate for nonprofit organizations. I do not see any detrimental aspects to working for nonprofit organizations you believe in and wish to support.  Donating specialized services on a volunteer basis (or reduced cost) is merely one way you can give to charity other than your physical presence. In fact, it is often a better use of those with specialized skills the organization is in need of. Grassroots.org is an organization specifically designed to match up those with special skills with non-profit or volunteer organizations in need of those skills. It is important to treat any donations or reduced cost work as real work though. With full project specifications, timelines, and budgets.  You need the full project scope so you can cap what you are doing and prevent the ever-running project scope which may happen. Set hard milestones or finalization factors and once they are met close the project. Don't let the organization stray, they will tend to without any direct malice. You need to manage them because without pricing involved, they may tend to just keep asking for more. You can always work on multiple projects, but don't let it become one ever-increasing morphing thing.  Really the only difference on your end should be the invoice. Either it is due or not. If you have an agreement to donate services, it's a good idea to still send the invoice but mark it as ""donated"" or indicate a discount if working at reduced rates. This way the organization has an understanding of what you are doing for them beyond the actual work. Even if you don't charge the organization a penny, you need to have them agree on the price of what you are providing (tax purposes). If you donate a $500 item to your local Goodwill (assuming US locale) that is a tax deduction. Check with your accountant, but any donated services may also alter your tax situation depending upon the organization.  In short, No. I do not believe supporting any nonprofit or not-for-profit organization you wish to help is detrimental to any industry as a whole. It is only working for commercial, sales/service, profit-driven, businesses which lowers the standards other clients have for freelancing. And to be honest all the ""contest"" sites on the web do more harm there than you ever will."
Contributing back to open source projects you've used and improved on the job?,"Disclaimer: Always read contracts you sign multiple times. Regardless of whether or not a contract is enforceable, be sure you do not agree to anything you disagree with. Nope. this is a straight up ""no"", regardless. You are contributing to an open source project. For your employer/client to claim copyright over your contributions to an open-source project would violate absolutely every single FOSS license that has, can, does or will exist (bold statement in some countries, but you should really adhere to this). If you are employed, pull request in your own time, away from work (as technically your employer can claim copyright and thus your pull request can be denied/invalidated, depending on license) If you are freelancing, just pull request. Unless you accepted a contract which sold your soul to your client for every waking moment until the date your project is finished, there are no problems with contributing to open-source projects as a freelancer. Something very, very important to note here is that you do not create the code as part of your client's module/program. Create it and license it, and you will own the copyright regardless of outcome. Just don't write it while on the client's premises. You should also publish it somewhere well in advance, and use it as a library in the client's code. Be sure the license is compatible. You should publish code you intend to reuse under a permissive license and then include them as libraries. Any other course of action can (and probably will) result in upset from software consumers who dislike open-source. I recall asking a Marketing Manager at Microsoft UK what his stance on open-source was and he looked at me like I'd just grown another head. If the company wants ""proprietary information"" in a program, then they will not make it open sourced, period (with a few exceptions). However, if they do decide to open source some of the work that you do, you can just agree to be a contributor or agree to be attributed in the contract; this entire negotiating area is quite daunting. There's a few rules that govern this, but if in doubt, always consult a lawyer or a government legal aide. If: Then it is entirely reasonable (and even enforced in countries such as the USA) that they own copyright and licensing for that work. They can also enforce an NDA on the code you are writing, but this must be in the contract when you agree to write the software if they wish to enforce it."
Sorting out the time wasters from serious clients,"What I do is in the first phone conversation I give them a ball park ""starting from"" figure and tell them the minimum deposit - this gets rid of a few straight away. If all is good after the initial phone call I tend to set up a meeting and give them a more exact quote after the meeting and tell them the exact payment terms then - e.g. 30% up front, 30% on designs signed off and 40% upon completion. Most seem pretty happy with this method for me, I try not to invest too much time until I know a client is definitely on board, around a 30 minute phone call, 30 minutes research and an hour meeting."
Can I modify clients testimonials?,"This answer is based upon my 20 years experience of having legal departments review testimonials and approve/refuse edits. I am not a lawyer though. Almost every piece I design has many, many testimonials and they almost always go through that company's legal department for review. So, while I'm not a lawyer myself, I've gotten familiar with what I can and can't do with respect to testimonials. For testimonials, generally no, you should not edit when possible.  Testimonials are unlike other text. For legal reasons, what is reproduced must very closely resemble what was actually submitted.  You may also want to consider the fact that some grammatical errors and non-standard usage may actually lend to the credibility of the testimonials themselves. People, in general, don't write casually using absolute proper English. So, it's not absolutely necessary to stick to proper English when reproducing casual conversation. ""It has been great!"" ----> ""[Company] has been great!"" or ""He taught me alot!"" ----> ""[Joe] taught me alot"" (yes grammatical error was left as is) ""The savings have unbelievable!"" ----> ""The savings have [been] unbelievable!"" ""The savigns have been unbeleivable!"" --> ""The savings have been unbelievable!"" ""My cat, Snowball, hates winter. She likes to play in the leave in Autumn though. This product was fantastic at reducing her hairballs!"" --> ""This product was fantastic at reducing hairballs!"" Removing innocuous, unimportant, unrelated bits is generally okay. but anything which directly refers to the company/product/service should generally be left as is. You should be aware that some legal departments have had issues with overly ""cherry-picking"" testimonials. Don't eliminate actual testimonial text that may be less than ""wonderful"" for the product/service if it's then followed by something you do wish to include. The intent of the testimonial should often remain. Again, this can also lend to the credibility of the testimonial itself.  If you are overly concerned with an unintelligible testimonial, it's best to either not use that testimonial, or have a legal department review the changes you wish to make. Testimonials are quotes and putting words into someone else's mouth can be haphazard and problematic. You should strive to leave things as they are quoted as much as possible. It is not unheard of for a someone to see their name being used as a testimonial and be unhappy with how the intent of their quote has been changed. For example...  ""I signed up for SubscriptionB last year. I hate this company! All they do is steal from me. I wish I knew they existed years ago. Then I'd have a benchmark to avoid!""  could be edited down to  ""I signed up for Subscription B last year. I wish I knew [Company] existed years ago.""  Which completely changes the intent of the quote... and can get you/the company into a lot of trouble. In my world, for my clients, the clients have to retain the original testimonial letter/email/video/whatever for comparison. And I have worked with companies in the past where the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed testimonials. So, when comparing the original quote to what was reproduced, it should always be clear that they are essentially the same quote and not overly edited to meet a sales goal. "
"What are the tax issues involved with ""employing"" a worker in a different country?","So this is an interesting question and I decided to do a little research. It seems that non-resident employees (those who are residents of one country but work in another) are subject to double taxation (being taxed by both their country of residence and country of work) unless they obtain special dispensation by filing a lot of paperwork. New Zealand
UK The United States IRS has special tax codes specifically for U.S. residents who are employed by an international organization or foreign government. Source The UK also specifies particular tax requirements for employees in offshore areas, including the specific stipulation that ""Most offshore areas are now designated as part of a particular country. Both employers and employees will almost certainly have to meet the taxation requirements of that country."" Source
More Info Clearly the details of the taxation are going to be unique to each specific tax code of the two countries involved. Also note that these links apply to employees, not to independent contractors or suppliers (as Andrew mentioned). For contracting, you're actually purchasing a product/service so the taxation likely falls under trade agreements rather than employment tax law. Outsourcing to/from another country may be liable to import/export taxes. This blog post has some useful advice in it regarding international independent contractors, though hard numbers are again going to be impossible to lay down without research into the specific countries involved. Your best bet is to talk to an accountant who is already familiar with these tax situations. Otherwise, spend a lot of time reading the tax code for each country where you plan to outsource."
How am I supposed to bill the company?,"We do not have any kind of official contract That's a problem because this type of question is typically answered within the contract that the two parties agreed upon. We can't possibly answer your question with any certainty as we don't know what the agreement is between you and your client.  You and your client need to talk and agree as to whether or not they want to pay for you to be available for all hours, or just pay you for the time it takes to complete assigned tasks.  The former is likely in the best interest of both parties. They get dedicated time from you, and you get a dedicated pay check. If the latter is the case, though, then you need to point out to them that you won't be available for 40 hours a week as you will be taking on other external projects to fill up your time on those slow days. "
To talk with client or to chat with client and the effects on landing contracts,"It is your freelance business, and if you prefer written communication to voice communication, it is okay to make that choice. I prefer email to phone conversations, and I have been freelancing for > 10 years. That being said, I do occasionally speak to my clients. Here are some observations:"
Quotation not favorable (against me) to write software features,"When a client asks you for fixed-price, in essence the client is asking you to absorb the risk.  Unless your specs are done in mind boggling detail, the client is going to assume that anything caused by poor communication is a cost that you are going to absorb. So here's a fair exchange: if the client has the capability to alter the requirements, then you must have the capability to charge more.  This is accomplished most easily by going hourly, but many clients balk at that. If you're doing fixed-price and your client starts coming up with substantial, material changes, require the client to submit a written change order to which you can invoice and demand some more money.  That's the best way to force the client to think before asking you to deliver more."
Dealing with an Irate Client that wants Free Work,"It's easy: Stop falling for the guilt trip and simply do as any professional would do in similar case.  That is, say yes and show a price list at the same time. And stick to this. If the client sill comes back that XYZ should be included, you simply cut that short and say ""let me know when you'll have the budget for the extra features and I'll be happy to help you with this!"" And if it keeps going, you can use another formula such as ""let me know if you have questions about the last proposal/pricelist I sent you about the extra features."" That is way more efficient than arguing about what was included and isn't, and going back and forth about the content of the first proposal. You will force the dialog to be about money and budget. The first proposal is matter of the past, and what the client is asking for is a new proposal, that's simple. You don't have to feel bad for this, it's just business. If that client keeps harassing you, stick to the budget formula, ask for down payment and always redirect the conversation to this. Don't waste your time with excuses and long emails about the ""whys"". In any case, you do not owe any explanation and should avoid going into the ""I need money to survive"" or ""I can't afford to work for free because XYZ"". That's lowering yourself in giving excuses no entrepreneurs should ever have to give in business and you know your client is aware of this anyway. You're the one wasting your time in the end because you'll either be underpaid or not paid at all. Your client is simply gambling using ""emotional talk""; these people do this because it works for them and they get lot of free work this way. Don't worry about the badmouthing for now. People who know you and the client are probably used to see that person badmouth everybody. On the other hand, if you have proofs about the badmouthing, you can always mention in 1-2 sentences that you will not tolerate any bad words affecting your reputation as a professional and might get your lawyer involved if this doesn't stop. And of course, you should stop negotiating with that client because that's what you seem to be doing."
Does the type of payment method reflect the implied professionalism of a freelancer?,"Payment options are really less about the freelancer's professional, and more about the kind of customers the freelancer works with and what they are comfortable with. For the customers that I work with (small, local businesses), I am paid via business check. I'd prefer to use an electronic payment, but my customers are comfortable with the current approach and in 10 years of freelancing I've never had an issue. Other customer types may need different options. But I don't think it reflects on the freelancer's professionalism, unless they will only accept payment options that repeatedly aren't appropriate for the type of customers they are working with."
Bad rating has decreased my chances of getting work - How can I recover from bad feedback?,"Short answer Before getting to the long answer, let's define several things: The ultimate goal of the client is getting the job done. Job is scope + budget + terms. Unless they are totally insane, they give you bad feedback because they feel the job was worse than the expected. It can be scope, budget, or terms in any combination.
I would not agree that having a 5-star is the ultimate goal on freelancing Web sites. Yes, contract applications are sorted by contractors' rating so it helps finding new contracts easier, but the reputation of 4.81 seems quite good for me.
Yet another problem that indeed worth your attention is how do you manage the problem situations. And (not to rant) you seem to have handled it wrong this time. So, the entire question seems to be split into several smaller ones, let me formulate them: You may or may not will to get further projects from this very client, but you most likely are interested to keep your reputation with them. Even regardless oDesk feedback, the professional world is very small, and sooner or later it hits you back. As I said, the client gives bad feedback because they feel the job is worse than expected. It may or may not be recoverable as of today, but you should certainly try to recover. It will open some nice opportunities to you: So, ask the client what exactly is wrong with the job you have done.
It's not about your medical issues. You have signed for a job and have not completed it and apparently not reported that you're unable to continue. This is the thing to be recovered in the first order. I believe, this is the major (or entire) reason of the bad feedback.
Unless you have totally ruined your reputation and they refuse to talk to you (which seems to be not the case here), think what practical, doable items can be there.
I did not say it must be free. If they paid you for the certain work done, you have to get it done. But usually, the scope changes over time.
Specifically ask what can be done so that they changed their feedback. I mean, not only the ""4 stars"" or ""5 stars"". It's important what they write in an accompanying note. Even if it is ""4 stars"", but they state that you have been able to resolve the issues, you can always let the others to read it.
The better you recover with an unhappy client, the less you would lose due to a low reputation.
Improve the way how you communicate (see below) and avoid common mistakes in the future.   A 4.81 reputation is not a disaster. A good client will not only look at ""stars"", but also read the accompanying notes. This is why I think they are important.
Try to find several smaller jobs and get good feedbacks for getting them done. This is not about incomplete or badly written code. Contractors get bad ratings when/because they did not ""make the client happy"". There are many subjective aspects here which can't be covered in this answer. The objective ones are: With all above, I hope you will get recovered quickly, your reputation will raise, and your clients will give you good feedback in the future. Update:
The feedback specifically says that you were ""very easy to work with"" and did a good job until medical issues affected your performance. I guess, you should certainly contact them and say something like: I understand that my performance was not good, and I think the ""4 stars"" feedback is pretty much fair. However, I'm looking forward to get further projects from your company. I'm also aware about my reputation at oDesk as I freelance for living.
  Can we negotiate about what can I do to convince you to change your feedback? Here you may list what you can actually do for the past project (if it's not completed yet) or for another project with the same client. I'm absolutely confident you can get through it."
Why < $10 per hour for freelancing?,"I used to charge around that when I started. I was a student back then, working during the night and studying during the day. These were my thoughts: What others said is true too, $7 is a lot in some places for some people. Everybody doesn't want to do a job at McD. You can hire an 2-4 years experienced web developer for around $300/month in some countries."
How should I brand myself?,"Why maintain a false facade?  People like dealing with people. In fact, they often prefer it over dealing with a company. There's no reason to pretend you are something you are not.  I contemplated this same thing briefly when starting out. What I found was ... As an ""organization"" when I received a cold call from someone, they were merely shopping around and trying to get general pricing or guidelines. Most never wanted to proceed past an initial exploratory conversation. A few did, but they were simple one-off, no relationship, jobs. I much prefer repeat business. I had to ""sell"" and convince these cold calls their project could be completed. If work was gained, the clients were far more rude and demanding. They failed to treat anything as if they were dealing with people and every conversation was along the lines of ordering lunch or some other non-personal conversation. It was very difficult to pick up fluctuations in perceptions and desires because everything was so cold and distant to a degree. Issues which arose were first seen as my ""company"" issues rather than an honest, open-minded look to se where a problem may lie. In short, as an organization you are treated like a building -- no personal connection. As a person, people speak with far more respect and value my time a great deal more. Cold calls were directly seeking to hire me and only wanted reassurance. I had to talk myself out of the work with these calls. Clients understand that it's my knowledge and experience at work not some nameless intern working on their project. They understand that if I present an issue they can't assume it's my fault. In fact, most assume the opposite knowing I wouldn't bring it up unless I needed to. I'm given far more consideration when I need more time on a project. I'm paid much faster and with less issues than I was as a non-personal company.  In general, people treat people like they want to be treated. People treat businesses like the business is out to get one over on them. There's a world of difference. That being posted, if you present yourself as an ""organization"" do you really want to speak about yourself as a third person? What if you have a distinct personality conflict with a client mid-project and they want to work with someone else? Do you then disclose your'e a one-person operation? That will result in feelings of betrayal and a loss of trust - goodbye client forever. The only feasible reason I can see to portraying yourself as a company is to have multiple personalities and use multiple email addresses to respond to clients. What about phone calls? What if a client asks, ""Why do we always deal with you? Is there someone else we can talk to?"" Sure, as an organization you may be looked at for some larger projects by bigger clients. But if you can handle the project as an individual, you'll still be contact by those clients (provided your marketing is decent).  You can be a one-person company operating under a company name but its only employee/owner/operator. That doesn't really seem to deter anyone who's ever contacted me. I brand my company. And I don't hide the fact that my company consists of only me. I didn't want to brand my name (it's too difficult to pronounce for some). It's okay to be a person with an accountant, or a person with an assistant, but in my view don't pretend to be something you're not. It is way more hassle than it's worth in the long run and there are practically no benefits to it. I will add that if you choose to go with a company branding, your name or some other unique identifier in the company name can be very helpful. For example, people may forget that ""Blue Goat Coding"" did that work for them 5 years ago. Bu they will remember they dealt with ""Bob Smith"" on that project 5 years ago. If the company name is ""Smith Coding"" or ""Code by Bob"" it will assist in client retention in the long run."
Offsetting own labour as 'allowable expenses' when accounting,"Unless UK tax law has some strange twist, your own labor always zeros itself out. Imagine that you actually paid yourself, and you could claim that expense as the cost of doing business. However, you would also now have new income (from your new client - yourself). The income amount is equal to the expense amount; the net is zero."
"How do I make money in a legal, moral way from home with my computer, without interacting with humans or uploading photo id?","You can try freelancing as you don't need to engage with anyone directly with this type of work, and a photo ID is also not essential.
Here are some of the tips that may benefit you. I hope these points can help you. If you still have any questions, feel free to discuss them."
What are proper manners when delivering project after agreed date?,"Well I also did some deductions after I was late in the project. I took down my hourly price 25%. In the end, the client was happy, but I am not sure I did the right way.  After this event, I started informing clients as soon as I run across the bottleneck or slow task by explaining them why I estimated atask for X hours and now realize it will take Y hours. So far, this works well and I don't have to drop my price down.  So the key is in the communication and keeping the client aware of all good and bad things. You can always pack bad things in the nice wrapping, but I would always tell the client about the issues, than implement them the quick & wrong way or telling him about it in the last minute. "
How do you motivate yourself when you're your own boss?,"In literal terms, be your own boss in every sense of the word. When I find that motivation for client projects is slipping I fall into ""boss"" mode. That is, I set a schedule for work and adhere to it as if I had a boss. It doesn't have to be a strict 9 to 5 schedule, but a block of time -- 4, 6 or 8 hrs -- every day where I will not touch anything other than client projects. I don't ""cheat"" and venture off. No random social network/forum/SE surfing during this time. No personal phone calls or text messages. No unnecessary breaks. I treat my office as if I didn't own it and someone else was responsible for my paychecks. This helps me ensure I stay disciplined and get work completed as I need to.  It can sometimes be very difficult to spend time doing things you would rather not be doing at the time. But if you had a 9-5 job, that's exactly what you would be doing most days. There are times where I must simply force myself to buckle-down and get things done. This is especially true if you're own lack of motivation is financially becoming an issue. Remember, slack off too much and you'll be looking for a new job which will probably pay less, if not new clients in a desperate fashion. If that's not motivation for you, it should be. I also find that after the first 30 minutes to an hour, the motivation is no longer an issue for that particular day, sometimes more. Much like any task in life you really don't feel like doing.... once you start it, it becomes far less daunting that staring at it from across the room. Here's a related question at GraphicDesign.StackExchange.com: 
How to Get motivated When Drained"
Apply and bid for an Android Development freelancing project online,"I started freelancing 2 months ago with Android development and landed my first job in just 1 day. The key points are: That's pretty much it. Remember low prices and good work at first, then higher prices and better work as you gain more experience."
Client threatening legal action constantly,"Life's too short..  You have 2 choices.... Barring these two choices, I don't know what else you can do. Certainly trying to ""change"" the client or alter his work habits or how he interacts with you will never be fruitful. Getting everything in writing is a good idea, but that should have been done from day 1. (Hopefully your files are not a nightmare for another developer. But even if they are... well, if it's not part of your contract to deliver complete documentation, then... well...)"
How can I reassure a client who is scared of me stealing their idea?,"This is sort of a familiar one. A client wants someone to build a website, and doesn't want to give them all the pieces of the puzzle at once (or is very vague about it). There are three choices here: There's also a fourth, oft-cited but never usually done by clients that act this way: Sign a contract, stating that you will not do so (aka a Non-Disclosure Agreement). It's a really simple process for the client, but too often I see clients with no real business sense trying to protect an idea without a clue what they can do except hog the puzzle pieces and not give you them until you've solved the rest of the puzzle (which is a grossly unacceptable way to create a website, to be frank). Explain to your client, in relatively simple terms, that keeping ideas and designs to themselves is the absolute wrong way to go about designing a successful website. Explain that many things on the website (skeleton layout, templating, major parts of CSS) cannot start without the entire picture in place. If they did start without the entire design, for example, you would be constantly remaking the site's skeleton layout from scratch."
Working simultaneously for multiple clients,"Is it possible? Yes, I've done that - work for multiple clients at the same time - for most of my time as a freelancer. How is it possible? For most clients (at least in my case) some weeks there's a lot of work (say building a new feature), some weeks there's little (them testing that feature, and responding to questions). That's part of the skill-set of a freelancer, balancing client needs when those clients don't even know about each other. It's also about balancing your time, knowing when there will be a lull in one project, and making sure things are lined up to start a 'when you have the time' request from another client. But that means you'll need to be flexible yourself. Those target hours may be a good guideline, but you'll need to be willing to work a long few days because a few projects collided (and then perhaps take a few days off the net week). When is it not possible? If some of your clients do not understand the difference between an employee and a freelancer. I go into that a bit here. Or if the kind of freelancing you're doing doesn't have something similar to the ebb and flow I describe (something where the work load is consistent all the time) then you may have issues being able to only dedicate part of the time. But at that point, it seems like it may not be the right kind of job for a freelancer, it's more of a 'traditional' contractor vs employee concept. About billing: As I've answered in a few other questions, I've had success simplifying the invoicing process with oDesk (now UpWork). Letting them track the time and invoice the clients weekly means I get to avoid extra time spent on timelogs, and get paid every week."
How to politely stop doing free work for people,"You may feel rude but at the end of the day it's your business. If they come back the second time you should give less information than you provided on their first visit, but tell them you can give them a more thorough explanation if they booked an appointment.
Alternatively stop giving away free information. When someone calls/comes to see you with their problem, you can respond with  ""That sounds like a very complicated situation. If you would like to
  book an appointment, we can discuss your current situation, and work
  out the best thing for you"". This way they know you are invested in their story and want to help, and you have offered your services, and you have not provided them with much information. Also, giving away free information is one thing, but don't start filling out papers for people. You need to charge, or else you're just a charity."
Freelance Consulting while Employed,"The first step is to be clear with your employer about your plans. If he gave you the green light, then read the following lines. If he did not give you green light (a reference for other readers of this topic), then you should visit a legal advisor to review your contracts. Employers are not always right and fair.  Now, you're asking how to approach to your future clients. Unfortunately, this is a two-bladed sword. One client will appreciate your honesty while other will run away from you. So the first step is to understand that you will not be able to work as much as you think. You may be too tired on some days, you may have family issues, you may get sick, etc. So if your main work week takes 40 work hours, the realistic numbers are between 10 and 20 work hours that you can count on every week. And I am talking from my own experience as a freelancer and as an employer.  After you realized your work capacity, you should approach to each project individually. For example, for projects that you can finish in 1 month, I would not tell clients anything about my main job. These are the jobs you can finish in approx 60-80 work hours.  For larger jobs, you can do some of the following: increase time frame and decrease the price. most of my clients like this, except those who are in urgency find your own contractor and outsource projects to them. you should know that by hiring someone else to do the job for you, you will not be able to sit in a chair and enjoy. you can trust me that you will spend all your work hours working on this project as well by planning it, monitoring it, pushing a contractor to work faster, etc.  I would avoid urgent jobs if you cannot handle them yourself. All my mistakes came from taking urgent jobs and hired someone else to finish it. Baad mistakes of mine.  if you take a large project, then you will either have to hire a team full time until the project is finished, or find a good remote team (who costs) and decrease your earning to minimum. I also avoid such project if my own team cannot handle it in-house.  In the end, do not be too honest with clients. Most of them are scared and will decline you quickly. Those who don't decline you probably want much from you for little money. The only thing where you MUST be totally honest is time frame and costs and a knowledge that you can actually finish the job. Getting the job is most times easier than finishing it. "
Phone or e-mail when attracting clients?,"I would start off as you have by emailing in the first instance. It allows you to set out your offering clearly in a passive manner to begin with. If you haven't heard back after 48 hours, I would then follow up with a phone call. The advantages that I have found with this approach are that: The fact that clients add a phone number means that they should expect a call, otherwise why are they putting a phone number up in the first place. Because they are coming to the market with a requirement, the fact that you are going that extra step and following up your initial email with a phone call, should be well received and will allow both parties to discuss the finer details of the assignment which may not be immediately obvious from the original advert."
Contractor going Full time - what do I do with my incorporation?,"Firing yourself just means suspending/cancelling your payroll account, which is a simple phone call. A corporation is a little bit expensive (bank fees + annual report filing cost), but not as expensive as making a new one if your situation changes in less than 7-8 years."
How can I prove my competence without working for free?,"Though we admittedly haven't been freelancing that long, we have never run into this sort of a problem :(  After setting up profiles on freelancer, freelance, elance and odesk, I have to say that I favor elance greatly.  They don't freak out when you put a link to your portfolio, they facilitate smooth communication, they secure up front payments for non-hourly work (we work on a project per project basis) and they paid out easily to our bank account.   I however will also say we are somewhat selective in what we bid for.  We only bid on projects that are clearly and professionally written.  If the person listing the job can't bother to use punctuation, or makes more than a couple typos, it's hard to take them seriously.  We also don't bid on jobs that are very vague, or jobs that seem shifty.   Best of luck with your freelancing... defiantly check out elance.com we've had a lot of luck there!"
How to utilize charity work for building a business,"First of all, even if a web designer have big portfolio, charity works can still be very valuable position. If you have mostly made internet sites or commercial portals with only a little part visible to not-logged users, charity/non-profit organizations' portals are usually open to everyone, so they are also more available for potential clients. Doing something for well-known non-profit organization is also a big plus. Imagine you can say you've done even small part of Wikipedia website! If you do some sites to non-profit organizations, you send a signal, that you are web designer not only for money, but you really enjoy what you are doing. People who are doing something only for money wouldn't do it for free, only passionate will. A passionate is much better webmaster than the others! And there are not only financial motivations. Doing something non-profit gives you satisfaction that you have helped other people. It is also something new after working with clients who were changing demands 10 times a day, and everything analysing with criteria, how much money will they earn on it. Usually if you do something for non-profit organizations, you have much more freedom in designing the site as you would like to. "
Part-time freelancing in Germany,"Bit late to the party, but:   freelance only 2-3 hours weekly, you don't have to pay health insurance for that Essentially yes: If you pay compulsory health insurance on your main job, that also covers a side job. This is even true if you freelance besides being househusband while covered by the family insurance.
Ask your health insurance about the exact limits, but IIRC 20 h/wk (15 h/wk if officially unemployed) is one. Below 400 EUR/month you'd anyways be like a mini jobber which can be done as side line. work too little, it is considered a hobby and you cannot deduce expenses That refers to income tax. I believe (but also rumours only) that this happens if you have prolonged times where you claim a net loss by deducing expenses which leads to lower total income. Which would mean that it is less a matter of how much you work than on how credible this is for earning money/how obviously you try to deduct stuff you really use for everyday life.   The tax office will cancel your freelancer status automatically, if you did not do anything and declare 0 income 0 gain for a couple of years (not sure how many exactly - but then it doesn't matter anyways, and just saves you hassle. Restarting the freelancing is easy: just fill out the form again, and in case you're not of a catalogue profession mention that this was considered freelancing before).  Note that as a freelancing engineer with a main job, e.g. professional books could either be deduced via the freelancing or via your ""Werbungskosten"". My guess would also be that there isn't that much discussion about software that can solely be used for engineering. Everyday software, and your computer that has ""game"" in its name will more probably cause trouble. freelance more than 19.5 hours, it is full-time and you pay social taxes Not sure what you mean with social taxes: as a freelancer you're decidedly not an employee, and besides the volountary obligatory health insurance (freiwillige Pflichtversicherung) you're yourself responsible for your social ""insurance"".
But yes, 20 h/wk is one limit that decides whether it is main or side business.  Note that it is not that easy to reach the 20 h/wk within the labour laws while having a 40 h/wk full-time job. If you get outside those, your main employer can assume that your work there is negatively affected by the side-business and that looses you your right to doing a side-job.  earn more money than in your full-time job and something happens Difficult to answer without a claim what happens.  you can earn a million working just one hour and you don't pay taxes Definitively not legally: the very first thing in order to start freelancing is to go to the tax office and fill in the start a business form saying ""freelancer"". They'll then approve of you belonging to one of the free professions, send you your new tax number and tell you that from now on you'll have to hand in compulsory tax declarations. And that's where you declare the million - and pay your tax for. The form does not ask how many hours you worked, it is exclusively concerned in the gain. your third party insurance counts for freelancing too My private third party liability insurance doesn't. A professional third party liability insurance does (should be for the correct profession!)."
"Freelance Web Developer Stationary for Estimates, Proposals, Contracts","Generally, you may want to consult/hire a lawyer to prepare the Terms and Conditions and your Contract. Of course, you prepare what you need included there and the lawyer should wrap it around with the legal attributes and requirements of the country you are living in/doing business. Invoices - There are many accounting softwares (both free and paid). I am personally a fan of FreshBooks.com (has a free plan with no time restrictions, that does the trick for me). If you want additional functionality such as over 3 clients and sending real/paper invoices to your clients you may want to look into other plans or other products. DISCLAIMER: I am not affiliated with the above site, this is just a personal opinion. Quote - I've seen many many different and creative ways to request information from the client and provide quotes on the prices of your services. Personally, I would go with something minimalistic, but well designed. Remember, this is usually where the client decides whether or not he should go with you or the other freelances. Of course, this doesn't mean that you can't provide complex packages or product bundles - just don't bombard your client with information at first sight. (That's why most designer's websites have a ""request a quote"" option, instead of simply placing dozens and dozens of scenarios and prices on the website itself) As for templates, I would suggest you check out the following great examples.

How does one transition a job offer into a sale?,"You answered yourself, that second response has everything. It is short, clear, friendly. If they are interested, they can come back to you. If the offer seems interesting, I might go little further myself - I would call them first. The email from headhunter will most likely contain phone number, so why not to proceed proactively. Only if I couldnt reach that person by phone, I would drop that email as a followup (kind of). ""Thanks for reaching out! I'm currently accepting work through my
  company, [name]. I wasn't able to reach you via phone, so let's
  schedule a call at a date and time that suits us both to see if its a
  good fit."""
Discount for 1-year full-time contract?,"Realize that if you are tied up, full time, for a year, you'll most likely lose all your other clients. So, if that's okay you need to make it worth your while.   If you are financially in good shape as things are with several clients, then putting all your eggs in one basket, as it were, can be very risky. Due to the damage, yes damage, such a position will do to your freelancing I would not be inclined to offer any discount. The only possible reason I may consider some sort of discount is if the client was going to take on additional items. Such as paying for equipment/maintenance, paying for electricity, paying for healthcare (if necessary), paying for all your business overhead essentially. Because unless the client is covering some of that as well, there's really little benefit to you killing off your freelance business for this one client.  Face it, your expenses are not going to change just because you have a lengthy contract. Your overhead will stay the same unless you are working on-site for them. And if you are indeed working on-site, then why not a traditional full-time employment position with all the benefits that are associated with that? (I know why... because it's cheaper for the client if you aren't actually an employee.) I've had many a client that dangled the ""we'll be looking for full time help soon"" carrot in front of me. As if it were an incentive to work more or cheaper for them. The truth is, if your freelance business is doing well and you aren't struggling there's really little reason to drown it intentionally by focusing on one client full time.  All that being posted, I might offer something like a 20% discount based on a lengthy contract with steady payments. I'd offer the same discount I do to any client that has a great deal of work for me. I reward clients for repeatedly returning to me. But... I wouldn't build this into pricing. I'd reward it along the way... every 90 days I'd just give a discount without warning as a ""reward"" for steady, on-time, payments. This figure would not be mentioned to the client during fee negotiation and it would not be built into my calculations for the figures I need to negotiate. It's a ""gift"", a ""reward"" not a ""discount"". If I were forced... I'd average my yearly income over my freelancing career (or the past 3-5 years) and then use that number as the figure to negotiate to. So if I've averaged $130k (random figure) over the past three years, the client would need to pay me $130k minimum. Truth is I'd probably add another 20-40% to that in order to cover the loss of existing clientele and the risk associated with that.  So, rather than trying to calculate hourly, I'd work backwards from annual income. The reason being that although we set hourly rates, most freelancers aren't working full 40 hour work weeks. We work more or less most weeks. So by using the annual income average you base figures on what you've pocketed, not just what you are asking for currently. Imagine a full 40 hour week for me at my current rate may amount to $4,000/week. But really I only worked 27 hours this week ($2700), 32 last week ($3200), 65 the week before ($6500), etc. So my hourly rate is not an entirely accurate indicator of my actual income. Averaging annual income over a few years is an accurate indicator of my current income. or  Whether or not that matches or comes close to your existing hourly rate is a different matter :) If the client balks at that figure, you can easily explain or back it up with the fact that you are already averaging that amount annually and that there's little or no upside for you if you aren't at least making the same average income you already pocket."
Struggling to find work,"The best way to find work is to go where your best customers will be. You've described the kind of service you can provide, but you haven't focused at all (at least in your question) about the type of customer you want to work for. Consider the following: You may think you are better off not answering these questions or saying ""all"" to them, but actually it is better to come up with real answers to these questions. Different clients will look for freelancers in different ways. For example: I provide similar services to you (.NET, mostly ASP.NET). I work only with small, local tech-savvy companies. These organizations typically look for freelance programmers via their network and via Google. So I use 3 marketing strategies: For other types of customers, you may need other approaches. Here are some other things worth considering: But again - this will largely depend on what kind of customer/projects you are interested in. It is better to narrow your focus because then you can properly put effort into a couple of key strategies, instead of throwing everything against the wall and seeing what sticks. You want to look very attractive to the type of customer that you want to work for, and a scattershot approach won't make you look attractive, it will make you look desperate. "
My client wants me to use pirated software. What should I do?,"Client wants me to steal secret plans from the CEO of his competing company. He sent an email today detailing where I can find the plans, how to break into his offices, and a schedule for when the break in would be best. Do you think you are blameless if you break in and steal the plans?
If the police arrest you for breaking into the office, do you think you'll get off and the client would be charged? Just because you can steal while remaining seated at your desk, doesn't make the theft not theft. Seriously.... a client is asking you to break a law which only makes you liable if you are caught. If you do not want to perform illegal tasks, refuse the work. Realize if you are caught for piracy, it is you that will pay any fines or serve any jail time, not the client. After all the software is on your devices, not the client's. Drop the client, refuse the work, and don't take on any additional work from this client. It's merely a matter of time before they rip you off as well. If the work requires the use of the software, and you do not already own a license for the software and/or the client is unable/unwilling to provide you with a license, you can't legally use the software - therefore you can't do the work being requested (unless you want to break the law). In most cases, a freelancer should already own the software necessary to complete their projects. However, on rare occasions work may require specialty software for a single client. It is not unheard of for the client to purchase a license for the software and provide that license to the freelancer. With the understanding that the client owns the software and it is to be used on only their project. In some cases the software is uninstalled or removed from the freelancer's systems once the projects are complete. Any client that ""gets around"" legally paying for tools they need will ""get around"" paying your invoices when they are presented. Required tools are a tax deduction and for business there's no viable reason to not pay for them. This also makes your work in these scenarios a work-for-hire type of agreement since the client is providing tools - you may not want to complete work under a work-for-hire umbrella. For me personally, if I do not already own software required to complete a project - I examine the costs of the software for my business and the return I would receive on that investment. If possible I look into alternative software to compete the tasks. However, if it is determined that it is not cost effective for my business to purchase a license for a particular software package, then I don't take on work which requires that software. But there may be ways to keep the project when this problem arises. (but not for clients asking you to steal outright) --  During bidding/quoting and it's determined that specialty software is needed, check the numbers. If profit on a project would make the cost of the software viable - i.e. the project would yield a profit of $5,000 and the software in question is $1,000. So I'd merely cut my profit by purchasing the software. I would seek a (non-refundable) deposit before work began which covered the software cost and initial work to be performed. As stated previously, purchase of software (tools) to complete your work is a tax deduction, so there's no real reason you shouldn't be legal if you are in business."
Working from home while dealing with significant other,I am in the totally same situation. Instead of 8 hours I need to focus for 15+ hours a day recently in order to improve my skill in short period. Got complained? Yes for sure. But finally I made some effort to set up a communication mechanism with my girlfriend. I share what I did and hope it helps.
Implement features in case the employer doesn't pay,"Be careful with this. If you intentionally implement a back door in a work product you're developing for a client, and the client finds out about it, you may find that the trust between you and your client will be destroyed.  Also, there may be legal repercussions if disabling the product or application has a negative impact on the client's business.  Also, consider that there must exist some degree of trust between you and the client. They're trusting you to deliver, and you're trusting them to compensate you for that work. If they discover you've intentionally written a security hole into their application, you may find yourself out of work, branded as a fraud, and unable to convince others to trust you. But lets say they do delay or withhold their payment. Remember, there's more at stake than just your money, there's also the livelihoods of the employees who work for the client, and the businesses and livelihoods of the clients who rely on your client to provide services.  If you do something to harm your client's business, you may unintentionally do more harm than you anticipated. I can't say for sure if there would be legal consequences or if third parties could file a case against you, as I'm not trained in law, but I would personally have trouble sleeping at night if I did something that put some innocent person out of a job. Consider that this is just a cost of doing business. Some clients will pay, and some clients will not pay for a wide variety of reasons. Some may pay months later after you've sent monthly, professional past-due notices as a reminder. The best way to protect yourself is to make sure that you bring in more revenue than your expenses so that you build up a cushion of cash so that one deal gone bad won't put you out of business. In fact, this happens to businesses all of the time: They become tight on cash due to cash flow problems and can't pay their debts. But once they dig themselves out of their predicament, they will likely work on paying vendors who they owe outstanding balances.  These established businesses don't get mad or launch attacks against these parties; instead, they remain professional and continue to approach these collections legally and professionally. If you're going to work as a contractor, you'll be working in a professional environment. That means you must conduct yourself with the same level of professionalism that you expect from your clients."
Whose responsibility is to give budget for job: Freelancer or Client,"I always cringe a bit when I hear a freelancer ask a perspective client ""What's your budget?"" Isn't that the same as asking ""How much can I get away with charging you?"" Or ""Can I charge you more than I normally would without you realizing it?"" For me, there is absolutely no reason I need to know the client's budget. I need to know the breadth, scope, and complexity of the project, that's all. It's for me to determine if it's a $500 or $50,000 job, then they can determine if they wish to pay for it. I rarely get a budget from any any client (but I don't use online services either). If I do get a budget it is after my quote in an effort to possibly lower my costs to meet a lower budget (or as a negotiating tactic on their end). I price all work according to what I need to earn. Isn't that how everyone should be pricing? I've calculated my hourly rate, then bear in mind current market rate trends, and ensure I'm never at a loss for any project. Is there a possibility that I could charge another 20% and retain the work, maybe. But is it worth finding out? Most often not. As long as I'm earning what I've determined I want to earn why chase after unicorns and rainbows? You know, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush and all that. If I calculate, based on the project scope, I need to charge $5000 to complete it. Then that's what I need to earn and that's what I quote. It makes no difference if the client has an $8000 budget. I price based on my rates, not what the client has in their pockets. Imagine this... you go into a store and want to buy a stick of gum. You walk up to the cashier and she looks at you, and then says ""Well, we would have priced that gum at $1, but since you have $20 in your pocket, how about we charge you $19.99 for it?"" -- This is what you are trying to do by pricing based on the client budget. It's ethically questionable and ultimately will do you more harm with clients than good. Determine your rates and then calculate project costs based on that. The client's budget should make no difference to you at all. Unless they express their budget is lower than your quote/bid and then it's up to you to determine if you wish to lower your pricing to meet a lower budget. Knowing the budget only really makes sense when their are physical material costs. For example, remodeling your kitchen. A budget is needed then to purchase appliances, type of lumber, type of tile, etc. and know what is available to spend. But in the digital realm, where any material costs are pretty much known up front (if there are any at all), knowing a budget is pointless.  The notion that anyone creating digital content needs to know a budget up front is a myth. We all know what web hosting costs, we all know what domain registration costs, we all know what that third party scripting package costs. These can all easily be factored into any bid/quote. Pretending that a client's budget does anything other than alter how much one thinks they can change is bogus. All you need is a thorough and detailed description of project scope to calculate pricing. Beyond that, it's a matter of negotiation, not budget. If you price a project at $100k and the client states they have a $10k budget... it's negotiation as to what you'll not do or the client will not require to reduce pricing."
How should I handle contract cancellation fees?,"You should really decide this explicitly in your contract, and have a cancellation clause. If you are offering an hourly rate for your work (rather than a fixed amount), you should ideally make this cancellation fee a large percentage of this hourly rate (if not 100%, though you could probably negotiate, or even get more, depending on how willing your client is to do this) If you are offering (or being offered) a fixed amount, however, you should try to stick to an amount you are comfortable with; if the project was cancelled part-way through, and was a big, important project with a deadline, having it cancelled could have a huge impact on your finances. This is the case where you should really have a cancellation fee that is determined by the size and budget of the project, and it's very hard to put a concrete number on this. If the project is smaller, you should still always seek a cancellation fee, but an idea is to keep a set amount for cancellation that your client can see in your contract, so that you know you will always get at least that amount for a project."
What are good resources for pricing calculators for web design work?,"Unfortunately, I don't believe such a site exists, and I wouldn't expect it to be accurate either. If you are working on projects, they are usually a per-project cost, which changes as the scope changes, with every single project. A calculator won't be able to detect this. It also will not be able to measure you skill level, or how much time it will take for each project. There are other unforeseen events you need to take into consideration as well. Below is a mini-list for web projects I've had to do: With some of the advanced projects, I always project an extra 50% of time/money for any extra functions that may affect the timeline. Once you build a module though (i.e. an authenticated login module with security and salting), it becomes much easier, and you can either pocket the difference, or charge less, for each module. The more you can modularize your projects and reuse code, the less time you spend building, and the more you know it works properly with all your clients. Again, an online calculator for rates will not always work for projects, simply because of the varying details with every project. If you are doing simple brochure webpages, it becomes much easier, but for anything with user input being built in, there is always room to expand the project scope, as well as the cost. You must take this into consideration."
How do you explain a higher rate in person than what you've quoted in an email?,"There is nothing wrong with adjusting your quote. You need to understand and really believe that. If you don't, it can be heard in your voice (if you are on a call) or it can be seen in body language. You quoted an amount based on an assumption from an email. You had limited information on the scope of the project and based on what information was given to you, you felt the original quote was appropriate. However, after further discussion you found that the scope changed to include other aspects that will consume additional time and resources. Based on the change of scope, the rate will change. The best advice I can give you is that it's okay if a client thinks that you aren't being fair in your rate change. The best thing you can reply to them with is that the scope and terms changed, and your quote is tied to those. If they don't want a quote change then they need to be verbose about their project requirements from the beginning. You can't give an accurate quote without all the information. If they protest about it, be firm. This is your time and energy being spent, and you don't get those back."
Should an agreement with software engineer contractor include a clause that the engineer is not liable of any company's losses?,"Under no circumstances should you allow yourself to have unlimited liability. The phrase used in contracts to prevent this is usually of the form: 'You shall indemnify and hold the Developer harmless for all losses or damage resulting directly or indirectly from the Software' However, my contract is just an extended version of Contract Killer 3 (also on github), and uses the following paragraph for this: We can’t guarantee that our work will be error-free and so we can’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised us of them. Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Phew. – source: Contract Killer 3 by Stuff and Nonsense Really, if a company is insisting that you must have unlimited liability to work with them, then they probably have a legal department who will sue you at the slightest provocation. Ensure that you have indemnity, or steer well clear of this client. You're not big enough to take them on in court. It's like having a car dealer sell you a car on condition that you remove the seatbelts. Sure, you might be fine until something goes wrong, but when it does, it goes catastrophically wrong."
I.T home support - protecting myself,"Although open-ended, I'll try to address it as best as possible. GET A CONTRACT DRAWN UP ASAP! Do not offer remote support, except to those you know quite well, and personally. The contract should be signed before you take in the system, and before you touch it. It should explain that you are a professional, but shit happens... Essentially. It needs to explain what can potentially go wrong, and that you will try everything in your power to not have it happen. Although contracts exist around the Internet, it doesn't hurt to spend a couple hundred dollars on a lawyer to look them over, and make sure it will cover your ass. For the remote support, that's a very good possibility (of them running away once it's fixed). For this reason, I only do remote support for my very good clients, and never anyone new. My good clients have established trust with me, and I know where they live. I haven't run into someone trying to skip out on a bill when I explain I only do it for my best clients. As for emailing a contract and just having them reply: I doubt it, but talk to a lawyer. If you're running any business, you can also pick up liability insurance; it may be expensive, but it would cover you for virtually anything that goes wrong. You'll need to learn to assess the risk involved, and make sure that if you get a gut-feeling that someone is bad news, you just don't deal with them. End of story."
Am I charging my client too much for my SLA - Service level agreement?,"For SLA agreements you should be able to make an estimate based on fixed tasks and average expected work for improvements/bugs.   For fixed tasks: For updates/fixes: For possibility where no fixes are needed, the SLA still applies. You're being paid for retaining possible availability, with fast/reliable turnaround.  It's a guarantee to the client that if things go wrong, they'll be resolved.  It's a 1 year contract, and perhaps the following year would be a reduced estimate based on the lower expectation of needs."
Is there any difference between outsourcing and subcontracting?,"The terms do seem to be used interchangeably... However, I would suggest that there is a semantic difference: Having Googled, this is in line with other opinions, eg:"
"How do I answer the ""How much will it cost"" question when researching a development task that has unknown variables?","When I have faced that scenario in the past, I have performed a small (10-20) hour engagement to define the requirements and design a solution. The document that I put together then serves as a road map for the next phase, which could be performed by me or by another resource."
Formality of contracts,"Short answer:
A contract must be as formal as possible.
You should be ready to sacrifice everything not covered by a contract. While my plan is to make it informal enough for the client to not need a lawyer to decipher it, I'd still want it to be enforceable. Sorry to discourage, but I really think you are willing two opposite things. A contract is a tool used when ""everything is bad."" It's like an airbag in a car. It can't be both reliable and not hitting on face in case of an accident.
When ""everything is good"", there is no need to even look into the contract. You only need it when there is an evident conflict of interests.
The major problem in any relations is ambiguity, when two parties assume different things. A contract solves those ambiguities. So, the more things a contract covers, the better it serves its purpose.
In worst case, you are taking the contract to a lawyer. With a badly written contract, even a good lawyer may not help, no matter if you are completely right. would it be worth it to have two templates depending on the client? Yes, but it's not about ""depending on the client"". It's about how much you are ready to lose in worst case. As per myself, when I'm doing something for my old partner, I don't need a contract at all. Even if they claimed my work is bad, I'm willing to sacrifice my entire effort to save the long-term relations.
OTOH, if I'm doing something for someone I'm not yet familiar with, I would try to make it as much formal as possible. Is there a particular guideline to how formal/informal a contract should be? This site has a plenty of real Consulting Agreement contracts. Don't panic, they are not that difficult to read. In general, you are pretty much close with 7 major sections. @ckpepper02's answer has better names for everything. I would only add:"
How to manage a client's expectations,"In my experience, it depends on the client. Some clients like to micro manage and in this case it is probably better to wait until the website is nearing completion before showing them. Other clients may have some useful input along the way and can be helpful. The problem with a new client is that you may not be able to tell which type of client you have. There might also be a third option where you can occasionally email a screen capture or similar to show clients the current status and and ask for specific feedback if needed. I lost one client because I involved them along the way in the development of their website. I was focusing on the most challenging part of the job which was developing multi page forms and PDF reports and planned to make it all look pretty at the end. Unfortunately, the client lost confidence because of the way the website looked even though most of the difficult part of the job was done. The lesson I learned was to progress the aesthetics and back-end development in parallel when clients are involved along the way."
How much bookkeeping or accounting knowledge is necessary when going freelance?,"It seems to me that this depends largely on the type of freelance business you are in. In my case, I build custom software. I don't have any ""inventory"", and I charge on a fixed fee basis (per deliverable). So in my case, accounting is very, very basic. On the other hand, my son produces a weekly internet program (he reviews bad comic books in an entertaining way). He regularly travels to conferences where he speaks and sells items related to his show. He also sells items online, but his main revenue is advertising revenue from his show. He also occasionally pays subcontractors who do work for him (art, costumes, etc.) In his case, his accounting could potentially be more complicated. "
How do open source projects come up with their sponsorship prices?,"Creating a price based on your hourly rate is certainly a valid one and the one that most groups that maintain open-source projects take. However, instead of asking them how many hours they'd like to sponsor, I'd suggest using a tiered pricing model and asking what level they'd like to contribute at. Why tiered pricing? It allows companies to choose from a limited range of options, making it easier for a sponsor to make a choice (four choices, as opposed to ""Do we want to sponsor 25 or 26 hours?""). Their marketing department can also put a name to their level of commitment. For example, which sounds better from their point of view: You can determine the pricing of the tiers based on your hourly rate (as you suggest). Of course, higher tier levels beget higher visibility on the site. Your highest-level sponsors might get prime page estate and influence on any dynamic content (such as blog posts or the like), while your bronze-level sponsors might just get a nice mention on your Thank You page. As for determining the rate, I do suggest basing it off of an hourly rate. It can be something like this (assuming $50/hr): By breaking down each tier into a number of hours, you'll be able to track when it becomes worth it to work on your project full-time. Examples of tiered pricing in action:"
Client asked me to remove copyright and name from licensed code,"NOTE: I am not and have never been an attorney. I post merely based upon my own experience over a freelance career spanning a couple decades. For legal advice, it is always best to speak to an attorney directly. First, I'd contact the product producer and ask about branding/copyright removal. It's often not an issue with additional fees. Second, I'd express to the client that simply removing the branding/copyright may be against the terms of service for the product and could possibly result in legal action on behalf of Company X (product owner). Third, your contract should state something about you adhering to and abiding by all legal restrictions in good faith but you are not to be held liable for specific requests made by the client which may be outside the terms of use of any product/service used. If you've done the three above items... remove the branding. The onus then falls on the client to protect themselves. It's also wise to retain all communications regarding the matter."
How Do I Start my Own Freelancing Company?,"Ultimately, it's how you advertise yourself, and what you can deal with for a job. Don't take a large project for pennies on the dollar, and don't undervalue yourself. I always estimate an extra 50%, because every client will want more and more and more; that's how I prepare for the inevitable."
Making a quotation for creating a website (design and development)?,"Your client expects specification document which is nothing more than a list of all features, man hours for each and your hourly price. This can be a usual word document with text only or excel sheet with table and additional calculations like risk or unpredictable events, etc. If you're writing it for the first time, then a normal work doc is OK. You may format it to look more professional if you like.  Now, design and web development are two totally different things.  Design - I would give client a rough price for the design + let him know how many changes he can have for that price (5 for example). Yes, limit number of changes or you may end up doing touches on a small image for 1 month. To know the price you need to calculate work hours you need for this project. There is also a situation when client is willing to pay all time spent on design, but those cases are rare, at least with me and my friends.  Coding - make a list of all features. Do not miss any and do not think that some feature is implied. The client will know that you are estimating the price for the listed features only. This will also be a type of agreement between you two. The list of features can be as simple as this: Landing page (you may also add a description of it)
1a. Left menu 5 man hours
1b. Right menu 10 man hours
1c. something else About screen
2a. Email feature 1 man hour etc. In the end you put TOTAL and count man hours.  As third part you may add hosting price and your monthly support or something.  If this is a ""sure job"", then make a list of features detailed ones. If this is only to see if the client will move forward, then list only high-level features letting the client know that you two will later make more detailed specs.  Ask if I missed anything. "
"Working per hour, where do you draw the line?","Per hour, my rule is, I bill only for time spent, and for all of time spent.  Build in a buffer to your estimate, but if it is an estimate, be prepared to invoice above or below.  In general when I produce an hourly estimate I put in a buffer of 50-100% depending on unknowns because if I can bill under estimate customers are happy. Some times, customers want an ""up to x hours"" bid, which is ok from my end if the work is well scoped, an understanding is that I will deliver what I can in those x hours, and that then we come together and decide what to do next.  For example, evaluating a problem for up to x hours is a good approach.  Delivering a web site in up to x hours would mean essentially no free fixes after x hours of work, and so forth.  At that point when x hours is exhausted I am expected to have delivered what I can, and preparing for any next stage negotiations with the customer. Fixed bids are entirely different, of course."
From Agency to Freelance - What Should I Charge?,"Ahhh the age old problem: ""How much should I charge?"" The short answer is: As much as the client will pay. The longer beginning of an answer is: What is the client's budget for the project? If they are a reputable company then they should have a budget for the project. Ask them. If they play coy that is first of all a warning sign that things may not be smooth down the road. The second part is how much do you want to make from doing this project? Thinking about how long is it going to take you to to complete the task. Then think about your cost benefit of spending time on this project versus a different project. Will you enjoy this work? Is there potential for more work? etc. If you are comfortable getting the normal rate you were paid by the agency then you have just saved the client 50% of their budget. That can make you look much more favorable down the line. If you are just starting out on your own it may be more important to have reliable work than high paying work. Cash flow is the most important thing to keep in mind as a business owner. Keep in ming that you may have trouble getting them to pay more later on. My suggestion is to talk with them about the project and learn more about why they don't want to work with the agency anymore. A general assumption is that they want to save money, but that doesn't have to be the main reason. They may like being able to communicate directly to you, in which case saving money isn't their focus so you should be charging the existing rate. If you propose a price and they accept it without question then you are leaving money on the table. Keep that in mind for the next project or client. Negotiating about the price is part of doing business. The important thing to remember with pricing is that its completely arbitrary. It is based on what the client perceives to be valuable, and what you need to earn to put food on the table. Get paid what you need. I have been in sales for over 14 years and running my own company for 5 and I still don't know what I should be charging. Best of luck!"
Is an agreement by email reply enough to act as a signature in a legal contract?,"Preface: I am not now, nor have I ever been a lawyer. For legal advice it is always best to ask someone trained in the versatility of the law. A contract is a written agreement which shows a ""meeting of the minds"". Email can be just that. It's my understanding that, while not as iron-clad as a physical signature, an email can be used to show intent and agreement. Just the same as a text message. Written evidence that a meeting of the minds was met is better than verbal agreement. While email content can be faked, server and routing addresses really can't easily. Emails can be traced to every server they touched. And should the need arise, the sending server (the clients) could confirm that an email to [you] was sent on [date]. But again, I'd consult an attorney if this is something which really troubles you. I've never been in a position to file a claim on a client, but I do use email as written agreements. Regarding PDFs, Adobe's PDF structure allows for digital signatures. This means there's really no need to print, sign, and scan anything. One can digitally sign a pdf, save it and then send it back."
How an EXPERIENCED programmer can switch to freelancing?,"Welcome to the wonderful world of Freelancing! First, you need to get a portfolio of your successful projects and problem-solving skills available. This is why most tutorials start with Wordpress - it's easy for non-programmers to setup and get running. I recommend a web presence, but if you're comfortable with another web tech, use that instead. For example, my new Resume one-page site uses Hugo. Still looks good. Second, you need to calculate how much you need to live comfortably as a freelancer. Check out other questions on this site relating to pricing to help with some of the calculations you'll need. There are still expenses as a freelancer you need to cover, even when you don't have customers during a day or week or month. Third, do you have a good exit plan? You should come up with one before you take the leap. The last thing you want is to burn through all your savings, and then go back to working for ""the man"". Finally, get your name and services out there! Pay for a bit of advertising, links on Google Search Results or similar, banner ads on programming sites, etc. Track your expenses, and make sure they all include a link to your portfolio, and a way to contact you. Freelancing does not usually happen miraculously in one day; as a conservative spender and over thinker, I planned for almost a year to get the pieces in place before taking the leap. I don't believe in half-assing what I do, and this is my livelihood that would be in question if I failed."
Should I offer to refund an upfront payment for a job I failed to complete?,"In situations like yourself, refunding is something what every good contractor would do. If the client is good, then he could let you something to keep because you also spent time on the project. So YES, you did an honest and good thing. And 90 min of your time is not too much comparing the bad feedback he could have given you in case you refused to refund.  So the only time you should never refund is when you made a concrete product. For example, I also ask for a upfront and I use it to make detailed project specs. It takes me from 8 to 40 hours, depends on the project complexity. Sometimes, clients want to cancel the job after I made specs and in such cases I do not refund, since I spent my time and made something concrete. If an upfront sum is too large, then I return only the part above the value of my work.  Also in the future, if estimation will take 1 or 2 hours, you can do that without being chosen for the job. Some clients may write a bad feedback even thou you refunded them - they simply dislike the fact they lost time with you. "
When is it safe to give Tax ID to Remote Employer,"In my experience, clients who I've done contract work for haven't asked for this until the end of the fiscal year, when their accountant starts pressing them to get their taxes in order. My experience comes from dealing with small startups, where there's not a lot of process in place. The mutual trust came from the fact that they already paid me hundreds or thousands of dollars in exchange for the work I've done. When they asked for my tax id, I didn't give it a second thought. Now, if you're doing work for a larger client, they may very well want your tax id in advance. In the United States, you can go to the IRS Website and apply for an EIN Federal Tax ID, which means you don't have to give your personal social security number to clients who contract with you. If that's not an option, just do some basic research on the client. If they're well-established, they likely have a website, some reviews, public artifacts on the Internet that verify that they exist and are indeed legitimate. If something doesn't feel right, move on and find another client. As far as what to do if a potential client asks for your tax id before you start work, here are a couple things you can do to protect yourself: If a representative from the company asks for this information, tell the representative that the EIN (or tax ID) will be included on your first invoice you send to them and that this is your preferred method for transmitting this information. If this satisfies both parties, move on. If the representative prefers that you send this information before you start working, try to include the EIN or tax ID in your contract. In the LegalZoom article titled, ""Hiring Independent Contractors"", LegalZoom suggests businesses note the contractor's business name and tax id in the actual contract: A written contract. Outline the nature of the relationship since merely saying the person is an independent contractor doesn’t make it so. Indicate the project’s expected results, fee and date(s) of completion. The contract should state the worker should use his/her own equipment/tools, is free to hire others without your approval, and that he or she provides liability insurance for his/her workers. Note the contractor’s business and tax I.D. number. Make sure the contract is signed by both parties and create a new contract for each new project.  Including it in the contract shows that you attempted to establish a business relationship with the other party, and will leave a paper trail for you to follow in cases of fraud. According to the Nolo Legal Encyclopedia, Does a sole proprietor need an EIN?, preventing identity theft is one reason for having an EIN: ...many sole proprietors still elect to use an EIN because it reduces the chances of identity theft and banks often require one to open a business account. And according to LoopHoleWy's Tax Basics for Startups, using an EIN protects your personal identity if you pay independent contractors and must issue 1099-MISC forms.  However, this works both ways, as someone receiving 1099-MISC forms from employers, using an EIN offers you the very same identity theft protections by not exposing your personal tax ID or social security number. While I'm not familiar with tax laws in other countries, whether or not this applies in this case or not, for anyone interested in such identity theft protections in your own locale, check your local and federal laws to see if there exists business tax ID's which you can use to protect your own personal identity. Of course, as I mentioned earlier, if the deal doesn't feel right, move on and find another client.  Here are some things to look at to help determine whether or not a potential client is legitimate: Do they have an up to date website that looks professional and modern?  If not, what industry are they in? If they're in IT and don't have an up to date website, this may be a red flag. Are there online reviews of the company from past or current employees, including contractors?  If 90% of the reviews aren't positive, this may be a red flag. Specifically, look for negative reviews that indicate employees or contractors were treated poorly when it comes to financial compensation. A few bad reviews may be normal and may just be from people who were rightfully terminated or who simply like to complain, but a significant number of bad reviews is a red flag. Does the business have a good reputation with other vendors and customers? If a business doesn't have a good rapport with its customers, this may also be a bad sign. If they don't treat their customers well, it's possible they don't treat vendors well, including contractors. In summary, if something doesn't feel right, move on. But if you do move on, be sure to protect your personal information by using information specific to your business, and make sure you maintain a paper trail from the initial contract including all invoices.

Charity or Nonprofit Support Services - What are the possible options?,"The easiest way to actually provide your services to a charity is volunteering for the charity themselves; it's free, and off-the-books. You don't have to declare anything, and you don't have to pay national insurance, which is a plus. However, if you want to incorporate as a nonprofit in the UK, you need to incorporate as a Company Limited by Guarantee (CLG), and then file articles of association (more here). Nonprofits in the United Kingdom have to declare their NPO status in their articles of association (you will have to write them from scratch or have a lawyer draft these), and have a set of standards which the organisation will adhere to (how their profits will be spent), which are reviewed by Companies House. There is no specific (i.e. it has no specific document) way to register a non-profit in the UK that isn't a charity. (Another alternative is a Community Interest Company, but I don't know if it applies here) As for tax itself, you will still have to pay tax as a company, but your taxes are relieved on the following: Provided these are on the list in your articles of association (source). In my opinion, unless you can make a charity, it's likely better than you simply volunteer, or incorporate as a Private Company Limited by Guarantee and list yourself as the sole guarantor, if you really must incorporate. You will, however, be able to take out loans and wont be liable for any more than what you put into the business at incorporation. You might want to Check out OnStartups Stack Exchange if you fancy making a company, though. http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/ is the site for registering a charity in England or Wales. Also, I currently operate as a sole-trader with books showing zero profit. Is this a problem? (It's not faked!) As a sole trader, you keep all profits anyway, and you aren't audited, so this isn't a problem. Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer, but I did go to business school in the UK."
Claiming use of home as office allowance if the work is unpaid,"You don't have to receive wages to claim home office as a business expense, however, you do need to use the office exclusively for that business and not for personal purposes.  For the US, see this summary from TurboTax for more detailed information. For the UK, as long as the office space has no other use for the time you are working you can deduct the expenses for that specific time frame. See this explanation from HMRC."
Formalities and steps when getting from an initial contact to a contract (and templates of documents used during these steps),"There is a ""typical"" set of steps that takes place, but this vague framework varies quite significantly in duration and content depending on project complexity, scale and negotiation duration. The basics are as follows: The client requests a proposal. This request may be made (1) publicly, or (2) to a group of companies or (3) to one company in particular. A company in this context also may be an individual person offering a service. This request will consist of a description of the job to be performed and varies wildly in length, from a few sentences to pages. The company (aka contractor) responds by submitting a proposal describing how the job will be done. The company may ask questions about specific details of the project if they need more information. It may be necessary for the contractor to sign a Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) in order to get the information they need. There may be a back and forth for a while between the client and contractor. This stage allows for the client to asses the contractor and for the contractor to asses the client. The proposal may contain a cost estimate. At this point, it's a good idea to establish a scope for the project, which is a definition of exactly what the final deliverable consists of (and what it does not consist of!) The client will ask for a quote if they like the contractor and want to move ahead. If they do, the contractor sends through a formal quote, detailing exact amounts to be paid and when. The client decides if they're okay with the quote. Once again, negotiation may occur over the price of various services and milestones. The scope may be revised to make things cheaper (and re-quoted). If they're okay, the contractor issues an invoice for the first installment. This invoice is what the client needs to pay for the work to start The client may send through a contract to the contractor detailing the legal responsibilities of each party. This in turn may consist of several stages of negotiation in order to reach an agreement over the contents of the contract. Both parties sign. Once the client pays the invoice, the contractor issues a receipt to the client, confirming the receipt of payment. The work begins. At this point, the documentation supplied is dependant on the scope and what documentation was agreed upon as a deliverable.  That is a vague summary of the business transaction process. Since there is a lot of negotiation about price and scope and NDAs, it can vary in duration from hours to weeks. It may be as simple as a client emailing a contractor about a small website change or as complex as a government municipality subcontracting the design and construction of a new stadium. TL;DR: (1) Request for proposal: Description of job from client.
(2) Proposal: Description of how the job will be done from contractor.
(3) Estimate: Estimate project cost.
(4) NDA: Non-disclosure agreement ensuring contractor doesn't give client's IP away.
(5) Scope: Description of work to be done (and what's not being done).
(6) Quote: Actual amount to be paid at each stage and terms of payment.
(7) Contract: Legal document detailing responsibilities of each party.
(8) Invoice: Current amount to be paid to the contractor.
(9) Receipt: Confirms that payment was received for a particular invoice."
What is good share ratio when you outsource projects due to lack of time?,"To me, this just sounds like a referral business. Depending how you lay your contract and Scope of Work out would determine if I would recommend this if you like working. I understand it's everyone's dream to just let other people work for you, making you money. This model would be great if you had multiple deals going on at a time, with multiple ""contractors"". Screw it, call them employees! You are right that you need to worry about quality as well; remember the old adage, ""if you want it done right, do it yourself"". If you decide you can trust others to do your work, you need to remember a few things: Edit about Share Ratio
There is nothing wrong with sharing the profits, and your contractors will want a bigger piece of the pie if they're doing the work. If you want to keep more of the money, then you need to only give them the easy, remedial stuff that you don't want to do. This is the only way to negotiate a larger amount for yourself. If your contractor knows they're doing more work, they'll start asking for more, and you can pick a good share ratio. Having said that, I had started off my first two contractors at minimum wage +$5/hr, as they were just starting out and I was supervising them and teaching along the way. This was great for them. I am sure that when you get people who have been in the industry a while though, you'll have to up the price. I don't believe you can give a percentage, but that's just my experience in my town."
Out of State Lawsuit for Payment,"Your question has to do with what a state feels they can regulate, and what other states will recognize regarding regulation.  I would recommend discussing this with a lawyer who can look at the specifics and give you real guidance.  This is mostly a response aimed at ensuring you get as much from such a meeting as possible. Additionally some of this is generalizable to international business deals gone bad as well because most of the issues are the same. First I want to point out that in general if you have to go to court or even collections you risk creating a bad dynamic regarding future work.  Additionally court takes a lot of effort on your part and it may not be worth your time unless it is a large amount.  What going to court can give you however is a better position if your client declares bankruptcy.  In court both sides lose, just one side loses more and you will never be able to bill for your time in preparing the court case.  So unless it is a lot of money, my recommendation is not to go to court.  BTW, a good reason for contracts is to minimize the times that court may be needed rather than actually making sure you can win in court.  You should go in assuming you will not be able to collect all your attorney's fees and that you are investing a lot of time you will never be paid for.  So take that as a big warning before you go to talk with an attorney. So before you go you need to find out why they aren't paying.  If they simply cannot afford to pay right now you have to make the decision as to whether to pursue a case in court on the theory that if they go bankrupt you can more easily collect, or whether to just hope they do better and can pay you in the future.  If it is a contract dispute, if there is something you can do to make them happier and get them to pay you, that is better than going to court. Now the key thing is that, in the US, states generally have the power to regulate businesses which do business in their areas.  I say ""generally"" because a lot of things are outside of this.   The reason is that the US Constitution vests the regulation of interstate commerce with the federal government, and this has long been interpreted to mean that states cannot impose barriers to business from other states.  This is the reason why, absent Congressional action, states cannot collect sales taxes across state lines for example. The two major issues I can see that you would want to discuss with a lawyer are: Which state's courts can decide the issue.  My immediate thinking is that since this is probably a payment dispute only, either state probably can.  If there are other contractual issues however, this may complicate things.  Also you want to check any contracts you have with your customer to see what the contracts state, and if you don't have a choice of laws/venues provision consider adding one in the future. Which state's laws are at issue.  Which state's laws are most favorable to you?  If there is no choice of laws/venues provision this allows whoever files first to choose the venue which gives an advantage. Are there any major reasons why the other state might decline to enforce a favorable ruling on your behalf?  In the US this is less of an issue but it does occasionally come up.  In international business this is a much bigger deal.  In general if a ruling would be clearly and heavily against public policy (again absent Congressional action if between states in the US), a state court may decline to enforce it at home.  (In International business dealings, states have much more leeway in deciding to do this btw, because the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution has no effect.)  Again, in the between the states, this isn't likely to be an issue but it is worth looking at just in case. You want to get your ducks in a row on these three issues before you file, and this means discussing all three with your lawyer.  The reason you should make sure you bring them all up is because you want to make sure that you have an opportunity to discuss all these issues and get feedback.  If you go to court, you want your attorney to be a collaborator, not the one simply in charge. Once again, the above three generally apply to international lawsuits as well though the issues are usually more complex there.  Keep in mind every jurisdiction will likely have its own ways of answering all three.  Every state in the US, for example, has its own tradition of conflict of laws resolution and these apply roughly in the same way (aside from the Full Faith and Credit clause) to international lawsuits as well.  I would expect similar in the EU between countries, or between a business in Argentina and a business in Wisconsin."
How do I calculate the cost (to me) of one hour of work?,"Now that's an interesting subject. Actually, two subjects: Ad 1) For me, that depends on if I am currently happy with the amount of work I have, and what kind of client wants it. Ad 2) I approach this more strictly (although I make sure I wont get paralyzed by analysis):  I approximate the testing time as 20-50% of the amount of time needed for development I would go for 50% if it is one hour of work. Of course if you can trust your contractors, you can lower this estimate, but you need to test; you don't want to hand over product with low quality to your customers, right?. Even in consulting, you ""test"" by proofreading whatever goes to your contractor, checking for mistakes, weak parts, redundancies, accomplishment of the goals, etc., and ensuring that you are handing over a high quality product to your customer. I add 20% of the original amount as the reserve; it is usually about right. And that's it – if the number is lower than doing everything by myself (with the price calculated per no. 1) – I would consider outsourcing the work. As you can see, outsourcing the work would usually end up being more expensive than doing the work myself if it was only for a one hour job..."
Freelancing in Germany: am I a Freiberufler or Gewerbe?,"IANAL, but Freiberufler is actually pretty well defined: Most ventures that you need to be uniquely qualified for can be done freiberuflich - Meaning lawyers, engineers, educators; Artists are deemed to be uniquely qualified across the board, as nobody can really rate art... . Gewerbe is mostly selling not-your-own/plain products, or working in a tradecraft (carpenters,...) . Beware, though: Freiberuflichkeit can be 'infected' by Gewerbe, and then looses all bonuses: So you need to make extra clear that it is only your artworks that get onto those mugs and T-Shirts, no other works, no plain mugs, otherwise your whole enterprise will be judged a Gewerbe as a whole. Best you just hit up the Finanzamt for advice on what to do and not to do. Go there in person, and describe what you plan, they'll give you advice on what to avoid - they have no interest in hassling you, and will give you fair advice."
Buying a domain for your client,"It depends what you do next. If you say, ""as a precaution I have acquired the domain names we were talking about. Please send me your details so that I can transfer the registration to your organisation ASAP, or if you prefer we can manage them for you"", then you've jumped the gun and intruded slightly on a decision that really is the client's to make, but hopefully no serious harm done. You may have been careless, if the client would have made a different decision from what you made, but I think not immoral. You should not necessarily expect to be reimbursed for them, especially if the client decides to use someone else (or to cancel the exercise entirely, or use fewer variants than you registered), since you weren't asked to do it in the first place. You can't be sure you've done the right thing, since there may be disadvantages to registering now. Just for one example, if the domain registrations are listed in a whois directory, then you've made a publicly-available statement that your name and address are somehow involved with the new brand. Albeit not a very direct statement, or one you can easily profit from, but still. You can undo that if it's not appropriate, but undoing something bad doesn't stop it being bad in the first place. If you say, ""I have acquired the domain names, now let's talk about how much you're willing to pay me for them"" then it's at least as immoral as any other domain-squatting, and I'd say rather more so since you acted on the specific and commercially-sensitive knowledge that your potential client would want those domains. NDAs establish that information is confidential and/or proprietary, but it doesn't follow that anything not under NDA is not proprietary, nor that it's always proper to act on it. I think in this case it isn't proper to squat a domain that your potential client discusses with you. To avoid squatting you can't demand payment for the domain, not even what you paid for it. We thought we were protecting him from domain lookups that buy the domains you search for.  Then fine. Follow through doing that, by transferring the domains to the client or their other designated agent as smoothly as possible. But as a general principle, don't expect to be reimbursed for unsolicited services no matter how helpful you expect you're being."
How does a developer determine they are qualified to be hired as a freelance developer?,"Knowing an entire API or framework inside and out is not really necessary. Every project I've worked on in 10 years of freelancing has involved something new that I've never done before. You are ""qualified"" when someone is willing to hire you. And the only way to find out if you are is to put yourself out there. BUT...there is much more to being ready for a freelance developer career than just your technical skills. For example: Your early experiences in freelance development will be better if you are prepared on the business end of things. Plenty of talented developers have sucked on the business side and thus had poor freelancing experiences. Don't make that mistake."
"Client owes me substantial money, I got another job full-time, client wants me to hand over keys to next developer without payment","Generate an invoice marked ""past due"".  Send certified.  That's all you can really do in your case, at this step, without getting an attorney involved.  The $10,000 is probably more than any state's small claims process. Other than that, don't lift a FINGER until you've been paid in full.  You might hear your client trying to bargain with you, but you've already done the work and there's nothing to bargain about. Don't ever pile up that much work over such a long duration and be waiting for payment.  Never, never, never.  Unfortunately, this far in, you may not see a dime :("
Risks of giving friend-clients a discount: price discrimination?,"First you need to understand some basics of discrimination law in your area.  I can only speak to the United States generally (and will note some exceptions below). In general, in the United States, antidiscrimination law came about because of the experience of segregation, and it attempts to balance the legitimate needs of businesses with the general interest in society of not having specific vulnerable groups targetted for problematic treatment.  I think this same balance must exist everywhere that antidiscrimination law exists, but lines need not be drawn all in the same place (and indeed aren't even in the US).  In the US for example, race is generally held to far stricter criteria than just about anything else because of our bad experiences in this area. Consequently in most of the US (California state law aside, see below), the question of whether discrimination is illegal has to do with the reason for the discrimination and its impact across society.  So for example if I give all African Americans a discount that would be illegal because this would be discriminating on the basis of race.  If I give blue-eyed people a discount, the same would probably apply because blue eyes very strongly correlate with socially constructed racial categories.  On the other hand if I give non-profit businesses a discount, there is no reason why this would be a problem.  Similarly if I give family members a discount, I would expect even if they were all the same race that this would be ok, because family members are such a narrow slice of society there is no general social damage done.  In general, with friends and family members, in the US, you aren't going to run into trouble.  I do not know about a few exceptional places like California though so if you live there, a quick attorney consultation might be a good idea. I single out California because that state has its own approach to anti-discrimination law which is in fact older than US federal antidiscrimination law.  The Unruh Act is generally interpreted to ban discrimination in business dealings on any criteria outside the business deal context (I suspect that friend/family discounts would still be OK but I am not comfortable saying this for sure).  The Unruh Act is sufficiently vague that even the ACLU has fallen afoul with this act for kicking off-duty police officers out of meetings on police surveillance.  I say generally interpreted because despite what the text of the law says, the California courts have generally looked to legislative history to see the law as advocating an end to any discrimination on non-relevant criteria.  Again, California is an exception but it shows how far this can vary even within a single country. So my advice would be to start by finding out what categories of discrimination are banned where you live.  Chances are you will find that this is not an issue.  However if you are still concerned, this is something an attorney should be able to clear up very quickly."
Developer Portfolio - screenshots and codesamples?,"I usually try to do it in the form of a case study instead of worrying about screen shots. My case study would include the following: If possible, I include the organization's name, but if not, I just say something like ""Sales system for major construction company"".  I may include a single screen shot, but you could also use a simple logo or nothing at all. To me, the important thing is that I want the potential client to see that I built something that improved my client's business, with as many specifics as is possible."
Sending a bill without delivering a product,"This depends on your agreement / contract. I will explain what you can do now, after I've said what you should do when making up the agreement. Ask for partial prepayment. Request half of the amount at start and half of it at the deadline. Split the amount in more parts if it's a large sum. This way, you always have something when the client can't pay (or doesn't want to, for whatever reason) at the deadline. Put fixed pay-dates in the contract. If you agreed on it, you can make the client pay, even if he can't use the product yet. Keep in touch. For clients it's hard to get to you if they see problems coming. You can make this easier for them if you have contact anyway. They can easily mention it when there's a conversation going on anyway. Okay, now what can you do in this specific case?  If you agreed on sending a software packet (i.e. not put the website online), you can just send him it. Send an invoice as well, because you did send him the product. He has two weeks (in the Netherlands that's the period) to pay, that's enough, also when busy with a fusion. If you agreed on some more services, for which you need the client, you have a problem.  If your contract lists a specific date or period for the deadline, tell him and say you can't help him after that time because you have other jobs to do as well. Subtract something from the price, because you don't give him all the services you agreed on, but make this a symbolic amount. It's his fault, in the end. If your contract doesn't list a specific deadline, you'll just have to wait. The only thing you can do is ask for a payment of the part you could and did do already, and ask him if you can make an appointment soon."
Should I ask every client to sign a contract?,To me it varies based upon the customer.  If its a valid reputable company I don't ask them to sign my own agreement.  They will have their agreement which they want me to sign.  In that case I use that document as an agreement.  If its a smaller client I will provide the agreement.  If its a smaller client and I am unsure if they will pay I also ask for a upfront deposit. So to answer your question it depends.  There should always be a document which is signed by both parties which spells out the work.  The document could be provided by either side.  In some cases there is an additional deposit.  If a deposit is used it is mentioned in the signed document.
"Client suspended dev work, but still wants fixes","An exception or two can be made.
When you do so (fix bugs for free, outside your economic/contractual agreement) don't forget to remember to your client that what you do is a favor/exception because you know it is only a one time request and because you appreciate him/her as a respectful/respectable client. Imagine that at his/her turn was (maybe) in the same situation when his/her client asked for the bug to be fixed. I understand your need to get mad and feel frustrated when it comes to money but in the same time, please remember that a small favor made today can bring you more money tomorrow; this because, at the end of the day your client will appreciate you supporting his business even during difficult economic times.
Of course, your role is to make sure his/hers request is genuine and not an attempt to make you work for free or a lower hourly rate. If this is the case, than you know better what you should do (maybe terminate the contract between you two or something else that best fits your expectations or business strategy)"
How to deal with projects that have gone on too long?,"You should clearly clarify these points initially : With this, if the client decides to change everything, he will have : If you haven't done this, the only thing you can do is directly ask the client to pay you more for these important changes, or drop the project - Or if you're lucky agree with them on a partial pay."
Should I charge a client who does not come to a code help appointment?,"I think your usual approach is the correct one. The vagaries of busy clients are an unfortunate obstacle to our making the best of of our freelance time. If you don't already, I would say it's good practice to send a courtesy email confirming the meeting on the day, just to ensure that it's still on the client's radar. It could be the most important meeting of your day but may well be a long way down the client's list of priorities. From a client's perspective, if a freelancer attempted to charge them for not attending a pre-arranged meeting, particularly if there is no contract in place that allows for time to be charged in this manner, I imagine that they would walk away. You'd find it very difficult to enforce the payment and would irreparably damage the relationship. If this is a first offence then you would be well advised to just take the hit and move on. If they are a repeat offender then they probably aren't worth pursuing. If they repeatedly fail to turn up to meetings then they are likely to be equally difficult to extract requirements/payment from."
Client wants manual for everything I do,Supply documentation for an additional fee. It's more work to track everything you do... you should be compensated for that work. 
Freelancer turned into an agency,"I personally avoid agencies for multiple reasons: You work with 3rd party person you never know how experienced person will be given your project They state one price, and then say higher price for senior worker I had bad experiences with them and like one-on-one approach Now, there are other people who do not mind agencies so I suggest you ask for a direct contact with this person who will work on your project (skype, phone, etc.). This will speed up communication.  In case you do not like that person, IMMEDIATELY ask for another person. Don't wait too long. Agency has dozens of workers on disposal, and you should get the best one for your money.  I think odesk offers you to see agency members so simply find the guy with the best rating and most experience, and ask agency ""how much for this guy"". "
"Starting out, how much to charge for development, hosting and maintenance?","You're pricing yourself into the ground. @ChrisForrence has great points and I'll add a few more... You will NEVER and I repeat NEVER profit from charging $350 for a site. Let's break this down from the first meeting... Also, don't offer SEO service. You're not really doing anything for $80. You'll just piss off clients when the ""don't appear at the top of the Googles"" for every search term imaginable.  So, let's do the math: Total price = $350
Total hours = 34 
$350/34 = $10.29/hour McDonalds pays about $8 - $9 per hour and it's consistent money. "
Collecting final payments from clients who disappear without making full payment?,I'm gonna assume you mean web development and related work.
Seeking advice on web design startup,"I am in the fifth year of running my own web design and development business. I hired a legal professional to help me with my terms and conditions and despite the copyright notice on my website, my terms and conditions have been copied by web design and development firms all over the world, often with very little changes. I guess I should be flattered! How do you go about gathering information and requirements for the software/website? (phone calls, emails, etc) For larger projects, I suggest getting clients to complete a web design brief or similar. This is a standard form that is sent to clients to gather key information. The type of information collected in a web design brief will include (for example): It can be useful to meet clients face to face at least once if you are in the same geographic area. Ideally at a face to face meeting, ask clients to show you some websites they find inspiring can help in figuring out what they are after. Get them to point out the features that they like on each website e.g. is it the layout, the colours, the responsive slideshow, the contact form etc etc. How do you communicate your ideas/layout/features for the website to the client? (create sketches, create actual simple prototypes, etc) Use the information you have collected to write a project proposal outlining the proposed deliverables and associated costs and time frames. Depending on the complexity of the project, you might include in the proposal a draft menu structure and layout using tools such as yEd and Balsamiq. On simpler projects you could specify that the menu structure and layout can evolve in consultation with the client. When dealing with larger organisations, ask them to designate a single point of contact so you receive consistent rather than conflicting instructions. On most website projects, I evolve the website design and development in parallel and provide access for clients to monitor progress and provide feedback if I have gone off-track. On some (usually clearly defined) projects, it is easier to work without constant feedback and provide the delivered project at the end for review and adjustment if required. Do you create a sort of finalized conceptual that becomes part of the agreement? This can be useful to help define the scope and to refer back to if the client goes off on a different tangent so that an additional fee can be charged for clear variations. You might be comfortable with certain clients (e.g. ones you have worked with in the past) to let the design and structure of the website evolve, and build this into the budget. Do you draw up a contract and what general things are contained in that contract (I'm not looking for legalise, just general things you consider)? Ideally it is best to eliminate assumptions on both sides or state any assumptions to make it clear what is and isn't going to be delivered. I suggest you create some standard terms and conditions that can be included in each proposal to make it clear what is and isn't expected. Examples for a web design job might include such things as: I think you have to expect and allow for a certain amount of variation when embarking on a large project and build this into the budget. This usually results in an optimum solution being delivered that you can both be proud of. Some clients will try to take advantage of you and you need to be constantly on the alert for variations to the agreed scope so you can point this out to the client at the time. I have made the mistake in the past of allowing a small variation without saying anything to the client and then before realising it, have spent many hours on something for which I have no formal agreement to charge anything extra for. A better way to handle this might be to send a short email to the client explaining that the item doesn't appear to be in the agreed scope but you are happy to include it for free if it takes less than half an hour etc. Then there are no surprises for the client if there is an additional item on the invoice if the task goes over the stated limit."
Is it good to get paid in advance and then start project development?,"There are obvious benefits to the freelancer if payment is made up front: There is also a big risk to the client: I have seen 2 reasons why clients are willing to take that risk: Personally, as a freelancer I have learned being paid the entire amount upfront is not for me. I've learned that my motivation to work on a project is tied to the money I will be earning. If I've already been paid for everything, my desire to work on the project tanks. That being said, I know other freelancers who prefer this approach and only take up front payments. And I almost always ask for partial payment up front, just not the whole thing. Regarding the contract...yes. You always create a contract prior to project development, and in this case you would just include that the terms are that payment must be received before the work can begin. "
Dealing with a customer that was satisfied with your services but is mad about the price,"Personal opinion... don't engage too much. If the relationship is damaged, then it's damaged. Get paid and move on. Too much discussion will only inflame issues. In addition, any reduction not cited in the contract shows your willingness to not adhere to the contract itself. This could be interpreted as a failure in the agreement from its inception. The client's lack of due diligence on their part does not mean your company should suffer damages. Once this perception is set in a customer's mind, it really unlikely you can overcome it without serious price reductions of ""freebies"" and that, in turn, means the customer will at least attempt to get a reduction every single time. Hi [client], I regret that you may have misunderstood the agreement you signed. All fees were clearly indicated before any work began and at any point prior to engaging our services you were free to comparison shop with other firms/service providers in an effort to save costs. Everything were were hired to complete was stated up front and above board. There are no hidden fees and certainly no attempt to take advantage of or otherwise reap some unhidden benefit from this business relationship. The contract clearly indicated the work to be done and the price for those services. We traditionally expect our clients to adhere to the contract which has been signed, much the same way we ourselves value the contract as a binding agreement.  You're analogy using cars is a decent one. Imagine what the BWM dealer would tell this customer if they wanted a reduction in price to match a Toyota after the sales contracts had been signed?"
Asking Clients to pay Advance Payment?,"With new clients that approach me, I ask for a non-refundable deposit up front. Usually it ranges from 30% to 50% depending on the overall project cost. I tend to waive the deposit for any client I've previously worked for and not experienced payment issues with. When asked, or if the client balks at this, I explain that the deposit is to cover the work which must be performed before client approval is sought. And, after approval adjustment, changes, etc would be encompassed by the remaining payment. Many clients fail to realize that several hours of work must be performed and only then can they be contacted for approval or further direction. If a client declines the deposit or refuses to pay it... I don't do the work. It's that simple. To use an analogy.... if I were a caterer hired to cater a banquet. I would ask for a non-refundable deposit up front to cover the cost of food and materials and the hours of preparation that take place before the scheduled event. Then the remaining payment would be for services at the event. If the final event never happens, I still would have purchased all the necessary items and spent time scheduling and preparing for the event. So, I should not be expected to cover the cost of my work prior to the event - thus the deposit and why it is non-refundable."
Monthly Fee vs. One-Time Payment for a Large Project with Difficult Client,"Step 1 is to protect yourself with a clear scope of work.  Write up a clear, concise scope of the work you are performing.  Include not only the work being performed by also what is NOT being performed.  These are called exclusions. Your scope should also include the price of the project, that billings will be done monthly on the XX day of the month and are due Net 30.  Net 30 is a typical payment cycle that just about any company should be fine with.  You should spell out how you will arrive at what you are billing monthly.  For example, I use the percentage of completion method with billings on the 20th of the month.  This means on the 20th of the month, I project ahead to the end of the month how far the project will be complete.  If that is 50%, then I bill the client 50% of the project, less any previous billings. This allows you to get your billing out earlier while still accounting for your expenses through the end of the month and therefore be paid earlier.  You should always be ready to justify your bill.  I strongly suggest a followup 10 days after sending your progress bill.  It should be a very friendly, ""I just wanted to make sure you received my progress bill and if you had any questions"".  This helps remove obstacles to getting paid on time. You should also consider putting the time the project is to be completed and document any delays on the part of the company you are working for.  Delays in work being performed that are not of your making cost you ""opportunity costs""; the income for work you did not get to do for other clients or that you turned down because your time was reserved for their project that did not happen as per the schedule agreed to.  However, this is a two way street so think it through. Finally, your scope letter also needs to spell out how you will handle changes to the project (a change order), whether additive and deductive.  The best way to protect yourself is to have language that says all change orders must be approved in writing before work commences. Then whenever a change occurs you need to be proactive with presenting the change in scope (the change order) and the amount the change will increase/decrease the original dollars. It is always hard to walk that razor's edge between losing work and protecting the work you are doing, but some opening friendly language on your scope letter about how the document exists to outline your mutually beneficial agreement, etc. can help the client see your professionalism. Any professional company should understand the protection afforded for both parties by a clearly defined project through a scope letter. You may want to get in the habit of having your bids also be the scope letter to save a step.  In this manner the client just needs to sign off on your bid and you are ready to move forward. Hope this helps."
"Can I use logos of companies I have worked for, directly & indirectly, on my website?","It's always safer to ask, right? But if you want our opinion, then: Yes, you can use it.  Just be professional there as well. Do not give project names or project specifications, but rather only company name and technologies you used while working for them.  If you have, however, created a cool thing and want to brag with it, then it's a must to ask your company for permission to disclose such information. "
Client threatening to take legal actions -- How should I have prevented this?,"No matter what is the behavior of the customer, being aggressive and insulting never helps. In some countries, it can, indeed, allow your customer to take legal actions against you for defamation/slandering. Another consequence is that the insulting e-mail can find its way to internet. What if, a few years later, a potential customer—a large corporation, decides to check about you before asking you for your services? What if they ask your actual customer what he thinks about you, and as an example, he forwards them your e-mail? In order to avoid those cases, follow two guidelines: If you don't want to maintain relations with a customer who pays (for example because he's a jerk), ask for more money. Make him abandon you because he don't have enough money. Never abandon a customer yourself. If the customer doesn't pay, there are two cases. Either you have enough leverage to force the customer to pay or you are able to take legal action. Or you can't, in this case you're screwed."
Freelance graphic design without true work experience or degree,"How do I find trustworthy places where people post jobs, people do the
  jobs, and the best one gets paid? The 'where do I find places' part of this question has been answered by Tim, I just wanted to add my point of view regarding contests, and an alternative approach.  The reason why designers and freelancers are usually against contests is because there is no direct contact with the client, you have people working for little or nothing (mostly nothing), and clients see design as an expense and not an asset. Contests depend on luck, if you are lucky enough you will get paid for the effort you put into your submission. If not, too bad. For these and other reasons, most designers don't like them (and are explicitly against them) because they devalue the industry as a whole. Nobody should work for free. But there are other ways of start working as designer without having to resort to contests. You mention you want to choose your projects. Well, sites like elancer and others list jobs (not designers), and the only thing you need to have is a good portfolio. You can create pieces for fictional projects, instead, and use those. Real experience is always better, of course, but you want to demonstrate you are capable of designing stuff, and you want to showcase your style. These portfolio pieces will give you that. "
How do I start my Freelancer career?,"You just have to start like all of us. I had 10 years of experience when started freelancing and even thou I was a beginner for remote clients.  So to answer your questions.  I'm good written, reading and medium as speaker in english. Work on your English. The language barrier may be larger obstacle than lack of knowledge. At least perfect your passive English (written language) so that you can flawlessly communicate via emails, chats, etc.  Where do I start? How do I find my first customer? Like we all did :). Google ""freelancing"" and register and top sites. Fill the profile professionally and start applying for jobs. If you do it all right, you should expect to get your first job (probably smaller one) in a month or so. You can expect to live from freelancing after 6 months in case you deliver quality products. 
Read this post of mine, it may help: read this.  I'm also have a blog about ASP.NET written in PT-BR. Should I do some
  kind of portifolio to show my expertice? Absolutely! Portfolio is the best thing to prove your experience. Also do IT tests on those freelancing sites."
How prompt should we fix bugs after app release?,"In a project I recently finished, we offered a warranty period for 60 days after the release date, in which we agreed to fix all critical and high priority defects within 48 hours. You could offer something similar. The key is to get mutual agreement on what is critical/high priority. You probably need to think about the kind of issues that are being found on your projects currently and decide on what you believe is a critical/high priority issue. That should give you some guidance that you can give to clients regarding the kind of issues that would fall under critical/high priority. That's the only grey area in this really. If you don't provide boundaries for priority there is a chance that a client could try to push all defects through as critical. Each needs to be evaluated separately but you should agree the priority before tackling each one. If a reported defect is not critical/high priority, you could still agree to fix those within X days (7 for example). Once the warranty period elapses, any further reported defects should be chargeable. I think it's entirely reasonable to expect the client to pay for your time to fix defects if they don't find them for 2 months after you complete work on their software. As long as you are up front about that and the warranty period and defect resolution agreements are written into your contract then you should be covered for the point at which you can start charging for fixes. The only issue that might arise is if a defect takes longer than 48 hours to fix. You probably want to include a clause in the contract allowing for this.  You could even state that you will fix critical/high bugs within 48 hours in the first 30 days and within 7 days in the second 30 days (or something like that), which should encourage the client to fully test the app post-release and report issues promptly so that you can deal with them and hopefully put the project to bed without it rumbling on and disrupting other projects that you may also be working on."
How much should I charge as a late fee?,"Over here in the UK we have a statutory regime (link) for charging interest and fees on late commercial debts. This provides that: If you haven’t already agreed when the money will be paid, the law
  says the payment is late after 30 days for public authorities and 60
  days for business transactions and The interest you can charge if another business is late paying for
  goods or a service is ‘statutory interest’ - this is 8% plus the Bank
  of England base rate for business to business transactions. plus an admin fee. However, invoking such legislation is perceived as being a one-way bet on never getting any further work from that client, so use with caution!"
How should I deal with my first clients who ask for my portfolio?,"You are not loosing clients because they are not your target group yet. The clients that are asking for portfolio are looking for experienced webmaster. Sad but true, but most of them are not interested in hiring someone that hasn't done at least a couple of projects. They want to be sure that you really can do the things and secondly, they also want to see what's your style, to check if that passes to them. What to do? You're a beginner, so you should consider taking significantly less money than the professional with large portfolio. At the beginning everyone earns less.  But the most important thing is to make your portfolio. Just look for some local non-profit organizations such as school or sport clubs and make a site for them. Or just make a few hobby projects and put them into internet. The site about breeding grasshoppers, or about West-African legends, or anything.  You need to invest a little in hosting services, but you need to be able to show something that is running in Internet."
How can I negotiate barter for a contract?,"Regarding taxes, in theory (at least in the US) you are supposed to report fair value of goods received but that is difficult to quantify.  After all nothing has a singular, objective fair market value but rather a range of plausible values.  The way I do it is simply to invoice the customer for the fair value of my services, and then buy their goods and services out of their accounts receivable balance.  In this view it isn't really a ""barter.""  Rather it is a straight-forward invoice and collection of debts albeit in a non-traditional manner.  There may be agreements which specify the manner of the goods, but the point is that the fair value to me is what I would have invoiced someone else for the same work.  The fair value to my client is the work that I did (that would have been paid for in cash) and so as long as the value is plausibly around that range, I don't see anyone questioning that approach.  If the value is not plausibly in that range, you wonder who is being taken advantage of. I would also assume that any applicable sales taxes would apply. A few things I would prefer to see in the contract if it were me: Customer has option of paying in monetary or non-monetary forms.  You invoice for a monetary amount.  They deliver a non-monetary item in payment.  You can include in the contract then that X will be deemed payment for Y.  The reason here is that this helps both of you.  They get to record the sale at your invoice price.  You get to record the purchase at your price.  You have documentation of an agreed upon value of the goods to be delivered.  Worst case, you just get what you would have billed someone else.  In the event that services are not delivered by the customer this also gives you a way to more easily collect. Put the goods and services delivery terms along with payment terms together.  Delivery of services or goods by them is payment for your invoices."
How do I tell a client that I'm working fewer hours because they pay me much worse than my other clients?,"Simple, either raise their pricing or drop the client. It's business. There's little point in working even a few hours for less money than you could earn with another client. Businesses typically do not provide individual pricing merely because you've been doing business with them for a while. Hi [client], As of [Month day year] pricing for my services will be increasing to
  $x per hour. I've absolutely enjoyed working with you n your projects, but
  unfortunately cost of living and market demands necessitate a price
  increase. I hope this increase is acceptable and we can continue
  working together. As always, I'm available for further discussion if necessary. Thank you I think the biggest mistake freelancers make - and I am no exception here at times - is to not be confident when discussing pricing.  The less confident one appears when discussing pricing, the more the client gets a sense they can have it altered. If you subconsciously convey that you ""aren't sure"" if you can get the pricing, the client picks up on that to some degree and it opens a whole flood gate of discussion which is not warranted. State your price. Clients pay it or they don't. It's that simple. If they don't want to pay it, they can find someone else. I, personally, have tried to get in the habit of repeating ""Pricing is non-negotiable"".  I do have some prospective clients that refuse the rates and move on... but, since my pricing is set, the clients I do retain make up for any lost prospect which wants me to lower pricing for them. I'd rather work for clients that see my pricing as acceptable. I detest ""haggling"" when clients have no reasonable understanding of my overhead or market standing. It all comes across as a ""yard sale"" for my time which seems entirely undesirable. This is my price. That's it. If it's too expensive, I understand and that means you'll need to shop elsewhere, not that I'll reduce pricing for you."
How to turn down freelancing projects due to ethical/moral dilemmas without upsetting client or referring party?,"I don't understand the dilemma. ""Sorry, I'm not available to work on your project."" Should be more than sufficient. If asked again, ""Sorry, I'm just not available.""  If pressed... ""Sorry, I just don't have available resources at the present time."" There's no reason you need to justify not doing the work. They aren't your ""boss"" if you're freelancing. You are perfectly within fair business practices to decline the work based on whatever reason you want to give. Using current workload as an excuse is often taken as ""less personal"" by some. There's also nothing wrong with stating, ""Sorry, I just wouldn't be comfortable working a site dedicated to XXXXX.""  After all, if you aren't going to do the job now, two weeks from now, or a month from now, you may as well make it clear why you don't want the work rather than waste everyone's time. It's often a freelancers folly to assume they need to please and stroke every single person who approaches them for work. That's a misconception. Do not waste the time of others. If someone has 50 sites to get done and they are all geared towards material you find objectionable, then turn them down and state you don't want to work on the sites due to the content but you'd be very happy to work with them on sites regarding different material. There's no shame in that. Don't send mixed messages. Clients will appreciate that far more than beating around the bush. If it's YOU CONTACTING THEM... stop doing a very poor job of researching the company. You should absolutely know, without a doubt, you would do any work for them you are capable of doing, otherwise you should not be contacting them at all."
Clients who don't pay their invoices what are your options?,"How far overdue are they? Do you have any language in your contract about payment due dates? If you don't, you should -- managing expectations is the most important. Both you and client should be clearly understood about deliverables and deadlines. In your current case, start by contacting them both by email (establish a paper trail) and phone to discuss the problem. Try to sort out a payment plan. If they fail to pay, or they disappear, or don't reply at all, you can look into legal action. Here in Ontario you can take somebody to provincial small claims court for issues under $5,000, fairly simple process and you don't need a lawyer. It's probably very different in other places. Talk to someone who knows your state law. Legal action is really not desirable but you need to know your rights, lest you need to exercise them."
Is scope creep before work has even started a warning sign?,"There are plenty of people that have 'grand visions' and limited resources.  They'll get going on something and then realize either that they can't afford to use it the way they intended, it's going to take longer to do then they expected, or that their understanding of what they needed was incomplete and they really need something else.  This goes on all the time, and I wouldn't be surprised if she calls you up again in a month and says 'we need this after all'. You have a 'first contact' that is tentative (new client you haven't worked with before).  Probably the best thing to do is keep rounds of communication going every month or so to see what her current projects are.  Rather than make 'all or nothing' software agreements, operate 'a la carte' time and materials.  You need to understand more about how this client does business."
Get freelance contracts and not only hired contracts,"If your services as a freelancer are valuable, it makes sense for the client to prefer to hire you on a permanent basis - so you cannot really blame them for trying. All you can do is inform them that you are not available for permanent positions. This might get you fired or not hired - and only you can evaluate whether this works out financially for you. Perhaps you could propose a freelancing role where you mentor an employee to eventually take your place? This seems self-destructive, but if done well - the client might find similar roles for you."
How can the online freelance IT market be segregated?,"On the surface, it is just as you have described it. But the reality is different.  Every fresh client will go with the lowest rate in his project. And eventually he will be burnt and will realize that the rate and quality go along. In that case, he can try another project with the medium rate or go with the high rates from contractors closer to him. This is where your chances are.  Another case is that clients will chose you over the cheapest rate because of the legal liabilities. He will pay you more, but he is sure he can sue you in case you do the job badly. I doubt he will sue some company 3000 miles away in a country with weird laws. Such clients are your chance as well.  Now, from what I have seen, Western contractors will get hired by clients of their own country and they usually can make a good living with 2-3 clients. Other low-rate contractors must have 100 clients to make the living. Would you replace with them? So although they will accumulate jobs with the lowest rate, they will NEVER do them with quality. Why? A simple math. They do the job at the lowest rate and those clients are usually assholes who want 1M project for 10 bucks. So low-rate clients will have to have 10 or 20 such jobs to actually earn something. What will they sacrifice? The quality.  So although your pace will be slower in gaining quality, you have higher chance to earn from freelancing. I have seen 100s of low-rate guys disappearing after some time (probably quit on freelancing and found a stable job in the local company). "
How to get direct freelancing work without job portals?,"The key to finding clients is to understand where your best clients will be, and then go there. Thus the answer to your question depends largely on the kind of work you do, the kinds of customers you are interested in serving, and the types of projects that you want to do. For example: I am a freelance ASP.NET developer. I have decided my BEST clients are small organizations (< 50 employees), where I work directly with the owner. These organizations are typically for profit, and are local to my area (so I don't have to worry about finding them if they don't pay up.) These customers tend to hire freelancers because they don't want the overhead of a consulting firm. They look for freelancers in their network, and they may do their own google search to find resources also.  Thus, the best ways for me to find clients has been via referrals, and occasionally using very targeted local Google Ad Words. In 11+ years of freelancing, I am rarely slow for very long.  Your situation may be different. If you want to work with larger companies, they may prefer to work through intermediaries. They may only hire organizations on ""approved"" lists. Some industries have trade groups that could provide a good ""in"". In short, you need to determine the attributes of your ""best"" clients, and then figure out how they would look for you and also where they will likely be. Then go there."
"In terms of industry standard, what qualifications are required for internet-based freelance translating?","Speaking just in IT, certifications can mean the world, or nothing... In my case, they mean nothing. I get my jobs based on my experience and ability to adapt. If you are translating, certificates just mean you can pass a test. If you are able to speak it fluently, that would most likely be enough. When applying to the projects, I'd probably recommend writing your letter to them in English, French and German, showing you can do it on the fly. I would also link to any other translation works you've done in the past to show your track record. You can also start just on Open Source projects, as many of the smaller ones are always looking for translators. You may need a bit of programming experience, but it should be minimal if you work with the developer."
How much time to spend on an initial quote as a part-time freelancer?,"I suggest two options: 1) You could create a questionnaire for potential clients that gathers a lot of information that you know you will need on most web sites. Yes, you may need more details, but you could try to gather the first round of information without investing a lot of time in the effort. (Your questionnaire could ask about if the site needs an e-commerce component, if you will need to gather contact information, etc., for example.) 2) I recommend you sell a design product to prospects. Here's how I'd pitch it: A good website requires a lot of thought go into the project. What do you need, who is your audience, etc. I will work with you to develop this information, put together sitemaps, workflows, etc. For this effort, I will charge you $X. Once this is done, I will provide you a bid for development of the website. I hope you use me for the site development too, but you can also take this  (the workflows, sitemaps, etc.) and get pitches from other web developers.  The advantage to this second option is that you can charge something for the work you will be doing to actual develop the site, so it gets you to the quote process sooner. And you get away from tire kickers who are asking for a quote but don't want to invest any time in the effort."
Freelancing and Using Open Source/GPL code to make money,"I have done this for 7 years.  Most of my work is on LedgerSMB.  The simple answer is yes.  Here is more information as to how to do this and so forth. Open Source Development is Pay Up Front for Development With software licenses you are compensating a developer in arrears for development work.  Microsoft spends vast amounts of money developing their products which they hope to make back through software sales.  Occasionally this doesn't happen (remember Bob?) and so in this model the developer bears all risk. With open source software, things are very different.  You charge up front for the development, and don't try to make the money back on the other side.   Contributing your changes back however, and hoping to ensure free redistribution cuts your maintenance costs, and this is a good thing. Why Contribute Back There are two important reasons to try to get your work incorporated in the main distributions of the software.  The first is that it cuts your maintenance cost.  Other people will find and fix bugs and this will benefit your customers for less cost than coming back to you.  Happy customers refer more customers. The second reason is that contributing back establishes your visibility in the projects you contribute to and this is a way of marketing your skills to others who already use the software.  When you get more sales calls you can point to features you have done, some of which the customer may already be using, and this gives you an in sales-wise. Of course not everything can be contributed back.  Maybe some things the community doesn't want.  Maybe some things are specific to a customer, and this gives you some extra support revenue down the road.  However, if you minimize this, you will have happier customers and more customers. Limits of the GPL Under no interpretation of any version of the GPL is mere use of GPL software sufficient to impose the GPL on work you do.  The question is what your licensing options are when you include GPL software in your solutions and this is not always an easy or straight-forward question to answer (for the v2 license, is it mere aggregation or derivation?, for the v3 license does 7(b) allow you to irrevocably grant user rights to your code to downstream users in excess of what the GPL allows?  I think it must because otherwise the BSD license family is incompatible.  Also does mere linking to a library under the GPL require your code to be under the GPL too? (Intensely debated in legal circles)  Is this transitive? (aside from the FSF, the general consensus is no) I prefer to release my code, where I can (a minority of my time), under the BSD license because it avoids these questions, but for the most part following community norms will never get you in trouble. These norms assume that BSD and GPL software can be combined together into a single work licensed, as a whole, under the GPL, that BSD code cannot have its license changed without first being modified (see http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/gpl-non-gpl-collaboration.html) and so forth.  Involvement in a community and following what everyone else in that community does is likely to be generally safe."
"I built a tool to automate work, should I ask a raise?","If I create a tool which makes it easier to complete my work, and complete it much faster than before, the client does not need to know about it. (Provided you aren't under a work-for-hire agreement).  How I do my job, the speed at which I do my job, the tools I use to complete my job, what hours I work and where those hours fall, are all my choice and the core of what freelancing often is. If none of these are true.... are you certain you aren't under a work-for-hire-agreement? (In which case, the client may own this new ""tool"".) I'm 200% faster at completing tasks today than I was 5 years ago... but I should never make less money just because I can complete something at a faster pace. Never penalize yourself for being good at your job.  Where this gets tricky is if you are under an hourly payment agreement. If work took you 4 hours yesterday, but this new tool means it'll only take 30 minutes today, you're in a pickle - at least ethically.  You could keep your rates the same and just invoice for the 4 hours it would have taken you to complete without your new tool. Its ethically questionable, however, again, how you complete your work is your business. Developing something that the means you don't need 4 hours doesn't necessarily mean the client shouldn't be paying what 4 hours of time is worth.  You could raise your rates considerably and cut the reported hours down to 30 minutes - this may be problematic. If you start slashing your expected or anticipated work time, you may find that when there's a problem you don't have adequate time to deal with things and clients are harping at you because you've been so fast in the past. Ideally, the balance would be somewhere in the middle. You raise rates to appropriately compensate you for your speed.. and you cut the necessary turnaround time down to allow the client to benefit from the new speed increase as well. Both you and the client get something this way. Client gets faster turnaround, you get more free time without any loss of income. I tend to not work hourly in most cases due to this. I work on value-based pricing. I've quoted a price to my client. The client is happy with that price and will pay that price. How I complete my tasks is entirely my choice - whether it takes me 16 hours or just 1, the client doesn't care they will still pay the quoted price. If I come up with a huge time saver, the client still pays what they've agreed to pay... I merely may be working far less to deliver what is expected. Again, I refuse to penalize myself for being good at my job. It's my opinion that for most freelancers working for hourly pay is never a great position to be in. Fire your hourly rate if possible. It's holding you back. I don't think this question could really definitively be answered without fully understanding any contract or agreement you have with your client."
Being clear about the way I work,"It takes just one bad client to make you think about this... So true! I'm hoping you are far enough in your career that you have other clients and other projects to work on as well. If not, read the next part; if you do, great! If you have other work to do, then you need to explain to your clients what takes priority, what the due dates are, and that work does not continue without payment / escrow. As a freelancer, your time is valuable, and usually the only way you are making money. So, treat anyone who does not respect your time / life as someone who does not respect YOU / YOUR COMPANY. If you have a large project you are working on for this client, it needs to have milestones setup that are definable, and have a clear indication of what is considered ""complete"" for that step. It will be included with the Scope of Work. The client should sign off on various stages, and money should be paid once work has been shown to have been completed, before additional work happens. As for billing, make sure your bills go out on time and to the right address / recipient. Once the bill is sent in the mail or email, I set a reminder on my calendar for 30 days. If I have not received payment for that invoice by the 30 days, I send a reminder invoice, and a statement explaining that late fees apply unless the money is in my account in 14 days. If it's for a project, work would have already stopped while I wait, and the statement would reflect this. After that 14 days, a new invoice is made, including a late fee, and sent to the client explaining that they are past due. No work has been done otherwise with this client for the past 14 days, so not much is lost. If the meetings are not being productive, then require them to send a meeting agenda ahead of time to all expected participants. If there is no use in you being there, explain politely that you have other projects to work on during that time, or that you are only available for xx minutes at yy:zz time. Set the limit, and stick to it! We've all wasted lots of time in meetings that could have been better spent elsewhere. You're the expect on your time and craft, so make it known! If you do not have other clients, you can still use a lot of the advice above - remember, you need to spend time working on yourself / your business, and that also includes finding NEW clients as well. If you are stuck having just one client, then you are essentially an employee without benefits. Explain that you are busy during the meetings that you could do without, and use the time to expand your business, in any way you can."
How do you divide your time between planned and unplanned/new work?,"Good question and one which most freelancers can probably relate to! I think the best way to handle your workload is to educate clients that you are only one person and will do your best to responsibly manage the competing demands of all your clients. This might mean occasionally missing a deadline by a day or two if another client has an emergency that you can't ignore. If clients can't cope with the odd missed deadline then they probably need to be hiring a larger firm that can absorb peak work loads easier than you can. The disadvantage for the client with a larger firm is that they will likely need to pay a higher rate associated with a larger firm's overheads. Ideally, it is also good to under promise and over deliver. In terms of deadlines, maybe add some time to allow for unexpected work. For example, if you think you can get a task finished by Wednesday then tell the client it will be finished by Friday. If no extra work comes in and you finish by Wednesday, then the client will be happy. If extra work comes in and you don't finish the task until Friday, then there's no harm done and everyone is still happy. In summary, I think the answer is in managing client expectations. "
Telling a client they won't have priority,"For my client I work on them based off the deadlines that I set. If I have two sites due the same day I will work on the one that is gonna take the longest and needs more advanced programming incase I run into any problems.  I don't think a client needs to pay to be priority, unless that is something they are willing to do but that should be discussed up front. "
Should I become a freelance web developer or a freelance software developer?,"I think you should shoot high.  The sky is the limit for you. You already have a lot of skills for your age.  I think it is totally possible to make some money with freelance web development to pay for some of your classes, however, I think there are a few things you need to consider when making this decision.   Before choosing a route, I would consider what you like to do the most; web development or software.  For choosing what you will be doing for the long haul, I would suggest to always go where your passion lies, in my opinion. The short term is a whole other story. Even if you wanted to go the software route for the long haul, software projects normally take longer to complete and thus longer to see the rewards for your work, whereas you could use the monetary rewards that come with web development to give you a jump start and get you on your feet. It will still be experience under your belt, and you could definitely use it to build up a reputation in the industry. You could also merge the two by working with wordpress, possibly building or configuring websites for people for money while writing code, a plugin perhaps that could kill two birds with one stone.  I think another thing to consider about freelance web development, is that it may be harder to find clients if you are lacking in the design arena. I think it's much easier to sell something when you can package it all pretty. Otherwise you might run the risk of not being able to find enough clients that truly understand the value of what you do. Software development can take many years, with many people working on one project to get it done, whereas with web development you can find customers that have problems with there website and need a developer to go in and get things working again.  This might be a good angle to market yourself from, rather than the building of websites from scratch, (unless you know design or or a designer you can work with), as you have said earlier, your pretty confident people are doing ok with using web builders on their own. But even the most resourceful business owner will hit a snag and at some point need to seek out professional help from someone who has the technical skills they just don't.  Thats where you could come in. Either way, I think there is definitely a market for you.  It's just a matter of going and getting what it is you want.  If you are confident and market yourself to someones current need, I don't see you having a problem getting work at all.   It is daunting a bit when you first start off but whatever you set your mind to, you can accomplish.  Just start small, and work your way up to bigger and bigger projects.  Expand your services as your experience expands.  Decide where your passion lies and then come up with a working plan that encompasses your short term monetary goals, and a step by step plan on how to use those short term goals as steps to your long term goals.  There is no reason why you can't make a few bucks and dabble in whatever software projects you fancy that might come up along the way."
Is it unreasonable to withhold completed work if a contract hasn't been signed?,"It is reasonable to expect a contract to be in place before the work is delivered.  Personally, I would expect the contract to be in place before work begins. My guess is they consider their verbal recognition of the contract sufficient, and you don't.  A polite clarification that you require a formal recognition of the contract shouldn't cause any hard feelings. Re: Project Completion ETA Hello [client], the project is finished and ready for delivery.  I
  will submit the deliverable to you as soon as I receive a signed copy
  of the contract I submitted to you on [date]. -Jedd"
Global freelancers and taxation,"The majority of countries only charge taxes on people for either (1) the time that they were working there, or (2) who have been physically present in the country for a significant period of time (""tax residents""). This is residency based taxation. Most countries have a physical presence test for this kind of thing.  Even though the US is even more strict about who pays taxes, as a non-resident alien, you still need to be physically present in order to pay taxes. A quote from the irs website about non-resident aliens elaborates (emphasis mine): If you are any of the following, you must file a
  return: ,,, So even in the case of the US, it is necessary to be physically present in the US at the time that you're working in order to pay taxes there (as long as you're a nonresident alien) The rest of the countries operate under a territorial taxation system, notably Singapore and Hong Kong. Residents of these countries only pay tax on local income.  Additionally, for the USA in particular, tax is only applied to us-sourced income. The source of the income is tied to the contractor location. See here. This means that for anyone outside the USA, no W-8BEN and no tax withholding is required. If you were to visit the USA and perform work there for a few weeks, then this paperwork would be required and you would subject to witholding tax."
Agile methodologies when developing software as a freelance?,"Irrespective of whether you are following Agile practices, if you do not involve the client from the outset, or someone else who can make decisions about project deliverables on behalf of the client (a Business Stakeholder in Agile parlance), then the odds are stacked very heavily against you actually delivering a product that the client wants and can use. This is even more important if there is only 2 people in the team - stakeholder and developer. My experience of both Agile (7 years as lead developer on numerous Agile projects) and Freelancing (4+ years as a contractor) have shown me that the projects upon which I was working alone with a client and adopted strict Agile processes were the projects that were most successful in terms of delivering a product that the client was happy with. The key to making use of the ideas behind Agile for a lone freelancer is to define the overall features up front and a priority order for those deliverables, whilst leaving room for change within those feature definitions. The danger with this approach (that you must be mindful of from the outset) is not to leave too much room for change. Instead, try to define what comes under the remit of allowable change and what would trigger a change request (with corresponding cost). If you're not careful, it becomes fairly easy for a client to simply fixate on the ""change"" aspect and cause you massive rework at no extra cost to them, which can quickly make a project unworkable from your end. The more closely you can collaborate with the client, particularly in the beginning, the better in terms of overall delivery success. The other key part of Agile that is important is the idea of iterative development. Request feedback regularly. Push changes up to a shared location and invite feedback at regular, predetermined intervals. That way, if the project is not delivering what the client has envisaged, there is time to change course without incurring massive cost and time penalties."
"In Germany, can I invoice a client for freelance work without having a business registered?","From my experience in Germany as a part-time freelance software developer with a full-time job (also as software developer), there are a few things to observe: About your specific questions: I'd recommend to look for a seminar on starting a company (Existenzgründerseminar). You can find them in many places (like Volkshochschule) and it's a great place to start to understand how a company is run (at least in theory)."
Should I charge for idle services as a freelancer?,"I do contract work and also charge by the hour.  What I charge for is my time to complete the job given the tools that I have, and if that includes waiting on a file to up load then so be it, it gets absorbed into the billing.   I also bill on a per hour basis and don't bill on shorter time units, (although YMMV for your field of work) and the client already has an estimate of how long the job will take - in which I also include time for contingencies such as slow network connections etc. However with that said I do try and fill my time productively with other tasks needed by the client for a job - unlike those slacker employees I know who happily spend a 1/2 hour at the water cooler discussing their weekend activities."
How do you curtail too much customer input on website design?,"Directed Choices. Most clients I experience want to feel as though they have input into how things look. I think that's just human nature. The key for me has been to always provide directed choices rather than open-ended questions. What this means in rather than: ""What color do you want it?"" 
  or
  ""How do you think it should look?"" You ask something along the lines of: ""Do you want that blue or green?""
  or
  ""Do you prefer the way button A looks or button B?"" This may seem like a very minor thing, but it's not. You are limiting the input from the client without them directly realizing it. This helps the client feel vested and involved because they are making choices. But, in turn, it greatly lightens the load on you because you are limiting the scope of choices available. The same philosophy works for just about any design element. You just have to ask the questions the right way.  Truth is, even using this method, you're almost always going to run into that one client that just sucks up your time by being indecisive and wanting constant changes. In those instances, I politely explain that a choice has to be made and stuck to otherwise I'm wasting too much time reworking things I thought were complete.  I'm odd in that I do not limit client revisions in my contracts. I've always been of the mindset that I'd rather have a satisfied client than one that left angry because they reached a revision limit and didn't get what they wanted. I've never really been bitten by this practice. Sure I may need to do a couple extra rounds of revisions for a client, but they leave happy and willing to return to me for more work. Which ultimately means I don't care about the extra revisions.  Many professionals do limit revisions though. So if that model works for you, have at it. "
"As a contractor, should I own the GitHub repo until final payment?","There are a couple reasons why I would not recommend the approach you're entertaining: Instead I would suggest adopting the stance that the client owns the code from day one, and make sure they have visibility, access, and even the ability to boot you out when they want to. The idea is to make yourself easy to fire. (Again, see reference below.) Then do other things to increase the chances of getting paid: Finally, related to the points above (including the ""warm fuzzy"" idea, the idea of making yourself easy to fire, etc.), I can't recommend this article highly enough: http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/be-consultant.html"
Reusing freelance code for future projects,"This will borrow my knowledge from this question, because I feel a lot of the knowledge would be the same. First off, from when I was a freelance web programmer, using PHP and MySQL (I do not do design), a lot of the code was fairly straight forward, even the custom stuff. When I did my research in how to do something, if I could see how it would help future clients, I would not charge the full rate of researching it, and would just add the cost to the next few clients who wanted that same feature. Everyone feels like a win-win. Is it ethical? I believe to. My time needs to be paid for, but that's not the reason you're paying me. They're paying me for my expertise. There are only a few ways to add two numbers on a computer, the most common being x += 1. If I use this for Client A, does this mean for Client B, I need to use x = x + 1? Does not seem logical. The main issue is that almost everything has been done. For those that haven't been done, you are probably not the first. If you come up with a method that adds two numbers together, is flawless, and works perfectly no matter how you implement it, it's stupid to not use it. All the clients I have dealt with understand that they pay me for my expertise, not my time. I know the process, I know what works, because as a freelancer, I am the expert in my field. This is the attitude to go forward with. The client who pays by the project does not care if it takes 5 or 10 hours, they just want it to work. If you charge $500 for the Widget Factory component, and the first time it takes you 10 hours, you're billed out at $50/hour. If you can reuse it for the next client, while still charging $500 for the component, and you can re-use old code and have it working in 5 hours, that's $100/hour you're charging! You are getting paid for your expertise, not your time. Does the client make you sign an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)? Then check to see what it covers, hopefully with a lawyer. If it's just the general idea of the project as a whole, then you should be safe keeping snippets that help you out more. Ask before signing the agreement! The last thing you want is to get in hot water with a company that could put you through court for months at a time."
Can someone suggest how I can improve my freelancer-to-client communication?,"You will probably hear a lot of suggestions, but they will eventually lead to the client itself. They are either willing to learn new things or not. And there is nothing you can do about it.  Now, what you can do it make an initial conversation with them asking them about their technical knowledge of the area in question. I personally do not do that as I simply forget to ask them these things. Later in the process I may discover that they do not understand some terms and then I explain it additionally.  I also have a habit of explaining specific terms in the brackets, a few first times I talk to the client. The second thing is that I tell them on the beginning to stop me any time I start sounding too technical. For example, last night I had to explain the client why I will be late 2 days on a certain task by introducing him to a term which made me work slower. Then I used good 5 sentences explaining to him what this term means, how is it used in the UI environment and why it's harder to detect bugs. Next time I mention this term, I do not have to make an essay.  So far this either works with me or clients are too embarrassed to ask for clarification :). No one likes to sound stupid, although we'd never call them that way. This covers points 1 and 2.  I never tried point 3. Just learned from my experience.  The bottom line is your behaviour as well. Never try to boast in front of the client by trying to look like a guru or something. We are all gurus to them just because we are ""programmers"". So he already sees a guru in you and if you talk simple with him, he will sooner interpret it as yourself stooping to his level, then yourself being ignorant or a bad programmer. So maybe you can have an introductory talk with the client to discover his technical background (again, I do not do that, but it does not mean I am right to do so). "
Is it possible to make money while giving software away for free?,"I can only really supply anecdotal evidence because public online advertising numbers are hard to nail down. It depends on which platform your software is (and where you want to advertise). My experience is mostly in android and web advertising. An android app that I developed makes about $1/day per 10k app downloads. This app remains open mostly for the time the user is using it. I've setup ads for a couple of friends and family members, one in particular had about 1000 unique views a day and the income was in the order of USD cents.  The online advertising revenue stream is saturated because over the past few years more and more people have cottoned on to advertising income. Software advertising isn't as common which means it's (1) less predictable & established and (2) not as familiar to users. People are used to seeing ads on free android apps. The same may not be said about PC software.  In any case, it's going to be necessary to generate a significant number of ad views in order to generate reasonable income. Unless you have a sure way of generating these kinds of numbers,  it's going to be difficult to achieve significant income from advertising.  If this is going to be used as a portfolio,  I'd recommend releasing a 'lite' version to show what the app consists of and then a paid version with full features.  This allows for a potential client to try your software without paying anything. "
Evaluating short term contracts and pay rate,"Try this: My rate for shorter term projects is <fill in the blank>.  For projects that are more than <fill in the blank> in duration, I may be willing to negotiate a better rate for you. This way, you don't cut yourself short.  Start with the higher number.  Also, be wary of customers who are shopping on solely price instead of quality because you may likely discover that once you get on board with such a customer, they'll want to nickel and dime you (and pay late, if at all) every step of the way.  For me, the more a customer focuses on ""price, price, price, price, price"", the less I want to deal."
"Too many clients, not enough work","I heard only 2 types of stories: those that have 1 client but long-term (and are afraid what would happen if they lose him) and those that have too many clients but short-term.  I have been in both situations. First like you, and then started increasing rate to get just a few good clients. As a result, when I was on 1 client only, a client suddenly decided not to pursue project maintenance any more. It took me 6 months to reinstate all connections and to return to the position you are complaining about.  Now, as of them, I have established these rules: Keep all good clients no matter of their work load or rate Find good guys that I can trust and can outsource work when I cannot handle all. Clients are happy with work done, these guys earn, and I also earn finder fee. Win-win for everyone.  Keep finding clients.  In time, you will have a good team of reliable guys that you can outsource work while you have too much work. It can also happen that you work 6-month full-time project for 1 client while outsource all other tasks.  But take care not to sacrifice on quality while outsourcing or your will lose clients. Never accept worse quality than you would deliver yourself. "
Can I be held responsible for HIPAA violation?,"I would suggest asking for a contract to be made, or you make one and ask it to be signed. The purpose of a contract is to protect both parties. You can simply state (the contract should be more in depth than the following ""In the unforeseen event that there is a breach in data I cannot be held responsible for any HIPPA violations"". I would include that you are developing it to be as secure as you can make it within your ability and time allowance and that once you hand the product off you are not responsible for any misuse of the product. I used to work for a pharmacy and HIPPA violations are VERY serious in the US and am honestly surprised that they did not make you sign a non-disclosure agreement.  Basically, within this contract you: The company: I would also talk to the company about consulting with a lawyer to create the contract and the company should be the one to pay for the lawyer if that route is taken. EDIT 1: Based on a comment by @cdkMoose You should also look into getting professional liability insurance. You can not entirely contract away your responsibility. If your work fails in some way that should have been caught and creates a security hole you could still be responsible. Contracts won't protect you from something that could be considered professionally negligent."
How to handle prospective clients asking for a meet up?,"In my experience, it's absolutely reasonable to expect that the client should be able to put down on paper what they need. A client who is unable to communicate clearly to you over email/phone/carrier pidgen/any method is sending a big red flag. No matter how good their idea is, you cannot execute it if they can't communicate it clearly to you. A client who only insists on meeting you face to face is saying: 1) They don't respect you as a professional. If you ask for a spec on paper beforehand, they should respect that this is the way you operate and comply. 2) They don't have the idea solid enough idea in their head. You can't read minds. They will need to get their idea on paper at some point in order to quote them. You want a client who knows what they want. 3) They don't have respect for your time. By withholding their idea, they're taking away your ability to decide if you want to spend time on their project. That's your choice, now theirs. Even if the client has the best idea and budget to match, this is setting up a precedent for bad client behaviour in the future, because you are allowing them to disrespect your time and letting them determine how you operate. You are the professional, you call the shots. If they don't want to do things your way, then they're not worth your time.  Stand your ground and stick by your requirements. If you need a spec before meeting, then they need to deal with it or find someone else."
How to determine what to charge for building custom Android applications?,"I tend to work out all of my prices on a estimation of the time of the project as it is currently defined, +20% contingency. I will then look at how this fits with their budget, if I forsee they will be repeat clients and require maintenance I will often take this price lower. I would recommend you do it in this way. Pricing ""by page"" generally devalues you work and doesn't normally reflect the fact you are producing quality work that you are proud of.  Make sure that the requirements of the project are clearly laid out - if the client wants to add feature X this is known as slippage and should be chargeable extra. If you do not do this you may find you end up doing an awful lot of work for not a great deal! This is a good article on pricing websites but is applicable to most situations: http://css-tricks.com/how-much-should-you-charge-for-a-website/"
"I was robbed by Upwork, what do I do?","You should ideally engage the services of a business ombudsman if one exists in your locality. Failing that, a business focussed legal organisation. If upwork hasn’t given you a fair experience, you should be entitled to compensation."
EU-citizen working as contractor in Switzerland?,"I am not a lawyer or an expert on the issue, but it would be very strange if a company in a reputable Western country X (i.e. not under embargo or similar) could not provide services to and bill a company in a reputable Western country Y. If a Swiss company wants to import goods from abroad, does the company they're buying from need to register a company in Switzerland? Sounds unlikely. If the deal requires you to work on-site, you might need to get a work permit, depending on how long you'll stay in the country."
Is there any service to outsource reading job offers I get and negotiating with potential employers?,"I'm quite sure the solution has been right in front of you the whole time - what you need, based on your specifications (such as being able to determine whether by YOUR estimation and for YOUR purposes, any given proposal they ""Read"" would be a good deal in light of your circumstances and business model - and the ability to negotiate terms that would be favorable to you, and solicit new business for you... What you need is a Virtual (or in-house) assistant, but based on the high degree of specificity and the fact that it requires knowledge of you and your preferences more than anything, your best fit would be a long term/permanent one, but you would definitely have to invest the time to train them and let them learn how you expect things to be done - it's an investment that (with the right VA) will pay off tremendously, but if you don't invest that time in getting them acquainted with you and your business, it can't work.  In a nutshell, it hinges on your willingness to take the time to train someone thoroughly (more than a day or three) and you having the patience to see that process through. If can do that, then a VA that you train to do those things is your best possible solution And you cand find those at any of the above sites lol I work on Upwork and Guru. Freelancer is full of very low-quality freelancers - same with Fiverr. No real experience with People Per Hour. I got accepted by their platform, but their user interface (all the pop-ups and sliders) felt really cheap and spammy..IDK I have no basis for direct comment on Toptal either, honestly I never bothered to pursue them, as they come accross quite ""gimmicky"" to me... as if what you're really doing is paying 10x as much for the same thing with an elite label while someone kisses your rear end throughout the process - maybe my perception was a bit jaded that day lol."
How to compete with free apps?,"Totally agree with ChrisForrence, Jean-Lin PACHERIE and DigitalVinci. Just a little more advice to you.
You can make a free version of the App, gather the review and comment from the version and add more valuable function to the paid version of the same App
If someone want to use your App for free, they can download the free version. Having a mass amount of free user is good, since they can help you to test and give you feedback about the App.
Then you can continue improve both version: The free version with baseline function, more value is added to the ""Pro"" version, so that when people want more and willing to pay, they got a choice."
Should I charge the same amount while in skype call?,"Short answer: depending on what role you are acting during the communication. In the case when calls and meetings naturally belong to receiving your tasks, reporting your results (including weekly/monthly meetings), or resolving technical issues, I would say that the rate should be the same. However, if you help others getting their tasks, balance these tasks among several people, this can be considered Manager's role and may be billed at another rate. (Update) There could be other roles, like Solution Architect or Business Analyst, you name it depending on your company's and projects' staffing schemes. They are hard to separate in case of single-person projects, but when your project team grows, and you are doing these tasks, you will have some opportunity to charge different rates. A side note, make sure that time spent for Communication and Team Collaboration purposes should be a special article in project timeline. This would prevent people thinking that communication is for free."
Am I charging my clients too much?,"As I can see, you charged them 8 pounds per hour, which is $13 per hour. This is a very good price and you definitely did not overcharge them.  Your other mistake is that you investigated the price of work in the UK. You cannot do that. If they wanted a UK developer, they would have taken one. You have to charge them your hourly price, which is enough to live comfortably (in India). I used to work for UK companies who rented their developers for 300 pounds per hour, while they paid me less than 10% of that money. I was sore, but I could not complain since these are not the ""rules of the game"". So accept it like me or you will have a lot of problems finding clients.  If they still have not paid you, this is suspicious. I sincerely hope that you did not transfer your work to their servers; always keep work on your servers until your are fully paid. 5 to 7 days is reasonable. 1 month is very suspicious. This is not reasonable. How are they paying you? An online service like PayPal, etc.?"
Should I tell my client that software already exists to fill their need?,"I would advise the client, and ask if they wish to proceed...if not then I would bill for the time owed. You will show that you have integrity, the client will be pleased and may send you referrals or do business with you in the future. "
How much cost can be charged for an hour in web development.?,"Your hourly rate would totally depend on your own skills. If your client is a technical guy, it will take him, say, one hour of Skype calling to understand how good you are. I run a startup web development company.
My hourly rates as per my skills and expertise (for all clients, irrespective of the geographic location) are somewhat like: You have to define a standard for yourself according to the services you have to offer."
Should I work for free if client's requirement changed,"Absolutely not! If you have agreed on terms, and delivered, then you should expect him to deliver on his part of the arrangement. Having said that... These three questions may convince you otherwise, or confirm your position. Either way, remain polite and professional, explaining that you don't work for free for projects that he agreed upon initially. You can explain that your cost for implementing feature X using method Y will cost $ZZZ. But make sure the lines of communication are open and clear."
"New client, hourly rate negotiating-- should client still state first?","Peter MV's got some good points.  State your rate.  But bump it up a little higher than what you're really looking for.  If the client doesn't complain, GREAT!  If the client does complain, knock your price down - a little at a time - until the client is satisfied, but of course don't go lower than what you were really looking for in the first place. This approach lets the client feel as if he/she had some ""power"" to control what gets spent.  It's a silly game, but not so silly after it works for you!"
Can they sue me in this situation?,"That, my colleague is known as 'scope creep' and is one of the oldest problems known to freelancers. It sounds in like they may be abusing the fact that you are 'not living around the corner'.  I avoid working for companies that I cannot drive over to and meet face to face.  There are too many people willing to twist things or railroad others in order to increase the scope of the project in their own favour. Distance working can make things even harder in that case. A lot depends on whether or not the client provided a project brief based on 'time period' / price per hour or 'piece work'.  Piece work can be a problem with clients you are not familiar with.  I would in the future demand a 'per hour' or 1/2 day or Full Day rate.  And make sure to clearly define what a Full day means.  Mine is 10 hours inc travel time but not inc travel expenses for example.  I also have a different hourly rates for different services. You need to re-read all communications from them and see how vague / exact the wording is.  Words such as 'may' vs 'will' vs 'plan to' can mean different intentions.  I shared a house with a solicitor for 2 years so I know a bit about how subtleties in wording can be misused. The best kind of work is via referral and then at least if 'Dave' treats you badly you can at least complain to one of his peers or do some form of moving and shaking. I find that works quite nicely.  Of course you never keep all of your clients in just one group though.  That can be equally dangerous for obvious enough reasons. As IANAL indicates - surely freelance.com has some form of protection for this kind of thing anyway. In addition I would certainly advise that you take out professional indemnity insurance so that in the future you can counter their threats with a lot more confidence.  An email threatening to sue you can be countered with 'do it!' and no sleepless nights. It costs around £20 to £30 per month in the UK presently (Oct 2013). I doubt that they are going to sue.  They're just trying to push you around. Finally, if it is not easy to physically speak to your client because they are 'too busy' or in a different time zone etc then I'd wonder why they were tendering the work out near you in the first place...."
Clients want to track the hours I work for them [closed],"Warning If anyone asked me to use such a framework, I would give the lead some serious second thoughts.   If the customer has the time to micromanage me or look through such footage, they have focused on the wrong things (huge red flag project-wise).  I have experience with this as an employee (call center environment) and it never ends well.   What is ostensibly intended to provide for good things inevitably leads to bad including possible disclosure of sensitive information (checking your bank account after forgetting to log out), or giving a belligerent customer things they can rip out of context to try to say they shouldn't pay.   Really, if you have any other choice do not do this. If you do this, you have to figure that any activity on your computer at any time could be accidently disclosed to your customer.  This could include without limitation trade secrets of other customers, confidential information you have agreed to protect, your own financial information (including but not limited to credit card information sufficient to make purchases online), and much, much more. Note additionally my experience was in the formal employment context.  Those risks go up quite a bit for consultants and contractors since typically you own your own computer and use it for other things too. Alternatives This being said, very often it is very helpful to give customers a detailed breakdown of what you did for them, how long.  LedgerSMB (disclaimer: I run a LedgerSMB hosting service with a business partner too, as well as do development and consulting on that platform) has a timecard interface where you can assign timecards with projects, add detailed notes, and include those notes, optionally on invoices you send your customer.  It is fairly simple: you enter a time in and time out, it calculates an interval at the rate associated with the service and customer.  You indicate how many of those hours were non-billable and give both description and notes. Then you can generate sales orders from a set of timecards, and sales invoices from the orders. I would hope that many other applications have similar functionality. If you absolutely must From my perspective the only reasonably safe way to address this is to create a screencast of your work, and at least check the ends (make sure you didn't leave it running when you were done and went to check, for example, your bank account). Specific recommendations for software to accomplish this is probably outside the scope of Q&A because such a list will likely go out of date relatively quickly but Wikipedia does maintain a list of such software which may be of help. A final alternative might be to require that a customer with such a requirement provides you a computer for sole use for you to use in working on their project configured to their specifications.  This way you have an air gap between anything your business might consider sensitive and anything the customer gets to see. However this is a business security nightmare.  If you have any confidential information on your computer at all, it is not safe, and if you inadvertently violate another client's NDA, you might be held liable. Finally, if you absolutely must do this, please discuss the relative impact of accidental disclosure of any NDAs currently in effect with a licensed attorney."
How do I communicate to a client that he's wasting time and money by using my services hourly vs. paying a monthly fee?,"One approach I've used in the past is to simply tell customers that I no longer provide this service at an hourly rate, but that I could provide ongoing support on a flat rate monthly basis. Then I explained what this new service includes. In my case, I offered a guaranteed response time of X days, bug fixes, and priority service whereby I drop other non-emergency work to take care of their emergencies.  I'd suggest doing something similar here. Something like: Starting in XXX month, I will no longer be providing hourly support for websites. Quite simply, I've found it is bad for my clients because they tend to focus on just the immediate need instead of thinking more strategically about how to protect their sites going forward. While this is good for me monetarily, I'd rather not profit from my customer's pain. Instead, I will be providing a flat rate monthly support package to clients. This will include the following: Based on your site's size and other needs, the rate I would charge you is: $XXX/month. Obviously, you will want to adjust the benefits as necessary. And you might not be comfortable with removing the hourly option. I can only tell you in my case, this was successful."
How to fire or salvage a problem client?,"Since you're asking the question, I think the answer in your case is fairly obvious. If they had not already crossed the line, you would not be asking this question. They have breached your contract and broken your trust to a point that you doubt the future of your relationship with them. That doubt and uncertainty can not be repaired except by them and you can not coerce them into repairing it. Threatening to drop them might get them to shape up for a little while, but I doubt it would be permanent. You also need to be consistent in enforcing the terms of the contract and in properly addressing breaches of it. Another consideration is that forgiving behavior can lead to a client who doesn't clearly understand the consequences. Since you've let small changes slide in the past, they may not realize that their contract is in jeopardy by requesting another small change. In other words, they might believe that you won't enforce the contract since you haven't yet enforced it - you've set a precedent. Also, in many jurisdictions a verbal contract is binding. So even if your paper contract and Scope of Work say one thing, if they verbally change it and you agree (or if you disagree or say nothing but still perform the work) it is legally the same as renegotiating your contract. These last two paragraphs probably don't change whether or not you should drop them as a client, but they may affect how you drop them. I am personally a little relaxed about the boundaries of a contract, but I've had people walk all over me because I didn't set expectations early on."
How do you explain to the computer illiterate what a web developer does?,"I think you should put limits on the explaining you do. If a customer does not value your service for what it is, you will run into trouble and discussions later on. If you are a new freelancer there is always the temptation to take every customer you can but sometimes it isn't worth it. I speak out of plenty of experience, unfortunately. That being said, use comparisons that they do understand.  Also, keep in mind that for some clients such a website builder may be exactly what they need. Some clients feel they need a web site because every one has one and no matter how hard you try they cannot be convinced of the added value. Send them to a nice website or hosting company that provides that service: they will be happy at first, when they discover they do need a real website they might come back. "
"The Freelance Lifestyle: How to manage travel, overtime, and family","It may very well be possible to negotiate the terms of the contract, depending on the type of work and your specific experience with that work. For instance, if the contract requires very specialized skills, skills that you happen to possess that are in high demand, you may have more room to negotiate. You could approach these organizations with an introductory letter, which outlines your skills and how you can help the organization.  Close the letter with a desire to meet via Google Groups or other video chat and discuss further. If you have a lot to offer, you could first see if your skills would be a good fit, and then -- unless they bring up the terms first -- mention that you're available to meet once a week/month, etc and can meet daily via a hangout. This process is sort of like a sales process. You may hear a lot of no's, but you may also gain some networking contacts or perhaps obtain referrals to other organizations that hire remote contractors. If the terms require that you be on-site, and you're willing to take one of these positions, make it clear in your contract that you'll bill for travel-related expenses in order to get you to and from work on the weekends so you'll have time for family.  Additionally, since we live in a world where we're all connected, you can also use technology to keep in touch with your family, perhaps even keeping a persistent video chat running while you're making dinner, relaxing, or just lounging around your quarters. Lastly, all contract work I've ever done has been remote. There are contracts out there that don't require you to work on-site, so if the on-site requirements take up too much of your time away from your family, then the answer may be to keep looking for something that fits your needs."
Client refusing to pay,"Be aware, even if you were to pursue something like small claims court and win, it's still your job to collect. A court won't collect for you. They merely allow you to legally pursue avenues of collection such as garnishment. Also be aware that there are filing fees which are generally $50-$100 so it'l cost you that to file a claim. Now, you can get that awarded back if you win.... if you win.... but it's going to cost you the filing fees up front. If you were to use something like a collection agency you'd be giving up a percentage of the whatever was collected. So you'll never gain the full $100 that way either and that's if the agency collects anything. For $100, I'd simply keep sending invoices every 15 days until the end of time or until I get paid. I find that for some stubborn clients the constant invoice becomes highly annoying to them and eventually they may pay to simply stop the invoices. Other avenues aren't really worth their cost to pursue. So chalk it up to a learning cost, be smarter about it next time, and move on. "
Should I remove my portfolio website from Google if it competes with the website I built for a client?,"I would not want to upset the client but a counter proposal might be appropriate where you can offer to do some more SEO work on the website to strengthen their position and add additional entries that will push down your own search result for the website! It might also be a temporary problem that fixes itself after a few weeks once the new website has more credibility. You could ask the client to adopt a wait and see attitude for a month or so and if the issue is still present, then offer to remove the link in the meantime."
"Should I charge my client the same rate for support services as I do for development, especially if I subcontract the support work?","Well there are 2 scenarios that I am aware of.  Large companies charge support A LOT meaning that 1 annual contract allow them to cover yearly costs of the project. But those are large companies.  I personally charge my regular work hours + 50%. For example, a client and myself reach a retainer agreement where I promise that I will reserve X work hours just for him in one year and any bug which appears, I will fix asap (a day or two if not immediately). If the client finds it expensive, then I ask him to contact me in case of problems but I will fix them when I have time (and charge my regular work hours).  Now, regardless of the fact you're subcontracting, you subcontractor has a job because of your client and your reputation is on the line, not his. That is why, it's absolutely fair to charge ""his rate x 2"" i.e. you earn the same as himself. You will soon realize that there is no such thing as ""not working anything"" when you're subcontracting. I found myself managing subcontracted project 8 hours a day. Just like I am coding it.  Now, the next point is sustainability of your business. You should charge as much as you can because you must keep the business going. It does not matter is you're charging 3 or 10 times more because there will be many situations where you will not be able to charge your client, but will have to pay subcontractor from your own pocket just to preserve your reputation.

How to backup declared income when the invoice is lost?,"With a good administration, this shouldn't be a problem. There are a few ways to save your invoices, and they're best used in combination with each other. Losing invoices is something that shouldn't happen with nowadays technology, and since everyone knows that, you won't be taken seriously if you do lose one, so don't lose them! That being said, what if your house (and all the houses where you have your backups) burn down? The best thing to do is what you already did: contact the client you send the invoice to. Calling works better than mailing.  There might also be a chance that you can find your invoice in your mail program, if you sent it digitally, or in the trash can of your computer. If you really can't get the original invoice back, see if you still have the offer if you made one and show that to your tax services. Otherwise, you might have a problem. Try telling the tax services you lost it, contacted the client but that he didn't reply yet, and offer them the contact information of your client if they want to check."
Best Way to Approach Billing with New Clients,"By all means offer them the choice of a monthly contract and bill accordingly and mention that's how you'd prefer to work.  You already know the downsides for the hourly billing so you should be able to communicate the advantages of monthly retainers to them in a way that looks advantageous to them. However, be prepared to be flexible to start with - the chances are that the construction company works with freelancers in a particular way that fits in with their finance workflow."
Are proposals and contracts the same thing?,"No.  A Contract is the terms and conditions you lay down, normally across all projects (it is often a generic document). A Proposal is job specific. It lays out what the project aims to achieve, the features it may have and timescales. The only variation is where the price is located. Some people put this in to the contract, however really it should be with the proposal so if the specification changes you can update the proposal and price without redoing the contract etc. I normally send them together so the client can have everything together. All legal bits, if you don't pay and so forth, should be in the contract. I also ask my clients to sign both documents when they are happy to proceed.  Just remember this: A proposal should do the selling (less is more!) and a contract is for all that extra stuff you have to say.

What to do when the client in proposal phase requests too much work? Should all our work during estimation be free?,"I do design/development of web sites, mainly WordPress based, and generally estimate a proposal--including client meeting, research and a draft of a contract--to take 4-5 hours of my time. How much I'm willing to go over that time depends on a few elements: Also, in most instances, my proposals and contracts are not specific about the technology I'll use to achieve an end (WordPress being an obvious exception and also if a client has a prior preference for an e-commerce solution), but am instead specific about what the end result will be (e.g., I commit to the fact that there will be a contact form in the site's footer, but not to whether we'll need to use a specific plugin or service to achieve that). I do this to specifically avoid the situation you're describing because: Based on what you've described, I think you need to be sure that you're not shutting down conversation with clients by refusing to do more research or adapt your proposals. Instead, you need to be more clear about what your proposals are and what your services are (i.e., differentiating between paying just for you to implement solutions vs. paying for you to be someone who solves problems) and be building the prospect's confidence that you're the person for the job."
What steps can I take to protect my reputation if my CV is plagiarised?,"This sort of behavior is a known problem, see Privacy Rights Clearinghouse 'Resume Database Nightmare: Job Seeker Privacy at Risk' One solution for the future may be to put a copyright notice on your CV, as recommended by 
'Let the resume wars begin' - Ask the Headhunter (Nick Corcodilos). Then you can use a simple DMCA takedown notice. (To my knowledge, job-boards will not accept CVs with copyright notices. But this is a plus, not a minus, since there are compelling reasons to avoid job boards, as per the article. One is to prevent stale copies of your resume being downlaoded, retained and passed off (sometimes years later) without your knowledge or consent - relevant to your issue here.) But obviously your immediate priority is to track down which source/job-board/recruiter this happened with. When you figure it out, let us know as a community service. We don't know who is actually behind it but whoever it is has been
  applying for roles using this CV. As for why, we have a hypothesis
  that it's a recruiter trying to get the inside track on active roles
  but this is only a hypothesis. Yeah that sounds plausible. It wouldn't make any sense that they were trying to harm you personally, just using you as fodder to get their foot in the door at new clients, and your reputation might get harmed in the process. But it's clueless and unethical. You may be able to get them blacklisted.
Presumably they hoax the email address to go to them, in which case you might be able to contact 'them' by email and then have proof they are doing this."
Does the clients have the rights to sue if I took too long (breach of contract)?,You gave them an estimate. Not a definite promised delivery date. So they can't claim that a longer timeline breaks your contract. They were free to pull the plug at any point. As long as you kept them in the loop. You produced a working demo/complete solution to what you were originally agreed to do. Mission accomplished. They changed their minds about goals when they talked to the second developer. It's not your fault that they didn't know what they really wanted when they gave you the go ahead. 2-3 day delay in correspondence for this kind of project is not a big deal (absent an agreement otherwise). Think they are just trying to scare you into giving them a refund that they know they aren't actually entitled to. They will look foolish for having paid twice to get their project done.
Project bigger than what was initially planned. How to tell the customer the higher price and different contract conditions?,"I agreed with the last poster mdomans. The first thing you must do is specifically identify and document that which you consider to be covered by your first contract, and that which you consider to be extra work beyond your original agreement. This is crucial so you know exactly what it is you feel you are owed or may be losing, beyond a general sense of ""hey, I'm working more hours than I was supposed to be on this deal."" If possible, it may help to put an actual dollar figure on the extra work if that can be calculated. Once you have the two separated and documented, you'll have a better and clearer idea of what it is you're actually talking about, how much you believe you are owed, or how much you may have cheated yourself out of. It may turn out that upon documenting it, it isn't as much as you believed it to be. However, if after separating and documenting you realize that you have cheated yourself out of just an unacceptable amount of time or money create an invoice. In the invoice include the documentation showing what you believe is beyond the scope of the first agreement, detailing hours, skills utilized beyond any covered by the first agreement, and exactly how you arrived at the ""extra"" number. Then simply send the client the documentation and invoice for the extra work.  It could be that the client is also aware of the fact that you have done an extraordinarily amount of work beyond the scope of your original agreement, and will take no issue with paying the extra cost for the extra services. For example, if they have requested for just an unreasonable or inordinate amount of changes and work-arounds, making the job a ""custom"" job rather than your ""standard"" services or job. Then the client should be reasonable and understand if not accept the fact that this is not what you've agreed to in the first agreement.   It could be that it is as you fear, and the client may say, ""Well, I didn't agree to that, so I am not paying that."" At which point, you can decide to either finish out the contract, but doing only that which you believe or can legally document to be a part of the first agreement. If the client wishes to have extra services, then it is only fair that they pay extra money. If they have an issue with that, they may turn out to be the sort of people you do not want to do business with after all.  While some may say this approach to be jarring to the client. However, this plan of action is legal, to the point, is the quickest way to both draw a line in the sand, as well as making sure the practice gets nipped in the bud asap. If you play it out in your head, almost any other scenario ends up with you just having to not only forfeit the extra work you've already done, but then being the clients whipping boy for the remainder of the contract. If you think you feel cheated now, imagine how you'll feel having to continue finishing out the contract having to continue to do all that free extra work. At the very least, the path I have laid out opens the door for not having to continue to do extra work for free going forward. This is because after fully explaining to the client exactly what you believe to be covered by your original agreement, and that which you wish to incorporate into a new agreement, if the client is completely unreasonable you have a fall back position. The fall back position is to tell the client, ""Well, I will finish out my obligation to you, but only my obligation. Going forward any extra services, will unfortunately require extra charges to you. The reason being I simply can no longer sustain the continued extra demands on my time and energies, without being compensated for that extra time and demands you are requesting from me."" Please update this blog when you get a chance, and let all know what you ended up doing, and how it turns out for you. Good luck."
Freelance sites specializing in quick turn-around? [closed],"Not sure you're going to find any sites that specialize in both on-demand style jobs (quick start to completion time), and require a specialized skill (meaning they pay what you seem to want).  For example, Amazon Turk offers jobs you could probably do right now, but they're jobs pretty much anyone can do, so the pay is next to nothing.  Your're probably better off to find clients, not sites that routinely have short jobs in a queue waiting to be done.  Many of my clients tend to be long term - not that the project necessary lasts a long time, but they keep an open contract and request work as needed. Your situation would be similar, just the other way around (you contacting them when you have some free time). I'll assume you're looking in the web design / development field. If you are, my guess is that design / development shops (more than one person shops) likely have jobs in a queue that they could pass to a freelancer, assuming the freelancer was willing to spend some time upfront to learn how the show manages work, the tools they use, etc. Advertising firms could also be a place to looks (to the extent they do work in-house)."
Should client requirements be included in a contract?,"As always it depends.  This is not legal advice.  I am not a lawyer.  However I also think that if you have to go to court, you have already lost more than you will get back.  The most important purpose of a contract, IMO, is that it provides a joint reference for expectations.  Keep in mind that typically a work agreement (contract or set of contracts) is going to consist of essentially two parts: I personally like to keep these separate.   This means a basic work contract does not include client needs, but the whole bid/approval process does.  This has a few benefits: It keeps lawyers on both sides focused purely on terms of doing business, not on reviewing scope of work, and This helps ensure that additional changes to scope are easier to approve. Now typically a contract is considered to have a number of essential elements and may be explicit or implied.  These may vary by jurisdiction but typically involve an offer for an exchange, an acceptance of that offer, and a general agreement on what was offered. So my preferred approach is to include in the contract a section which just notes that scope of work will be provided by the customer, and bids will be dependent on that scope, and that changes to scope may involve additional fees. Then the bidding process can be incorporated by reference. Remember also that it is not uncommon for a given piece of work to be governed by a series of contracts, including non-disclosure agreements, work contracts, and the bidding/order process.  There isn't anything necessarily wrong with keeping these separate, particularly if the people who need to review changes to different pieces are different people.  For example the lawyers don't want to be called in because the customer wants a little more done. So as a summary you want to think about how a given document fits into the rest of the process.  There may be many more contracts that cover a given piece of work and these may be explicit (an NDA) or implied (offer/acceptance of a bid).  Hope this helps."

Is it convenient for me as a freelancer to ask for Amazon gift cards as payments?,"If you are asking about the convenience for companies in the United States of America some may have issues with sending gift cards for fear of possible IRS ramifications. I had once asked a similar question and that was the response I had received. It would also depend on the size of the company you work for. You are more likely to get paid in gift cards if the business is sole proprietor or small group.  Although still in its infancy, and depending on its legal status in your country, Bitcoin or other digital currency may be an option. Imho, nothing compares to the ease and quickness which it can transfer wealth. Either way It doesn't (shouldn't) hurt to ask. Unless of course it may be perceived as a tax dodge of some sort."
What Are These People Trying To Accomplish With This Scam?,"It's way to build ""fake"" reputation by completing your own jobs. That way it looks like one is well seasoned, has been very successful, and has made clients happy on the crowdsource site even though they really haven't. It's also a way for banned/disallowed individuals to use the site through you... making you liable for any actions they take on the site. It's a retake on the... ""here, I have this check but no bank account. If you cash it for me, you can keep 10%."" You cash it, give the person their 90%... and then the check bounces and you are out all the money. It's just a scam.. ignore it and move on. Nothing beneficial to YOU will be found in their proposal."
How close do end client work locations need to be to fall foul of the 24 month travel and subsistence rule?,"HMRC consider the City to be a single location.  In fact, the rule is considered to apply where the journey to work is broadly the same. This rule is modified where the employee works at a succession of
  workplaces but the change of workplace has no substantial effect on
  the employee's journey to work. All such workplaces are treated as the
  same workplace for the purpose of the legislation See HMRC's Status Manual for more info In your case, assuming your journey is via rail then underground into zone 1, then the existing interpretation suggests a single continuing period, irrespective as to your exact destination. Of course, the 24 month rule only applies if you spend more than 40% of your working time on that site (or collection of neighbouring sites)."
How I can be hidden from my current working company?,"You have multiple options.  Go incognito with fake name. Create your iOS identity as ""John"" and be known as John without telling anyone your real name. Some clients may not like this and the morality of this step is questionable. also it may be almost impossible to be accepted to freelancer websites as all the good ones will request you submit your ID when creating a new profile.  Freelancer sites like Upwork usually offer private profile. It means that you will be hidden from searches and anyone directly accessing your profile, EXCEPT those clients you previously worked for and those clients whose jobs you have applied to.  Now, how good or bad this is, it's really questionable. Many freelancers do this. The reasons are either honest or dishonest. I guess if you are good in what you do, I don't have to know you're Max since John has done pretty good job. I may be angry or suspicious if I want to hire you full-time and I see that you sent ID as Max. 
In my case, if your incognito reasons are sound, I would not mind you being incognito. After all, I never hire Max or John, but the ""guy whose iOS skills are superb"".  In the end, it's all up to you. For every 10 people that question incognito step, you will find 10 honest people who have their own justified reasons to be incognito. "
How to get work on freelancer.com as an existing contractor but new to freelancer.com?,"My answer would be to start with a 20-30$ project and offer it to do for 10$.

And secondly when you apply for the job make sure you just don't say that you have experience in blah blah fields etc.No one is interested to hear about your qualifications,they want real work,so instead just show them   links to the screenshots of the similar work you have done in that field.......

How do companies sustain by working on freelancing sites?,"Peter, To answer your question, the guys who are using actually using the bid sites aren't the same guys who end up doing the work -- not if they're trying to run things as a multi-person business. Yes, someone from the company has to FIND the work.  Let's say this person finds a gig worth $25000.  They evaluate the job, and determine that it's feasible.   Okay, then somebody has to finance the work.  Computer equipment and networking.  Internet access.  Development tools.  Office space.  Utilities.  That person with the money isn't necessarily the person that finds the job.  Then somebody has to find the talent to do the work. Then somebody has to manage the talent to do the work, and will probably liaison with the client. Oh, and of course there are the people doing the work. So the person who finds the work must understand that he can't have the whole $25000 to himself, because he can't do it ALL.  Possible, but cutting corners can be quite impractical in the end."

How should I deal with a client who refuses to pay after receiving the finish product?,"Yes, it is definitely unethical.   You do have other options. You could: Do nothing.  Just take the loss and treat it as a learning experience.  Next time you will know to never give the client the finished website until they have paid in full.  Always host the site on your own servers during development and only transfer the site to the client's servers when they have paid all or most of the agreed price. Continually remind the client that payment is due.  Send overdue invoice reminders every two weeks.  I think this works better with paper invoices, but sometimes with small amounts, clients get annoyed at the hassle and pay the invoice just to make the annoyance go away.  But given that the client did give vague reasons for non payment and not just tell you to get lost, they may eventually pay up. Remove only your work from his servers.  You should not delete anything without having a backup, and you should definitely not touch anything that is not your work.  If your work is now entwined with work done by others then you don't have this option.  I don't really recommend this, but if you do it, you must let him know that you have taken the site down and that you will restore it as soon as he pays what he agreed to.  Do not try to extort any ""extra"" from him.  What you are trying to do is recreate what should have happened in the first place, namely that your site does not get onto his server until you are paid in full.   Even if the client has behaved unprofessionally, that is no reason for you to do so also.   My recommendation is to persist in asking for payment for a while, but to treat this as a lesson and move on.  Be glad it was only for a small amount, and that you now know better how to protect yourself in the future."
How to explain to client their other freelancer is incompetent?,"Short answer, you don't.  Longer answer ... Speaking poorly of other freelancers will reflect more upon you than on them. Yes, that seems backwards, but it's not. If you complain about other people it is you who will gain a reputation as being difficult or not being a ""team player"". You're the squeaky wheel who will garner all the bad attention... not the other person. When dealing with tasks that are incomplete or incorrect. Merely explain to the client, ""I'll have to repair the issues with A in order to implement B."" ... or... ""Unfortunately, the way A is constructed, it won't be compatible when we build B. So, I'll need to rewrite A from the ground up."" The gist is.. .you detail the work you need to redo, fix, or otherwise address. You do not state anything about who completed the work or your opinion about anyone else or their competency. Stick to strict facts about the work. Essentially act as if someone you don't know is doing the other work. All criticism should be about the work itself. An astute client will eventually see that you are rewriting or fixing a lot of items inevitably costing them more money. Just keep records of why things are incorrect and why they need reworked.  Only ever mention ""John"" or his competency if the client directly asks you pointed questions regarding him and his abilities. As for the emotional aspect, just be grateful that ""John"" is creating more billable hours for you and improving your income. You shouldn't be frustrated, you should be happy to earn more."
How to manage project requests from clients who offer partnerships?,"I get many requests of this nature as others have mentioned and most of the time I tended to follow the advice given here about how best to say no to these project requests. However, 18 months' ago I was approached by 3 partners who were looking for a fourth to deliver a new startup idea. It was the usual approach of offering equity due to them having no money. After careful consideration, instead of turning them down I actually decided to proceed with this one for these reasons: These sort of projects can work if you have another primary source of income that can support you whilst you effectively work 2 jobs and there are lower expectations around the time it will take you to deliver a working system. It also helps if the person with the idea understands how to make the project successful after you have fulfilled your end of the bargain. If they don't have experience within the site's target industry that would be a red flag for me. The project is now live and going through a round of beta testing. In short, don't just let the client sell you the dream - look beyond that and examine the reality. If they've put significant work into how they might realise that dream and are not just expecting you to do all the work and make them loads of money, then it might be worth deeper discussion with them. Just don't be strong-armed into a partnership that you aren't getting a fair deal on. "
New project manager suddenly demanding source-code prior to payment,"IANAL, nor any form of professional regarding law, let alone Australian law. However, from what I've found from a quick google of Australian copyright law, it seems to conform with most copyright laws throughout the US and EU. Therefore I can only assume that transfer of ownership works similarly. With this assumption, you still seem to be the owner of those binaries. So if the worst comes, you should be able to obtain compensation for the work from a small claims court (Whether that is worth it or not is entirely your decision).  As mentioned by cdkMoose in the comments, see a lawyer before considering action. Also, whilst the independence of each contractor's work seems to keep the situation from becoming complicated, it's worth mentioning that a situation with multiple contractors could complicate the situation, this would further warrant the need for a legal professional to keep you in the clear when dealing with the situation. Though once again i'm not a lawyer or law professional and therefore the advice above should be taken with a grain of salt. Regarding current affairs, I wouldn't hesitate in sending an email to Person A regarding the matter as Person B has already made his intentions clear and it is unlikely you'll get anywhere swiftly on negotiations with him. Though I would advise toning down your email rather than a passive aggressive jab at Person B as this is unlikely to go far. Instead raise the issue as needed  Hi Person A, As to my knowledge there is still an outstanding invoice regarding
  Work, If there are any issues regarding payment, please keep me
  informed so that we can come to a compromise and get this issue
  resolved as soon as possible. The invoice has been discussed with Person B, however there has been
  no progression regarding payment. I will be happy to provide the
  source code as soon as payment has been made, as per our usual
  agreement. Kind Regards, This is a fairly poor draft but could easily be improved to fit the situation, and I feel it points out the key parts without so obviously taking a stab at person B. Whilst you may want to bring Person B to attention and take a good stab at him, remaining professional will allow you to be quite smug. If the situation goes your way, then he will likely feel belittled by Person A's payment and dismissal of Person B's demands; If not, then do not provide the source code until payment has been made, as at the moment you are in the favourable position. You hold the source code, as well as copyright ownership on the unpaid binaries they possess (especially if it's deployed to users and making them money). as a quick reminder: I'm not a lawyer or legal professional and I urge you to take any legal advice here with a grain of salt as it can be difficult enough to keep up with legislation and laws regarding my own country, let alone Australia's law."
Rude and confusing client but possible important job,"He said he wanted to talk about the website. We agreed to contact again the week after to fix a meeting date and hour. This didn't exactly happen, did it?  You drove across town, and back, to sit with this guy for twelve minutes.  He didn't care at all about your time.  But what's worse is that instead of going down a course - prescribed by you - of getting a new project, you allowed him to dominate the meeting after having had to chase him down to even get an audience with him. What's worse is that you didn't meet him in a situation where he would be required to vest his time in the same manner as you, i.e. at a coffee shop or rented meeting room.  So he had the advantage in getting you to his office and dismissing you quickly.  He never had to leave his seat to do a thing, but YOU did. Now, THINK AHEAD. With this client, you're going to be chasing him down for requirements, to sign off on work, and to get paid.  So far, his behavior shows that he is inconsiderate and doesn't feel accountable at all for making promises to you and then breaking them (in your example, he's done this twice). Unless you are desperate - which he is hoping for - run away fast."
How to deliver licensed software to client,"If YOU own the code, then YOU are the only one who gets to keep the source code.  Clients get installation files, compiled or otherwise.  And a written licensing agreement that asserts your rights over the product and says what they can and cannot do with those install files.  Don't skimp on the licensing part - write it once, write it well, and then you can reuse it later for other projects.   Especially if your work is plain text script, don't skimp on the licensing agreement. There is nothing to prevent your work from being copied and shared in that case, but without a stringently worded license, you may find you have a hard time making a case for compensation if you find your work has been stolen.  Wouldn't hurt to also have at least a few files embedded with steganographic information as well.  It's hard for a dishonest person to later prove their assertion that ""it's all MY work!"" when decoded key files in the application show your copyright declaration.   :-) "
Is it good to leave a job to start freelancing?,"Plain and simple....  If you don't have 6 months to 1 year of savings to live off of, you aren't adequately prepared to start freelancing full time. You can do it part time and keep your job. However, until you are prepared to live, without income, for several months you aren't ready for full time freelancing. And this is how you prepare for ""no work"" periods."
Is it ok to communicate with client only through email?,Okay? That's 80-90% of my client communication.  It's perfectly fine to communicate through email. But I do have a few suggestions:
By how much can you increase your rate if the work is urgent?,"It's not uncommon for freelance developers to charge double-time for last minute, urgent items. In fact, I recommend it. As freelancers, we often get 'last minute urgent work' through no fault of our own. In effect, charging a premium for 'urgent' work is a good way to train clients to respect your worth and your time - but also provide an option that will remunerate you properly for effectively putting your life on hold to focus on their urgent project."
How to work with a micro-manage client,"Sometimes the money is not worth it. I offer discounted prices for well-behaved clients, and I overcharged the ones that are, well, no good people. Here's how you've got to look at it, the client is paying for you, which means that every resource he asks for that you need to use, has to be paid for. Is he paying for your blogging skills only? I don't think so. He also has to pay for your patience, for 24/7 support, for being rude, for being demanding. You don't need to fire the client, you just need to put a price on the job. Support is handled by email. Does he want to instant message you on whatsapp/telegram/ig/sms/whatever? it costs extra Does he want you to be available 24/7? it costs extra! It's called premium support. Charge for it.
If the client pays, I bet you will be happy to answer him late at night! Now just take that logic and apply to everything that annoys you in a client. Extra reviews? Extra money Extra meetings? Extra money You are not an employee, if something it's not on paper, on a contract or written email agreement, then you don't have to do it. Learn to say no and learn to negotiate those terms."
"What are the pros and cons of having fewer, smaller projects compared to larger, bigger projects?","Note that there is a distinction between ""project"" and ""client"". Large clients can have small projects and vice versa.  More/Smaller Clients:  Pros include: Cons include: Fewer/larger clients: Flip the above, plus add the Pro that larger clients offer potentially greater opportunity for finding additional projects within the same client. For your specific question, I would prefer 3 x $10,000. Your project portfolio is still diversified and your project management / administration overhead is reduced. And either of the two options you mentioned is MUCH better, IMO, than a single $60,000 project. Large projects are nice for cash flow, but you can get buried in the project and lose your marketing edge... remember the old consultant's dilemma: ""If you're billing, you're not selling; and if you're selling, you're not billing!"" Striking the right balance is important for long-term success. FYI, I've been an independent consultant since 1979."
Employer Via Freelancing Platform Threatening To Take Legal Action Against Me,"Sounds like you're using Upwork? If not, let me know and I'll adjust this. Personally, I've been using Upwork for over a year and pretty much stopped using it because of low-quality clients. If there was no issue with your work during the development process and the client was able to see your work and then all of a sudden is not happy, that's a little suspicious. Unless, they're not satisfied with what's happened since the most recent billing period. This client may be happy but may want to keep the work and make back the payment so, in essence, you worked for free. Nevertheless You are paid for your time especially during hourly contracts. You're paid $x/hour for your expertise and skill. You provided a service, even if it wasn't completely up to the clients expectations - you put in the time and your time is worth something. I've been threatened a lawsuit or two in my time and have always been able to resolve the situation but I am not promising that your situation won't escalate. Ask the client for specifics as to why they're not happy, why they didn't bring up issues earlier, etc. This can all be used to call BS or as evidence later on. If they don't want you to fix anything then remove your work. I would tell them that I'm sorry they're unhappy with my work and that I'll refund them x% (I did this once and gave back 50%) but that I will be removing my work as they're not happy with it and I don't want to leave them with low-quality work or with work that was done but not technically paid for (because of the refund). Here's the thing about legal action - no one is safe. I could sue you because you missed a comma in your question or claim you keyed my car. I could bring it to court as well (more than likely would be thrown out). Anyone can sue anyone for anything. If things do escalate then you need to be prepared to build a case. Save all work hours, save all communications through all methods, have proof of work, etc. STAY PROFESSIONAL Through ALL communication stay professional, helpful, calm, and don't use profanity. If none of this works and they decide to proceed with a lawsuit Let the client know you're prepared to defend yourself. This had a client back off of a lawsuit from me once: I have X which proves you had no problem with the work after seeing it multiple times. Y shows communication between us that I offered to fix the problem but you wanted to keep my work and get a full refund. I'm not a lawyer but you may want to research one."
When should you discuss getting paid?,Estimating and consulting are absolutely billable. If you're making an estimation and they're holding the other freelancer to that estimate then you've already provided them with tangible value. Before you continue meeting or talking further about the project you should schedule a meeting or at least send an email stating that the rate and the terms need to be ironed out. If you feel like you are beyond that point then you should take the initiative and send them a proposal that they should review and sign before anything moves forward. The benefit of this is since they've completely danced around the issue you can control the terms.
Why create invoice as a freelancer,"It's not about advantages, it is about law and also about your clients."
How to find someone to handle customer/commercial relationships on my behalf? (I'm a programmer),"So much to address here... First off, NO. You don't need a PR person on full-time to help you. You need to deal with your own situation before you bring more people in. Freelancing should make you more money than being a regular full-time employee, punching in and out everyday."
Free support after selling a project,"I typically offer free support on a software development project for 60 or 90 days after the project goes live. After that, I offer fixed-fee monthly support to clients. This support includes bug fixes, answering questions and general troubleshooting via email. I generally find that my customers appreciate knowing that they can call and I won't be starting a stop watch for billing purposes. (The price depends on the size of the app I am supporting and how quickly they will typically need a response.)"
Disadvantages to incorporation/forming an LLC?,"LLC disadvantages vs. sole proprietorship: Government fees to establish and maintain the LLC (usually $100-$500 first year and up to $100 subsequent years, depending on your state). Paperwork to to establish and maintain the LLC. However, in some states, this is nearly zero - just a few minutes of filling out government web forms. That's it. Taxes are the same if you choose pass-through taxation. Keeping separate bank accounts is a good idea to maximize liability protection, but is not required. Incorporation disadvantages vs. sole proprietorship: Same as LLC (government fees and paperwork), except much more extensive. Additionally, accounting regulations and taxes could be worse, depending on the type of corporation you choose. These disadvantages were the motivation for the invention of LLCs.

Donating my work to charitable organizations without incuring legal liability?,"bill my work as usual, let them pay me and donate the money back to them Yes, would be possible, but it would be weird if you agreed on that in a contract. If you don't agree on that in the contract, the charity could hesitate before working with you because they can't be sure they get their money.
Furthermore, when you agree on this, the charity needs some liquidity, which it doesn't always have. don't create a bill at all? Possible, but then it's going to look like volunteering. With a bill, you agree on what work has to be done before you do it. Without, the charity can ask for more, you can suddenly disagree... a bill creates clarity for both parties. create a bill with 100% discount (sum=0)? Yes, this is the way to go. You won't have to pay taxes over €0,- and there's clarity for both parties. Of course, when you are familiar with the organizations, there's no problem with informally agreeing on donating back or not creating a bill at all. But when you don't know them or they don't know you, a bill creates clarity. Also, with 100% discount the charity can be sure of not paying."
Is it required to register under any authorities to work as a freelancer?,"If you are in India - then no, there is no legal requirement for you to register yourself as a freelancer. However, if you are directly involved with Govt. contracting then you must hold a valid Govt. issued license. As of your income, you must pay your income taxes regardless. If you are getting paid directly to your bank account then it would be good to find out if it is TDS i.e. Tax Deducted at Source. This means that appropriate taxes were deducted  (and paid on your behalf to the Govt.) before the monies were paid to you. If it is not, then it is your responsibility to pay your taxes at the end of the financial year (i.e. March for India). For freelancing in other countries, you will face numerous restrictions (almost 95% countries in the world) due to immigration reasons. The reason is that freelancing is considered to be self employment and those countries allow self employment for citizens or naturalized citizens only.  For example, if you move to America in a work/non-immigrant visa (H1/L1 etc.) you will and must be employed by an employer at all times and get monthly paychecks. Also, based on the kind of non-immigrant visa you hold, you may or may not be legally allowed to change employers (example L1 visa holders cannot change their L1 visa holding employer whereas an H1 visa holder can). You will not be allowed to do any kind of work that can be considered as self employment until you obtain naturalization through an immigrant visa application which could take 5 to 10 years (for Indians and Chinese citizens specifically, since they are exempt from visa lottery) depending upon various situations. There are various ways an immigrant visa can be filed and in your case the most probable method would be employer based, where your employer would need to file your non immigrant work permit or naturalization.  European countries also impose several such limitations to non-immigrant applicants. That is, until you obtain a legal immigrant status you would be limited in terms of self employment. European visas are points based and there are numerous criteria to fulfill to gather appropriate points for filing a visa (just an FYI)  As of your question, once you immigrate to a different country (i.e. become a naturalized citizen) your records will be tracked by their Labor Departments automatically since your application for immigration will most likely need labor department's approval (better known as ""DOL"" or ""Department or Labor/Labour""), so there may not be a legal need for you to register yourself as a freelancer/self employed thereafter. However, some countries may indeed require you to register yourself with an additional public or private licensing body for you to be able to legally perform freelancing or start a business. Although, a small subset of countries such as Bhutan, Nepal etc. may allow you to work there as freelancer without any necessary documentation but for a limited period of time (This applies to Indian Citizens only). While it is not legally required for you to be registered as a Freelancer in India, it may not be a bad idea for you to be associated with a more larger professional group of freelancers. If you intend to move to another country and continue freelancing, and since freelancing is treated as self employment, you might need to acquire appropriate work authorization or even naturalization or citizenship of that country through an immigrant visa process or other legal procedures authorized by local laws.

Can I start doing work before my LLC paperwork has run through to completion?,"No, you cannot start working and billing under the name of a legal entity that does not (yet) exist.  You can certainly start work on the project, but as of now, you are still working as a sole proprietor. You would not be covered under any of the legal protections provided by the LLC. And you cannot retroactively claim the work was done ""under the corporation"" after the fact when the legal corporation is finally formed. That would be like taking out insurance after the event already happened."
How Should I Track/Group Receipts and Expenses as a Freelancer?,"I am going to go over some basics of expense categorization with a UK flavor.  The same applies generally elsewhere.  Note that your second question, what can or cannot be claimed as deductions on taxes is something that is quite subject to change, and basically you can loosely follow accounting sites and talk with a tax accountant once a year to make sure.  Also regarding time commitments of being a  parent, I totally understand (I have three kids). Chart of Accounts Setup The chart of accounts is basically a system for categorizing income, expense, cash, obligations, etc. This is a critical task but it only needs to be done once.  You will want to hire an accountant to help you with it, but since it is your business you should understand at least the basics of what is going on. Questions like this are one reason I recommend that all freelancers have basic familiarity with accounting and bookkeeping practices.  You will probably want to hire an accountant for additional advice through this process of setting up your books, but you can do your books by yourself once things are set up.  If you get a decent double entry accounting program, you should be able to do most of what you need just through entering vendor and sales invoices, so I don't see a major reason to hire someone to do this on an ongoing basis (aside from tax preparation) since you probably would want to be in the loop anyway. In general though in most places and times expenses necessary to realize revenue may be deducted.  Without such a rule, mapping financial accounting to tax accounting ends up being a real mess.  There are some exceptions in most places though so this is a place to get some advice (for example in the US, iirc and I am not a CPA, if you claim real costs for meals while travelling on business, you can only deduct half of the cost there on the theory that otherwise you would have had to eat non-deductable food anyway).  This is something to talk with an accountant about. Most countries have some sort of recognized categorization of expenses in income tax reporting, and this is generally where to start.  Some countries, like Canada, formalize this under a system like GIFI (Generalized Index of Financial Information), but even where this is not formalized as such usually tax forms will have some categorization of expenses you are expected to report to, so you want to start by looking at tax forms.  If you have an accounting system that supports GIFI (LedgerSMB does), you can set up your codes to match tax reporting categories and this simplifies things a bit even if your country does not use GIFI as such (neither the UK nor the US do).  Don't worry about this too much.  Just look at the tax forms and see if there are any requirements for breaking things down.  Actually setting up GIFI codes is an optional step but it simplifies tax reporting and lends some clarity to the process. Once you have a good idea of where these are, and any exceptions to the all business expenses general view, then you can set up your ""Chart of Accounts.""  A chart of accounts has basically two parts and five major divisions.  The first part tracks operational resources and commitments (assets and liabilities) and the second part tracks owners' interests (income, expense, and equity).  We are focusing here on expense reporting.  Expenses represent a decrease in your ownership of the business through routine operations.  You want to track these based on two criteria: How do these map to tax reporting categories?  You want to avoid accounts which cross tax reporting categories generally.  It is easier to fill out a tax form by adding the totals from two accounts than it is to go through one account to figure out what goes in which category. Is there anything that must be tracked relative to everything in an income account (this is a question to ask your accountant if you don't already know the answer)? In general getting the chart of accounts setup right will save you a lot of work going forward.  One thing I will note is that the more financially knowledgeable my colleagues and clients are, the more likely they are to get accountants involved in this process at this stage. Best Bookkeeping Practices Once your chart of accounts is set up, you have your basic categories set up, and a decent piece of accounting software installed, you can categorize your receipts quick and easily.  This is mostly basic data entry but some importance to detail is important.  A typical way to do this is to have two folders for the current year (and one for each prior year where you are saving receipts).  Receipts go into one folder, and get moved to the other once entered into the accounting software.  I like to try to do this once per day. It usually only takes a couple minutes.  Fire up the software, enter the receipts, close it. When entering receipts there are a couple of practices I like to recommend that will save you a lot of headache.  The first is you want to to enter and track the invoice number from each receipt (the UK I believe has a requirement for invoices to be uniquely numbered).  In the event you are travelling somewhere without such a requirement and you get an invoice without such a number, you want to have a convention that allows you to go from the computer record back to the original receipt in the event of an audit.  Something like M (for manually generated)-YYYY-MM-DD (representing the date) is not a bad idea.  However write this on the back of the receipt so you have record of what the number was. Like so much else, keeping the time minimal in this is mostly about set-up (get the help of an accountant here), and about routine.  If you get these taken care of, tracking receipts should not take significant time."
How to prepare for freelancing?,"I've got 20+ years consulting within IT behind me so I would hope that counts for something. Hopefully a prior answer I supplied might help:
https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/8576/how-to-build-a-startup-freelance-software-qa-in-the-us/8585#8585 I recommend getting a year or two in a full time job first. Anyone can work in a bar or restaurant, but the best make the biggest tips. If the food and drink being served stays the same, and the location is the same, the ability to provide good customer service will be the key difference. So... while you might think you can code, successful consulting means you need to know how to sell yourself, regularly, you need know how to work well with others in stressful possibly politically unfriendly situations. College/school teaches you lots - I respect what you have attained so far, but you will have to learn and adapt new environments and new skills every day for the rest of your life. Best of luck"
"Is outsource.com a good place to find a job, or is it a scam?","I've been a freelancer on Outsource.com for a few months and have actually had some success.  I've been hired twice so far.  It's a different setup from other sites... you pay a subscription fee to get quotes and message clients, but there aren't any service fees so it's up to you to do a good job marketing yourself.  Since they are new, there aren't swarms of freelancers to compete with and because of the subscription fee, you don't see people quoting unreasonably low. Not sure what the site will be like once they get a lot more freelancers on, but right now I'm going to keep at it."
Cancelling a project on a client,"Conor, Looks as if you've kind of blew it on this one.  When a client reserves the right to make changes to requirements, then you CAN'T do fixed price and expect to make a profit. Your only saving grace might be that you've set milestones, thereby making portions of the project severable.  If I were you, I'd turn over the work for the first milestone, if it's done, and keep your payment for the same (which you've already received).  For anything beyond that, either negotiate hourly terms or drop out."
Company stability,"I don't really see any options other than target a different market. Start selling to smaller companies. Build your business. Once you do that, the concerns of the large corporations will be reduced. They want to protect their ass. You're not going to trick them. Build a business, then grow into the enterprise market."
Copyright on freelance work,"In our line of work we sell two things: We use the first approach when it's unlikely that we can market the same work to other interested parties because of its uniqueness.  We hand it off.  The client can use it, or flush it down the toilet.  We've been paid in a 1:1 ratio for our time vs the work product, and the client owns it.  We assume no risk other than not being paid for our time. We use the second approach when it's a lot more likely that we can market the same work to other interested parties.  (Think of Itunes, or app stores, or even the 'old' music business).  We are betting on spreading our production cost out over lots and lots of purchasers.  If we can earn more than our production cost, that's great -- but just to break even is a great achievement.  Often with this approach, we assume all the risk (in other words, work for free) and earn money only through licensing. I don't think any client will be willing to pay you for full development cost AND licensing that you're going to offer to other parties as well (namely, the client's competitors). You'll have to decide on whether this opportunity is your Sure Thing before you even think about a licensing approach, because you may end up losing your shirt in the process."
Is making a connection on a networking website such as LinkedIn a good first step?,"A better approach than simply sending a connection request directly to a potential client is to find a common connection that you both have, who you can ask to forward an introduction to your client-in-waiting. That way you can compose an introductory message that explains why it would be valuable to the client to create a connection with you.  Provided that you are no more than 3 connections away from the client, LinkedIn will give you the option of making an Introduction Request through any of your connections that can pass the message through to the client. This approach has the added advantage that you are being referred to the client (if your request gets that far!) by one of their trusted connections. Of course, there is a real possibility that one of the connections in the chain might choose to simply ignore the request to forward. This approach would be better suited to being a single connection away from the client (i.e. they are a 2nd degree contact) so as to minimise that risk."
Community for freelance webmasters who want to make portfolio with non-profit projects?,"I spent a good amount of time looking into this and there doesn't appear to be any general ""community"" where non-profits and volunteers interact (no less one specialized in websites). I couldn't even find a general community where volunteers interacted with other volunteers. There are some specialized forums for specific groups. But, there are a number of resources that bring volunteers and non-profits together. This information tends to be U.S. centric. That wasn't my intention, it's just what I was able to find. None of these resources are centered around technology, but you can find 100's of listings from non-profits looking for website help.

"Client hasn't responded to invoice, company has potentially conflicting policies on when to pay contractors, unsure what to do","It sounds like your contract isn't as explicit as it should be regarding payment. If this is the case, you need to use that to your advantage by using any leverage you hopefully have. If you can withhold delivery, that is your leverage. Do NOT give it away for nothing - especially not promises. If at all possible contract-wise, state that no more work will be performed until the first invoice is paid. In addition, the second (and presumably final?) invoice must be paid in full before final delivery. This may sour the client relationship - but if they really complain, they were probably never going to pay you. Going forward, explicitly specify how payment happens; ideally in a way both parties will find reasonable."
What are some approaches for identifying your ideal customer?,"The first time I got this question, I was completely stuck. My stuttering answer was: ""someone who pays me on time"". Ugh.

Eventually I figured out that for me these attributes were irrelevant. Instead I tried to broaden my thinking in terms of client attributes. Consider these basic attributes that will apply to most clients: Think about the people you will work with inside the organization as well, and their attributes: Depending on what you do, you may also consider your ideal project with attributes like: You may not have opinions on all these things, but try to pick one extreme or the other as much as possible. As you said, you want to identify your ideal client to develop more effective marketing, but you will often end up with clients that are close to your ideal client but not exactly meeting the criteria. Also, let bad experiences guide you. If you had a bad experience with a client once, think about their attributes and consider choosing an opposite attribute for your ideal client.  Depending on your business, there will likely be other attributes that are relevant to you. For me, type of technology, and the tools that will be used are relevant.  Here is an example of my current ideal client (excluding technical stuff): For me, this really helped because I now have a clear picture in my head of the kind of businesses and people I want to work with, and I can tell fairly quickly if a project isn't right for me because they will miss on multiple criteria."
How should I determine whether to charge my client for converting iOS 6 app to iOS 7 app?,"If I'm working hourly, this is a simple answer: talk to my client, let them know how big the changes are expected to be, and charge for my time if the client gives the go-ahead. If I was working on a fixed price, I would look at my contract. If it doesn't mention this case, I'd figure out what I want to do (either answer has pros and cons) and update my contract immediately. Then I'd do the update since it was my fault for not specifying. When working mobile you need to figure out how far back you support, and what you do if a new version drops during development and spell that out in the contract. The same applies to web developers and browser versions. Be willing to bend on it (""I REALLY need this to work in IE 6"" is an acceptable response from them, but it opens up the dialogue of how much extra money you get to charge to make that happen), but be clear where the lines are drawn."
What to do when a client cancels project 1 day before delivery?,"First off, I'm sorry to hear of your endeavor and that you had to deal with a nightmare client like that. I think we've all been there at least twice. Now then, hindsight is 20/20, so let's be proactive. The worst client a freelancer can encounter is hard to shove into one box as they come in all kinds. To name a few, there is the waffler, the procrastinator, the bargain shopper, the know-it-all, and a dozen or so others. However, the end result is typically the same. The project goes over budget and over deadline due to the dreaded ""Scope-Creep"". No matter how you might try to keep these wishy-washy, impossible-to-please project killers in-line and on-task the decisions get delayed and you end up either waiting for them to deliver their content, or to even answer an email, yet one thing never fails to hit on time...The deadline and their criticism of your missing it (even though they were the reason why the project is stalled). But, here are the facts: or  You can use your time wisely, provided you have documentation you have the right to take her to court and attempt to collect. Depending on the cost of your contract and the percentage of work you've actually completed* along with your local laws will determine whether you're heading to small claims court or a civil trial court.  However, the simple fact you're asking us here would lead me to believe that you have a somewhat more vague contract. So, in my experience your only recourse in this situation is to: There are a number of sites out there with templates for writing a letter to demand payment in full for services rendered. Moving forward, it would be best for you to use a stronger proposal & separate contract that states detailed provisions determining what is expected of you and in what timeframe, what is expected of the client in what timeframe, penalties for being over deadline, Provisions that address change of scope/scope creep, how they are handled, and the penalties/additional fees to cover last-minute add-ons & requests. Detail every possible scenario you can think of as being reasonably possible to cover your bases.  It's also good to include an escape clause with a percentage of compensation depending on the stage of the project for yourself along with detailed legal ramifications as a result. Essentially, you want to have your clients sign an iron-clad contract that documents any possible scenario and recourse for you to recoup your fees. There are a few really solid proposal/contract platforms out there that allow cash-strapped freelancers to draft their own comprehensive documents.  Personally, I find Proposify to be absolutely indispensable. I use them religiously! Though there are others like Bidsketch and PandaDoc Just remember moving forward, that the more you define in plain English and have your clients sign on in agreement, the less this will not occur again. And in my experience, if a client is hesitant to sign fair & equal conditions on your service provisions-You probably do NOT want them for a client anyways. Best of luck to you! Let us know how it turns out."
What is the correct steps in resolving lack of payment?,"I have a couple forms of dealing with slow payments. 1) Repeat clients who have paid without issue previously. Allow them time. Send overdue notices and resend invoices every 15 days until payment is received. If nothing is received in 30 days, call and speak to them to politely ask, ""Was there an issue with the invoice I sent on XXXX?"" The thing to realize in these situations, for me, is that if the client previously paid without issue they may be experiencing a hardship, change in staff, or some other unknown delay. It's unlikely that a previously paying client suddenly ""stiffs"" you on something. So approach it from a curious standpoint, not a demanding standpoint. If you can't contact the client any longer, see #2 below. 2) New Clients and the first or first few invoices.  In many cases, I've received payment simply because I keep resending invoices. Clients are tired of seeing the invoices and just want it to stop, so they pay. It's also important to take into account that there are times when a first invoice may have been overlooked, forgotten about, or lost. So the initial contact should from a friendly position."
How to manage clients and their projects?,"There are hundreds of pieces of web and desktop software available that could help you. Most of them will offer free trails so I recommend you try a few and see what works best for you. Here are a few I use: Podio.com: this has an iOS app that goes alongside the website, you can have many projects, invite clients to post on message walls, set up projects and goals and customise pretty much everything about it. Layout finance plans, set task lists, assign tasks to collaborators. It's very full featured. Trello.com: This is similar to podio, but simpler and easier to use. It's basically like a pin board with cards on it, but you can attach images, make todo lists, and rearrange the cards and move them into categories. Good for project management but not so good for clients HarvestApp.com: This has some really handy time keeping software, all my client information, I can track expenses and projects, and it will generate and send my invoices for me based on the hours I've tracked, per project, and send them to the right client. Those 3 are probably my favourite, they all come with really good iOS apps (probably android too), but like I said, you should try a few and see what works for you. From what you've described, Podio might suit you well"
Errors in a signed-off publication: should I return money paid?,"i was desperate for money and knew the people pretty good so i did not
  push a contract on them and instead started working ASAP That is your big mistake, business is business, even with friends it's still business.  A freelancer without contract is very vulnerable. In all my contract I make sure I put a clause where I details that there is no refund policy. Because this is not a tangible item, it makes no sense to refund hard working hours, all  you can do now is learn from your mistake and make it right the next time."
What is reasonable time to allow to pay invoice?,"I put net 15 days on invoices.  15 days is customarily the minimum. Remember payment may need to be routed through accounting, or the mail if a check is sent. You can't expect or require immediate payment in most cases, even though it's nice when clients do that. For a weekly invoice, with 15 days you'll always be a week behind. The other option would be to request the first week up front (at contract signing), that way you are always a week ahead and can stop work if payment hasn't been received for the the coming week. Related: What is the correct steps in resolving lack of payment?"
What are the rules for Freelancing overseas with a US company but residing in the UK?,"This varies from place to place and sometimes with time, as well as the relationships of the countries involved. In general, it is a reasonably safe bet that some sort of work permit is required to do billable work onsite for a customer in another country.  The form of work permit may vary.  For example, if you are a professional in IT services with a 4 year degree (whether it is related or not), and an American travelling to Canada to work, you can get a NAFTA-related permit on arrival (last I did this it was $150 CAD).  The same, I believe, is true of Mexicans entering the US for such things, or to Canada, and Canadians entering the US and Mexico, since it is governed by NAFTA. Similarly, with the UK, answers will probably depend on whether you are coming from another EU country (I would expect low to no visa requirements, but check with a lawyer since it is better to be safe than sorry), coming from a commonwealth country (in which case I am not sure, but would expect no or minimal visa requirements), or other countries.  I would expect it to be easier to go do work in the UK from Canada or Australia than from the US. The point is that this question rarely is answerable even in the case of a single country regarding a single set of rules.  The relationship and trade agreements between countries are necessarily important because you are, in effect, trading services. In the telecommunicating example, this varies with local law, so be sure to ask a lawyer.  Many countries in fact do allow telecommuting to a business outside their borders without a work permit but some do not.  I don't know specifically about the UK.  I suspect with most countries, like the UK, you are more likely to run into length of stay issues when working for an employer or client in your home country while residing there.  I would not expect this to be an easy way to a long-term stay (again unless there are other treaties involved).  However there are exceptions.  I know someone who lives in Malaysia and owns a house there but leaves every three months for a weekend or so he can get a new entry visa.  Many countries don't look kindly on that practice though. This would be a good question to ask on the expat SE site when it enters beta (commit to it on area51 today)."
What is the difference between an LLC and a PLLC?,"Many states do not allow an LLC to be formed for professionals who require a license (e.g. lawyers, engineers, accountants). A PLLC is intended for licensed professionals who require the benefits of an LLC. A professional limited liability company (“PLLC”) is a business entity
  designed for licensed professions, such as lawyers, doctors,
  architects, engineers, accountants, and chiropractors. While many
  businesses choose to form a limited liability company (“LLC”) because
  of the tax, limited liability, and other benefits, states generally
  don’t allow LLCs for businesses where a license is required. Licensed
  professionals who want the benefits of an LLC must form a PLLC
  instead. http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-professional-limited-liability-company.html Although there is occasionally debate in the computer professional business (eg. the recent editorial in ACM Communications), I am not aware of any jurisdiction which requires software engineers to be licensed in a similar way as, say, a civil engineer. Perhaps your speaker thought it looked better (ie. more ""professional""?)."
How can a new freelancer judge the competition?,"This is what I do when I evaluate a market (for my needs or for my prospects): Of course the evaluation is always specific depending on the nature of the market and it should get much deeper than this, but this can get you started in case you like it."
"Setting up an ""exit strategy"" without upsetting or causing troubles to clients","This is where networking with other professionals would help. I've ""exited"" a few clients by recommending them to some other colleagues I've worked with in the past. It has been a reciprocal agreement, and we essentially ""trade"" clients. I don't mind talking to other people in my field, so I can still help them out if needed. As for the reason? You can use anyone that doesn't make the client think you're firing them. ""I have just been awarded a very large contract, and need more time available to deal with it"" is one possibility. Now, the underlying part of your question about clients who don't pay their bills or answer emails... They would be my first to go. I choose to Freelance to do my passion, not to hound clients for payment. The clients who make it easy for me to do my job, I keep those ones, anyday!"
How to build a portfolio as a freelancer new to the market,"You can create three of your own projects in the language that you prefer and use LinkedIn and Instagram to sell development services. The idea is you can show your abilities to make things like a web page or mobile app; it's so important in interviews or if your client wants to buy services from you.

Can I claim payments to me personally as income for my single-member LLC?,"Even as a single member LLC you must keep finances separate. You must have a bank account for the LLC which is not your personal bank account. Then you can pay yourself (or take dividends) from the LLC funds. But you can not deposit the LLC money into a personal bank account. Well, you aren't supposed to. I guess a bank may allow you to, but legally you really want separate accounts. There is a legal difference between you and the LLC. You need to financially operate as if you are not the LLC and the LLC is not you. And you need to present the business as an LLC not as you personally. It's fine if you present the business as an LLC owned and operated by yourself. But you should never get payments from clients under your personal name. They should all be paying the LLC, not you. (To be frank, any client worried about this is probably not worth the gas it takes to drive to the bank to deposit their check. I've never, in over a decade, run into a single client that had a problem making a check payable to my LLC rather than to me.) You should never be paying for personal items (groceries, dates, entertainment, etc) from the LLC account. The LLC account should only be paying business expenses. It is also wise to not pay yourself a regular, steady paycheck from the LLC. You can take dividends whenever you want, but not adhering to a set schedule is beneficial (at least that's what I was advised by my attorney). So take some this week/month, then don't take anything a couple weeks/month, then take a different amount the following week/month ... that sort of thing. The entire point of an LLC is to ""Limit"" your ""Liability"". If you fail to keep finances separate, and appear to be ""living"" off the LLC, a judge can immediately dissolve a single member LLC and hold you personally responsible for any judgement/settlement (heaven forbid) rather than the LLC, thus removing all liability limits. As a single member LLC, only by rigidly keeping finances separate can you try to combat such an occurrence. All that being posted.....  Yes, the IRS permits you to file taxes as an ""individual with a single-member LLC"" rather than filing twice. You won't be taxed twice. I run a single-member LLC and merely file a 1040 and schedule C every year under my name, not my LLC. The income is added to your taxes as 1099 income or ""general"" income along with any W2 income. You do not file taxes for the LLC... you file your personal taxes claiming the money earned through the LLC. This option of filing taxes on you own, personal taxes is only permitted by single-member LLCs or sole proprietorships. As soon as you have another member in the LLC.... then the LLC will need to file its own taxes. And at that point I'd suggest you hire an accountant if you haven't done so already, because then you get into tax issues with payouts to members (dividends), etc. and things are no long ""easy"" at that point. (Yes, basically the IRS treats the LLC as if you are the LLC ... but a judge doesn't want you to to that if you wish to actually limit any liability. That's government for you.)"
Which collaborative software do you usually need to work?,"For remote work, the types of applications I've found most useful are: Chat, IRC or Skype communication software.  These allow real time communication amongst team members, and most can allow you to bring your group together for a virtual ""meeting.""  Screen share is very helpful, so try to pick one that's got that feature. These are almost all free, or have a free version. I know a lot of folks use GoToMeeting for team meetings, but it's not free.  Their pricing structure for smaller groups isn't bad, however.   Group collaboration software.  Google is a decent one, and if everyone has a gmail account it's probably the easiest to incorporate.  There are also collaborative softwares and apps based upon group management of textual content, ie, Joomla, Drupal, Wordpress. At the very basic, you probably need to be able to review and edit/comment on documents and papers.  File sharing software.  You also need to be able to share files, because not everything can or should go through email. Google Drive can handle this, and so can shared ftp accounts (although for these, you will need to make sure everyone on the team can deal with using the software.) Dropbox is another file sharing option - you can share a folder in your Dropbox with your team and everyone can leave files there for each other without email file size or type limitations. For geeks, there's also GitHub. It's not just for software development, but make sure you get a private option if you are going to be sharing files for business purposes.  That will cost a bit, but I don't think it's too much.  Nice to have:  Group dashboard like Trello to help manage work flow.   These applications, plus whatever special apps you need to do the specific work you need to do, in my experience will handle most of the virtual communication required for remote work. Right now our team is using Gmail, Google+ and Google Drive for file sharing and email/video/audio/screensharing communication, IRC for basic chat, and Trello to keep everyone up to date on what's being done or planned at the moment.  That, and our SVN server, gets pretty much all of our team work done. "
"What are the best ways to get to a decision maker at the owner, CEO, or CFO Level?","The key to keeping the ball rolling when it comes to landing a contract is communication. At this point, you've submitted a proposal, and it sounds like you've either contacted a member of that organization directly, or a member of that organization contacted you. First, the decision maker may actually be the person you've contacted. Don't assume this is always an executive level decision, especially in today's business climate where workers on the front lines are empowered to make decisions based on their own knowledge and experience.   Second, you must determine what criteria they're using to determine what decision to make. If this wasn't made clear to you, contact the prospect, make it clear to them how you plan to add value to solving the problem, and ask them what they need from you in order to move forward. If you assume that person isn't the decision maker, you may inadvertently insult that person, which may or may not have an impact on their decision to select you.  If they think you'll try to run to the VP of Operations everytime they ask you to do something you don't like, that may be a huge turnoff. I know it would be for me if I were hiring a contractor. Just like with hunting for a job, you must ask for the job in order to land the job. If the person you're speaking with hasn't yet made a decision, asking  what they need from you in order to move forward may give you an action item, something that gives you an excuse to continue to follow up and keep the conversation moving forward. Of course, they may tell you that it's up to the VP of Financial Planning, in which case, you could then ask that person to set you up with a meeting with that person."
How feasible is it to work fixed price and parttime for a client as a freelance software developer?,"Assuming it's only a small slump, I would look for more clients. You need food on your table, and that's your first priority. It's good you want to work with your client, as opposed to only for yourself - but part of being a freelancer is that you go where the money is. If money isn't coming in the same, but they get the same amount of work out of you, then they're taking advantage of you - they're getting you for half price! Look for more clients, which you should be constantly doing anyways. Choose your projects based on what time you have available and your skills. Your current client has to understand that if they want you full time, you need to be paid for full time."
"How to sell a project to your competitor? Documents, Warnings, Considerations","From a business college student's point of view, you will need to do a few things to sell your idea to your competitor. Good job on thinking about this. As a market researcher, you have no idea how many times I see ideas stolen.  How should you protect your idea? You will need to have your app patented. This may take a long time so I would recommend getting started on it. Here is the link for more info: https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/can-you-patent-your-mobile-app Now for telling your competitor (or the person you want to sell your app to) you will need to write up a proposal. Here is a website that has templates. https://www.sampletemplates.com/letter-templates/business-proposal-letter.html Mention your project as an investment. You are actually selling them an investment so I'm sure you'll get their attention. Write up the proposal once they show interest. The questions they ask you are things you should add to your proposal.  To make sure that they think about it, give them a deadline. Lastly, tell them that you are also looking for other investors (even if you're not). This is a copywriting technique.  This may not seem easy but it is doable.  Goodluck. "
Complicated situation with client and an aggressive external company,"Sounds like you have 2 problems:  For me, the second problem is the real problem. And the easiest for you to effectively change. Any way you address the first problem, I suggest keeping the second one in mind. Clients will often consider looking elsewhere. They do that. It isn't a bad thing if a) you are good at your job, and b) you are good at communicating that you are good at your job.  Most people don't want to make change for change's sake, but will also wonder if the grass really is greener on the other side. A relationship of trust helps a lot with that, but hiccups like this do occur.  As a freelancer, you should have a plan in place for loss of client. If you only have one client (not clear from question), and don't have a plan, it is easier to panic, and make things worse. I suggest to take some time (an hour, a week, I don't know your situation), and imagine life without this income. You need to be in control of your situation, and know how far you are willing to bend in order to keep that paycheck.  Once you know what you are willing to do, then look at the situation from your client's view: they have 6 months of 10 workers. It has already been paid for. If they don't use them, that is lost opportunity and money. How would this client feel if they were paying 10 people in cubicals to sit around and do nothing for 6 months? As such, your goal here is not to convince them that you are better, or that they make mistakes. Instead, your goals might be along the lines of: Convince him that letting them do anything is worse than than having them do nothing. (Sounds like you have some ammunition, but probably not enough yet.)  Convince him to change the dynamic, and that you manage the relationship, and still use those resources. (I am sure that W also sold PM services as part of this, so there is some uphill to this argument, but probably not as much as you might think.) End the relationship gracefully so you might still could get a call back with the thing blows up, and still be able to use this client as a reference in the meantime. Convince him to not hire them in exclusion of you when the 6 months are up. (maybe you need the paycheck now, and are willing to be humiliated for 6 months or longer in order to get it. You wouldn't be the first man, think about the guy who dresses in a hot dog suit and dances in front of the restaurant. That man is a hero for his family, not the loser society makes him to be. Different scale, but same principle here) No matter what you do, you still have to deal with the fact that you have already made it clear that you don't like their favorite W. That isn't bad, adults don't like everyone, and don't have to. This fact becomes a problem if (when?) W decides that you are the final obstacle to landing the contract, and decide that the easiest way to land it is to show that they are more professional. This is probably path of least resistance for them, because someone with the job title of CEO will naturally think that a company is more professional than a freelancer, that more people are more professional than a single person, and that a stranger who pays a salesman is more professional than his weird aunt's cousin's (or little niece's, or whatever) husband. But you already have results, time, and trust on your side. The one thing you have to be most careful of, in this situation, I think, is to be painted as the ""You guys are mean, I'm taking my ball and going home!"" child, who won't cooperate when they ask for info about what you have already built.  So, what do you do? Save your business first. Anyone can work with idiots and humiliate themselves for 6 months. Not everyone needs to, and that has to be your decision, but anyone can. You need to figure out how best to save your company, and whether that involves this client or not.  Forget the family relationship. You can't do anything about it, and at this point it can only work against you, so don't bring it up. You have 3 years of results that (should) mean more than a distant family relationship.  If it were me, I might say something like this: If you have got this amount of work to keep 10 people busy, and are willing to pay for it, then let's get started. Who better to manage it than me? I can manage people you hire, or, you know, I can take charge of finding managing temporary resources myself. What? You didn't know I could do that? I'm sorry, I must not have mentioned that I have (managed x people doing y thing at z company) and have (certificate in whatever) with (so many years of experience) and am a member of (board/club/association/website with so many members) that I can call on to assist me/us. And frankly, with my help, W could probably be turned around, and, together, we could save the free labor they already offered you. Why don't we take this opportunity of the free labor, as well as the work you have already done with them looking at the big picture, and really take your business to the next level? What do you say? But no matter which strategy you choose, be a professional, and attack the second problem first. We all need this reminder sometimes, but employee or business owner, we need to be, and can be, in charge of our own actions and own decisions. Situations are transient, and can best be controlled through our own actions and decisions, and are really less dependent on other's actions and decisions than we often believe. Take a deep breath, it sucks, but it probably isn't really as bad as it feels to be right now. "
Content planning and wireframing. Many clients don't want to hear about this?,"I'm not 100% certain this is related to ""freelance"" as much as it is to workflow. But...  I find wire framing critical. But it needs to often be explained to the client. At the very least the level of importance needs to be explained to clients.  If a client passes it off with an ""okay let's proceed."" then later, when they want layout changes, it's my job to point to the wireframe and explain ""you approved this"" along with ""there will be additional costs incurred""."
how can I get references from my freelance editors when looking for a job?,"1. Could a Testimonial be sufficient? It's probably reasonable to ask for testimonials from clients on behalf of your current employer and this might be sufficient especially where testimonials mention you by name. If you have a good relationship with your clients, or have done some work you are especially proud of, you could ask for this specifically. Your current employer would likely welcome some fresh testimonials from clients so this could be a win-win! 2. 'Fessing Up Alternatively, you could just come clean with your current employer. Sometimes it can be good to let employers know you are looking elsewhere so they don't take you for granted and so they have the opportunity to address any issues you may have with your current employment. Some employers may admire your ambition. Of course, there is a risk of offending your current employer with this option, and you should be prepared to leave if you have to. Sometimes you have to close a door before another one will open."
How to properly make Retainer Agreement for IT company?,"Although Avonelle Lovhaug has an excellent write up, I'll give my two cents as an answer. First off, the only retainers I've used have been with 2 very good clients that I've known for years; they know me well, and I know them well. When I did the retainer agreements, one of them was a lawyer, and I trust him to draw up the contract, and allow areas for us to write in numbers and dates. The reason? It's a legal agreement, and I can change it as needed in certain areas. What the lawyer did was sit me down, and ask me in plain English what I wanted. I explained what I wanted, and they added some more suggestions that seemed good. For example: Then, of course, blank fields for the customer's business name and address, contact information, etc. The clients usually have their own agreement(s) to sign as well (i.e. Non Disclosure Agreement), and they get signed at the same time. Now, back on topic... With a retainer, you need to remember that you are basically becoming ""on call"" for the client, and usually also need to give priority service. Because of this, I do not feel I would do more than two or possibly three at a time, unless I have staff under me. I don't think the clients would feel good to hear ""Sorry, but I got another priority client who paid the retainer this month, so you'll have to wait your turn"". Now, back to your 3 questions... My retainers are unlimited, and sold as blocks of time; usually, 30 hours each time. My clients do not require me to be full time at their office, unless we are doing a project (i.e. refreshing all systems). Because of this, I know I will work between 15 and 30 hours (15 to account for any ""emergency"" calls). I keep track of it with an invoice sent from my phone billed to the account instead of asking for money. Once it says that the time has been used, new retainer starts up. Again, depending on your industry, this will vary greatly. For me, when I do good work in IT, I only need a couple hours of maintenance per month per client. I usually reserve the first half of a day doing maintenance/billings. Once that's done, it's just work for the rest of my time. I do not do retainers with an end date, just a length of time they need to give before cancelling the contract when they have money left over ""in the account"". Again, because I don't do the traditional retainer you are thinking of, this doesn't apply to me; what I would probably propose though is to have a certain cut off that will roll over to the next month; for example, 75% of whatever is leftover from the previous month gets pushed into the next month, free of charge. Again, I don't do this, but something you may want to consider. My reasoning for not giving ALL the money is because you still need to be paid just for being on call, period. Even when you aren't working, you need to be making money since you are essentially promising to be available."
Company registration when working in many EU countries?,"If you believe the Single European Market propaganda, you would be right to believe that a company incorporated in any EU state can undertake work in any other EU state - in which case LUX (or EI, NL) may be the answer to your question. However, the SEM is rarely straightforward in practice, and I know from first hand experience that using your own contractor company in Germany (even if incorporated in DE, never mind LUX) is quite tricky as you have to comply with the various labour laws. This can make it non-viable, and most contractors end up working via management companies. In terms of tax, there is a major difference between tax residence and tax domicile - so even if you register your company (domicile) in (eg) LUX it may be resident in multiple countries simultaneously. You need to take proper legal advice..."
Can I anonymously use my public LLC?,"If you want to create an air-gap between yourself and the company that you're consulting for (so that people who have access to the company records for your freelancing LLC and your own personal financial records can't see the ultimate source of the income) what you'll need to do is incorporate a second anonymous LLC. You create a secondary company, which we'll refer to as Hobby LLC. Its sole purpose is to book revenue from the client and formally hire a contractor e.g. you, as the sole employee of Freelance LLC, to perform the work on the project that you're developing. Freelance LLC then invoices Hobby LLC for 'services rendered' and banks the revenue as it would any other project, so the money passes through the Hobby LLC first. Obviously your name will be on Hobby LLC's paperwork, which is why you need to incorporate it in somewhere like Wyoming or Delaware, where company records can be very scanty indeed. You may also need a tax lawyer to explain why you're paying money to yourself from a company that you own, in order to demonstrate that this isn't a money-laundering scheme or tax avoidance scam."
Which country is the best to incorporate business for a freelance developer?,I heard from many people that Gibraltar has good taxation. You should check it out.  Others opened a company in Germany as it has a great refunds and benefits for companies.  The third group opened a company in South America (I think Chile) as it gives great benefits to any foreigner who wants to open a company.  It would be great that you come back here with the result of your investigation and let us know which one was really the best. 
"Do I charge sales tax on consulting and programming in Pennsylvania, USA?","Consulting and programming services are not subject to sales tax in Pennsylvania as far as I understand, however you're in a better position to judge than I am. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue website, tangible goods, services on those goods, and specific other services require sales tax. Extract from How do I know which items or services are subject to Pennsylvania Sales Tax? (emphasis mine) Generally, the purchase of an item by the ultimate consumer is subject
  to sales tax. Likewise, services performed on taxable items are
  subject to sales tax, along with some specifically designated services
  set forth in the law. The list of specifically designated services are mentioned on the page Is there a list of services subject to PA sales tax?: Following is a list of taxable services in Pennsylvania. Since consulting and programming aren't on this list, my understanding is that you're in the clear, however I don't have a complete understanding of the services you offer. You're in a better position to judge if your business falls into one of the above categories."
How do you give feedback on a contract from a client?,"Well, since my wife is a lawyer I've asked her such questions zillions of times :).  To change the contract, you can use the everyday language and, as you said, their lawyers will change the contract. But are you sure that you understand the contract 100%? Many, many times I've given a ""simple contract"" to my wife, and she found tens of hidden clauses which I did not understand even after she explained them to me. The only thing I understood was that I should not sign the contract as given. It's like you're making an application for a client and he asks for source code. Do you really think he can understand the code and find flaws in it? Or when he's testing a demo - a small slowdown in the app which he may not notice at all was due to a lazy implementation in your source :). To get back to your question. When I have to sign contracts, I do like this: IF he can sue me and if I can face legal consequences (not all foreign clients can sue me), then I give this to my wife and I do not start working before all has been cleared up. IF he cannot sue me, then I usually sign after a quick look on it. Like when you sign NDAs or similar contracts. In such cases, I do not need a legal protection. Find your option and do not sorry for money you spend on a legal counsellor. Consequences may costs you 10 times more. "
Freelance authors: building a reputation; generalize or specialize?,"I think the normal progression is to start out general and then begin to specialize.  The advantage of this is that you can start to get some gigs, and then build on what those gigs give you to focus more on depth.  In general depth is more valuable than breadth in terms of knowledge, but both are needed to some extent. Starting off as a generalist has the advantage that you are able to find a niche you may not have thought of when you started, and it provides some open opportunities for other things as they come up.  For example, most of my paying work is in software development but I have had some significant freelance technical writing gigs doing things like integration documentation for companies like Microsoft.  Having a generalist background even after I specialized was immensely helpful. On the other hand this means that I have been able to develop depth in a number of areas and thus serve customers better both in writing gigs and other work. So yes, starting off generalizing is not a bad approach, but try to build some depth at the same time, and be open to specialize as opportunities arise."
How to handle computer processing time when billing client?,"A way to do it, is to estimate the value of the CPU processing time against your gross margin on a regular (monthly/yearly) basis, versus a previous period (month/year). Example: Last month you've made $10.000. You have  10 CPUs. 5 of them account for 125 hours of CPU processing time/month. You've estimated that the CPUs processing time contribute to your monthly profit with  $5.000 $10.000 (total profit) - $5.000 (profit from your CPUs) = $5.000 $5000 / 125 (hours of CPU processing time) = $40/hour You bill your clients with additional $40  for every hour of CPU processing time"
How to find clients/companies with long-term projects and/or steady flow of work,"This isn't a matter of luck!!! Maybe you should be paying someone to work within your group and find projects as often as your little group would be available to work on them.  If you're pricing correctly, then there's no such thing as TOO MUCH work because you can always outsource or get more developers if you're swamped. Anyways, this person's job would be called ""business development"""
Doing business in Australia as foreign freelancer located overseas,"As mentioned in other answers, you may not need to register your business in Australia just to deliver work to an Australian client.  However, if you wish to, the steps are: 1) Register the business in order to get an Australian Business Number.  The ABN is required for a variety of business-related operations such as opening bank accounts and issuing Tax Invoices.  There is provision for ABNs to be issued to foreign companies who are doing business in Australia. 2) If you want to incorporate in Australia (rather than just have an ABN issued to your existing business), there are a variety of other requirements, which for your purposes would be purely administrative.  You will need an Australian address - you may wish to use a virtual office supplier, such as Regus.  For the process of incorporating, I used ClearDocs - a fully online business incorporation service, which cost around $600AUD.  Most of that money goes towards registration fees required by the various government departments. 3) You may choose to register for GST with the Australian Tax Office (ATO).  Companies which turn over more than $75,000 per year must register for GST, but even if you don't turn over that amount, you may choose to register.  The benefit of GST registration is that you can charge GST to your customers and claim back GST credits on your business purchases. 4) Optionally, you may want to open an Australian bank account.  This will reduce the administrative complexity for your customers to pay you, as they will be able to pay to an Australian account in Australian dollars. 5) Understanding the requirements for issuing Tax Invoices within Australia.  This is the mechanism by which most companies interact financially and if you are freelancing, almost certainly the mechanism your customers will be expecting. 6) Engage an Australian accountant.  There are approaches you can take to how you structure your business and how you collect and report your tax which you will need assistance with.  You'll need to understand your Business Activity Statement (BAS) and other annual reporting requirements."
Pay - How To Claim Expenses,"Hopefully there are some tax experts here as I'm not one! Ideally, the £50 (or the actual travel expense amount) should be entered as a reimbursement of an expense so that you aren't paying VAT that you would pay if it was entered as income. The VAT has presumably already been paid when you paid for your travel."
What is an appropriate follow-up time with clients?,"This is a tough questions and it really varies from a client to a client.  I would try once a month for a couple of months (let's say 3). Then move this to every 2 months. This is in case of a remote clients. Try to get friendly with some clients and ask then to contact you in case of any job, even in case of tasks only.  I am doing it this way. Sometimes they don't reply at all, some times they tell me ""get back to me in a couple of weeks"". If they stop replying, then I'd wait for 6 months - till they forget about you :). Occasionally you'll have to dismiss some clients. "

"upwork.com customer disappeared, I would like to do the same to the project","Most importantly: upwork.com knows that some customers are... ""heavy"" and they consider it in your (disclosed) rate calculation. Furthermore, such bad luck happens with roughly equal probability among the freelancers. Thus, the chance of that you will have bad luck multiple times, is very low. In my personal case, this customer, although wasted a week for me, but ultimately paid, offered new projects and probably gave a good feedback. But I was not so lucky with another one. The result is that I still have a quite good, although not exceptional rating here. Today I do not use them (my current job forbids it) but I could get projects any time. The most important thing: do not over-estimate the importance of single case bad lucks, the top prio is your average result. Probably there is no way to delete a contract on the upwork.com, but probably it can be closed in good standing (and with good feedback), but very likely it requires the cooperation of the customer, too. So there is no way to silently leave out, but some bud luck is tolerated by the company. The UI what the customers see... well it is not better than the developers see. Many seemingly non-cooperativity of the customers roots that they have no idea, what and where to click on their UI. Beside these, I also accepted and did some not economical projects with the goal to improve my rating. As the details of the rating calculation are not known, I have no way to know, how much did it help."
Working as a self employed in US for a EU client,"From EU perspective it works like this: If you buy goods for the purposes of your business from a supplier based outside the EU, you must generally pay VAT at the point of import (and may deduct this in your next VAT return if you make taxed sales). http://europa.eu/youreurope/business/vat-customs/cross-border/index_en.htm I don't know anything about the US though."
"US-based freelancer invoicing in foreign currency, can I have my UK client pay pound sterling into a UK-based current account?","The important is that you declare your revenues in the country you're operating the business. And as the url below suggests, you might also need to declare this UK bank account to the IRS. So yes, you can invoice your client in Pound Sterling and have it deposit in the UK bank account. That's a good solution if you actually have a need for the Pound Sterling somehow (eg. shopping online in the UK) and don't want to pay for the exchange rate. http://london.usembassy.gov/irs/bankaccts.html But if you have an account to receive online payment such as Paypal, you can simply invoice in Pound Sterling and then convert the currency to USD, and get it transferred into your US bank account. The only downside is the exchange rate that you'll need to pay (usually around 2%-2.5% + value of currency) and the currency value on Paypal is not always exactly following the market, but it's usually close enough, and worth the ""trouble"".  It might be an easier and safer solution than having a deposit in the UK, and there's other online payment method you can use other than Paypal (eg. Stripe, WePay.)  Your client can either use his own Paypal account, credit card and even bank transfer in some cases. From Paypal for example, your client can deposit money from their bank account to their Paypal account, and then send you a payment."
How to ensure the person signing the contract is authorized to do so by the company?,"Ultimately this is a question for your lawyer* not a bunch of other freelancers. I am NOT a lawyer. I do not intend to give legal advice and make no representation that what I post will suffice for your situation. Most contracts have a signature line, followed by a ""for"" line. I.E. John Doe for Company X. Then in the body of the contract there's a clause stating something like: Each person signing this Agreement represents and warrants that he or she is duly authorized and has legal capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement. Each party represents and warrants to the other that the execution and delivery of the Agreement and the performance of such party's obligations hereunder have been duly authorized and that the Agreement is a valid and legal agreement binding on such party and enforceable in accordance with its terms.  It's generally called an ""authorization"" or ""representation"" clause. Should the signer not be authorized and sign, given this clause, you would legally go after the person signing the contract for misrepresentation, rather than the company."
How to wisely spend money on improving my freelance business to result in a steady stream of income?,"I would consider your infrastructure before marketing. In my experience, you need to be able to absorb risk and error as easily as possible.  Do you have backups, transportation, file and data management, invoicing, and a proper computer? Do you have everything you need to do business and handle emergencies? Remember, you can't lose work or drop in quality, especially if you thrive off of word-of-mouth. "

Acceptable terms for sales contract where I'm the sole developer,"This is as simple as this - find out your hourly price and stick to it! When you get such an offer, analyze the project in detail and calculate how many work hours it will take you to finish it. Then tell your price to your ""people"". They can add their commission on top of your price.  If you want to go deeper, you can calculate your maximum hourly rate (for short projects) and your minimum hourly rate (for projects over X work hours).  But basically, it all comes back to you.  If you are not sure about your hourly rate, then browse statistics on popular freelancing websites, as they will offer the average hourly rate for each field. After that, try to figure out if you can use the average rate or you have to (de/in)crease it. Also, don't be intimidated if they tell you ""Can you do this job for XY dollars""? Simply analyze it to see how much work there is, and then calculate the hourly rate. In a matter of a seconds, you will know if you should take the project or not. "

In your particular case, I would convert your code and functions into a library, after which you could license the use of that library instead of embedding your code into the product. My knowledge about programming doesn't go beyond Web Development so if it were me, and I had some JavaScript functions that were unique to my work, I would bundle it up in a file or folder and license it exclusively to that project."
What's the most important consideration when accepting a new client?,"I'm in web development myself, my answers: If money seems to be the only important thing, or you're being compared to India I've frequently had discussions with potential customers that in the end boiled down to that they didn't like our rates, either because ""competitor X is 10% cheaper"" or ""I could outsource this to India for half your price"". On both cases I move into arrogant mode, and ask whether they like to invest in top quality for a high rate, or low quality at half the rate, taking twice as long to not deliver what you want. Never, ever, get into a bidding war with these customers if you don't absolutely need them, believe in your product and let them decide whether to choose end product quality over a bit of discount or not. Same goes for if the client is requesting offers from more than 2 competitors - that's an absolute red flag for me. I've heard customers tell me they requested 9 offers, but no one can evaluate that many offers on quality. Customers like that only care about the price, so they'll be whining about every invoice you'll ever send. If you don't believe in the client's business If you don't think they have a chance to succeed, you should be honest about that. If they can't convince you otherwise then, steer clear. Don't ruin your own reputation by becoming the guy that 'ruined a company by sending them invoice after invoice for a failed product'. They will try to blame you for their failure, it's human nature. If the client has no technical knowledge whatsoever Again, this means fighting about every invoice if they don't understand the complexities of the product. Customers like this only see that Facebook works, not the thousands of man hours involved, and will expect you to replicate that in a few days 'because you know this kind of stuff'. They hire you to be the expert, but they should know at least enough to appreciate your work, or it's going to be drama at one point or another. They don't need to know everything about your job, just enough to appreciate why they're paying someone else good money to do it for them."
What to do about a possible fraudulent client and a scam in progress?,"I actually have to say, I don't think this is a ""scam"". He has been in touch over a very extended period of time. I do think how this is a very bad idea.  I often meet other freelancers, who with all the best intention in the world really do believe they have the next Facebook. I believe you may be dealing with someone who isn't fully aware of what makes businesses work and may always be likely to blame others for failures which are evidently their own. Check what you bank offers
Many banks, including my own, offer services to help businesses. Barclays offers a credit check service which allows you to check someones credit history without them ever knowing; best of all the first 5 (I think) are free.  If you are in a situation like this already I would recommend you speak to legal services of some description  as soon as possible. It is worth noting that anything discussed over the phone is worthless, make sure everything is in writing somehow. The bottom line: Stay far, far away from anyone who won't give an address and sign a contract."
A bad client who pays a lot - should money or attitude prevail?,"I just ignore the off-hours contact and deal with things during traditional hours - even if that means I get emails and messages the next morning. I have a few clients who will email Sunday evening. While they may be expecting a reply, they don't get it until Monday.  Like with any business, a client is free to email or call anytime, that doesn't mean I've got to respond at that time. In my experience, it isn't that clients think you are always available. It's somewhat human nature to not really perceive others over the internet (and sometimes phone) as actual people. They assume since they are at the computer, everyone is. It's a misconception which extends well beyond freelancing. I don't see off-hours reaching out as an ""attitude"" per say. If the client is pleasant to deal with in spite of their ""panic attacks"", they will eventually learn that they can't expect everything to be dropped immediately and their issue addressed simply because they ask. I wouldn't drop a client simply because they repeatedly reach out at odd hours. Now, if the client is unpleasant to deal with on top of the panic attacks, I would probably be looking to supplement that income stream elsewhere."
"Concerned, freelancer I don't know may run off. How should I pay a freelancer?","For fixed price projects, depending on the size of the contract I always did 50% up front and 50% upon delivery. For larger contracts (+1500 euros) I took 30% up front. The freelancer thinks the same way: ""I'm not going to do work if there is a chance the client just runs off with my work and doesn't pay me!"". There is always a risk, but if the freelancer has decent references there is no reason he would want to run off: if he just does his job he gets another 50% or 70%.  I never worked with escrow services, it just costs extra and I never heard of a freelancer taking half and just running off. Which of course doesn't offer any certainty, and I should mention I never worked with freelancers or clients that where more than a few hundred kilometers from me.  "
Where can a front end web developer start freelancing?,"The challenge that you're going to run into with Freelance web development is that, in my experience, many Web developers have  pretty broad understanding of the entire development stack from databases to server-side coding to front-end HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Thus, if you're just starting out and wish to avoid learning other parts of the stack, you may run into trouble finding work. In my experience, when a Freelancer needs to outsource something, it's because he or she needs a specialist in that area. Using myself as an example, I lack knowledge in design, so I'm less likely to find work building websites since most people who build websites can also manage to do the little bit of scripting necessary to make the site functional. However, I specialize in JavaScript. If you have a Web application and are stuck somewhere or are doing something complicated, that's where I come in. If you're going to specialize in nothing but the frontend, you're going to need to specialize in it, which means you're going to need to be rally good, write really clean, W3C-valid HTML code that works in every browser, and have a deep understanding of front-end User Experience. Even then, you need to understand at least a little server-side code. The best front-end coders I've ever worked with still knew a little PHP so that we could understand how we were going to integrate things. They weren't experts in it, but they weren't ignorant to it either; it's naive to think that you can get away with never ever knowing how the server-side works. With that said, you have to start somewhere, and the best way for you to do that is to look for small jobs that require just minor changes to existing front-end code. This will help build your skill-set in that area while hopefully giving you some income."
Is it right to call a client who didn't hire you to ask for the reasons he/she didn't?,"First you say this: He told me he was glad to have had the interview because he ended
  quite happy whith me. Nevertheless there were still four more
  interviews and he had to finish them all. I  hate to break the news to you, but I am fairly confident he said that to each candidate. A week later he sent me an email telling me I wasn't hired. And one week later is not a bad amount of timing for a normal interview cycle like this. Now, I am really curious about the reason he didn't give me the job… We all are curious about why we were passed over for anything in life. But the reality you simply calling him might not result in the answer you want. For all you know you will get some more puffery tossed your way (i.e.: white lies to soften the blow but ultimately they just don’t want to talk to you) at best and at worst you will be a pest. My advice? Respond to the rejection thanking them for their time & indicating if they ever need someone in the future to handle similar tasks you would be open to talking to them again. Do you want an answer? Or do you want to at least have a chance in the future? My advice is to be as polite & acknowledging of the rejection as possible while presenting yourself to future opportunities. That is the best tact to be professional in a case like this."
What to do with code after oDesk job completion?,"There is a written contract between yourself and the client, you signed it when you accepted the oDesk Terms Of Service (TOS). I also work on oDesk and so am familiar with their TOS: Looking here under section 8.6: Proprietary Rights in Work Product shall be owned by Freelancer until payment has been made by Client, at which time Freelancer will be deemed to have assigned all Proprietary Rights in the Work Product to Client. This means that once the client has paid you for the work you did, they own the code that you wrote. The intellectual property rights belong to them. It is up to the client to decide what you do with that code. I usually store all the code I write in a private repository, so that if the client needs me to do more work or modify the code I wrote, I can easily access it. If the client requires I delete all the code (which is rare, but possible), then I am contractually obligated to do so.  Making that code public is not up to you, it's up to the client to decide what they will do with the code.  Side note: Usually most people don't read the TOS for websites, but there are some cases, like this one, where it is incredibly important to read the TOS and know what's in there, otherwise there can be serious legal consequences."
Should I charge the client when I get stuck on stupid mistakes,"Delays which are due to your business/working practices are typically not the clients responsibility. Let's look at the situation with a similar scenario..... You're working along on a client's project and mistakenly close a file without saving it. Silly error, but I'm sure it's happened to most. This error means you have to redo what you just did for the past hour. That's an additional hour of your time.  If something, in the middle of a client's project, incurs time not directly related to the completion of the project, then it should not be invoiced. If I made some silly oversight which adds significant time to working hours in order to correct, I wouldn't feel right invoicing the client for time spent correcting my oversight. I'd not invoice for time spent on my error."
How to handle interpersonal relationships and expectations from client's marketing department,"The easiest way to handle the short-notice work is to set up a Service Level Agreement (SLA). You can document how much notice the client must give, and how soon you will act, with financial requirements in each direction. Get this agreed, signed by management. Implement a basic ticket handling system and boom, you can bill extra for the urgent stuff. That said, make sure you include sections for out of hours cover, holiday cover and other potential breaks. The agreement will only work if it puts a requirement on both parties."
Hiring freelancers who are a couple?,This looks like business and personal got mixed. They are out because the core foundation of business is trust.
Bartering - client has cancelled and is asking for money,"If you two have no contract, then what is he breaching? on the other hand, the mutual understanding is valid in front of the law.  I'd say that he was not acting correctly, from what you wrote. He should have given you more tasks. And if not being satisfied, he should have told you that. So if this comes to the arbitration, I'd say that email are enough of the evidence.  But bare in mind that we are not legal counsellors, and maybe you should ask someone ""more law related"" about this. "
How do I resolve a payment dispute when trying to obtain code for testing?,"The contractor is absolutely right. Why? Putting the website on your server, he's giving you a code or moving the code to your server. And the code is delivered in the end, unless you're paying your contractor hourly. Since we work remotely, we cannot give the code to the client, before we are fully paid for the work (again unless we're paid hourly in which case the client will get what we made within paid hours).  The only solution is to test the website on his server. Why were you against it? For your testers it's the same whether they test on your on his server. For him, it's not the same.  The only situation when you can get your copy of app to test, is when a developer can produce EXE or any other binary file which your testers can test. In case of mobile apps, it's the usual practice the client tests on company's servers. We did the same for multi-million project, and I am doing the same while working as a freelancer. "
Is it right to charge for work done incorrectly?,"There is no clear cut right or wrong; it all comes down to your working relationship and which processes the two parties agree on contractually and during the project. Since you seem to want to continue the relationship, I suggest you pay the bill and keep this episode in mind when negotiating the next project. Turning what I believe is a misunderstanding into a stand-off on principles, could very well jeopardize the working relationship. And good commercial partners are not always easily found. The situation you describe is notoriously difficult: When is a project considered 'delivered'; what are the acceptance criteria? What constitutes a bug which needs fixing for free and what constitutes a change request? You'll need to discuss these issues and come up with a mutually acceptable agreement."
How do I determine support rate if not previously negotiated?,"I would bill for your full-price rate in this case.  Even though the work is unrelated, your discussion with the client about the task can be considered as an informal agreement. Since price was not mentioned during this discussion, it is assumed that the client is happy to pay the existing rate that you have negotiated in the past. If the client wanted to negotiate the price further, it would have been mentioned in discussion. As an aside, I do sometimes do minor changes for free (< 30 min) for clients with whom I have a great relationship and charging them for the short amount of time is not worth the hassle. (If the client starts taking advantage of this, then I'll reconsider free work for them). "
number of hours is too high?,"Keep doing what you do. It is a good filter method which protects and helps you get rid of clients that want cheap labor or quick fixes. I cannot find anything wrong with your method of estimating the amount of time you find necessary for getting the work done. If this is what you need to deliver quality, then there is no reason to change. Not if your business generates profit. Yes, there are faster workers. And, yes, there is cheaper labor force.   This being said, stay who you are and negotiate what you think is best for your business in order to maintain a high rate of client satisfaction (and implicitly generate word of mouth) by delivering quality and high standards. The market has an invisible hand and it is capable of reaching an equilibrium without the need that you lower your prices or rush the work you do (just because one of ten clients says so). If your clients want someone else (faster, cheaper or just better) let them have this other person. ""Is it worth not doing the project?""
YES. If you lose money by lowering your standards or by making too many concessions then yes, it is worth not doing the project. ""How do you deal with these types?""
You negotiate what's best for you. If you feel you need a certain amount of time and if you aim for a certain amount of money, than defend your interests by being the better negotiator between you and your prospective client."
"As a new Freelance editor earning a low pay rate, how long should I wait before asking for a raise?","You'll want to establish your compensation up front. The contract you'll sign will have the details of what's expected from you, how you'll be paid, and at what rate. Many publications have a standard rate, either hourly, by the word, or by the piece, that you'll be expected to accept if you want the job. If you've got some negotiating room, or they ask what your rate is, all the better. The job you've described sounds like copy editing; at an online magazine, you might not get a credit for that at all, and any text you create as part of your editing will be considered ""work-for-hire."" If you're going to take a lower rate as a means of promoting yourself as an editor and getting names on your resume, that's a valid choice, and you can add it to your portfolio."
"Where, other than home, can freelancers do their work?","As a freelance, sometimes I work also at my clients's company offices, when I do a project for that specific client, if they have a free office or desk usually I can stay with them from a few hours up to a few days. 
While I work there I have people around, and the client is happy because we can interact more efficiently as I develop their project. Of course I do that only with clients that I get along very well. Other places where you can work being with others is the city or university library, parks when is summer, etc. I wouldn't stay at Starbucks or places like that, I would feel very uncomfortable and is not a stimulating place."
What should be on an invoice?,"Since the requirements for an invoice are very country-specific, I'll give a general answer on how to get these data. You need to get to the site of your government. If your country has an organization for business & self employed with a separate website, go there. For example, for UK residents, there would be gov.uk, clicking further gives gov.uk/browse/business. Search for 'invoice'. On the UK website, this leads to this page, which gives a clear overview of the requirements of an invoice. You must clearly display the word ‘invoice’ on the document. You must also include: If your company is a registered limited company, you must also include: This list is very basic. It will be the same for most countries, with just a few minor changes. However, to be sure, find the website of your government and look it up. There might or might not be different rules when trading with companies abroad, and whether or not different rules apply depends on the other country in most cases. Try to find the information on the website of your government. If you cannot find it, contact them. It's important that you are sure about it. It is not a good idea to keep this information on this website, because it might change and can have considerable impacts."
Web design copyright norm,"There are many variables.
In short words, you have to know how to licence your work and this should happen when you write the contract with the client. Of course, there are many aspects of the problem you should consider: No matter what the situation is, you should always consider this legal concern. Moreover, make sure your work doesn't defaults as the property of the client just because you were payed and asked to do the job (it happens in most of the cases).
Look, i found on internet a very good article which gives you a very good idea about how copyrighting works and the way you shuld handle this matter. Here is how it starts: The moment a work is created in a tangible form, it immediately becomes the property of the author who created it. As soon as you draw that illustration, snap that photo, or write that article, it belongs to you. As owner of that work, you can license its use to another (and even restrict how it’s used), or transfer ownership entirely. The exception to the above is “work for hire.” That’s when someone else hires you to take the photo or write the article; or when an employee creates a work within the scope of his or her employment. As a freelance designer or programmer, it’s important that your contract makes that distinction; otherwise, the work you perform could be deemed as “work for hire” in a court of law. You can read more details here My case? I do web design as a freelancer. Controlling what happens with the source code after it was delivered to the client is very hard. For this reason, when I ask for a price I consider all the implications (including what can happen after I no longer have control over my work)."
A dress code during a freelance interview?,"I think it ultimately depends on how you want to market yourself and the industry. As a freelancer or contractor, you're ultimately the president, CEO and busybody. 
Based on that, use your best judgement as to how you want others to perceive you as a brand. If you're trying to speak to clients that are in the healthcare or financial industry, i would field their expectations accordingly. The other factor to put into play is the industry that you're in. If you're a freelance painter, it might not make sense to wear a suit and tie. In the end, dressing and fashion is an art. If you're making a conscience decision on your attire feel confident about it and go with it and dress comfortably so that it supports your personality and you."
When making a website which activities do you normally include in invoice?,"Generally, clients buy a freelancer's time. Using that logic, all time spent on client work is invoiced, regardless of the work. I never heard of clients wanting different rates for work on prototype versus the actual product - and since both will consume 100% of the freelancers time, it seems reasonable that they cost the same. A reasonable angle could be having less than 100% compensation for tasks that don't consume all the freelancer's time; e.g. traveling for the client or being on-call. Having said that, the freelancer should then be permitted to do unrelated work during that time. Or - if compensated fully during travel - the freelancer must perform client work. As a freelancer, your risk is allowing the client to place more work under a lower rate - so it needs to be quite clear to both parties which areas are discounted and which are not, as this obviously has the potential to be contentious and destructive for the relationship."
An employer hasn't paid me for months already. Should I keep working with them?,"It sounds like your employer is having financial problems, possibly the end client not paying them, but the fact that they hired another contractor for something else, indicates they have money, you are probably just one of their last priorities.  And once they pay you late once, it's just easier to sit on your next paycheck than someone else's.  Also, how many employees do they have?  Have you heard any of them grumbling about not getting paid on time? I doubt it.  The squeaky wheel gets the grease - and you need to start squeaking a lot louder! I would stay VERY pleasant with them at this point.  You don't want to burn bridges or have them bad mouth you to others if things fall apart.   However, you are running a business not a charity, and now your own financial standing is being affected by their financial problems.  I would tell them they are a favorite and important client to you, consequently, you have turned down other work because you know how important this project and the end client is to their business, you love working on the project, but you simply cannot afford to wait any longer for payment.  You need to be paid what is overdue immediately, otherwise you regrettably cannot do any more work for them because you need to spend your time trying to get back some of the business you turned away to work on this project so much. I would not turn over any more work until they are caught up on their payments to you and I would tell them you understand about cash flow issues, but you need to be paid on time in general, and know in advance any time they are going to be late paying you so you can make decisions for your own financial future."
Why are the majority of my US clients so hesitant with contracting outside the US?,"Why the are not choosing you? The reasons may be: They prefer working with some in the USA. In case things go bad, they can always sue USA contractor. USA contractors are also aware of this.  Price of the project - large project are usually not being subcontracted outside USA Remote workers are unreliable. I heard this sentence from many clients who tried hiring someone full-time remotely, and then got burnt heavily.  They are afraid that remote worker may leave in the middle of the project. This is not rare as we all know.  ""And currency: given the current change rate, companies might be biased into thinking EU citizens are simply too expensive as workers"" by ZJR. I've faced the same problems with currency conversions. Some credit cards (like Payoneer) will charge up to 3% any US dollar leaves the US. Meaning, if you're paying someone outside USA $1000, they will charge you $30 extra (besides all other fees) because dollar had left the USA.  ""Also timezones: a company might be already contracting overseas to China, and that requires a certain timezone juggling to brief, debrief and schedule meetings. Adding Europe into the mix might spike the management overhead, requiring too much energy and resources to keep things working"" by ZJR.  etc. I think that these reasons may be the main reason. Of course, some of them may be patriotic, but I think that most of clients would rather hire expert for a lower price, that USA mediocrity just cause he's American.  I would suggest you really try working for that company in the USA. If you are a developer and good one, after a year or so, you may be able to negotiate remote work. A personal friend of mine succeeded in this, but he had to work for that company 2 years on-site. "
Charging for meetings/conference calls with a client,"Traditionally as a freelancer it is your time and skill that is hired. So yes you bill for conference/meeting times.  It is customary to build in a few hours for discussion with every bid.  Some freelancers use a reduced rate for ""consultation"" but really that is your choice. For me.... an hour of my time is an hour of my time, whether that's  and hour on the phone or an hour building something it's the same block of time so I charge the same. An easy way to decide stuff like this is to imagine you needed to hire an attorney for something.... what would you expect for free and what would you expect to have to pay for? Do you think an attorney would speak with you for an hour and not charge you for that hour??"
How to decide what Upwork projects to bid on?,"First, as more of a philosophical angle, it's better to look for high value client, not high value projects.  [Quick note, I've not really used UpWork since the departure from oDesk, and I'm not at all a fan of the upcharges just to get better access to data.] First, your specific questions: If a project has too many proposals already, should I not bother? How many is ""too many""? When I was bidding on projects, my rate would always be near the top (if not the highest). I wasn't concerned with how many proposals there were, what I looked at was the average rate vrs the average interview rate. If the interview rate was at least a little higher, it told me the client's primary interest was not the lowest hourly rate.  It now looks like UpWork charges for access to those kind of stats. If the project already has ""hires"", should I not bother? This depends on the type of work you're doing. If I had to choose between two jobs, and one already had a hire, I'd probably pick the other. But this could also be a useful indicator about the client. If it's a job where more than a single contractor are obviously needed, can you identify the hire? If so, what does that tell you about the client? If the project is still open after a week, and has no recent activity, should I assume the client has moved on and never gotten around to closing it out? Time itself isn't necessarily an indicator of that. Have they moved anyone to interview (if so, perhaps they've just not found anyone yet)? What do the average bids tell you (lots of low bids may mean they're waiting for someone with what the consider 'reasonable' pricing)? Some general tips:
I'd always use bidding on projects to expand my area of expertise. As a contract developer doing API integrations, if there was an API I wanted to play with, or wanted to become an 'expert' in, I'd focus my bidding on those jobs. Think about your reputation when you bid - specifically, does this job seem like it will end successfully with the client leaving positive feedback.  This may no longer be true, but oDesk used to match you in search results to not only your profile, but the keyworks in the jobs you bid / won. Keep that in mind, because what terms your profile matches will affect the job invites you get. And on that topic, your profile may be the thing you can improve the most. Right now you're asking how to validate that a job is worth using one of your available bids. Wouldn't it be better to just filter inbound requests? How valuable is a good profile? Valuable enough that mine has been copied multiple times. (Which was an interesting story, I found out about that interviewing another contractor for a client, and thought some of their profile sounded familiar. Turns out it was mine.) I touch on some other tip in this rather dated guest post on the oDesk blog, parts are still relevant."
Freelancer refuses to be paid. What to do?,"Sounds like you didn't really do your due diligence. You didn't check any references, look at past work.. nothing. So, really, this is kind of your fault. If the freelancer refuses payment, what's the problem? He send you the videos.  If you're concerned about who owns the work, just get him to state in an email that he relinquishes all rights to the work."
Does this freelancing experience count on a resume for a full time job? How do I mention it?,"Consider positioning yourself as a business owner/consultant vs. freelancer. You can create a section on your CV below your previous job or above it, depending on what is most current and is more impressive. Something like this:  ""Your Name Consulting, 2004 - Present"" 
Offers design and development work to a range of clients (you can be descriptive and specify things like non-profits, small-medium size businesses or event cite specific industries they touched like education and health care clients).  I specialize in deploying CMS platforms that extend to Magento, Wordpress, Joomla, and Drupal If you want to go the extra distance, you can build yourself a very simple portfolio site to showcase some of your work. It will give employers added credibility to see what you've shipped and the type of skills you possess. "
How Much Information is Enough Information?,"Now, how much information is too much?! Ideally, clients should be aware of all good things happening in the project and be unaware of all bad things like bugs or bottlenecks.  You can achieve this with some clients, but you cannot with others. I go into the same situation as yourself, and the more I talk about the bugs and involve the client into bug details, the more they don't rate me as an expert. Let's say, I am rated 4 out of 5.  So, if you can, avoid details about bugs or other bad things. If you need more time, just tell them why, and use neutral words like ""optimization"" or ""refactoring"" or ""speed up the things"".  There are however, rare cases when the client is a developer as well. And in such cases, you can talk to him about the issues because that person will understand you, and that person may be able to help as well by googling and sending you good links. You do need help from a programmer when solving problems, but you do not need help from non-programmer."
Effect on employee-periods in CV on finding contractor jobs?,"I think you should step back a bit from the question.  In my experience the good clients usually are hiring based on your presence.  The CV is a guide to that presence.  Employee positions are not really necessarily either relevant or irrelevant to that presence.  So it depends. If you are just starting out, chances are your CV will have mostly employee positions.  That isn't itself a problem, but how you frame them might be.  Ideally you want to look at the experience as if it was consulting.  What did you do there that is relevant to your freelancing or consulting direction?   I think the fundamental question you have to ask yourself is ""how do I want to position myself?""  Then add relevant employment and contract positions there.    Pay attention to how you present it though."
"Client ghosted after delivering results, no payment","If you have given everything away, there might be very little you can do. All you can do now is hope that the client for some reason returns. If that happens, you have some leverage you MUST use. This is obviously a client where good faith is not enough - so you must negotiate a working process you can live with. This will typically involve partial deliveries and not performing more work until payment is received."
How to enter freelance websites with high rates since the beginning,"I understand your problem. What helped me to develop a profile is the following: Make clear from the beginning your prices and years of experience. Don't justify it, there are always jobs/projects that require skilled people, and projects that don't. Act accordingly to your experience. If you have many years of experience a portfolio with a few huge/hard projects and former employees testimonials would be nice. Use a short brieff and be goal oriented. My customers value that the most. If you have an engineering degree use it, show it off. A customer once hired me instead of her daughter because of my degree and seriousness. People value formal education, especially if they know that their position requires it. You need to apply the right projects and choose carefully your words (be patient and work hard). Price is always a competitive factor, be aware that there may be people as skilled as you with better profiles and lower rates. All the above is as valuable as Just do it. Hope it helps."
How to deal with client who makes constant changes to work,"I know it's pretty much standard to set a limit to the number of revisions a client can have.. however..... I'm rare... I don't place a limitation on changes/iterations on most of the work I do. I allow my clients to not be concerned that ""uh-oh, we've already made 3 changes. Now we have to pay for more or deal with a piece we don't like."" My client love this aspect of my business. And I'm almost never ""bitten"" by it. But then, my clients are not the one-off, get'r'done, type of clients.  The only time I do place a limit on iterations is for projects of a more ""art"" nature - illustrations, logos, etc. Since redrawing over and over is not something I can do repeated at no cost. But for general layout and  design... I don't limit things. Instead, what I do is include a clause in the contract which states something along the lines of: There are no limitations on the number of revisions you may request. You are allowed as many revisions as are necessary to complete a piece of which you can be proud to display. In my experience, this generally should take no more than 3 to 5 exchanges. However, a couple more is never a problem. Technical issues such as typographic errors, misspellings, bad alignment, should all be corrected after the second proof.  Although there is no limit to the number of change requests you can make, I ask that you keep in mind that every change requires time and effort, no matter how small it may appear. Any request for changes should be reasonable and delivered in a ""bulk"" fashion. In other words, please take your time when reviewing proofs, collect your thoughts, and return with a list of desired changes rather than detailing individual changes one at a time.  Please be be considerate of my time and not abuse it by requesting an unreasonable amount changes. If at any time I feel the number of change requests is becoming a concern, I will open a dialog to discuss this and hopefully we can come to an amicable solution. In some cases additional fees may be used to offset an unreasonable amount of change requests. This goes over pretty well.  If a client then starts hitting my limit, which is generally more than 10 requests, or even more than 3 requests if they are ""sweeping"" in nature. I open a dialog with them: Hi Client! Thanks for sending the changes. I'm becoming a bit concerned that changes keep coming in and I'm having difficulty determining when or even if this project will be completed. Please realize my original project quote considered a reasonable amount of changes, roughly under 7 on average. This project is now hitting X rounds of changes. If you feel we're close to the finalizing with this last change request, then there's no worry. However, if you feel the piece still has a ways to go to be final, please let me know.  Clients tend to respond well to that. They will stop monkeying around and finalize the piece in one or maybe two rounds after that. Or, they are open to the discussion that they realize they are making a lot of change requests and are willing to either pay a bit more or at a minimum switch to the quote+hourly for changes. This way the amount they spend is in direct correlation to the amount of changes they request. I try my best to never be accusatory in my dealings with the client. I always want to come off as if ""Hey, (smile, smile) did you happen to realize...."" Really my goal is to just remind them that my time matters. Most of the clients I've dealt with are very open to this and even if they are against any additional fees, then do reluctantly admit that they are kind of going above and beyond and they need to stop. And most do. "
How to handle projects that are medium to large as freelancer,"As a solo freelancer, in order to take on larger projects, you will need to build a trusted team you can work with. This will take time and effort.   One way to begin, is by joining and participating in local user groups, attend the workshops and social evenings.   You will get to know other freelancers, what their strengths/weaknesses are. Assume that if you are going after larger-scale contracts, you are also taking on some responsibilities, including Consider where it leaves you if either a) the client doesn't pay, or b) your freelancers don't deliver as promised?   This going to happen from time to time - how will you handle it? Going after large-scale projects is doable as a solo-freelancer - but make sure you know what you are getting into when you are assembling and managing project teams. When it works - it's a dream - and can be very profitable. When things go south - look out - it can be a world of pain. I worked for a web firm first, managing large scale projects - that gave me the experience to do it on my own. If you don't have that experience, then be frank with with the freelance team you put together about your goals and ambitions - make sure they are the type of people you can rely on - and that they are willing to work with you to go after the 'big fish.' It can be done! (But it's not without its risks)."
Do I need to use SEO on my portfolio site?,"The main question you need to ask is - how do you expect to use your portfolio site?   If you are expecting to direct people with whom you've already made contact to it to view more expansive examples of your work, then SEO will not be of much use to you, because you will provide these folks with a URL and they will not be needing to look for you to get to where you want them to go.   If you expect people to be looking for you online, and for that to be a major route for obtaining invitations to apply for open jobs (ie, you are fishing for recruiters) then you may benefit from some SEO.  But, as mentioned already, do it yourself or set a reasonable budget that you can live with for the work to be done.  "
Sending advertising offer letters to local businesses,"The way it typically works is this:  Businesses are looking to solve a problem. It could be solved with software, or it could be solved with process improvements. Or it could be solved by a little of both. It may take 6 months or it may take three weeks.  Despite your credentials, you still seem a little inexperienced. Maybe not in software, but definitely in the business of software.  Inexperienced developers tend to think too big in terms of scope. Again, I say inexperienced in the business of software, not necessarily as a developer. There is a difference. Therefore, your best bet is to start off small. Look for businesses that just need a small change done. This will get you to the point where you're talking to real customers and finding out what they really need. In most cases, many businesses are going to just use pre-built software because it's cheaper and has been tried and tested in many different businesses and environments. Custom-built software is expensive, and most businesses who build custom software will either do it in-house or with experienced contractors. What's more, custom software is a long-term commitment with support contracts and SLA's and things that may arguably be difficult for a single sole proprietor to support. So, instead of approaching these businesses with a 6 month scope of work in an offer letter before even finding out what they're about, word it so that it sounds like you want to help them solve a problem. If you approach them with the idea that you're going to spend six months working on enterprise database software when all they really need is a simple solution to manage a few documents, they're immediately going to think that you're not really going to listen to their needs. The last thing any business wants to deal with is a contractor who doesn't listen to them. Years ago, I worked for a company that needed a website built, and we hired a few different contractors because they all said they'd build the HTML to standard but ended up using tables (for non-technical readers, that's an outdated methodology). We finally found a contractor who would listen to what we needed, and that person got our repeat business."
How much time should I spend on open source work to advertise myself?,"Ever heard of Rovio Entertainment?  Well, most people hadn't until the company released their 52nd game. The first 51 weren't really all that great, but number 52, Angry Birds, put them on the map and netted them 200 million dollars in 2012. The point is that not every project you do will be a success, and that's okay because finding a winning idea takes time and many attempts.  Therefore, if you're working on iOS apps, and that app isn't bringing in success, try working on another one.  When I first graduated college, I worked on a few different Firefox Extensions back when writing Firefox Extensions was still cool, and I wrote about my experiences writing  them on my blog.  Not many people really ended up using them, as they weren't real winners, but it did evoke some interest from a lady in New York who wanted to hire someone to write a Firefox Extension that did something very similar to what one of my extensions was doing.  The difference was that she had the creative ideas and energy needed to start a business, and she had the capital to pay me to invest more of my own time and energy into helping further her business goals. Therefore, I'd suggest you continue down the path of writing your apps, but instead of just publishing them, get the word out on your blogs and social networks that you have these skills.  There will be someone out there looking for someone with specialized experience, and that could very well be you. As for how much time to invest, that depends. Marketing yourself definitely takes time and dedication, and it's up to you to determine how much time you can afford to take away from other activities in order to invest that time in your projects. As an aside, I'd suggest not focusing on your age. Ageism works both ways, and you could inadvertently talk yourself out of a nice contract wage by showing your cards. If and when someone does contact you for work, be as professional as you can, focus on what you can do well for that person, and keep in mind that you likely have knowledge and experience with something that many others either don't have or haven't demonstrated. "
Best behaviour to have in meetings with people trying to impress / confuse others with unnecessary technical jargon,"Quiet confidence gets me the kind of clients I want. Bold, boisterous, technical arrogance often garners clients I don't want. It all comes down to a person's selling style really. I actually get more clients because I don't use jargon or technical-speak when explaining things. I rely on cues from clients as to the level of techno-speak I'll use. I'll explain something in plain English, they may reply with ""Oh, You mean XXXX."" That lets me know they understand that and I can go deeper into technical talk about it. It never bothers me when someone goes overboard into jargon or techno-speak. I merely watch the client. If they start to appear confused or lost I may reiterate something in simple terms. Politely, of course, without interrupting or trying to talk over anyone else. I never want to treat anyone as if they are stupid, dumb or ignorant. However, I also never want to assume someone understands all aspects of my career. They are hiring me specifically because I understand things more in depth than they ever will. I don't need to ""flex"" that knowledge unnecessarily. Chances are they aren't very interested in learning the language of my career. They merely want something done well. If other's feel the need to do so, that is their choice. I find that if a client feels there's a ""learning curve"" to working with you, that's a deterrent, not a selling point. In my experience, clients prefer understanding things. Overloading them with industry-specific terminology, jargon, or technical terms does not aide in a client's understanding. Faced with two candidates -- one who explains things so they understand and one who bombards them with jargon -- most of the time, they'll pick the candidate they understand."
Client saying Another freelancer did the job while on contract,"In Upwork, I think there should be a valid contract between client and freelancer, the client should have made a deposit for the job, so you can: In case 1, I think you can contact Upwork support because the client does not respect the contract."
Selling Java library - which pricing model to choose?,"A project on which I'm involved uses a 3rd-party library among its Maven dependencies. What the 3rd party did was to set up a Maven repository on the public Internet, protected by a username and password. My company pays a yearly fee to the 3rd party to have access to their Maven repo. We configure their repository in our Maven settings file, and that's it.  Obviously, having an account technically means we can use the latest version of the library in any project we need. I don't have access to the contracts between my company and the 3rd party, though, so maybe some more severe limitations are defined there and maybe legally we can't do that. Hope it helps. "
Controlling stress associated with maintenance services,"Your friend is a guy called SLA. Service Level Agreement You set how heavy the lash is for the amount of money the client is willing to pay. Doesn't matter the job. Some office guy exploded his desktop? You got a week to fix.
Some very important server went down because the maid pulled the cord midday? It's still a week, unless they hire premium SLA. At least with SLAs, if you're getting called at 2a.m. if for someone that's worth it. It's up to you really. Most of the stress comes from dealing with customers and managers, they are usually technologically ignorant and proportionally arrogant. Dealing with computers is the easy part. You will only work after hours if you offer very short SLAs, this might be a dealbreaker for some clients, but you're the boss. Things that will make your life easier: As I said, even if you detect a huge problem and have to spend the night solving it, that is 10x less stressful than having to fix a simple email server with the client breathing down your neck. So keep tabs on your resources and monitor stuff. Let the computer tell you when it's going through hard times before it reaches a crisis.
On top of that, it's awesome if the client calls you at 2am and you're already up, fixing whatever it is and just saying 'Mail server down? I'm on it already, don't worry' While you're working, make sure that you're doing whatever you can to prevent having to work other times. Like automating parts of your work or doing general prevention routines."
Could I theoretically make money by creating software Linux distro needs? [closed],"First off, remember that Linux is marketed as very robust, open source, and free (with a few exceptions). Can you keep that philosophy? The reason distributions become popular are for different reasons. Ubuntu became popular because someone was able to make all the decisions, and choose where development happened. Debian is build to be rock solid, but doesn't always have the latest packages in the stable build. Red Hat (and CentOS) are built for businesses, and offer lots of other cool tools. Now, where would your system come in at, and how would it compete for market share (which you'd need first)? Are you going to build off of Debian so you can claim it's rock solid? Are you going to build off of Ubuntu because you want newer packages running? You need to get people to want to use your new distribution before even thinking of getting money out of them, even in donations. There are a large number of ""developers"" who contribute source code to the Linux Project, and you could even help there. You can also pick a distribution and just make your app. Let's start with this, and see where it could take us. Have you heard of the FOG Project? They're a ""Free Open Source Ghost"" program, with a DNS and DHCP server built in as well. It has many great features, and many, many companies are using it over the Windows Distribution Services (which costs money). It does one main thing, and it does it quite well: allow an IT person to image many machines, quickly and easily. Now, how do they make money? They don't have large 500+ member teams working on the stuff, they have a few core developers. They accept donations for the few people working on it, and they seem happy with that. You know what else they do? During the installation, new versions ask if they can use part of your CPU time to essentially mine bit coins in their name. They give you the option of supporting them, without actually paying them. They started doing that after getting a good customer base going. It doesn't cost my organization any money to contribute that way, and we have 40+ FOG servers deployed (over 40 physical sites, so there's one server at each site). That's like them having access to 40 BC mining machines, without all the extra costs of running one (extra hardware, extra power, etc). As a customer, I feel this is a great way to keep the project going. I don't program like they do, but I want to see it grow. You will want customers that want to see your product grow. Once people are using your product on an everyday basis, then you can start looking at non-intrusive methods of monetizing. Don't start big, start small, with one well-made, much-sought-after product, and build from there."
Can I invoice a client for programming freelance work without having a business registered in the USA?,"The USA Small Business Administration website talks about the various possible business types, one being the Sole Proprietor. Here's an extract of the definition of the Sole Proprietor, from here (emphasis mine): A sole proprietorship is the simplest and most common structure chosen
  to start a business. It is an unincorporated business owned and run by
  one individual with no distinction between the business and you, the
  owner. You are entitled to all profits and are responsible for all
  your business’s debts, losses and liabilities. You do not have to take any formal action to form a sole
  proprietorship. As long as you are the only owner, this status
  automatically comes from your business activities. In fact, you may
  already own one without knowing it. If you are a freelance writer, for
  example, you are a sole proprietor. You are automatically a Sole Proprietor in the USA. As a result, you are free to invoice clients as necessary. There are reasons to register as a business. Some people register a company so that they may sell shares to potential investors. Some people register a company because of the limited liability benefits that come along with.  Neither of those are necessary, though. If you're just starting out, there is no problem delaying business registration until you have reason to. "
U.S. Citizen performing contract work globally for a U.K.-based company,"A company can contract another company to provide services from anywhere in the world so I can't see why you'd need a work permit to perform freelancing services remotely. If you physically travel to the UK to perform your duties then you probably will need a work permit.  Official government guidelines here: https://www.gov.uk/visas-immigration (usual disclaimers apply - IANAL, the internet is no substitute for professional advice, etc, etc...)"
"Do all clients requests, some off them or none at all?","Heres the thing.... You need to have a conversation with the client. Not emails, not texts, not instant messages, but a conversation as in speaking via telephone, Skype, or in person. The is no way you are going to adequately express your concerns via any text delivery method. Text is heard in the reader's voice not the writers. So, if the client is at all bothered, annoyed, or concerned themselves that will come across to them when they read anything. Your tone of voice is imperative and needs to be conveyed not the clients internal voice. Leaving this up to the client interpretation via text is a recipe for an argument or discourse in almost all instances. It's not unfounded to speak with the client and voice the issues..."
How and when to abandon a client?,"No, don't ditch him yet, he does not cost you anything. He may actually have some other plans, but it does not look too bad. Unless (!) he owes you money. Does he? Since you said that his account was locked and he was too lazy to open it.  If he owes you money, then of course, you will stick to him. If he does not, I would stick to him. Do your other work as you do not owe him anything.  I would also send him a polite and friendly message saying something like ""Hi XYZ, I have seen that there is no activity in this project so I cannot reserve any more of my free time for it. I have taken other assignments as I have to make a profit. Once you decide how you want to proceed with this project, please contact me so that I can estimate the scope of the work and can make an execution plan"". You've got the point. My rule is that I cannot be a cry baby in business. If the client's laziness does not hurt my business, I do not ditch him.  Since you mentioned you're using a freelancing website (odesk I suspect), you can ask him to close the project and rate you. And then again, he can reopen project. This however has bad side as once he closes the project, he may forget about you (unless you two contact by other means). "
Legal ramifications of walking away,"I'm going to speak just as a suggestion: if there is no clear scope within the first 2 meetings, walk away. You are supposed to be getting paid for your expertise, not your time. With your expertise, you should estimate the amount of time to accomplish X, Y and Z goals, within the scope. Another issue is not having a contract. Always get a contract, especially with Scope of Works being drawn up. In your contract, you need to make sure you have an Exit Strategy, so that either one of your can exit the contract as needed. Usually, if I cancel the contract for whatever reason, I offer to give up to 2 weeks notice (large projects), or as little as a week. It's reasonable, and proves to the client I won't bugger off right away. They can also cancel the project, usually for a fee. This is because if I don't have other work lined up (i.e. They promised to use me for 6 months and cancel after 2), I need some cash to fall back on while I get the next job in motion. The Scope Of Work may include the payment terms, but does it describe anything about you having to stay on until completion? If not, then I would not worry about the legal aspect (read: IANAL). As stated above as well, you should talk to your client, and express your concerns. You will need to be firm, otherwise you are setting yourself up for failure. If I hired someone to refloor my living room, but I left the furniture there, I'd feel bad since that's not his job. His job is to refloor the living room, and that's it. When people hire freelancers, it's usually because they can't do it themselves, and it's likely the client does not understand the work. Write notes, bring printed emails, draw diagrams, and do your best to explain the issues in person. There is nothing like an email argument conversation between two people who don't understand each other. When you talk, make sure he's being respectful of your time talking (i.e. not answering phone calls, not interrupting, etc), and make sure you don't talk to him like he's a kid. When it's his turn to speak, follow the same rules. He can't help you fix a problem if he doesn't know what it is though. If it's just a matter of scope creep, then I would just refer to the Scope of Work, and explain that's what he paid you to do, so that's all you're doing. If he wants more work done, explain I would love to do that work, let me draw up a secondary Scope of Work and contract. This shows you are willing to work with him, but that you need proper documentation of the project first."
How do I convince clients not to use irrelevant pictures on their site?,"I have been in similar situations where clients won't listen to sensible advice. One approach is to accept that the customer is always right and proceed with whatever they instruct. Under these circumstances, you might like to consider: Another approach is to dig your heels in and say you can't continue with the project under the particular circumstances. You may not receive your full fee or any fee though. A third option might be to urge the client to get some independent professional advice. Rather than relying on friends and relatives, is there someone else they know in the industry that could provide some unbiased advice or do you have a colleague that would be willing to weigh in on the issue? The best option might be to implement an A/B test where page A has the cute kitty and page B has something more suited to the business. Measure the success of the page via newsletter sign ups or analytics or some other metric and you may be able to convince the client with some real world data. Be prepared to be wrong though, in case the cute kitty is a winner! :)"
To expand business or increase rates?,"To get right to it, you want more cash. One of the simplest ways to do that is to just raise your rates, like you mentioned. The biggest problem when doing this is, naturally, the fear that your current clients won't be able to accept the rate increase and would like to cease working with you. If I were you, I wouldn't worry too much about this because, as you mention: let's just say I have just the right amount of new clients knocking down my door, ready to get started at my current rate So you do have other options available to you should any current clients turn down your work. I recognize that ""If they won't accept it, just replace them"" sounds extremely harsh, but the point of raising your rates in this case is to ensure you're being paid what your work is worth. The value you provide to your clients should be reflected in the compensation you get, especially when the value of that work (i.e. your experience and skillset) increases/becomes more effective with time. Losing a client that's not going to pay you what you're worth is acceptable because, if you begrudgingly continued to work for them even as your other clients accept the rate increase with grace, you're essentially just losing money when working for this stickler client. There'll be a period of transition between losing this client and beginning to work for another, during which time you'll obviously not be paid, but ensuring that you're using your time to establish relationships with clients that are willing to pay you what you're worth is extremely important. This transition period shouldn't be feared, as it's a necessary part of ensuring you're compensated fairly. It does carry with it a cost, but it's not as heavy a cost as the time, money, effort, and scheduling associated the other option you were considering: Hiring someone. You say: My rates are more than fair From your phrasing, it sounds like you might be selling yourself short a bit. This is a pretty clear clue to me that you should be requesting a higher compensation for your work. You've got more experience, you've developed your skills... Now it's time for that to pay off. Depending upon how decent your relationships with your current clients are, you should be able to negotiate a rate increase without a problem, especially if they've kept you on retainer for awhile already. The way to do this isn't always easy, as you note: I think that they'd still be fair with a 15% increase, BUT I don't know if that's the best way to go in the interest of keeping my long term clients who I don't want to drive away, nor put them in a position where they feel like they're being asked to pay this increase ""just cuz"" If you feel confident that your somewhat shorter-term clients would be comfortable with a 10-15% increase, then propose exactly that change... But not immediately. Give your clients ample notice, perhaps a couple of months' time to digest the change before making it. If your clients have already been working with you for some time, they should recognize the value in your work. Giving them time to process the adjustment in your rate as you continue to work with them shows that you're polite, professional, and that you value their time as much as your own. Your longer-term clients are going to be a bit trickier. You still want to raise your rates, but it feels punishing to do that to some of your more trusted clients. The way I would handle this is by telling them that you are, indeed, raising your rates... But for them, it's going to be less of an increase than your other clients due to your pre-existing working relationship and how happy you are with that relationship. This shows them that, in the interest of preserving your working relationship with them, you're willing to make that increase more easily digestible for them, while still making a stand for the experience and quality of work you provide. For all future clients, you'll charge the increased rates sans the discount. You can determine just how much less that increase will be for these long-term clients dependent upon your relationship with them - I don't know them like you do! Dmytro Chasovskyi mentioned in a comment that you should set up a yearly inflation adjustment for your longer-term clients. I couldn't agree more with this, as it also gives you the opportunity to increase your rates, should the need arise, along with the inflation increase. As time has marched on, and your experience has increased, you seem to have let your rates fall behind the increases in cost of living of your area and general inflation. It's important that you value your work enough to cover the increases in these expenses, as well as the increases in your experience."
Is it reasonable for a fixed contract cost to a client to be based on the average salary of the role from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey?,"So as the developer survey states the average salary of an iOS developer, you definitely need to charge little more. Let's suppose a developer earns 100% for a two-month job, so you need to charge 120%-140% of it. A freelancer always charges more than a full-time developer, as you might be giving more time than a full-time developer or you possess more experience than an average developer. Secondly, once the task is complete, the client will be asking for revisions too that might extend the duration to more than two months. So you need to take this into consideration too."
What do I need when I want to work as freelance developer in Ireland (Dublin)?,"Tax law is complicated the world over, and as a general rule you should seek the advise of a tax specialist in the jurisdiction where you'll need to pay taxes, they'll also likely be able to incorporate a company for you if that will be the best option. In 2001 Ireland moved from a system of tax-free allowance, to one based upon tax credits, the principal tax credit being €1,650 (directly offset against your tax bill), which is roughly equivalent to a tax free allowance of €8,250, you can find out more on Wikipedia entry for Taxation in Ireland. It's also worth pointing out that as in most countries, there are tax benefits to being a registered company: As a sole trader you pay income tax at the same rates as PAYE employees, but based on your net annual profit (i.e. after the deduction of legitimate expenses). If you’re operating as a limited company, however, you could be paying tax at a mere 12.5 per cent or even at just 10 per cent. This means that there can be a considerable tax advantage in operating a business through a company instead of as an individual. via Just Landed Ireland is known for it's low corporate tax rates (EU customers of many multinationals will often be billed by the Irish subsidiary of the company for exactly this reason; e.g. Amazon AWS), so you may find that the turnover at which it makes sense to incorporate is significantly lower than it would be in Germany. Again, you should seek professional advise specific to your situation. To find an accountant in Ireland you might want to try the Chartered Accountants Ireland website's Member Search, and I'd suggest looking for one in the town or city you'll be living."
How to talk to a company as a prospective contractor vs. employee,"Having been down this path before, here are some thoughts: Resume Compensation Expenses"
EU client wants 'registration number' on invoice (I work in the UK),"I assume the request for a registration number is for VAT purposes. In many EU countries including the one I mainly work in an invoice needs to include the VAT registration number of the supplier as well as the client. Also, for business within the EU (above a certain amount) you need to fill in an EU sales list which includes all your EU suppliers and their registration numbers. So asking for a tax registration number seems like a reasonable request.  If you are not registered for VAT then there is no VAT registration number to give of course.   NINO is something completely different as far as I know, this relates to you personally and not your freelancing activities and should never be asked by a client. UTR is used for your yearly self assessment and should not involve an overseas client. (I am a freelancer in EU, non UK)"
Shall I count my management work hours if I outsource the project?,"I would say yes. bringing more people on to a project always creates more work, and I don't see any reason you shouldn't bill for that work.  EDIT: from Peter's comment below, and to expand on this thought a bit more. I'm saying this assuming that since you are outsourcing, you are interfacing with the client directly. And by that mean handling all invoicing and financial matters along with most if not all client communication. That would also mean that you are paying the outsourced person directly. If this is the case, then the subcontractor's client is you , not your client. That means, among other things, that you are responsible for his pay, not your client (even though your client is indirectly helping you cover that). In that case, the percentage you take off the top is your fee for handling the client relationship and assuming all the financial risk and responsibility that comes along with that. Having said that, your management tasks for the project, (which I'm assuming is mostly communication between you and the client and you and the subcontractor) is a service that you are providing your client. And as such, I will bill it in the same manner as you bill any other services to said client."
How can I determine my rates as a freelance Wordpress developer?,"As a freelancer, how can I determine what I should charge clients? One easy way it to shop around - do some market research. What do other freelancers in your area (profession, location and similar circumstances) charge? You will get a range of rates from people, which should give you a good starting point to position yourself and your rates. What should I take into consideration? You need to consider your expenses and overheads - everything that you pay out in order to complete a job. This, divided by the amount of time you estimate a job to take, will give you a estimated break-even rate - a rate that will end up with no profits or liabilities (assuming your estimates are correct). This is your rock bottom rate - possibly a rate to attract customers with, but not a long term rate that you can profit from. At this point, you need to figure out how much of a profit you want / can make, taking into consideration the current rates you got from your market research.  Position yourself too low and you will get customers but no profit. Position yourself too high and you will not get many customers, but you will get high profit for each. This is risky, as you may not get any customers and those you get may look elsewhere.  Position yourself somewhere in the middle, where you can both get happy customers and get a healthy profit."

Is it advisable to contact a company and offer your services based on job advertisements?,"I've used a similar strategy and have found success. On my LinkedIn I note that I am a freelancer and it's clear that I have been so for quite a few years. I get contacted by at least 2-3 recruiters (either internal or external) a month offering me an in-house full-time W2 position. I make sure to always follow-up and note an interest (if there is one) in the position but that I am a freelancer and intend to stay as such. I then give a sales pitch (brief) about my skills & experience. I inform them that if they don't want to hire a freelancer for this position I understand but that I also offer consultation services so that I can teach their team my skills and industry insights.  Consulting is usually when they're interested in me because I can train 5-10 people at once to do what I do so their whole team is worth more than they were before.  I think the industry really plays a major role here as I work for 2 but it only works with 1. I'll explain: When I get contacted it's usually for SEO work. Good SEO's usually freelance or work for a marketing agency. It's recommended you don't hire an in-house SEO for your company or bring someone in and have them learn SEO to work on your companies website.  However, for development work, it's a different story. Many companies have their own in-house dev team (they take on other roles as well if there's not a ton of work to do). Rarely will I hear back from a recruiter if they're looking for a dev employee and I mention I'll work as a freelancer.  Now, you're talking about responding to a job ad itself. If you 'apply' to this job via a form then I think your chances are about 1% as jobs who get a lot of applicants only skim an application for certain things and don't really read it. ""Will work as a freelancer"" tossing it, not what we're looking for.  I recommend email, or better yet, calling the company and talking with someone directly. avoid HR at ALL costs these people have no idea how to hire people for a position in a department other than their own and are a major roadblock for anyone trying to get a job.  Look the company up on LinkedIn and find the department manager/team leader. They may not be able to say yes or no for hiring a freelancer but they're more likely to give you the time of day than HR, company recruiters, or an operations manager.  Is the approach considered unprofessional and will it ruin my reputation (e.g. like staffing agencies spamming LinkedIn)? Will I be (mis)judged to be needy, arrogant, rude or even aggressive? If anything, it shows you have dedication, and you have a real interest in the position. You're applying for a job because you believe you can complete it and you can do a better job than others. Now's the time to prove why you're better.  Is there anyone who uses this approach as part of their regular ""sales strategy""? I wouldn't make this a 'regular' thing. I say you'll get 7 no's for every 1 consideration but your outreach strategy shouldn't focus on this tactic. There are people looking for freelancers specifically. "
How long should I leave an overdue payment?,"You must state explicitly what the penalties are in your sales conditions, including the delay after which the invoice is deemed overdue, what the fee is (usually an interest rate on the amount - there exist ""legal"" rates - with a minimum) and other relevant details of the procedure. Of course if those conditions are new, you must inform the customer, preferably before the next deal. If they react negatively, you can still negotiate payment conditions that suit you better. My own policy is to give my customer a first warning on expiry, wait for 2 weeks, give a second warning with threat of a charge, and after another 2 weeks confirm that I am applying the rule . For the good customers I don't want to hurt, I drop the fine ""as a commercial gesture"" but tell them it's the last time. You should see this approach as rather soft, arrogant companies don't hesitate to fine you on the first day. In any case, act immediately and make yourself respected, you'll never be penalized for that."
How do you negotiate your fee in equity?,"It all boils down to one thing, do you believe in the project? Accepting equity is always a bet, because so many things can go wrong at every step of the startup way. The moment you accept, you are becoming an active part of the company as opposed to just a contractor, and you have to be ready to push the project ahead with all you can give, because your future income depends on it. Yes, it does mean scope-creep, responsibilities, long hours, and stress. But it is also be a very exciting ride and certainly extremely instructive.  If I were you, I'd estimate the time needed to build the app, multiply it by 2-3, then weigh that time against potential value of the product. You need to know as much as possible about the company, including their business plan and profit expectations. Only with a full picture in mind  will you be able to make an informed decision. If their plan seems shaky, or if they do not have one, I would strongly recommend that you try to get at least some compensation. It's not uncommon to ask for low salary+equity in order to minimize your losses if the project doesn't work. If their plan makes sense, and you believe in it, go for it, and enjoy! About the negotiation, remember that ideas are worthless, only products have value. So do not undervalue yourself just because it doesn't seem like a huge commitment at the time, you are critical to the company. Make an offer based on how many people are on board, and ask for an equal share (eg: if 4 people, ask for 25%). This gives you room to negotiate when they make you a counter offer. If they are also inexperienced and freak out, explain your reasoning and always keep the door open for negotiation.  Good luck!"
Choosing the right partners,"Here's a question for you - what sort of structure are you providing to encourage your people to perform?  Do you have a mutually beneficial and understood verbal or written contract that specifies who is responsible for what, what kind of work each person is responsible to put in to be counted as a full participant, and what kind of rewards they can expect for staying the course?   People are people, regardless of how smart they are.  They lose interest quickly, get distracted, and often after a while begin to look for reasons to put in less than their best efforts, especially when the payout for their work is seen as iffy or a long way off.  Very few are disciplined enough to work consistently for long periods of time towards a goal without some incentive along the way to continue to do so. Could this be what needs to be tweaked, or maybe has been missing altogether, in your last three efforts?  So, to answer your two questions, here is what I would do. If you want to proceed with your start up, make sure that you have a clear understanding of the roles and work required to pull it off, and put this down somewhere in writing.  Perhaps in your business plan.  Then be sure that anyone who signs on from now on understands what is expected of them and what the rewards will be and the consequences for not following through. Interview potential partners like you would a potential employee to make sure they have the background and skills required to deliver. Offer incentives for good work. Get something in writing for your protection and for the protection of your new partners.  A memorandum of understanding may work just fine, or a simple contract.  Be sure to invest a bit of cash in having it vetted by a business lawyer before you sign it or ask someone else to sign it.     If you want to proceed without partners, then I'd start looking for some sharp folks who are willing to freelance for you for wages.  Then I'd take my completed business plan and start shopping around for capital... investors, loans, savings.  There are whole books on how to do that, and many are industry specific.  "
How can I get started as a freelance writer?,"I will caveat my answer by saying that I am not a writer, so I'm certainly no expert in the field. That being said... If you want to get connected with journals, newspapers, or magazines, you'll need to write articles and submit them to the editors for review (by e-mail or snailmail) - and get ready for a LOT of rejection. I recommend you pick a particular genre that you can write about and select several magazines or journals from that genre - for example, you could pick science as the genre and select Scientific American, Popular Science, Discover Magazine, etc. as the magazines; then read those magazines. Get a feel for what the editors like to see. Similar to preparing for a job interview, tailor your resume (your articles) to the magazine or editor that you're writing for. When it comes to freelance writing, there is very rarely an ""opening"" that you apply for. You write and submit and write and submit until somebody publishes an article you wrote. If they like it enough, they may ask you to submit another article, but there is still no guarantee that it will get published as well. But as you repeat the process across multiple magazines, your chances of success will improve. If you're a good writer and a magazine has published a few of your articles, they may extend you an offer to be a full-time writer for them - which would make you no longer a freelancer ;) As you can guess from the ambiguous maybes, there is a lot of uncertainty in freelancing. You need to be prepared for a lot of rejection and a lot of hard work; and even the best writers get rejected. Most editors sort through hundreds, sometimes thousands, of freelance articles to publish, and that's mostly to fill space when one of their full-time writers gets the flu. A blog can be an inexpensive and safe way to start and develop your skills, but it's a very different world from magazine and journal writing. Blogging makes you no money unless you have your own website with banner ads for ad revenue. Once you get popular as a blogger (which is getting harder and harder to accomplish) you might start an online store. Blogging can be an excellent way to hone your writing skills and zero-in on the topics that interest you the most and that you would like to write about. I definitely recommend you come up with something more specific than ""stuff"" to write about :) The best way to connect blogging to magazine articles might be to look for online magazines to write for: such as MaximumPC (a completely online tech magazine). In this example if you write a good tech-related blog, you can reference a MaximumPC article and then pingback to your blog in the comments, potentially catching the attention of one of their writers or editors. They would review your blog and if they like it, they might invite you to write a guest blog for their site. You would also submit articles to online magazines directly, like with a paper magazine, but being online allows you to present your blog as a portfolio of prior articles that an editor can peruse and decide if they want to publish what you write."
"When working with another freelancer, how do we resolve disagreements on what projects to take?","I am going to assume that as it currently stands, you are both 50% with your decisions. This is definitely going to be hard to handle initially without some sort of system in place. The earlier it can be addressed, the better. One caution when working with others on the same level is that if you are friends, you need to put your friendship on hold sometimes for the company; hopefully, you both are mature enough to be friends after work is done. When people work together, there is always going to be a Leader and a Follower. Even the best of leaders will follow the right leader, and become followers themselves. Point is, there will always be one person who thinks they are ""slightly better"", and this is where ego comes into play. It's an evil, but still quite unavoidable. When it comes to business, you need all your personal feelings aside, but you still need to trust your instinct. A growing freelancing business is like a child to you: you want to protect it, and make sure it grows to be a healthy business... Or adult, one of the two. Business decisions can sometimes be hard to make, but once you make them, stick to them. When one partner has a concern, both should talk about it until both are on the same page. If the concern isn't one to get worked up about, then someone will say so and the decision will be made. If the concern is something that would affect your partnership (business, personal relationship, reputation, stress...), then it needs to be dropped as soon as possible. The point is, you both need to talk about it, and both of you need to respect each other enough to listen to each others concerns or praise, as it deals with your babies, respectively. If a project is going to drain both of you so much that you are willing to destroy your business or drain your bank accounts, you need to see it before it gets too bad. Hope this helps."
"To work with a team of reliable software development freelancers, which platforms can I use and how do I get started?","I have always worked this way (with the exception of technical writing gigs).  In general teaming up with other freelancers makes it possible to deliver greater guarantees than you can by yourself, and it makes it possible to tackle larger projects as well.  There are some difficulties in working with new people (making work styles gel, ensuring you send eachother work that is appropriate to your expertise, etc) but these can be managed. Now there are many times when this is not appropriate.  I cannot imagine technical writing being a good case for this sort of team work because often clients want specific writers, but for more functional tools, it is generally a good thing. There are two other points I would make in terms of IT services and software: I have found that many customers have had bad experiences with loners, and that loners are harder to replace than team players.  This makes being a loner a possible red flag for a customer.  If you want to work alone you should be aware of this and at least have partnerships where you can hand off projects. One of the very good things about teaming up is that if one team member takes on something that turns out to be outside his or her expertise, it may be possible to salvage the situation by handing it off to someone else.  This is far harder to do working alone."
What expectations are there of support when handing development over to a different contractor after my contract is terminated?,"I don´t think there are any ""business norms"" on support after cancellation of a contract. As already stated by @candied_orange, if it's not in the contract it doesn't exist I think it would seem unprofessional to hands-down reject a request for support. If any service is requested upon by the client, the least would be to talk to them about the conditions for fulfilling that request or - if it is totally out of question to support them for whatever reason, send them a polite refusal. If there are no binding agreements with your former contractor which prevent this (anymore), you could also extend your offer of services directly to the super-client. You don´t have to wait until they come to you directly. Approaching a company where you have good reason to think they could benefit from your services is good business practice. Any work done professionally should be paid at professional rates. Especially if it´s a short handover: you are giving away valuable knowledge, small volume - (big overhead cost), with no good perspective of further assignments. So the rate for that can be on the high end."
What is an appropriate safety net for equipment failure?,"Preparing for unforeseen equipment issues is a problem for any small enterprise, especially when it comes to critical hardware. The only answer is to not rely on any one piece of equipment. The net can solve this quite adequetely for critical software backups and files (like email, accounting, quotes, invoices, contracts, graphics, video etc) through the cloud and if not entirely free, entirely reasonably priced. As for 'my most powerful machine that I use for everything but cannot afford two of' then so be it. What exactly is the problem with a two day or three day recovery period. So a smaller less powerful machine or infrastructure is a PITA but it is an emergency measure. Short term. Personally I have my big office machine, that I back up important files to a separate hard drive. Critical files are on the cloud and accessible from any device. I also have my beautiful laptop, that I can use quite comfortably for any task, and do so from home or customer sites as and when I want to. The loss of either my big bertha or my sleek laptop would not leave me stranded. But at home I also have my 'other' PC that I keep just in case. I make sure all three are able to operate. If my office burned down with my laptop in it, I would have my home PC. If my Laptop and home PC burned down I have my office PC. If some virus took out my home and office PC I have my laptop. If something happened to all three all my critical files are in the cloud or on my portable hard drive. If the internet collapsed I have my own copies of files. I am not sure what more I could do, and believe me, things have often happened that has meant I have had to revert to one of the backups or the other. The car analogy is a good one. You cannot afford two cars, to have a back up in the garage at all times. But you do have access to care hire, emergency recovery or break down assistance. Or you can go out and buy a new car. Or take a taxi. It is the same with hardware, either have a spare, or have the means to get a spare and recover all your critical software.  How do I prepare for critical equipment issues? I have a backup or a spare. That is not the only answer, but for me is the best one.  "
Paying another self employed person if we work together (UK),"Why would it be illegal? It seems you are buying a service (that you cannot provide) from your partner. Nothing wrong with that.  Whether your company structure is optimal, is another matter that very much depends on your jurisdiction. Addendum: Assuming self-employment is somewhat comparable between the UK and Denmark, the main concern for the (tax) authorities is whether both of you are business owners independently of each other; i.e. that none of you are obligated to find work for each other, as that would be deemed being a 'de facto employee'. When I started out, one of my first assignments was a collaboration with 3 other freelancers. We even got business cards in the company that maintained the client contact - even though we were in no way employees. It is perfectly legal for a group of freelancers to join forces in a 'collaborative partnership'."
Should I add VAT to an invoice for 2 days freelance work in the UK?,"In the UK, domestic work is VAT-exempt if you don't meet the income threshold for VAT (currently £82,000). If they ask for your VAT number for tax purposes, simply state that you are not registered for VAT and do not charge VAT. If they complain, they have a mediocre accounting department as this is the very first section on VAT in almost all documents describing it: You can only charge VAT if your business is registered for VAT. — https://www.gov.uk/vat-businesses/how-vat-works So no, you must not add VAT on your domestic UK invoices to businesses unless you have a VAT number. On the invoice, state ""VAT Not Applicable"" or something to that effect. There is also no need to register with an umbrella company (agency) for this purpose, either, unless you would like to use their insurance, company name, etc."
"Non-paying international client (US client, UK freelancer)","I'm not a US citizen. Like you, living in Europe. But, in the past I needed some legal assistance overseas. At that time, I got on the internet, searched for some legal advisor and found a lawyer who assisted me and for my surprise, delivered results. What can you do from your situation? If I was you, I will search for a legal adviser in the US and ask this legal adviser to send them (to your client) a letter by mail post (I believe the synonym to Royal Mail in the UK used for handling most of the legal communications is USPS). What this letter should do? Inform your client about his obligations to you, the time and legal constrains and some other legal stuff. Why send them such a letter? Because this is how a civil law process starts/gets prevented (if the defendant fulfils his contractual obligations). By doing this, you give the defendant the chance to solve the conflict before taking any official and future legal actions (maybe isn't the most appropriate comparison but take this first step as part of an ""informal litigation""). Waiting will do any good.
Start sending them daily reminders about the due payment and meanwhile, find a legal assistant overseas. As soon you found someone, send them a letter by mail post.
This is all you can do from your current position before starting a civil action. And, in the future, do one of the essential things any freelancer should do: Will this solve your problem? Let us know."
Valuing My Freelance Business,I don't have much experience with this but here's a few of my thoughts: All of the nuances you raise above are exactly why companies are sometimes very hard to value - just look what happened with WhatsApp recently. You may be able to get someone involved who is more experienced in order to broker a deal.
How do I accept international payments using Stripe as an Individual?,"I was dealing with this problem for 13 years. I think PayPal has restrictions for non-US or non-European citizens to have an account and even more restrictions if your country is a third-world country. Online payments websites have more restrictions for you because the money can be illicit, so they put this kind of restriction to avoid money laundering. this problem of Region or Requirements Restrictions also happens to me with Stripe, Venmo, CashApp, and Google Wallet. My better recommendation is to use PayPal, which I and a lot of freelancers friends use. Also, this is the payment method favourite on upwork.com and freelancer.com. I recommend you research about a Virtual Credit Card. I used this to verify my PayPal account. At the moment, I am using PayPal goods-and-services to be paid for my services and all is normal. I receive money without restriction. It's just bad for the commissions and withdrawal for local currency."
Should one keep their clients' files separated?,"I give codes to different customers, here mostly tickets. These codes are the prefix to folders, accounts etc.
That helps to separate the work for different customers. And so it is possible to give access to accounts to co-workers for this customer only. Every customer has its own .txt file with notes what is linked to him."
How to estimate project costs - Mail (Postal) survey?,"This is something I've done myself... First, make sure you've got ""letter stuffing"" as part of the costs. Some places are happy to print, but won't stuff envelopes. I managed around 4/minute at peak stuffing rate. Second, allow tranches of surveys to be sent. Relieving the pressure on your print/send service will make things cheaper and more accurate, as well as allowing you to cut short if you reach the required response count from a given area. Split your tranches across all areas to keep a good sample. For example: Group recipients into areas. Assign numbers 1-5 at random within the groups. These are your tranches. You might hit the response level required by tranche 3, so you can cancel tranche 5 (4 will likely be in production already). If you think you won't hit the response count, you can bake a reminder into the sequence. Third, interpreting scanned responses still takes time. Will you be using data entry people or software? Budget accordingly to allow for exceptions in software. Is the response staying in-country? Do you have people there to do the scanning? Have you allowed for taxes, etc?"
"How are images, icons, videos, logos, etc. budgeted, and who chooses them, the developer or the client?","This will vary from client to client and will be based on their wishes, but can really be summed up as follows Client images The client will provide their own images for use in the project. They will sometimes want control over various other aspects, including palette and copy. In this case, these images remain property of the client. Client-specified stock images The client will select certain stock images to use. You will need to negotiate and define who pays for these as part of your bid/contract.  Suggested images The client will suggest images, and you will need to find appropriate images that meet their requirements. It is likely that you will need to pay for these and factor the cost into your bid/contract. If none are available from stock photo sites, you might need to hire a photographer/designer to produce them for you. No preference The client gives no direction on what images to use. In this case, you will likely be absorbing the cost yourself and will need to factor this in as part of the bid/contract. Of course, there are many more possibilities, but this covers the common scenarios. You might also expect overlap between them, as well as different levels of control within a single project (eg they specify a main image but leave the rest to you). With each situation, you will need to negotiate the image costs with the client, and factor them into your bid if they expect you to foot the bill."
Do I have to report income for small jobs?,"You are supposed to report all income earned from all sources.  Your tax liability will depend on many other factors. I am not a lawyer or an accountant. It will be best to discuss with a tax professional about this. It would probably be best to set up a sole proprietorship company (again, talk to a tax professional, accountant or lawyer about how to do this, and if it's the right thing to do). Your company is how you channel the payments, and then you have tax advantages of owning a business - in other words, you can write off expenses against your freelancing income to minimize your tax liability. EDIT based on the edit of the OP. How you report the income will depend on what tax form you file. If you are filing a Schedule C (Sole proprietorship), for example, there is a line for gross earnings and you don't have to specify the source(s) of the income, just the total amount.  I believe the 1040 form also has a line for ""other income"" and you may have to add an additional sheet to enter all the sources."
How do you charge regression testing in programming?,"I try to charge enough that I can do this work for free.  But some customers don't like this arrangement so sometimes I have to make other arrangements. YMMV.  The question really comes down to who gets to assume risk.  There should be a financial premium on assuming risk to help even things out a bit. Here's the basic issue: The customer doesn't want to get stuck with an unknown bill for a project. You don't want to get stuck with a whole bunch of work that brings your per hourly earnings down below what you can live on. Resolving this conflict requires adding on a basic third piece: What I typically do is offer a rate that includes, free of charge, bugfixes afterwards for a year.  That rate is double (!) my desired hourly rate.  In most cases, I spend no time on after-market fixes.  In a few cases I spend a lot of time.  I try to plan so that I spend about 2/3 of my time as billable under this arrangement.  This: Protects my interests and ensures I am making money. Protects my customers, ensuring they don't get stuck with large after-market bills. For some customers though, they don't like this arrangement, and it breaks down for very large projects, so I also offer another rate in those cases (not advertised and sometimes as low as 50% my initial offer rate) with the explicit terms that the work comes with no warranty.and that I will bill for everything.  On average I make a little less on these projects, but I also bear none of the testing and bugfix risk. TL;DR: I try to throw in these free of charge by billing at a rate that allows me to make more doing this.  For large projects, or certain customers, I may however shift the risk to the customer and offer a large discount.  I believe that this approach best meets the interests of all involved."
"On an EU invoice, will my Brazilian customer have to pay VAT?","According to HMRC's VAT section the rules for export of goods and services are petty clear.  In summary: In other words, if you are a UK company supplying goods or services to Brazil then VAT is not applicable, and you should ZERO RATE them. So, that's the EU perspective... In Brazil, they also have a tax on the provision of services - ISS = Imposto Sobre Serviços The best information I can find comes from KPMG as a PDF It looks like this is chargeable on the supply to the Brazilian customer, even if the supplier is outside of Brazil..."
What guarantees do employers/freelancers needs to take for big projects?,"If the project is big and costs a lot of money, it will not be given to startup or single freelancer, but to big company. It's highly improbable that it will be otherwise, but in that case, the client would normally want guarantees, so you'll have to deal with very large penalties for delays etc. In that rare cases you should concentrate on making the deal so, that it will not ruin you in case of failure. But you must know, that even big companies with >100k$ capital were ruined by such contracts. Contract penalties can extend to millions$. The more typical case: you are involved as subcontractor company or as a freelance part in the big project lead by some big company. Normally you are either paid per hours and do what you are told to do, or you have some little part of it, for fix amount$, and you have to service it for N months. In that case you should also analyse the contract carefully, if any doubt consult with professional layer, because it is not untypical that there will be clauses that would try to make you liable for a large sum of money in case of failure. If you sign something like that, and the project will fail, it's quite probable the company would try to make you liable to the very amount they can, so better not to sign something like that under any circumstances. Don't be make responsible for something you have no influence on (no matter how good you'll do your part, the project may fail for thousand of reasons)."
Dealing with potential partners,"There's a say: ""Verbal agreement is worth as much as the paper it's written on"" They already tried to take over your content, are asking for you to open doors to the market and are now asking to know your team. This is a clear take over. During the meeting they will exchange contacts with each one of your teammates and will try to do to them the same thing they tried to do with you. Someone will crack, someone will be enslaved and used. This whole thing seems very weird and shady. Here's how a good business deal is: See? absolutely clear rules and payment for work Did you get paid for the posts? Are you getting paid for the meetings? Do you have a clear participation on profits? If you answered no to all of them, they are making a sucker out of you."
Freelancer working in Asia for EU/UK companies,"To do it correctly, consult an international tax lawyer. (I'm not one.)  Based on the following tax treaty, you might be to do what you want without breaking any laws.  Have a look at the following sections of the UK/THAILAND DOUBLE TAXATION CONVENTION, SIGNED 18 FEBRUARY 1981. Please don't move to Thailand based on your personal interpretation of this treaty. Again, consult an international tax lawyer. "
Legality of providing freelance support for a product which my current employer previously supported,"It would likely depend on your current contract of employment. Your contract (assuming you have one) may restrict the amount of work you do outside your main employment, for example. If your employer is abandoning a product, the non-compete clause may not apply as they are no longer in that particular business. As Canadian Luke says in the comments, you should really discuss this openly with your employer. As you will be dealing with existing clients of your current employer, it's not something you can really expect to do without your current employer finding out. It may be in both your interests for you to continue supporting these clients. For example, your employer may not want to upset existing clients and it may be financially beneficial for you to keep supporting them. If this can be done without interfering with your main job, then it could be a win-win. I recommend creating a list of possible concerns your employer might have and coming up with some reasonable solutions to these before you initiate a discussion. For example, your employer might not want you to accept calls or read emails for this outside work during your normal working hours. A solution for this particular concern might be for you to have a different phone and email address for the outside work and that you only answer these outside of your main working hours. You will need to be realistic about how many hours this outside work will take and whether it can reasonably coexist with your main job. If the outside work is more than 10 or 20 hours a week one option might be to re-negotiate your main job to a permanent part time job (e.g. 30 hours a week) instead of a full time job assuming the outside work is financially worthwhile."
Security work as a freelancer,"Are you able to see people at your place? This might help lower the personal issues a customer could have about sharing security details with you. With a certain expertise and reputation it shouldn't be hard to even skip that part. I worked with many people I never met because they got recommended by someone I trust. What do you mean with interested? No experience yet? If not, you can start look into securing servers, those are usually remote from the office too, so it doesn't really matter where you work. Then you need to decide which kind of servers you wanna specialize on, Linux, Windows, all. Get to know the basic tools like OpenVPN, SSH login with certificates, Firewall-Rules, SSL/Https in Webservers like Nginx and Apache, port blocking tools like fail2ban, maybe things like XSS and SQL injections, depending what kind of security you prefer. From there your interests will take you in the right direction. Start training on an own server, either as a VM or a real one at a provider, help friends look into their setups, and so on. To really consult people you should know what you are talking about in general. You don't need to know all specific commands and it's okay to learn during the job. Security is more about planning ahead and preventing problems than actually dealing with live hacks, so you are not really on a hot schedule. You should have a broad knowledge of all possible security threats and either know how to handle those or who to use for subtasks you are not familiar with. For ""on-site"" working there are tools like remote desktop in the windows world or on linux you open a terminal anyway. That's not really an issue if the client trusts you."
"When outsourcing freelance work to foreign country, do I file a 1065, a 1099/1042(S)?","I eventually had to talk to an accountant. He told me that regardless of method of payment, my US LLC does not have to withhold taxes or report the payment as payments to contractors (1099/1042(S)) to the IRS; it is simply a business expense. He said this gets more complicated if the recipient is working in the US (regardless of nationality), but that is not my case."
Freelancing while being Employed in Germany,"Go to the ""Finanzamt"" of the ""Landkreis"" where you are registered to live (your ""Wohnsitz""). Take ALL your documentation with you. Explain this situation to them (again, backed up with the relevant docs). They will not try to trick you - completely trustworthy. But the answer could be complicated and bureaucratic, so get in writing what they say you should do."
How should I send an invoice to a European country as a freelance developer?,"I think your H1 status (H1-B?) is likely to be your biggest pitfall here (see later comments). Technically, the H1-B visa names the (single) company for which you are allowed to work in the US. Of course, your client is not in the USA so you may be in a grey area. On the other issues: As another poster said, you should have sorted this out beforehand, and had a contract to work to. If you have protected yourself with a time-limited demo, then your chances of getting paid are good. At this point you are on the horns of a dilemna ... if you collect the money, you can't risk not declaring it on your tax return. And if you declare it on the tax return, and your visa precludes such work, you could be packing up to go home real soon now. So I really suggest you do some research into the H1-B status thing. An hour or two with an immigration lawyer may cost you $500 -- but compare that to having your visa revoked. If the lawyer says ""you can't do this"" ... you may just have to forego the $6,000 and decide whether you deliver the product pro bono. UPDATE: I've done a bit of googling and found statements (from self-identified immigration attorneys) that doing work for companies OUTSIDE the USA does not affect your H1-B status. You may still want to confirm this for yourself, but it makes things easier. The other consideration is ... what does your sponsoring company in the USA think about this?"
"Who own the ""copyright"" or intellectual property for the code you have written?","Because you do not have a contract in place, I suspect there are too many variables for anyone here to give you a precise answer. Possible answers are: Some countries respect verbal agreements - thus even though you have not signed anything, they have asked and paid for work - what you hand to them belongs to them once you have been remunerated unless otherwise agreed. I would never recommend working without a contract - there are too many things that can go wrong - not just ownership issues, but if your code was to negatively impact the client, its not clear if its your problem or there problem. In my contracts, and contracts that I have seen, there is a UAT (User Acceptance Test) whereby client agree's to test something within 5 days (for example) and anything that is found broken within those five days is listed as a defect and fixed for free. Anything that is found broken after five days is a fault that the client cannot sue for and fixes are chargeable. The project scope should make clear what is in, and not in scope - Scope usually changes and thus changes can be charged accordingly (priced as a separate project/software release version). Best of luck!
Contracts will also help you get paid if the business takes your code without paying (I know of this happening)."
How to raise the price for friends?,"Simple, explain that it is costing you more in { time | resources | parts | tools } to continue operating the way you have been. Inflation happens, period. What I did for my pricing model is that my F&F rate (Friends and Family) is always $20/hr less than what I charge regular clients. Option two if you do not feel like raising your prices is offer to put them in the queue for your work, but it only comes after the regular paying customers get their work completed. If your friends do not like one of these two choices that both a) respect your time, and b) respect your income, then I would not consider them friends, and ask them to take their business elsewhere. You don't need negativity in your life with people not willing to pay you what you're worth."
Lack of Sleeping for Projects,"You should never neglect your health. You should sleep for about 6-8 hours a day to be healthy. You can end up in trouble at a later age. Plan out in such a way that you don't overwork and you need to skip your sleep. You can work for 8 - 10 hours a day and still end up finishing the project. If you end up with minor bugs you can speak to the client and ask for a few more days to fix the same. Clients do expect delivery on time and they are happy if you deliver a quality project in time. So if the work takes one week, depending on the project, take a few extras days, inform the client the project will be completed in one and half weeks. Don't fix on exactly one week, because there might be days when you will be ill and you can't take up work on that day. Always better to quote a few days extra. Definitely in the long run working continuously without sleep affects health. If it is absolutely urgent, and you need to deliver the project the next day, you can skip sleep for a day. I encountered a situation where I had to deliver an update (not a final delivery) to the client, and I got stuck on some issue. I didn't sleep that night, fixed the issue, and delivered the update. But if it is likely to repeat (skipping sleep) for a few day's, I would certainly not think of skipping sleep."
What percentage is fair for me as a graphic design subcontractor?,"This might do better on workplace if you are an employee.  If you are a freelancer with them you should come up with a rate and if they don't like it or there are no factors that make it worth it to you, move on. However I am going to flip this on its head and say ""suppose you mostly do freelancing but have an employee who does some things for customers.  How much to charge?"" For background reading you should lool at Writing my first business plan. How do I know what to put in the pro forma balance sheets and financial targets? You start off looking at fixed costs.  You say they have high fixed costs.  That works against you in this case.  Once you know what your full fixed costs are, then you look at production costs and overhead and see what is needed to make it work.  This is how you plan production costs and fixed costs against revenues. When I bring in subcontractors and agree to have them do work on a project with me paying them my minimum markup is 100%.  In other words I charge twice what I pay.  I do this because I offer additional guarantees and I may have to step in and fix things that have been done wrong, and I have low expenses.  I am also taking on all non-billable work relating to what was done by someone else so my risk and overhead are significant.  If I had higher expenses, my markup might be significantly higher. I do think that a 400% markup ($20 -> $100) does seem excessive, but without knowing the specifics of their business I don't know. However your concern as a worker should be ""is it worth your time to work there?""  If it is then it doesn't matter why, and how much of what you get out of it is money, or what they are selling what you do for.  If it is not, then you need a raise or to get work elsewhere."
Should I adjust my pricing based on my client's budget?,"Instead of lowering your rates, offer the potential client a reduced feature set or smaller scope of work for the the amount of money he can afford. Tell the client ""I charge $X for A, but I can do B (which is a Subset of A) for $Y"" That way, you are still getting what you deserve to get paid. If the client is happy with the smaller project, he can certainly save up and pay for the entire thing later on. If it's a web project, offer a site with fewer pages, or a standard template that doesn't require customization, or something like that."
Client asking me to do a coding challenge,"Sure, it's happened. It's similar to if someone said to you, ""I will only pay $5 per hour"" for something you know they can't get from any other qualified person for less than $80+. Just laugh and keep on moving. The fact you tell them, 'no' could motivate them to skip the requirement. You have to have confidence. No it doesn't matter if coding challenges are (relatively) common in the full time employment job hunting world. Don't do anything for free for somebody who hasn't even paid you a dollar. To put it all in perspective, there are potential clients who would pay you serious cash just to think about working on their project."
How to respond without hurting a potential IDEA business guy's business proposal,"I met some guys like this one in my work career til now.  What I usually do (and would do in your case) is: If the client is not happy with that there are many other freelancers that maybe would be happy to invest time on that millionare project with zero guarantee to get any payment at all... You don't have to be too nice or be afraid to offend him, just be normally gentle and professional.  If he is too bossy with you and you don't feel comfortable with him, don't work with him, say that you have other projects in your schedule and you won't have time for other big projects. About your edit: this is not a new matter about people's good relationships, in fact the ancient Romans were no stupid, they used to say ""Verba volant, scripta manent"", that literally means ""Spoken words fly away, written words remain"".  The Romans understood that about 2000 years ago, and I guess that your client knows that very well too, to the point that he doesen't want to engage a serious, professional and correct work relationship with you. He just wants to take advantage of you and this is not correct at all. In your place I would just say: ""I'm sorry but I got engaged in another long term contract and right now I am not able to work on your project, also I can't afford the risk to work for weeks or months without any real perspective to get a proper income"". Personally I would never work for a client like that. At this point I would not trust him even with a written agreement because if he is a rich person and he behaves like that with you, he could even use a lawyer to find some small pointless clause or reason to criticize your work or your contract to try to avoid to pay you."
Making quotations out of thin air,"Avoid these clients. Seriously, don't even consider working for clients such as this. If the client can not take the time to at least attempt to describe their issue as thoroughly as possible, especially in a written description, then they will not take the time to interact with you appropriately. A lack of any detail shows a clear apathy towards both the project and the worker. And that will ultimately translate to you tracking them down to get input, direction, and possibly payment. In addition to repeated reworking of things you've already completed because the client failed to describe things correctly to begin with. If you are at all interested in pleasing, seamless, beneficial client arrangements, simply do not quote/bid/estimate on a project with little or no description. The absolutely most you should do is ask for ""more detailed information"" before providing anything yourself. Vested clients want to eliminate as much guesswork as possible. It's understandable if they just do not posses the knowledge to describe an issue correctly or accurately. However, I have yet to run into a client that can't describe the problem they are experiencing."
Using client's idea to develop an app,"Obviously, I (or anyone here) have not been part of your negotiations or development, but I can tell you, you're only going to add fuel to the fire. You're also going to put yourself into a legally sticky situation.  You did yourself a disservice by not writing a contract/scope of work etc. At this point, you're both stuck. You also made a mistake by not charging him anything upfront. Try and salvage the relationship. If that doesn't work, consider this a learning experience. "
Client requests for extensive task information when invoicing,"I tell customers who ask for detailed itemization of time usage that ""this is not a service I provide"". If pressed, I note that tracking that level of detail for him would create administrative overhead for you, and that you would either have to tack that time on to his bill, or adjust your rates to compensate. Since your goal is to provide value to your clients, not paperwork, you've opted instead to not offer either option and instead just decline to provide the service. Of course, there is a risk that the client will prefer to find someone else who is willing to meet his administrative demands, but if they are happy with your services this is pretty unlikely. Once I've told customers I don't provide that kind of itemization, they have backed off right away, and it was a non-issue. "
Client threatening to sue me,"Don't be scared of that guy, there is no way that he can sue you, I assume you are talking about oDesk or something similar. When you register on that website there are some privacy and agreements that you and your client have to read. Clearly he is not aware that you weren't working for him under a real contract, that's just a contract on the website. Also, he didn't respect the rules of the website, once he accepted to give you one more week, then he had no right not to give you the money. Just ignore him and keep every evidence of your work for him, he cannot do anything about it, you're the winner. Head up, and focus on the next client."
What should I charge for a custom shirt builder web application?,"Some of the first considerations would be: How many times have you done similar work, what were your costs, time, difficulties. Can you offer a better web based design and ordering tool than the established competition: Printify, Broken Arrow, or CustomInk's modern design tool. You can't compete with great design tools available on the best sites, with a tool like Customly's simple designer (screenshot). Not only do you need your application to be easy to use and fully featured but it needs to be easily expandable and maintainable - it can be difficult to get the client to pay for so-called expected and ingrained properties that aren't externally visible and seem self-serving, a future convenience for the coder. Will this effort generate future business with many new customers, or only this one customer; and probably only this once. If you can amortize the cost over dozens of future customers you can sell usage of the software for a low monthly rate, or assess a low one time fee with a limited number of years of free updates. With web developer rates on the Internet ranging from U$10-U$200 what you can charge may seem to be pushed towards the lower end, don't let it be. Know what you must charge and how much you must make. Frequently it's useful to mention a minimum amount, i.e. regardless of what is involved you'll need to be able to bill at least one or two thousand dollars minimum, otherwise you'll miss larger jobs in favor of smaller ones. This is a polite way of establishing upfront that if they thought something was going to cost a couple of hundred dollars they'll need to try elsewhere, regardless of how simple what they propose might be. Be certain to charge full price for consulting - if you aren't spending time earning money from one customer you don't want to be wasting it offering free advice to another; you can always offer to subtract 10% of the consulting service costs from the final product price. There are various formulae for reimbursement, or offering a more attractive price. Charging an hourly rate certainly assures that you are paid for each hour, but there's likely an upper limit in the company's interest and they probably want a finished and working product. Charging a flat rate to do the work leaves you to do all that would be required (based on your experience with similar projects) sufficiently quickly to realize a profit beyond your expenses. You can only fully know an approximation of your expenses from considerable prior experience. Charging a fraction of the cost on the basis that you'll be able to sell usage of the completed application to future customers would offer the first company the most attractive price; but then you are in the business of promoting and selling this product to potential future customers. If your product is clearly better, easier to use, and offered at a lower cost, the barrier to acceptance and convincing people to switch from what already works will be lower. With so much competition you have a challenging road ahead: quality of product, service level, and projected confidence are rather intangible; but something you still want to charge for."
Asking client to pay bank transfer charges,"No. Client pays an invoice. It's up to you to calculate all costs in the invoice or pay part of them yourself. For example, I always pay PayPal's 4%, never ask the client to pay it nor I increase my price for 4%. I treat it as my running costs.  Read point 1 :)"
How much can an iOS developer charge?,"Not pertaining to iOS specifically, but freelancing in general, also as a citizen/resident of the USA, I would charge roughly 4 times the hourly rate you get from an employer. I've seen other freelancers charge around this much. So if an iOS dev is making 25EUR/hour, then as freelance, said dev would charge 100EUR/hour. This may seem high, but there are few reasons to charge this: Of course there is latitude in how much you charge, but hiring a freelance shouldn't be assumed to be cheaper for the customer, or more/less lucrative for the developer. The benefit of freelancing is freedom in working how you would like work, or working with someone who can work with or around you more easily."
Ex-employer wants to hire me after I send him a design,"No money, no final design. Full stop. You can meet with them to discuss what they're looking for, or refer them to your portfolio. You NEVER release a final product until you get paid or money is in escrow."
How do I balance the risk of pricing myself out of a job vs. not getting any work at all?,"You'd be better off trying to pick up some work through recruiters than ridiculously lowering your rate.  The longer you stay in projects where the client doesn't value your work, the more annoyed you'll become because the client will continue to be unreasonable.   Usually, this type of client is clueless and will work on the premise that you deliver million-dollar solutions at a fifty-cent price.  Raise your sights a little higher, and avoid cheap-skate clients like the plague!  I can't guarantee that you won't have some challenges along the way, but it's a better situation to have a challenge where you ""grow"" vs a challenge that stresses you out and only gives you the minimum reward."
"Hired as a contractor to start Monday, received unsigned contract Friday before with unmentioned terms","It's possible that the person who did the negotiating didn't prepare the contract and instead gave it to someone else to do without telling them the details of what was discussed. So it is possible that they aren't really trying to be deceitful as such.  Don't feel pressured into signing just because she is due to start work on Monday. You are under no obligation to agree to their terms and have every right to challenge them. If this negotiation takes longer, then the school must make a plan. They should have got the contract to you sooner. I would recommend approaching them with changes to the contract which match the verbal agreement that was negotiated previously. Talking to them about the new contract terms allows them to also discuss why there is insurance in there and why the schedule is as it is. You have every right to make changes to the contract and negotiate new terms with them. While this client's actions are not ideal, this kind of thing is common."
Client refuses to pay on Elance. No Escrow funded,"I'm sorry to say, but you can't. And I'm sorry again to say, but the people on Elance are right. They always state clearly when getting a new job to not work until the escrow account is funded. They even send emails reminding to not work until the account is funded. I once did something like this. I started working and finished before realizing the account was not funded. Of course, the difference was that I already did two jobs for this client, so I had trust in him. That doesn't mean I didn't wait for two weeks to get paid for a one-day job. The bottom line is they can't do anything, because technically that client respected the rules and you didn't. It's a hard blow, I know, but you must get over it and learn from it. And about getting the money, the chances are slim. There are a lot of people who want to take advantage of good people, and that client seems to be one."
Freelancing as Physicist / Mathematician,"A third area, in addition to @MichaelLai's first two, might be financial services. But, alas, that would also be lots (and lots) of programming. However, you'd also be developing models requiring lots of math. I have an ms in physics, but most of my work has been programming models for the financial services industry in New York City. For instance, binomial tree models (e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_options_pricing_model) to solve the Black-Scholes equation (e.g., https://www.hoadley.net/options/bs.htm) Take a look at those pages, and I think you'll agree that your math background will be put to pretty good use (albeit lots different from C*-algebras, etc:). Also, my experience is mostly contract programming in New York City, where financial services comprise a large segment of the city's economy. I know nothing about San Diego. And also, although contract programming is typically hourly, I've usually been expected to put in hours that amount to full-time work, or even more hours. However, on various occasions I've had fixed-price contracts, where you agree to deliver a product/project for an agreed-upon fixed price regardless of the hours spent. Then your hours are up to you, although the contract usually has a calendar time-frame for various deliverables leading up to the finished project. And that can be a daunting constraint, depending on how well your experience has prepared you to develop the model."
Are there any disadvantages of taking work based on a retainer?,"You are not informed properly, retainer money is not returned! This is true in the IT industry, especially programming, and some other industries like legal. 
In other industries, companies don't usually use the term ""retainer"" as they don't want to return unused money. That is why you will more often see them sell premium support or similar service which are not refundable. 
Take note that I am not capable of listing all services which return or not return retainer. I can only talk for my field of expertise - programming.  They are paying you to save your time for them and act on their requests immediately, not tomorrow, not when you have time, but right now.  For example, you save 5 or 10 hours a week for this client. If there is work, you work every day. If not, you can drink coffee or do other work in his time, but you are obliged to work on his tasks immediately upon they come! So he bought your time for the period of 1 month or 3 months or 1 year and you are not obliged to compensate anything. Just check a few of my last questions about retainer since I got great advises there.  And about disadvantages, the largest is that you are bound to this client and you have to work for him, regardless how interesting project you have aside. He bought you time and you have to serve him firstly and always, even if you planned to have casual Friday :). "
Should I settle for a percentage or keep with an hourly rate?,"This really depends on the percentage and workload. Getting paid in percentage is overall more risky then paid by hour - if you want more profit, you must assume greater risk. A bigger company will give you the option for percentage either to reduce their risk and their variable costs or most likely as the percentage model (%-model) would just cost less.  A smaller company or, for example, entrepreneurs which don't have much capital, mostly have to use things like participating interests models (including a %-model) as it reduces costs if f.e. the product doesn't sell as anticipated. However if the product sells well, there is a good chance of making a lot of profit and much more compared to if you would have been paid per hour. Another factor to consider is the overall workload. If you would have to do a lot of work at the beginning and would have less to do over the product cycle, lifetime percentage is always a good choice. See this simple example: Given this simple example, you would end up with an additional $13,000. However, the main purpose of this exercise is to show that if you have a smaller workload and higher earnings later (especially long term) where you don't have work anymore, it's definitely worth taking the risk. In conclusion, the %-model gives you the opportunity to earn more money compared to an hourly model, but it also has the potential to earn less instead. If you understand the business and its risks, it'd be worth opting for the %-model. As you said, you're working at the design, so this could be a good opportunity.  If you want to charge upfront as a basis, its totally up to you and your business partner. In Germany, it's not an unusual proposition.  As a personal tip, do take care of the legal part! Most business partners try to pull you out as soon they see that their %-model plan costs them too much. Do long-term contracts, not based on years. I've seen this dozens of times."
How can a company protect itself from technological theft when bringing on a freelancer?,"This is not just a freelancer problem. You have the same problem with employees. There are two parts to solving this problem - people and process. On the people side, it is important to hire reputable people, people who will sign an agreement and honor it. Background and reference checks can help here. Once hired, it is important to continue to educate about how loss of technology would hurt everyone and how to prevent such losses. Generally speaking, most technology ""leakage"" happens when an individual makes a security mistake. On the process side, it is important to manage critical information and critical technology. That can mean limiting the knowledge to certain people, monitoring how they use that information, and checking for any leakage. The technology protection process requires constant upgrading as new risks appear. You also need to consider how to recover from disasters and ransomware attacks. For an example of managing critical information, the encryption keys at a bank are kept broken into pieces and several people have to work together to put the keys together to load them into PIN pads or decryption boxes. No one person has all the knowledge. Finally, if your company's profit margin is that small, I would recommend bringing in people who can help your company develop products or services that can command higher profit margins. Leave the low margin areas for the Chinese and have a better life."
How should I deal with the inconsistency of incoming work?,"I would say that your rate is low.  If you remember, freelancers rates are higher than normal rates because with our work we have to save money for rainy periods. So for example, if $20/h is enough for you to live through the whole year and annual average of your work is 50% (50% of all your time), then your rate must not be lower than $40/h. This way, you will have money for rainy periods.  Do set your salary!!! If you earn $10k in one month, it does not mean you can spend it. No way. You can spend only your salary each month. This way, you will have salary from money accumulated in the previous months.  If you earned so much this year, you can reward yourself and take a large bonus at the end of a year. But you still have to have enough money for you salary in the forthcoming months.  I hope this helped.  PS. Many people like to live reckless life and like the idea that they can spend with no limits. At the end, this hits you back in rainy period. Freelancing is about freedom, not about being reckless and irresponsible. For that, it's better you stick to the job in some company.  "
Should I charge my client for mistakes I make?,"The only way you'll ever make money with design is to become familiar with and accustomed to value-based pricing. No client I've ever come across is willing to pay $150-$400 an hour... or willing to pay for 40 hours of work, at something ridiculous like $35/hr, when you've spent 30 hours of ""rough"" design exploration and only 10 hours actually finalizing something. However, most will gladly pay $600 without ever knowing it only took you 2 hours to design something.  When you start out.. that $600 may mean you only earn $10/hr because it took you 60 hours to finish a project... but as you improve your skill set and get better at estimating your time, you whittle that away and start making more and more money without really increasing prices.  Value-based pricing rewards you for being better at your job. The faster, more efficient you are, the more profit you make. Why should you charge an hourly rate clients will see as acceptable when you can do in 1 hour what other designers may need 5 hours to complete? Only value-based pricing is a viable model in my opinion. So, in general, with value-based pricing in mind, yes you charge the client for your exploration time. But it's up to you to be quick about things. The longer you take, the less money you make -- which is a different mindset than ""the longer you take the more the client pays"". The client pays the price you've bid/quoted... you have to ensure you are A) bidding accurately and B) not eating your own profits by taking too much time with projects. An example with value-based pricing:  A client approaches me for a tri-fold brochure. I know I can complete this in 3 hours tops... Client asks me what my hourly rate is. I simply tell then the cost for the brochure design will be $450.00.. the client is happy with that and hires me... It only takes me 2 hours to actually complete the brochure..... I make $450.00. ($225/hr) Same client... different tri-fold. I tell them it's the same price, $450. They are happy and hire me. This time I ran into a hurdle and it took me 4 hours to complete...  But those extra 2 hours I needed means I made less profit on this project compared to the previous one. I make $450.00 ($112.50/hr) Same scenario if pricing were hourly: Conversely.... the client approaches me and asks what my hourly rate is. I tell them its $150 an hour. They complain, whine, and balk. Telling me they generally only pay less than $40/hr. They expect to pay me the same rate they've paid others. As if every designer has the same abilities and skills.... but I'm not the same designer. So... lets pretend I cut my rate (which I NEVER would) to something like, say, $50/hr. Then I tell them it'll take 3 hours.. they are thrilled and hire me... It only takes me 2 hours... I bill the client for 2 hours.... I make $100.00 Second trifold hourly. I bid at $50/hr. Tell the client it will take 3 hours. I run into a problem and it takes me 4 hours. What do I do about that additional $50? Do I contact the client asking for more money than I quoted (bad practice) or do I eat that figure as well, meaning for 4 hours of work I only made $150, essentially only $37/hr. Either way I must upset the client and possibly lose their business or make far less than I estimated. Even in the best case scenario and the client is happy to pay for the additional hour without a problem... I make $200. Dollar amounts are fictions and have no actual bearing on my pricing. These are examples only and should not be seen as pricing advice. If you are billing hourly, you need to be honest and ethical and never pad your time. It's the only real way to remain in business and keep clients happy. If you are billing based on an agreed upon amount then the amount of time it takes you to complete something is largely irrelevant. Your'e being paid for your knowledge, experience as well as your skill, not just the time pushing a mouse around on a desk. For something like a logo project, which you mention, first you must know your overhead costs (electricity, equipment, software, rent, heat, water, etc). Then you calculate the approximate time needed multiplied by your hourly overhead... this gives you a minimum amount. After you have the minimum, it's a matter of market trends, current market pricing, depth and scope of the project, your area of expertise, etc to calculate the profit amount on top of the minimum you've calculated. This ultimately leads to a solid figure to bid/quote.  If you bid/quote a solid figure, the client has no worries that you will be asking for more money, and generally there's much less issue with payment since it's understood from the beginning. And it's up to you to remain within the time you've bid. Any additional time means you eat that cost, not the client. Other possibly helpful questions: Which is the most honest or ethical way to bill, hourly or fixed price? Am I supposed to be paid even though my work isn't used? Is it common to demand deposit/retainer to avoid payment disputes? Underestimated project: Do you charge the excess time? Whose responsibility is to give budget for job: Freelancer or Client"
How do I prove my source of income as a freelancer?,"Tax returns.  Neither Fiverr nor istockphoto are your employers so they aren't obligated to track your earnings or send you records. It's up to you to maintain income records.  Since these sites are not your employers no bank should need anything from them. The bank is treating you like a ""employee"" of these sites, which you are not. You are self-employed even if you use sites like fiverr and istockphoto to sell your merchandise/services. What the bank wants to see is a record of earned income... this is customarily done via tax returns for the last few years. You can also take your records from the bank and highlight deposits from these companies to further verify your income. I've never used fiverr. So, I'm not 100% sure about their payout method. But I do know istock simply deposits funds into your account when you ask for them."
Attracting clients who want web developer not designer,"When someone needs a website, in most of the cases, they have no idea that there is a designer and a developer, or someone who can do both things, they just look for ""someone who builds my good looking and functional website"", without making much difference between web design or web development. They are completely unaware of your skills, they don't even know what is Python, Javascript, or an HTML form, they want the result. So if you want to concentrate only on the development part you can still present yourself as ""someone who is able to build a site"", enstablish a collaboration with one or more freelance designer and then if someone will contact you asking for ""web design job"" (meaning the full development of the site from design to coding) you can talk and understand what the client needs, then you can communicate with your freelance designers, make them take care about the graphics and layout, and then when the design is approved you will start your part of the job, and the client will be happy, he will have what he needs, you will work on what you like to do and your designers will do the same. In this way you will also be able to get development jobs from your freelance designers, if they want to concentrate on the graphic part they will use your skills for the coding, and vice versa. You can also contact web agencies and offer yourself as a developer."
Handling client extras on the fly,"Personally, when I have a contractual agreement with a company, signed from the legal representative of the whole company as a single entity, I assume that every request coming from it is regulated in the contract.  So for every call and request that comes from any company office I assume that the caller asked to the boss or the supervisor for permission since I'm going to bill each request that takes more than 15 minutes. If you have the flat rate for the support it's ok, otherwise put in the contract that each request is going to be billed with an hourly rate Of $x. Sometimes happened to me that in some complicated case, I agreed with the company to have a single person reference and I could discuss and get requests only from this authorised person."
I am lost in between freelance and a steady job,"What do you need help with? Asking us should you quit your job? We cannot answer that.  A few advises.  If you plan to quit your job and do freelance, take this into consideration: Do you have enough money to pay bills for 1 year? Yes, 1 year.  Write down all your clients and count how many hours of work they all can bring in 1 month. Be realistic and lead by your current amount of work with them.  Think about how many clients you can surely attract in 1 year. Think about sources you will attract them from.  If you start freelancing, you may have to raise your price. Are your client ready to pay that price? You may lose more than half of them.  Write a note to your clients saying that you plan to do freelance full time and ask them to predict how much work they can give you monthly. You may be surprised.  The 1st year will be tough. Design is usually less paid in freelance world that programming. Thinking ""if  work 5 hours a day, I can make the same money"" is wrong. Can you make 25 hours of work weekly? Each week in a year? We freelancers always think in a way ""if I work 40 hours at this rate, I would be rich"", but it's hard to find full week of work every week.  Also think of all expenses you may have working freelance: extra office, extra costs on bills, etc. "
Logo designer and I cannot agree on final product. Do I still have to pay?,"That said, you can always negotiate and come to an agreement - let the graphic designer know you appreciate their efforts, but cannot use their work, and if they'd settle for 25% instead of 50% - under the agreement that you will not use their work in production. Graphic designers should always quote in terms of 'number of versions or concepts' because design is a very subjective and creative process - it could take months, if ever, for a client to be happy with a logo, and where does that leave a graphic designer in terms of being able to put food on the table?  However, graphic designers do this day in and day out - they should know how to use a contract. In terms of an ethical compromise, I did exactly this in similar situation with a Flash designer - they were talented, diligent and professional - but it became clear that they could not pull off the job to the acceptance of the client.    We discussed the situation - and I told the designer that the current circumstances were not their fault, I could not continue with the them and I would like an amicable resolution.    I asked what price would satisfy him - he told me, I paid it - and we remain on great terms ever since. The 'ethical' thing to do is work out a fair compromise with the designer. Although I could have easily 'not paid' the designer, I never regret that I took the time to negotiate a fair compromise - and looking back, I trust if you take that approach you will feel that you've done the right thing."
What are the pro and cons of working directly with a client versus through a consulting agency? [closed],"Having worked both for myself only, and through an agency, I have decided that I enjoy both equally, but for different reasons Now, for working for myself:"
Handling a client that doesn't pay after services are delivered,"Friend, you have screwed yourself on this one, unfortunately. The best you're going to be able to do to mitigate this situation is hiring an attorney in Arizona to represent you.  You will have to show that there was a written agreement made constituting an offer and an acceptance; that there was work performed per that agreement; and that the payment wasn't made.  Moreover you have to identify a responsible party (a person or a business entity) to name in the suit.  You may get a judgment in your favor from a court in Arizona, but that doesn't guarantee that you will ever collect a cent. The attorney's fees may easily make this not even worthwhile.  (easily $100-$250 USD/hr) In summary: You don't ever want to do work in this fashion again, where you lump a lot of valuable work into a final invoice for a client that you can't force a payment out of easily.  You'd be better getting paid for milestones throughout the duration of the project, so you don't end up in this position again.   Additionally, you don't release all project deliverables until you've been paid something!  Host them on your own servers.  But don't go into any other situation trusting that everyone is going to play 'nice'.  Your family depends on you, so don't make this mistake again. Lastly, posting bad reviews is a waste of time. Best of luck."
How do I bring up me charging for work?,"The money talk shouldn't be a 'dreaded' thing at all. It is absolutely fine for you to expect payment for your time and services, and as such is a important part of any business transaction. Any professional would charge for their time. Even if you don't consider yourself a professional - pretend. Conduct yourself as a professional. Here's a reply that demonstrates this in a professional tone. Just assume that he's willing to pay and tell him how much it will cost. Dear his name Thank you for showing interest in my services. I do offer tatoo
  designs, and this particular one would cost amount. Usually I charge
  percent up front and the rest when the final design is delivered.  Kind Regards,
your name You can add in whatever terms you want to use. Consider how many revisions the price includes - things like that. If you don't know enough about the design he wants, then you can ask him for more detail before giving him a quote. If he is unhappy with the amount, you can negotiate a price in the middle that you are both happy with. If you're just starting out, you can charge less if you want - whatever you feel like. But don't work for free. You want the client to value you and value your work. What you charge for your work is the value you put on yourself and your time. Giving your work away is saying to the client that your time is worth nothing, and they'll treat you as such. You want them to treat you as a professional and respect you."
How can you inform a client that a freelancer is unqualified without being a jerk?,"I agree with the others that it would be imprudent to say something overtly negative about Bob.  Though you might be able to get the client to realize by asking ""innocent"" sounding questions ""Why did you and Bob decide to skip XXX?"" ""Is there room in the budget for rebuilding XYZ because we went did ABC?"" etc. If you can get this over quickly, you might suck it up and do that.  But if this is a long term project, I think I would keep going to Bob with project stalling questions that he can't answer.  He wanted to be in charge and the client agreed to that - let them rue the day.  I would force him to make every decision and I would not give him a free web development education in the process.   If you believe Bob's decisions are putting the project in jeopardy you might say something to the client (or Bob) like: ""I understand I work for Bob on this project, but as a professional, I cannot, in good conscience, proceed per current direction.  You are a very important client to me and your success is crucial.  As a business owner myself, I also have a reputation for competence that I've worked many years to build.  I cannot put my name and reputation behind the current design. eCommerce is very complex.  There are laws and security issues... XYZ could happen...(blah blah blah say something to scare them straight here).  The last thing I want to do is become one more problem to you, but I am extremely concerned about this and feel an ethical obligation to bring it to your attention.""  On a side note: 
The situation has changed.  You had a direct client and now suddenly you are a sub contractor working for less money for Bob who doesn't know what he's doing.  The message your client is getting is that you were over charging them in the past and you're desperate enough for work to lower your rates and give up your authority.   I don't know the details but I wonder if the fact that you accepted this project as Bob's contractor for less money than you normally charge lowers your value, and the value/importance of the work, in your client's eyes.  You say the money doesn't matter, but I think it does.  Maybe not to you personally, but it may affect how your client perceives you, or reveal how they saw you all along.  Maybe something to think about...   I have learned that yes, it's good to be accommodating, but there is a line.  I would never (now that I'm older and wiser) let a client turn me into a sub contractor for someone less competent than me and pay me less than they always have.  You are where you are on this project but at the very least you can prepare yourself for how to handle things should this type of situation arise in the future, especially with this client. Good luck!"
Pricing for a remote client when going against local freelancers,"If your only edge vs other freelancers is price, you've already lost this battle. Why not offer some nominal service as a bonus, that won't tax you too heavily and keep the price consistent?   Also - promote yourself on what you can accomplish, and not just price.  Anybody can promote on being the cheapest, but the cheapest ain't always the best!  Real, genuine expertise is attractive to a potential client.  That means that when you're trying to get the business, you can't use a boilerplater template to try to get a new client because a boilerplate doesn't communicate how your expertise is going to specifically make things better for the client."
How smart is to disclose minimum hourly wage?,"There are many good ideas listed in answers above, and I agree with most of them.
However, to my mind, the main thing has not been spoken out: The minimum wage means minimal (or zero) profit margin, hence, it is associated with maximal risk I can afford. A single tiny step down, and it won't worth even starting. Hence, I have to be absolutely certain on everything else in oder to agree working on minimum hourly rate. Here are some considerations I should take before working on my minimal rate: Obviously, while discussing it with the client, you should not copy and paste what I have said above since it will sound rude. :-) You have to formulate it in a polite manner so that the client understood that your goal is to make your business relationship strong and reliable. Then you can mutually agree on lowest possible rates."
Is it possible to market myself if I dont want to reveal my real ID online?,"Anything is possible. Whether or not it is a good idea is totally dependent on your market. Our clients determine what our freelancing business will be. Trying to force them to accept what they do not want to accept means not much business. If you want to be private, the recommended solutions are to either get a ""Doing Business As"" name or to get an LLC. When I last did a DBA, it only meant going down to the county courthouse and paying a small filing fee. Once you have that, you can present that name to everyone, take payment under that name, set up bank accounts in that name, and fully function as a business with that name. You can also get a PO Box for that name and use that mailing address."
Freelance Contract to prevent exploitation?,"Contracts do not prevent exploitation. If a project relationship starts to argue over the words of the contract, that relationship is already soured and the best thing is to get out of it as fast as possible. The only thing contractually is to make sure that the contract has a simple ""get out of this mess"" process. The way to prevent exploitation is to pick trustworthy clients - ones that value us and are willing to pay for honest work."
Decision and negotiation of long term time-consuming job,"Well from what I can see, you are a good photographer and you have more work than you can handle. So this is a good position for expansion. The same happened to me in the programming field.  Declining a long-term client is never a good idea. Especially if a client is paying you your price and if he's a good client. So bringing another man to a team is a way to go.  Now, any client that worked with you before will not be happy if he sees another man working instead of you. They like you, your style, your quality,... It's up to you to persuade the client that by bringing another man, quality will not be jeopardized.  You have to make the client understand that you are too busy and working for him over your energy will produce bad quality. Tell him that you cannot sacrifice quality no matter what. So bringing an extra hand is the only way to preserve quality. This guy will only do the shoooting and you will do post-production. Even if this guy is good at post-production, you do not have to disclose that right now. If the client likes the output, he will not care who did post-production.  In cases like this, what worked for me is offering a risk assurance. I usually tell the client that if he is not happy with the work, that I will charge him zero. This usually calms them down as they know that they don't have to pay you in case your guy screwed up.  But take care of this!!! In order to preserve your quality, you will have to approve of every output because clients see this as your work. So train the new guy the way you do and examine every output he makes. If you don't like it, the clients will not like it eventually as well. "
I found out that a client is using the work I did for him to sell fraud courses,"You should take the routine to make any client (friends, family, or not) sign a well done contract (you can search here to find many posts about that) that contains also a releasing agreement on any material that he will give you or that he will use independently on your sites. In this case, I'm not a lawyer but I don't think that you can be involved in anything illegal, since you produced a ""clean"" software that he used for his purposes. It would be like if you build an empty site with Wordpress for a client, and then he fills it with copyrighted materials. Or if you sell cooking knifes and then someone use it for an armed robbery. In any case, if you will have a signed contract from the client will always be better."
How quickly do you write project estimations (if busy with other tasks)?,"Estimates/quotes take top priority here. Any delay in returning a bid/quote can instantly result in losing the project. I have yet to find a day where I could not spend some time writing up an estimate. Even if it took a couple days, I can work it in with what I currently have ongoing. Face it, no one schedules every day wall to wall. It's often very valuable to put in a few hours of overtime to finish a bid/quote.  If you are slow on delivering a quote, clients see that as a direct correlation to how you work on their project. If you are slow to quote, they will assume you are slow to respond when working."
"What to do with regular work disrupted by a sudden, unexpected offer","If the new client needs you to start immediately, I would ask you existing clients: How urgent is this?  I've had some things come up and I'm trying to prioritize.  Will it impact you negatively to push back our deadline to ____?"" You may be pleasantly surprised to learn they really don't care.  I have nearly killed myself over deadlines only to learn later they were pretty arbitrary on the client's part, and the client was clueless that I stayed up all night.  When I hire freelancers I let them know if something is not urgent because I know what it's like to be the freelancer, freaking over deadlines.   Most clients aren't thinking about that but they must be aware you have other clients/projects and if they like you and your work so far they'll probably be perfectly happy to let you coast a week or two. ALSO - one way to buy yourself time is to send them some questions that need to be answered before you can resume their work (and will take a little thought on their part).  9 times out of 10 they won't get back to you for some time unless the work is truly urgent.  Maybe I'm a bad person but I have had great success with that technique - just bounce that ball back into their court and and get cranking on the new client's project. FINALLY - do you have any personal days you can take off from your 9 to 6 job?  If so, you could use that time to get things under control.  May be a downer to use your time that way but it could also launch you into new work that may ultimately free you up to quit your day job..."
What's a fair price? and how to point that out?,"I don't develop in Ruby but I am familiar with it.  For the functionality you're describing, Ruby or not, you've spent a ridiculous amount of money. There are PHP guys who'd work for $15/hr (I'm not one of them!) and for the price you've paid so far, it would have bought you almost 450 hours of development time.  Perhaps you are working with a digital services ""agency"" that is greatly marking up the price of their developers. As for pointing it out - you've already agreed to it.  Maybe the best thing you can do is to get all your source code and find a less expensive option for further work.  You've spent quite a bit for an app that doesn't do anything useful yet."
How do I fire a client who is asking the impossible?,"You need to remember that you are the expert, not him.  As an expert, you should provide your client with a document explaining the technical limitations and, if possible, cite authoritative sources that explain why it's impossible with { current technology | current hardware | current man=power | current laws }.  I would try to meet with him one more time, and simply explain to him one last time, ""Hey, this isn't going to work because of reasons A, B and C. We cannot accept anymore money, as money is not going to fix the issues preventing this from happening. It's not us, it's {insert reason here}."" If he doesn't listen this second (or third) time, you'll just need to walk away. It's harsh, but freelancers should not be walked all over.  I have found that impossible problems kept me up at night, and it messed with my health because of that. Learn to say no, and stick to your guns. Your subordinates will thank you."
Is good practice to hire a headhunter or marketer?,"I've been offered the services of lead generators, but for my business, they wouldn't work; they were in a call center in another country, wanting to cold call a bunch of businesses. That's not how I work. In your business plan should be information about how you are hoping to attract and keep your clients. Make sure you stick to it! It is possible that head hunters work for your industry, and I respect that... But for my business, it would be a kick-in-the-face to my customers, and the types of customers I want to attract. Another thing to be wary of is how will these headhunters know how much you charged a client, or that the client is the right fit for you? Will the head hunters get a commission everytime you sell work/services to that particular client? It seems very shady and vague as to what it would account to. What I recommend is creating your own network, and using clients from there. Be it other freelancers, or just friends/family. Give them a kick back (i.e. a percent of the sale, a nice dinner, etc) for referring customers, but leave it at that. You are the one that then works on the relationship with your client, and you shouldn't need to be at a debt to someone else just to keep a client."
How can I make a monthly maintenance pricing structure work?,"I provide flat rate monthly support options for custom software I build. It includes: The amount is different for each customer, because some applications are more difficult to support than others. Also the pricing depends on how quickly I guarantee a response - some are satisfied with 2 business day response, while others are looking for a response within 24 hours, any day of the week. Things you'll want to address in your agreement: Also, be cognizant of how much time this will really take. I set aside 25% of my time every month in case there are support requests, and I schedule other project work assuming only 75% availability. If support is needed for a client, I want to make sure I can still meet my regular project obligations. And I am careful not to take on more support clients than I can handle. Right now, I would not want to have any more than 4 support clients at any given time. Again - your circumstances may mean different limitations but consider what those might be."
Is there any guideline for invoice numbering?,"With invoices, the important part is that they are unique across your company - in this case, you. etc. When you receive documented payment (i.e. a cheque or e-Transfer) where there is a memo field, 99% of the time the memo contains the Invoice #, which is unique just for you. This helps with tracking which invoices are paid, and which are not."
Do you own the right to publish someone's work after you pay them?,"Unless your contract specifically states that you own all rights or the right to resell/redistribute the work... then NO you do not have the right to resell or redistribute anything under any circumstance. If you do not have rights, then adding a ""credit"" is meaningless. However, a contract can stipulate that reselling or distributing is permissible if a credit/attribution is included. Creative Commons licensing often has this stipulation. In short.... It depends upon what the contract agreement for the work states. Without a formal contract or by default, the artist owns all work he/she creates and you have no rights to resell/distribute anything (at least under United States laws - laws may be different in other locations)."
How to deal with a customer who get work and didn't gave payment?,Most freelance sites have an arbitration clause for this type of thing. Screenshot the logo being used and contact the proper support channel on said freelance website. It'll take a while but they usually either succeed in getting you paid or in the client ceasing to use your work.
I grossly under estimated my costs for a job and want to renegotiate compensation. Should I?,"No matter how you present it, that is blackmail. And I very much doubt a bank did not let you sign an NDA which prohibits you from using this data elsewhere.  Fixed price is exactly what the name implies: fixed price.  What you can do is create an overview of the work and costs and propose a new compensation, while not in any way holding back on delivering what you promised. If you're lucky they be willing to compensate, if you're not lucky you can take this lesson to the next project. "
How to deal with sudden health problem,"Get the help ASAP! A help that you can monitor and see (ideally in the same town as yours). Let this guy handles urgent work until you are better. If need-be, pay him so much that your margin is at the positive zero.  However, talk to your clients and try to postpone those with non-urgent requests. For others, use your help mate.  Aside of this, this has proven that your clients are a****les. You are good just as long as you can deliver. When you are out of order, they replace her. So this has proven you that you need more reliable clients, those that will treat you as a human. "
When is a job too small for meetings?,"I like this question: I struggled with the exact same thing with meetings in general. Clients one hour away asking me to join in on a meeting. I usually ended up spending an afternoon with 2 hours travel and 2 hours meeting.  So these days, I'll try Skype first. 
If the client doesn't want Skype I'll explain that I will need to invoice the time because the size of the project (and my quote) normally don't include face to face meetings. 
Most clients will then decide Skype isn't so bad after all, others understand my predicament and are willing to pay for my time. "
Should I charge the client for long meetings in person when he pays me on a per-project basis?,"He says that he wants me and his design team to work together and our agreement was only for programming, not for design (he would provide
  the flow and images). This implies a change of project scope.  If he is talking about a single day, then I suggest you consider a separate invoice for your time - apply a discount since some of your time is paid under the existing contract. Present the customer with the quote, explain to him the additional costs help cover your travel time, and your hours of work which were previously flexible are less flexible. Perhaps not charge first time, but explain to him that any other onsite visits will be chargable. Working with customers, like any relationship, can be tricky. You don't want them to waste your time, nor do you want to under sell yourself. Consider a rate for offsite work, and consider a rate for onsite work, and share that with the client. Explain that you have expenses to cover just like they do and the flexible working practices (like location/time) help you to offer a cost affordable service. When your working practice becomes less flexible, you have to adjust the cost accordingly. If the customer balks and walks, examine your contract and find the exit clause. My contracts stipulate that my contract can be cancelled immediately if the project is cancelled. If your contract is the same, their walk should cost them some money (and cost you the chance of any further work from them for the next year).
Best thing though is to avoid rocking the boat - find compromise - especially if you think there is the possibility of additional work to follow. When you talk with the customer - smile - be pleasant - your body language helps just as much as the words you use. Your customer did not wake up one morning deciding to make your day bad - their requirements changed so work with them to help them deliver the goals and you will profit along the way. Lastly, for your next contract, include an hourly rate for onsite visits. Perhaps budget that 20% of your time will be onsite. If/when the customer asks you to be onsite, then go, but advise them that after x number of hours/days onsite, your time becomes chargable. I never say no to a customer - I just become more expensive, it gives them something to think about before they ask me. Best of luck"
Hired for work but problem was fixed by the client's hosting,"Absolutely! If you did the work you were expected to do, and there was an agreement in place beforehand (even verbal), then I'd expect you to send them a bill. This client may decide not to pay it, given that ""you didn't fix it yourself"", but you  still need to show that your time is valuable! Hopefully, lesson learned. In a previous job, when I was working for a tech shop, we would have people trying to come in for free advice all the time! I'd offer one or two sentences for a solution that people in the know would understand, and if they were asking for more details, I'd explain our hourly rate. Some people wouldn't bat an eye at the cost, others would get defensive and try to work around it. Stand your ground, and stick to your guns - you didn't learn all your skills for free, just to give it out for free to everyone who asks, right? In the future, I would explain with the quote that you expect X Y and Z conditions to be met, in order to facilitate you completing your job as close to what the quote says, as possible. If you need to overhaul a web site, explain you will need Admin access to the hosting service to do your job. You are free to explain why, but you need to know what you need to get the job done, as the professional. When I do web site consulting, I know my limits, and I ensure the client understands this (i.e. I don't do any design work at all - check my blog, it's just the default theme). I can do all the server back-end stuff, and run quite a few sites this way, and tell the client they need to hire a professional to do certain things that I can't, and I encourage them to have the professional contact me. I allow them supervised access, or I ask for the files to be FTP'd to me directly, then I'll post it. As the Server Admin, it allows me to do backups and cover my ass in case the other professional messes something up, in particular. If you are doing lots of free work, the client is going to expect you to keep doing free work, even outside the scope of what you can handle. Stick to your guns, charge after a certain amount of time, or else explain why you can't continue as previously planned."
How to start & who should start first interview over Skype?,"From what you have said it sounds like they haven't decided to use your services for their project yet, but they wanted your contact information should they choose to use your services. Now that you have sent them your Skype information here is what you should do. Then all there is to do is wait for them to contact you, they haven't decided whether you are the right person for the job.  Something that you can do in the mean time while you are waiting for them to contact you is study up on their company so that you know who they are and what they are about (even who they are if it is an individual) it helps to know who you are talking to sometimes."
How do I know my freelance team working at home?,"You cannot control if they work, nor you should. You should control their result! Make a good system of tasks and milestones and make work-hour calculations for each task. If they are beginners, add some percentage to it and tell them to stick to that calculations meaning that they will be paid for those specific work hours only. All hours above that is unpaid and it should be OK since they are beginners.  When working with seniors, then you should give them each task to estimate their own time of implementation. Compare it with your estimation and try to see why they estimated more or less time. Lower estimation does NOT always mean they are better then you, it can mean that they missed some facts in the logic. After that either try to negotiate they are paid for their estimation or you can allow them some overhead to their estimation. This way, you will see if they have result. This is all that matters.  "
How to determine percentage of time home office used for freelance,"It's probably reasonable for you to make a rough estimate of the percentage of business use for your home office and Internet. You could keep a diary for a week or a month, noting down your hours for personal and business use and then extrapolate these numbers for the whole year. There is no easy way for the tax department to check the actual percentages so they need to rely on your honesty and are unlikely to question your estimate unless it seems excessive (e.g compared to what others claim). As long as you can explain how you arrived at the percentage amounts, you should be fine. You should probably get some professional advice about the tax implications of claiming your home office as a tax deduction. In some jurisdictions, this isn't always a good idea. In Australia for example, home owners have a capital gains tax exemption on the home they live in but claiming a home office as a tax deduction can affect the exemption with potentially huge financial implications."
how does hourly system work? How does the client know how many hours we worked? [duplicate],"That's a good question, but I don't think there's any purely logical answer to it. A surprising amount of business is still conducted on the honor system (with each side taking different things on trust). I have freelanced primarily in editing for print publications, and a little bit in design and writing. Some of my clients want an hourly fee, and others want a per-word or project fee. Some who work with hourly fees put a cap on the number of hours I can claim. Sometimes there's an arrangement that if I think I'm going to go over the maximum, I should talk it over with them, and if there's a good reason, they'll usually increase the hours. I'm sure if I spent a ridiculous number of hours on an easy project, a client would just not hire me again. I have never had anyone ask me to prove how many hours I spent on a task. Really, if a client wanted some kind of proof of hours, it would be up to them to ask for it at the start. No matter what payment system you use, somebody is taking a risk. I think it's just one of the ways freelancing is different from staff work. In the long run, both freelancer and client are asking ""does this benefit me, and is it worth what I put in?"" as long as the answers are ""yes,"" the exact number of hours may not matter."
Deciding budget of a project which does not have exact requirements,"Well you already answered to the first part of your question by yourself. There is no real way to tell the budget.  Besides that, in my experience I always tell the client without any requirements which should be at least a small scope statement.
In addition you could provide your customer with examples or ""price ranges"" from your existing portfolio.  However without any requirements it is impossible to set up a correct budget.
If a customer really want one, I prefer giving him examples by (making up) sample requirements or portfolio items and their approx. costs."
Freelancer charging for debugging,"If the contract didn't specify what the deliverables were, then you are forced to negotiate that later. In this case, you have conflicting deliverables - so many hours of work, vs. fully debugged effort. So, you need to negotiate which deliverable is satisfying the contract. In most cases with software development, it is not possible to guarantee all three of ""fixed price"", ""hours of work"", and ""fully debugged product"". In most cases, to get fully debugged product, the price and hours of work are open ended as bugs can be found in almost every product out there and can be found years later. Most software is delivered when someone decides that the remaining bugs are acceptable for today."
Is it ok to publish job openings on my LinkedIn profile to try to earn hiring commissions?,"In short, the answer is 'no', it's certainly not inappropriate to advertise potential vacancies on your linkedin page, but you need to understand that at that point you're basically moonlighting as a stunted recruiter, passing suitable candidates along to other recruiters who claim  that they'll pay you a small finder's-fee for helping them to place a candidate. Given how low the rate-of-return will be (your best candidate will be up against many other candidates), the potential to get screwed over by the recruiter deciding not to pay you (which happens often), the potential for reputational damage when your contacts realise that you're acting as a recruitment consultant on the sly and the strong probability that your company won't take kindly to you touting yourself as a headhunter for their direct competitors, I'd suggest that you don't do it. It's simply not worth the hassle."
Declined project,"You perhaps jumped the gun a bit. The way you describe it, I see no red flags - but a couple of orange ones. With a non-technical client, the potential for the exact type of disagreement you describe is quite large. For them, IT might be uncharted or previously badly charted territory - so they now over-compensate by attempting to micro-manage the process. A way forward could be to demonstrate that you actually have their best interests at heart; that you choose your tools to get the job done faster and better - and being completely transparent about progress having a short feedback loop. Having said that, whether one is successful often depends on the personalities of key people; stubbornness or pig-headedness is pretty much impossible to navigate satisfactorily. Were I in your shoes, I would have proceeded with the client - only stopping if it became obvious that a clash of personalities would prevent you from delivering successfully."
Client hasn't paid in full can I take down the site?,"If you are paying for the hosting server, I would say you have every right to pull the site down for breach of verbal contract, if only for hosting it. But as others have said in the comments, your best bet is to contact a lawyer and find out exactly what rights you have in the locality where you do business, since this varies from country-to-country and state-to-state. I would put into writing what you are requesting, what you did for that money, and what the consequences would be should they choose not to pay you the full agreed-upon amount. Sometimes that's all it takes. If not, you'd have a case for small claims court. Accepting a buyout seems like you are agreeing to take less money for the website. This, to me, means you cannot take the site down or file any sort of claim against the client. I would only do that if I felt it was in my best interest to continue working with the client. Whatever you do, you need to get it in writing and ensure both parties agree. I have a clause in my contract that stipulates I may take down the website if payment isn't received within 60 days of invoicing. Clients are contacted multiple times prior to that deadline and reminded of this fact, and consideration is given if there are provable hardships, but only for so long. I have pulled down websites for late payment just a few times, and only once has a client not turned around and paid immediately. Treat your business like a business, and you'll find it garners more respect from your clients!"
Can client demand a refund for software that fails specifications?,"Obviously, the following is not legal advice, but just some general advice from a seasoned freelancer / consultant: It looks like your client is right in demanding a partial refund, given that you promised to deliver in accordance with the specifications. If you don't give them a refund, they can send you an arbitration demand and they'll basically sue you, just not in court, but in private arbitration. My recommendation in such cases is to talk to the client and try to be as accommodating as possible -- perhaps there is a way you can satisfy the remaining 10% or perhaps you can reach some other agreement with the client. I'd highly recommend avoiding litigation. If you can't make it right for the client, then I'd suggest giving them a refund."
Can I take my client to court for non payment of invoice before invoice is due?,"It is my understanding that in the United States, if you have evidence of an intent to default on payment or a contract, you can start the legal processes of repercussions due to that default, i.e. small claims. Certainly someone stating, in writing  ""I won't pay"" is evidence that there is direct intent to breach any contract for payment."
How to tell client I cant do any more changes till they pay invoice?,"Assuming you have a contract stating the fixed price and the three changes, you simply refer to that very contract. Having delivered the contractually agreed upon work, I am happy to work on further refinements. However, this will require payment of invoices and agreeing on a future hourly rate. Insist on an hourly rate, as this benefits the client as well as you. Continuing in a fixed price mode most often leads to a souring of the client relationship, as they naturally try to extract as much additional work from you as possible, often with no issue being too small. Agreeing on a pay-as-you-go hourly rate means every change costs them money, which limits their nice-to-haves and will result in a more rapid final delivery and probably avoids ending badly."
"Inflated business area, what to do?","First of all keep in mind that freelancing always is a risk. Sometimes things are going well, sometimes not. Sometimes I love to be free and having no boss, but sometimes I really hate the responsibilities and problems which you only have as a single freelancer (you probably know). I was in a pretty similar situation and here is how I got out of it: Keep in mind that freelancing can be hard. It takes many years to build a successful business and if it is not working than you have to change something dramatically.  If nothing helps anymore give up your business and join a company fulltime for a while. It may bring new perspectives into your career."
"I am a US citizen living in the US, can I freelance for a UK company?","It is perfectly acceptable to work from the US for a UK company.  You will need to invoice the UK company from a US entity (either Inc or self-employed), paying the taxes at a state and federal level in the USA. You should call your state's small business administration (sba.gov on a federal level) and ask for advice on how to get set up."
"Freelance programmer's monthly fees, expectations too high?","Ah, the good old fashioned ""stuff works and never breaks"" assumption from a non-it manager. First up, DBA requirements. Advise them that if they do not wish to procure DBA support from you, they will need to provide their own DBA. Ensure that your terms of service/sla/etc do not include DBA support as part of the package.  Next, general support requirements. I would suggest creating a realistic offering at a fantastic rate, but any support outside of this limit will be billed at a premium. To prevent new features being demaded as part of support, ensure scope documents are clearly agreed upon.  Onto development. Offer additional development at your standard rate, hourly. Include a detailed SLA for development activities. Once you have all of these in a solid SLA, have the customer sign it off. Now you have covered yourself in the event the customer unplugs the server and breaks everything, and they will have areed to pay you for their own foolishness."
Advice about the transition out of freelancing for a long term freelancer,"I don't know if I am going to properly answer your questions because I am a convinced work-on-your-own person :) but I am going to tell my personal experiences and impressions on that wide subject... I have been freelancing for over than 20 years now, and during these years happened that I was offered a few times to enter a company as employee and therefore close my own business. Even though the employee position seemed more secure and comfortable for many reasons, each time I did not accept and I opted to keep the freelance-client work relationship, and in the end I was right to keep it because the secure position with years got weak and (some of) the companies was forced to fire many employees due to world or sector crisis, but I still kept and keep working nowadays with the same companies, because they pay me per job when they need it, and I am not a big fixed cost for them no matter how the businesses goes. Also for me is not comfortable at all to re-enter to work in team inside the companies, for many reasons:  About the age factor, it is very true that after a certain age is very difficult to find an employee position inside a company because they propend to get young people (also for taxes discounts), so if you have this chance think very well if catch it or keep going on as freelance. I think about that too a lot, what would be like in 10-20 years from now? I am on my 40's and I am completely aware that I can't keep intense work rithms as when I was 20 or 30, also many young people are showing in the business with their freshness and enthusiasm, but I don't worry too much now because I have experice by my side and people trust me as a reliable person and for now I have no problem getting and keeping clients at me (for what are my possibilities as a single person). If you want to keep one foot in the freelance world and worry for the future or lose passion, I can suggest you to differentiate your business and knowledges, don't just stick to one or two competences but become familiar with more things, that will be also more interesting to move in new areas. Also because a table stay stable (sorry for the rhyme) the more legs it has. If a table has 4 or more legs, when you cut one leg, it still stays up in some way, this is also how many should be your streams of earnings. For example with time I developed many skills and I work in different areas for very different clients (BTW I always wondered if this is a good or bad thing, but that kept me always with works to do and incomes), I can be a pure programmer, a pure designer, a pure photographer, a full-stack developer, or all of these togheter, which often happens (I'm also certified in some of these areas), so I always find something to do. But as I said before, I'm one person and I'm not 20 anymore, and sometimes I feel burnt-out of stress and tasks to do, so since some time I am trying to have a side business with my own commercial company applying my knowledges for myself this time and not for others. I keep freelancing with good clients and and tring to grow other areas of business hoping that with years going on the freelance part of incomes will be less and less and the commercial part will become the main income. Maybe you can try to do a part time employee with this company (for example 2-3 full days a week) and see how it goes and if you find yourself comfortable or not, at the same time you can keep your good clients and work for them in the rest of the time. Then you will decide what is best for you, possibly it will be a very good decision and a very good place to work for many years to come, and I really hope so for you if that is what you wish and decide to do. All the best!"
How to bill client for rendering time?,"Charge your normal rate - because, as you say, it prevents you from doing other work. Clients generally accept they're buying your time - so having varying rates could potentially open up a whole new can of worms. Keeping it simple with one rate for your time seems the best option for both parties as it enables more smooth collaboration."
Should I disclose that I am freelancing to my employer?,"Are you living in a country with good legal protection of the worker? If yes, then I strongly say DO disclose. I am worried that if I disclose this to my employer, they will think I'm going to leave one day. This is good! He should know that his employee is so good that other clients pays him for his skills. He will respect you more. Why would your employer pay you if no one else wants to pay you? I'd say this will make you better.  I have 2 part-time workers helping our team. They work in a large company which has the same rules. They asked for permission to work for me, the company said OK. They are now more respected since others heard that they are so good in their field that someone else (our team) is paying them for their services.  I am required to disclose the activity to them and have to fill out a business activity form every year describing all of the clients I work with and how much I'm making,  Again, this is in your favor. Let your boss see how many clients you had and how good you earn. This is an excellent proof to ask more money from your boss or ask for better position. If I saw my contractor involved in some large projects which turned our well, I would not think much to give him a promotion in my own company.  But follow these rules: Ask the boss should you ask about every new job at odesk or you simply have to ask permission once Under any circumstances DO NOT let your boss think that freelancing is more important or that you are under-achieving at work because of the freelancing. Your full-time job must be no.1. If you have hard private project, then cut from your sleep or your friends time e.g. your private time. At your work, you must always be good, rest and concentrated. Even if you are not (can happen sometimes), let no one notice. Many people pretend being exhausted because they work too much, but this should not happen in your case.  Do not take sick leave so you can finish private projects. This can be tracked easily.  Do not complain how little you work at your own place. You should earn ""little"" because your boss is paying you full time, not your productive time. Freelancing pays for your productive time. If you think you work too little, leave that company. In the end, no matter how good and lucrative freelancing may sound, I advise you to stay at this company for 1 year at least. You will soon see bad sides of freelancing, and you do not need to be without income when they happen (yes ""when"", not ""if"", as they will happen eventually).  "
Billing Hourly - Include Client Specific Research and Communication?,"That's how long these things take. Just for documentation write-up, my minimum estimate is an hour a page, excluding research and drawing of figures or graphs. Easily longer for high density pages. I'm not surprised at an email taking half an hour. Especially since it is also necessary to check grammar, spelling and punctuation. You are correct to charge for research and communication time. Communication with the client is a deliverable - you are giving them your expertise. Just because its in the form of an email doesn't mean it's cheap. "
How do I determine what my time is really worth?,"Your time is as valuable as you make it. I started at $20/hour, then when I hit capacity for a few months, bumped my prices to $35. Once I hit work capacity for a few months, I jumped to $50, then $85. I've been stuck at $85 for three years now -- although I might be able to charge more, $85/hour is more than enough to keep me happy. It's all about supply and demand. If you're in demand, increase your prices until you start to see demand fall off."

How to decide the price for an iOS app for freelancer - feature/function basis or complete project or hourly?,"Add up all the feature cost values to get total project cost. Add up all the feature build time values to get total project time. Explain dependencies in your quote/bid -- i.e. ""Feature C can not be completed until Feature B has been implemented and tested"". or ""Feature D through F must be completed simultaneously for a stable end product""."
EU resident working as a contractor in the US,"I'm not a tax professional, which is who I think you really need to speak to. I do believe any form of US business (LLC, S-Corp, Sole Proprietorship, etc.) is going to require you pay US taxes. You can't receive income in the US and not pay taxes in the US. A Sole Proprietorship is still a business entity even though it's only a single person. Similar to how an single-member LLC is still a business entity even though it's one person. The only way to avoid any US taxes on income is to not receive income in the US and receive it in your home country - i.e. client pays international invoice. Unfortunately, the fact that you are going to be be required to pay US taxes may have factored into compensation negotiations. If the inability to pay international invoices was presented after negotiations then you may be able to revisit negotiations. Otherwise, you may be out of luck."
