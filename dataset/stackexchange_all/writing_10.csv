"The ""Rules"" of Writing","This may very well be the most popular ""rule"" of writing.  It refers to the idea that it's better to ""show"" an event as a scene, rather than simply ""telling"" the reader what happened. In my opinion, this is mostly sound advice: On the other hand, sometimes there is information that the reader needs to know to understand the story, but forcing that information into a scene would divert the plot or bore the reader to tears.

"""Dear Stack Exchange, I am very disappointed in you"" - How to construct a strong opening line in a letter?","""Dear SE, I don't even know how to express how disappointed I am in you--literally. Because I don't know all the facts. But all the indications I've seen make me fear that the full facts would only make my current disappointment even greater."" Thereby: Injecting some smartass humour, but also Expressing how huge your current disappointment is, while Acknowledging we don't know all the facts yet, even though What we have heard so far is pretty damning indeed, and furthermore Stressing things look very bad and it would take a very surprising save on their part to fix things Oh, and they should really show up and own up to this epic fail on their part. ASAP. At the very least. And it's absolutely not enough--just a start."
How do you write a Stack Exchange answer?,"This is something that is relevant across all sites. You should be used to markdown and know at least the basics: Put your most relevant points in the start and make them bold so that people will know at a first glance whether they share your opinion or not. Don't post a wall of text without any highlights and breaks. If you prefer not to use bold text and headings that is okay on most sites as long as you use paragraphs.  If you don't know what you are talking about people will see through your lies quite fast. There are many experts and using false data or drawing false conclusions will be detected quite fast. This is especially true on very specialised sites, such as for example StackOverflow, but you will also find experts about any topic that you are talking about on sites like WorldBuilding.  Most sites prefer to get to the point as fast as possible and not beat around the bush. There are differences though. For example on WorldBuilding many people love to read stories. If you phrase your answer in a in-universe or in-character style you can basically talk as long as you want. On technical sites like StackOverflow people don't have the time to read through long texts. Writing is probably somewhere in between as people spend a bit more time on reading in general and normally don't have a problem that needs to be fixed now.  On RPG you can find that many people reference guides and rules in a specific style, by mentioning the book name and page number and then using the citation markdown with added emphasis on the names of an ability/ rule/ ... and the important words on which they focus later.  On RPG, especially when talking about D&D, there is always the option to say ""the DM decides"". It's a non-sensical answer if you have spent time on the site as it's always applicable - the gamemaster can always change anything. That is not the kind of answers people are looking for. They want rules. Rulings can be made by anyone. Answers only referencing the option to make a ruling as the DM will get downvoted. But answers who explain why they would rule a certain way can get highly upvoted, as that is important information.  On WorldBuilding you should keep in mind that the square-cube law is not your friend when designing big creatures. The bigger, the more muscles and more dense bones are required, making the weight a bigger problem, which is why animals are capped at certain points in size. You know this rough rule if you spend some time looking through creature-design questions. It's an easy way to answer, but most of the time people expect more, as it's basically the same as ""The DM can decide"" on RPG. You have to discuss the ramifications of this usual problem. But it's nearly always a part that needs to be discussed, so you should spend some time explaining it. SFF has a lot of story-identification questions and they have a long list of questions that you should try to answer as best as you can if you want to ask such a question. That also means that these are important things to keep in mind when answering. Furthermore you have to discuss every matching and mis-matching point in your answer. So knowing the standard things that are discussed makes it easier to compile a standard answer for story-identification questions.  On WorldBuilding people love pictures. Especially sketches. If you have useful pictures you can easily get a highly voted answer. It's not always applicable, but on a theoretical and creative site like WorldBuilding it's far easier to use sketches to your advantage to illustrate your ideas, than on a technical site like StackOverflow where you need actual code or a site like Writing where you need citations or citation markdown for example phrases.  Every site, and often every tag, has individual properties that you have to get used to. It takes some time and you will make mistakes. As long as you format your answer properly and know what you are talking about you should be fine on most sites, but getting to know the site and tags is important for high quality answers that are well-received across the wider community.  As of writing this I have:"
How can I write about historical realities that readers mistakenly believe are unrealistic?,"I feel for you. I write about the Anglo-Saxon period in England and I am careful to portray my characters living and working in huts and wooden halls and guarding their villages with wooden palisades. No matter. My readers conjure up castles out of thin air.  Of course, this is how fiction works -- how all of languages works, really. We can paint a very large and detailed picture with a few words by pulling images out of the reader's head. If the images are not there already, it is very hard to force them in. And if the reader has associations with a word, a time, a setting, an implement, or a title, it is very hard to break that association.  In my case I suspect that any scene or implement that suggest medieval times to my readers, a sword, a horse, etc, brings a whole cascade of medieval associations flooding in, with castles mixed in there willy nilly. The reader ends up convinced that they have already seen a castle in the story when there never was one.  I think to a certain extent you can combat this with description. But to the extent that this succeeds, the reader will be aware of the dissonance between their stock of images and the image you are presenting. The question then is, which is more authoritative to them, the images in their head, or the words in your text.  If you can make your writing authoritative enough -- if they believe the portrait you are painting -- perhaps they will adjust the images they have in their heads. If not, they are more likely to believe the the images in their head are correct and you are the one committing anachronism.  But I don't think you are ever going to win at this game entirely. A certain portion of your readers will still see huts in Rome. A certain portion of mine will still see castles in an 8th century Northumbrian village.  They key thing, I believe, is to make your writing as authoritative as possible, but not to go so far in trying to convince the inconvincible that you ruin the story for the readers who are ready for what you are writing.

What's the modern way to handle gender in tech writing?,A few additional options: [Edited to add:] Here are some additional tips from Val Drummond's Elements of Nonsexist Usage. Chapter 4 is all about pronouns.
"Using real words from a foreign culture feels like 'Calling a rabbit a ""smeerp""'","I've found that the main key to unfamiliar words -- and this applies to jargon in technical writing as much as it does to foreign or made-up words in fiction -- is density.  The example in the XKCD comic is irritating because it can't get through a single sentence without three new words.  The situation is very different if three unfamiliar words are introduced over the span of a chapter. Another key is how naturally you supply the explanation.  Instead of ""translating"" or explaining, provide context -- introduce the asvarans in a setting where their martial role is apparent, show your sardars in leadership roles, show your ostandars ruling, etc.  This might be direct (you show those characters doing those things) or indirect (people refer to them in connection with illustrative events or attitudes). Imagine if the XKCD example were instead handled like this: The six fra'ars stood solemnly in front of the gate, their gray beards all reaching nearly to their waists.  Despite their years they stood strong and alert.  $Name, standing in front of the others, held a large sword aloft in one hand, seemingly effortlessly.  $POV-character involuntarily took a step back; he knew that the krytosis was normally wielded two-handed because of its weight. He heard the din of the many farmlings running and playing beyond the gate.  He envied them; they had no cares, were not affected by the ill tidings in the land, and had no idea of their eventual fate.  He wished he could be young and oblivious again.  [...] This is more jargon-dense than I would write for ""real"", but I hope it illustrates the point that you can introduce terms without falling into the ""pass the dictionary"" trap."
Do You Use Any Version Controlling Software/Methods As Writers? [closed],"I am a programmer in real life, so using a version control software was a no-brainer for me.  I write stuff in plain text, with each chapters in a separate text file. I use Subversion on them, with TortoiseSVN on Windows, and also use a Dropbox for backing up my repository.  This way I have my changes versioned, I can comment the changes I commit, and if my hard drive decides to die, I can be back really quick."
Should an emoji come before or after a full-stop? 🤔,"There is no real grammatical rule for this and the very fact that you are using emoji shows that grammar probably isn't very important. That being said, from what I see on social media, most people use emojis sort of like punctuation, not text, putting it at the end of a sentence instead of a period/exclamation point. Example:  Today was a great day 😀 I am happy 😛"
"The Good, the Bad, and the Semicolon","Bollocks. (That's a technical term.) The semicolon is the correct punctuation for a particular kind of sentence structure. So on the face of it, if you want to outlaw something, it should be that sentence structure, not the punctuation that is necessary to it.  But this is one of those rules like kill all the adverbs. Many writers today do not give sufficient attention to the quality of their prose. They are all about getting their plot down on paper and are negligent of their prose and its effects. One of the most obvious ways this shows up is as the sloppy use of adverbs. But merely cutting out all the adverbs won't make your prose better. And substituting exotic verbs for simple verbs, as some anti-adverb crusaders recommend, won't make it better either. In fact, it will make it more pretentious. If you train yourself to be a good prose stylist, if you pay attention to the quality of your prose as you write, you will use adverbs appropriately where they are needed. Similarly, people who don't pay attention to their prose often end up writing convoluted sentences that are hard to read and then try to fix them with punctuation. If you get down to semicolons in this attempt to punctuate a broken sentence it is a good sign your sentence needs to be rewritten. In fact, I would state it as an axiom that if you have any question about how to punctuate a sentence, you should probably rewrite the sentence, and, quite possibly, the entire paragraph. But really great sentences can sometimes require semicolons and taking out all the semicolons will make the great sentences worse but it won't make the bad sentences better.  Any rule that makes an enemy of any part of speech or any punctuation mark is bollocks. Great prose stylists use them all. To determine if an adverb or a semicolon is appropriate in a particular sentence, you have to look at the overall quality of the prose. Adverbs and semicolons may be relatively rare in good prose, but they have their place and are something essential to felicity of expression. "
How do I translate into a gendered language where the gender would be a spoiler?,"The question is not whether the translator knows the true gender, the question is whether the character doing the speaking knows the gender of the person behind the door. If they don't, using the default seems plausible and probably be the best option. If he/she does, they would, in real life, use the correct form. Using the default male conjugations and pronouns would, come the reveal, be retroactively incorrect and can make viewers feel cheated.  A perfect solution would: None of the three solutions proposed satisfies all three requirements.  A potential solution that does satisfy all requirements, but is not necessarily practically possible regarding the number and type of interactions, would be to, yes, be more creative and explore other formulations or grammatical constructs. Think along the lines of an equivalent of ""they"" instead of ""he"" or ""she"", choice of words that obscure gender (example in spoken french: ""mon ami(e)"" instead of ""ma copine/mon copain""), impersonal statement/questions (""How are things?""), or maybe using a descriptive noun instead of a pronoun (example in French would be to refer to the person behind the door as ""the beast"" (la bete) and use feminine constructs)."
The protagonist can't defeat the antagonist without the antagonist being stupid,"Actually, most stories that have a specific antagonist depend on the antagonist being stronger than the protagonist, so logically the antagonist should win most of the time -- unless they do something stupid.  We love to root for underdogs. After all, most of us are underdogs. If the hero was clearly going to win, it would not be much of a story. So what is an author to do? You will find all of these in literature but in popular works the first is obviously the most common. So the question becomes, under what circumstances is it satisfying to the audience that the hero wins anyway, even though the antagonist should clearly win.  The key to this question is virtue. Why do we want the hero to win? Because they are more virtuous. Why do we want the antagonist to lose? Because they lack virtue. So the difference between winning and losing must itself rest on virtue. This can take many forms: The antagonist loses, despite their advantages, because their signature vice leads them to make a mistake. Not a random mistake, but a mistake that they make for the very reason we hated them in the first place. Because of their cruelty, a henchman rebels against them; because of their treachery, an ally abandons them; because of their arrogance, they leave their flank unguarded; because of their idleness they do not discover the secret that will be their undoing. All of these will seem dreadfully contrived, of course, unless they are seen as the direct result of their faults and the past actions they have taken because of those faults.  The hero wins because of their signature virtue: because of their courage, they keep fighting when all seems lost; because of their compassion, a minor character they have been good to shows them a secret passage; because of their loyalty, a friend sacrifices himself for them; because of their learning, they discover a secret unknown to the antagonist. Again, all of these will seem dreadfully contrived unless they are the direct result of their established virtues and the past actions they have taken because of those virtues. "
How do I know if a concept is sexist or not?,"Sexism isn't a yes/no kind of thing, and it's a mistake to treat it as such. Saying that a story or an idea is ""sexist"" is shorthand. What it means is that it creates, encourages, or reinforces sexist stereotypes, and that those stereotypes have real-world consequences. So, a good way to come at this issue is to use these: Let's try those questions with your particular example: A matriarchal witchcraft-based culture, where the most epic power is giving birth to a magical familiar, at the price of not ever bearing a human child. 1. What are the stereotypes that my story is relying on, conforming with, or playing into? I can point to several: 2. Is my story repeating and reinforcing a particular viewpoint, bias, or narrative?
3. Is it a viewpoint, bias, or narrative I support and stand behind? We've noted multiple stereotypes, so the answer here is to varying degrees.  It also depends very strongly on how, exactly, you portray different facets here. If, say, your portray witches hoping to birth familiars as generally turning to lesbian relationships which don't risk pregnancy, then you've definitely avoided falling into the ""isn't it important for women to not have any sex"" narrative! Or, for example, you might worldbuild a society with underlying sexism -- and then note and criticize that sexism. In this case, you're repeating the sexist viewpoint -- but you're not aiming to reinforce it; you're interested in deconstructing it instead. Even so, you should understand: choosing such a fraught and sex-dependent element, you're necessarily entering those conversations.  And, obviously, the degree to which you agree with any or all of these broad stereotypes is something only you can answer! e.g., Maybe you do think people who don't want kids are very rare and, at some level, selfish. In which case I might disagree with you personally on that issue, but on the level of craft, I will encourage you to follow your own convictions, rather than try and artificially conform to viewpoints you don't share yourself. 4a. How harmful are these stereotypes? Again -- each one would need to be examined in its own right. And, finding the nuance between what you are willing to portray, and what you aren't, is very valuable in and of itself. For example, ""women shouldn't have sex"" is extremely prescriptive and direct, as opposed to the much fuzzier ""women's fertility is a really important thing"". On the other hand, ""women's fertility is the most important thing about them"" is pretty awful.  Likewise, ""people born with male genitals cannot become pregnant"" is not a controversial position. Whereas ""the ethereal realm responds only to people born with female genitals"" is more iffy, because that's implying cosmic significance to birth-assigned gender. Or consider, ""yeah, the ethereal realm responds only to people born with female genitals, and actually that's kind of tragic?"", which is one way to kind of thread the needle -- or at least try to. Here's Neil Gaiman's Sandman back in 1991:  Also note that different people will have different opinions on everything, and different people will have different takes on whether (and  how) something is harmful. The 1991 Sandman example I just gave is considered somewhat problematic today (e.g. 1,2)-- whereas in 1991, seeing it in mainstream (and even prestigious) comics was immensely significant. These things are complicated and have many facets. You're not going to please everyone -- but at the same time, don't write hurtfully out of mere ignorance. 4b. Is there any change I can make to change things up, and avoid reinforcing it? There always is. Maybe the ethereal realm is fine with trans women, and they can totally do the ritual! Maybe in your story, trans witches are just as much a conduit between the mortal and ethereal plane as cis witches, and they become magic-pregnant.  Maybe the brightest of witches are working hard to discover new ways to summon familiars -- and then it'll be their smarts that are most valuable, not their uterii. If getting a familiar and then serving society with your newfound powers is seen as altruistic, not power-hungry, then that's no condemnation of people who don't want kids. And so on. Each one of these is a change to your story, and you might not want to adjust what you had in mind, merely to avoid reinforcing stereotypes that are all around us anyway. That's your own judgment call. Just recognize that even not making a choice, is still a choice -- conforming to existing social norms is also shaping your story, as surely as avoiding them would be. 5. How central are these stereotypes to your story? The more central an element is, the more care it needs. (On the other hand, the less central it is, the easier it is to just make whatever adjustments make it ""safe"" and then forget about it.) In your case, this is the access ticket to epic power, and it's something everybody knows, that informs all of society and its social structure. So... pretty important to get this right, I'd say :P (This doesn't mean your social structure needs to be a good, kind one. Maybe it's a really sexist society! But then, you probably want to make your criticism of that sexism evident to the reader...) That's how you do the analysis. You look at what your story is saying; how it's saying it; what the consequences and the implications are.
You also look at how much it would ""cost"" you to change it. And, maybe you wind up saying ""you know what, there's some sexist undertones here, but I can't change it without telling a completely different story, and I think this story is a worthwhile one."" That's OK! Not every adventure novel is a paragon of gender equality! Some subgenres have at least a little sexism or bias baked right in! Sometimes you're exploring gender issues specifically, and can't avoid stepping on some people's toes! Sometimes, ""forgiving"" some sexism is a choice you make -- but it helps if you make it deliberately, consciously, owning up to it, rather than doing it just because you didn't know any better.
And, being aware of the issue in the first place will probably make your writing better at this than it would have been otherwise.  These are all your calls to make -- once you know how to make them. Which brings me to one last and crucial point: In order to recognize stereotypes and biases that you suffer from (along with a whole lot of the rest of society), you need to get outside input. You're not going to know how you might reinforce sexism without learning about sexism. Ditto for racism, gender issues, religious identities, ethnicities and any subculture that aren't your own. Learn about these things in general; learn about the topics you're touching directly in particular, and for elements featuring heavily in your book -- get appropriate readers who can point out issues that you'd never have guessed. Hope this helps -- all the best!"
A critic made a comment that my female character sounds like she was written by a man,"TL;DR: Try submitting with a female pen name.  If the criticism goes away, there's your answer. This is your character and you need not bow to anybody's tropes or nuances, or notions of how or why a female is.  Justify your character's actions, outlook, language, interests with sources from within your character.  Formative influences from youth and later on have their place, but those go into the character, not onto the page as such.  As a reader, I do not so much care what happened to your character EXCEPT as far as it helps me to understand her. So your character herself is the seat of anything she does, and your job as the author is to selectively show the reader what makes your character tick.  I dated a girl who was a sysad on a university VAX system, she ran cross-country, she climbed mountains (for fun! -- ugh!), and she knew all about the music scene, criticized movies from a logic and plot point of view, and so forth.  She was all woman, too.   Make your character live!  Write her in your chosen voice, and keep working on things that you agree need working on.  Don't take any ""you write this female like a man would"" criticism unless you can source it from a blind test. In my own creative writing classes (long ago), we had a great demonstration of the frailty of most peoples' sense of the sex of the writer through anonymous submissions.  It was revealing.   Finally, even when I do think that I can tell that an author is a man or a woman, it doesn't so much come across in the way the characters stick to sex-based roles, but in the overall writing.  Yet only rarely do I get a chance to really blind test this, so YMMV. You know your character better than anybody.  Make this character work on her own ground, for who she is, and keep in mind that even the most perfect author (me., no doubt) still has to lump some criticism.  Write to please a committee, and your voice will not be heard."
How to overcome the fact that I can't write?,"Writing is one of the areas in which it is the most dubious that there exists such a thing as latent talent. There are a few important pieces of evidence for this: Check out this article on expert performance if you believe you do not have the innate talent to write well.  You almost certainly do, but it may take years of concentrated effort."
How to avoid turning dialogue into Q&A session?,"OK. This will be like all the other things we are learning. You fill your tool box with every tool you can find, and use all of them. In this case you are collecting tools to make your dialog sound natural. We are trying to reveal information to the reader, and you say you are using interrogation. Right, this is not natural.  Part of natural dialog is leapfrogging over an answer, so that's one tool you can add to the toolbox. Bad dialog: ""Why are you wearing that?""  ""I'm wearing it because I want to."" Well, duh.  Less bad: ""Why are you wearing that?""  ""Shut up."" This can have the bonus of getting more information to the reader—because the reader fills in the blanks. In terms of a short word count, you might want to look at leapfrogging and trusting the reader. Part of natural dialog is what is thought, instead of what is said out loud. We do a lot of thinking when we are talking. ""Why are you wearing that?"" They were going to a funeral for God's sake. It shouldn't come as a surprise to her anymore; he always dressed inappropriately. Sometimes she thought he did it just to annoy her.  ""Listen up. There's no dress code, and you're not my mother."" A lot of times the question and the answer do not match up directly. If the answer in your interrogations is the information your readers actually need, then you might tweak the questions so that the exchange is not too on-the-nose. Above, maybe what the reader needs to know (you know what the reader needs to know) is that there is no dress code wherever they are going. But it would be too on-the-nose to have someone say ""Is there a dress code?"" ""No."" You can slip different, disconnected bits of information to the reader through Qs and As in this way. Part of natural dialog is not to ask questions but to make observations. ""Spandex. Interesting choice for a funeral."" It shouldn't come as a surprise to her anymore; he always dressed inappropriately. Sometimes she thought he did it just to annoy her.  He laughed. And you can just cut the dialog altogether. He was in spandex. Of all the things he could have chosen, he decided spandex was what he'd wear to her mother's funeral. It shouldn't come as a surprise to her anymore; he always dressed inappropriately. Sometimes she thought he did it just to annoy her.  There's lots of tricks... You can add physical gestures to your characters, and so on, nonverbal communication.  Your goal is to paint a scene and deliver information leaving the reader wanting more.  Listen to dialog while you are out. Natural dialog is not a logic stream. It is conveyance of information, power struggles, rife with emotion, short phrases, sentence fragments, often selfish. Or, loving kindness, a compassionate ear, gentle. Sometimes dialog is mindless blather, which can be amusing or tiring. Sometimes it is a person sharing an anecdote with other people.  In terms of other tools to get information across, you can use a found diary or a hacked phone. You can use a drunk character who reveals far more than they should. You can create an emotional and vulnerable moment where a character shares information without being asked.  Collect your tools, go through each section of your manuscript that feels off, and find a different way to convey the information your reader needs."
Is there a special software for writers?,"I've been using Scrivener, which is available as a free beta for NaNoWriMo participants. It's a writer's project organizational tool that allows you to have many different associated files, and to view more than one on the same screen. For example, you could open a file about a particular character while writing about them, have an outline open while you work on non-fiction, etc. You can also move pieces (smaller files) around easily to rearrange parts of a work. When you're done, you can compile your manuscript to multiple formats: plain text, Word, et cetera. "
Avoiding racist tropes in fantasy,"This is a great question.  I think being aware of the problem is a good first step.  If you really do want to use the traditional creatures but without the baggage, I think you'll have to take on the suggestion from the comments section, and subvert the tropes --either by inverting, replacing or mixing up the coded racial signifiers, or by revealing the inner heroism of one of the despised groups, or the inner villainy of one of the favored groups. I've encountered it done both ways. Ursula LeGuin deliberately made her more civilized races darker-skinned, and her more barbarian races paler in her famed Earthsea sequence (but it was so subtle that most readers and basically all illustrators and adapters just ignored it). For a more bold statement, Shrek is a revisionist fairy tale that recasts the ogres as the heroes and the prince as the villain (although it's only the donkey that is portrayed by a voice actor of color in the movie version).  It should go without saying that there's still plenty of potential to offend people, however, if you do this wrong. Jar Jar Binks was on the side of the heroes in the Star Wars prequels, but that didn't make people any happier about his pseudo-Jamaican patois. With that said, I would still encourage you to make the effort.  When I was a young FF & SF fan of color, I was pathetically grateful on any of the --excessively rare --occasions that I encountered a legitimate hero of color in any of my favorite books. These kinds of portrayals, whether or not you notice them consciously, do make a difference."
"Is the ""hero guy saves girl"" trope misogynistic?","This is a matter of opinion; personally I don't find it sexist. People have genders, and sexual orientations, and they have to mix.  We stray into sexism when we pile up too many tropes. In your case, you avoid the trope of sexual reward for Edward's effort on two fronts; Lily is his sister, and he doesn't seem oriented toward heterosexual reward anyway. Also, any family member has inherent value to normal people.  She doesn't have to be ""helpless"", she can fight and perhaps injure her captors. I love the little girl kidnapped in Along Came A Spider, she actually manages to escape, freeing herself and then repeatedly injuring herself loosening boards but continuing her efforts despite this. Although she would have been caught if the hero did not show up in time; I was impressed the writers did not make that little girl just a damsel in distress waiting for a white knight. Do something similar. A stereotype is a collection of traits, you can break it by letting Lily play against type. Heck, you might make it clear that given another hour or two, she might not have needed Edward to save her at all."
How do you communicate to people that writing is a job and prevent interruptions?,"I have worked from home for over fifteen years, I treat it like a job, with minor laxities (but not in my schedule). I have a separate cell phone which is the only number I give for work colleagues. On my personal phone, my message is approximately: ""I am working, if this is an emergency then text me, or leave a message and I will check at my next break."" In general: Do not allow people to do anything they would NOT do if you worked for a boss in a building somewhere. If you wish to answer the phone, be a tougher boss of yourself: You are a writer, so say what you would say if that were true for some character of yours: ""I am sorry Mom, I am in the middle of something and I have a deadline and I cannot afford to talk right now. I will call you later on my break."" If they try to talk any way, ""this will just take a minute,"" then say ""No, I am working, I am hanging up, don't be mad,"" and hang up. Think about the situations, write responses for a character that really cannot take personal calls at work, and use them."
What's the least distracting method to inform editors I'm a woman?,"If you are submitting to a professional journal that (like many) puts a short blurb about the author(s) somewhere in the article or journal, you could provide a suggested blurb and ensure that there is at least one feminine pronoun in it somewhere. If they don't, or you don't know, you could say, ""in case you need an author's introduction, here is a suggestion:"""
"How to write a story without conflict, like ""My Neighbour Totoro""?","There is definitely conflict, in the sense of narrative conflict, in My Neighbor Totoro. Sickness (with possible death) counts, whether it's resolved through any action of any characters or not. Finding Totoro and then not being able to find Totoro, or seeing the growth of a magical grove of trees, and then having it not be there later counts.  Not knowing Totoro and getting to know Totoro also counts. It's an unknown that gradually reveals itself. Personally, I'm not a big fan of the word conflict for a narrative because of this very confusion. I prefer to think of it as tension, or even better dissonance, as in music theory. Something is unsettling (a V7 chord, a person is sick, a character or place can't be found), and then that unsettling thing is either resolved or isn't.  The unsettling thing, whether you call it dissonance, tension, or conflict, is what brings interest. It doesn't have to be a fight between two or more characters or ideas, or a massive obstacle that is overcome. It can be two girls getting to know a magical creature and experiencing a new place.  There are plenty of moments of tension in My Neighbor Totoro, though. Just look at how the expression on the girls faces change, moment to moment, and you'll see it."
Is Wikipedia Trustworthy?,"Wikipedia is a crowd-sourced site where anybody can contribute, just like this one.  Wikipedia strives for verifiability and neutrality and has an active user community, but that doesn't mean that things can't get past it.  It doesn't mean information there can't be wrong.  Some pages are full of detailed, reliable information; some are not. So, in evaluating the reliability of what you read on any given page there -- or anywhere else! -- you need to ask yourself how they know what they say. Do they cite sources?  Good Wikipedia pages do.  Do they not cite sources but make a logical argument?  (Not so common on Wikipedia, but common elsewhere on the Internet, including Stack Exchange.)  Do they present evidence? Since you asked about Wikipedia I'll focus on sources.  For a first approximation, ask yourself if the sources cited are generally considered to be credible.  If they cite peer-reviewed, publicly-available research, that's pretty good.  If they cite the National Enquirer (a tabloid full of sensationalist fiction masquerading as news), be very suspicious.  If the facts you're checking are particularly important, central to your thesis for example, then you might need to actually go look up some of those sources to confirm that the Wikipedia page accurately represents them.  If the facts are less important or tangential, or your assignment doesn't call for this degree of rigor, then establishing that Wikipedia's sources are credible might suffice without looking them up. I wrote more about evaluating sources in this answer, drawing in part from this article from UC Berkeley. For Wikipedia in particular, you can also check the ""talk"" page associated with the topic you're looking at.  The ""talk"" pages can sometimes tell you if any content is disputed or of questionable quality.  If the ""talk"" page is empty, though, don't assume that means everything's fine -- it might mean that no experts have looked at the topic yet. It's impossible to say, globally, ""Wikipedia is trustworthy"" or ""Wikipedia is not trustworthy"".  Unlike an edited, curated encyclopedia, it contains material at a range of quality levels.  I find Wikipedia to be a good starting point in research; sometimes I find everything I need there (including supporting sources), and sometimes I don't.  Don't rule it out, but do be prepared to go beyond it."
Choosing character names is a constant difficulty,"So Sméagol, Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins do not sound silly? Honestly, don't care too much, if they sound silly or not. First, you can change them, second, I've read some great stories with very silly named characters. If you want make up fantasy names and have no good idea how to start, here is what I do:"
What kind of protagonist or writing style is Jack Sparrow?,"There are several ways to think of Jack because he takes on many, many roles depending on what the movie needs. In general, he's a walking plot device and only very rarely does he develop anything along a character arc. If he does develop, he may not be faithful to it. And his role changes from point to point as the movie has different demands. An Iconic Character is a known entity. They have a very, very strong personality that is largely set in stone. Within any given episode they may explore some of that territory you didn't understand previously; but they always revert back to the mean. Most super heroes are Iconic characters. Who they are is recognized, loved and adored. Anything they go through may be challenging, but it's what they do to the world around them that is interesting; not what they do to themselves. Mad Max is another very good example of an iconic character. Max does not change, he changes his world. And this can be compelling if the world is interesting and needs to change. Iconic Characters, chemically, are catalysts. They bring to the world something that is different, that inspires chemical change around them, but not within themselves. Please note there is that one arc with Swan where Jack looks like he's having an arc. It turns out he doesn't; it's all for Swan's character development in the end. A McGuffin is the thing you want to find because as soon as you do you'll get the next piece you need to solve the big problem; whatever it is. Jack often takes on this role, even though he often is rarely pivotal in solving whatever the problem is. He is known to the audience, they feel something about him, they usually want to see him and so just teasing that what you're after is getting Jack Sparrow on the case is enough to hook an audience while you develop the rest of your arc. A thing you like to have in genre fiction, fantasy especially, is a touch of the strange. Jack is usually the character used to introduce and interact with that strangeness. He is usually strongly related to ""element x"". Access to him grants access to the larger world: one that is scary and exciting. This is not the McGuffin. No one goes out to find the strange. This is a cost of him showing up in your character's lives. The antagonist is the one who stands in the way of the primary characters getting what they want. While Jack rarely holds this role the entire movie and is often not thought of as the bad guy; he often is the thing standing in the way of others happiness. Jack becomes an antagonist when a scene needs one. Most often this is because he's after something, usually something very unclear, and it's not until he and the main characters reconcile their directions that they can move forward. Jack is never the protagonist that you root for in the long run, but when he does advance his own agenda it almost always causes problems for others to deal with. This is a classic part of his antagonistic role; but it also sometimes knocks down walls, open doors or initiates the role of a true antagonist to come onto the scene. This is usually a very engaging scene, whenever it happens, because it's usually full of crazy. The point is that it's baked into the character that you expect him to do something for his own reasons that make everything worse. This is very valuable as a plotting device because it often feels organic. Jack is just being Jack again. I've already alluded to this, but Jack is the one that opens very specific doors. This is a minor part that he plays, but it's important to understand as a facet of his character. At some point he opens a door that otherwise could not be opened. He is one of those items you pick up in a dungeon to get to the mini boss. This is like the McGuffin, but also sometimes something more. Rather than being a boring item sitting in a chest somewhere he walks around, does his own thing and causes problems. So he is a more interesting skeleton key, especially when the things he's doing and the problems he cause factor into solving the character development problem of others. It's very hard to cause character development with a latent prop. It's easier when your prop walks around and pushes your character past their breaking point, or puts them into a situation where they must make a decision. Jack is ultimately the one who figures out how to do that and the movies occasionally imply he does this intentionally. There are lots of characters who only succeed because they are lucky. Chaos can occur all around them and they walk through it unscathed. Occasionally Jack is this person. This is one of the standard character archetypes. Essentially tricksters have other-worldly or super human knowledge that allows them to deceive others, take what they want or operate within the world by a different set of rules that often seem convenient, contrived, or godly. Tricksters often do many of the things described above. Getting them to do the thing that is helpful for you when all they are interested is making problems or getting what they want out of the world is a puzzle for others to solve. A rogue is bad guy who steals from bad people to help themselves and sometimes others. You like them because they do unto worse what you can't. Robin Hood, Guardians of the Galaxy, Indiana Jones, Ocean's 11, and Han Solo. All of these are rogue stories. Rogues are usually thieves because stealing from bad people is easy and appears to be victimless. People naturally like rogues, and they are interesting to tell stories about, because it's easy to have them change their mind or do something awful that has to be dealt with. It’s easy to root for and against them. They live in a narrative gray space that you can play with. Jack often is only in a scene to lighten the tension or make a joke. Be it about a “thump-thump” or not getting eaten. Jack is the punch line to the joke. If scenes get too tense you usually want an escape release in a movie like pirates to keep the thing fun and light. Without the joke you can easily slip in to Darkness the Darkening. Since Jack does not take the world seriously and at times appears to be slightly insane, it's relatively easy to use him for this; that also makes him fun to watch. He's not the only character with this feature, and it's not unique to him. It's a part of the world, something in everyone at different times. But he does take it to his own personal extremes and it is used to emphasize all of the other types of roles he has. It's also the thing that makes you realize he's not going to be the one to save the day. He can't be. He's not focused enough or serious enough. This leaves space for the true hero to step forward and solve the problem. It also leaves space for the reversal, because once the audience doesn't trust him he can actually do something and surprise them. Jack represents those things others want to be and don't want to be at various points. He does this largely without changing himself. He acts as an example of what others could be and choose not to be, or choose to be. How people feel about him is often more important than how he feels about others. Jack is the thing no one wants to be at the end of the day, but everyone wants to be for a day. He had no friends. He has no love. He has none of the things he wants. He's extremely capable, and almost never permanently successful. He lets everyone see what fun is, but he ultimately conveys to the audience and to the other characters that you don't want fun at the end of the day; you want satisfaction, contentment, acceptance, and fulfilment. (And ok, if the characters are stuck in a rut, sometimes the thing you need is Adventure). Jack shows others what it means to fail, even if he fails spectacularly. His primary point of existence is to change the world around him and the narrative. He provides obstacles, reasons to do things, ideas about the world he understands, and brings in the strange. He escalates small problems into large ones. He can't be trusted, but he is needed. Most importantly. If you have Jack in a scene that's not working, you can do just about anything to make it more interesting and get to the next scene. This was probably important since they largely filmed all of the battles before writing down why they were having them. Which brings up the last and final important point. Used poorly Jack is the cheat sheet the teacher discovers you're using that ruins the rest of your year. The movies that lean harder on Jack are ultimately the ones that suck just a bit more than the rest. Toolbox characters need to be used lightly and with precision or you risk diluting their effect."
Sometimes a banana is just a banana,"This is a balancing act, but ultimately we're in La mort de l'auteur territory here. Ultimately, readers are going to... read... things into what you have written. Some are going to read ""overly"" literally and miss your figurative intent. Others are going to reach for innuendo in everything that you, in your own head, meant literally. Subtext will develop. Critiques will form where random things are picked apart and you're left wondering when you even wrote the passage in question, because you don't even recall using that specific phrasing and certainly not with any intent for a particular interpretation of it. Art has two sides. Any art. Any act of communication. There is the side of the creative experience. And there is the side of the interpretive experience. The more you try to strangle your art into a narrow existence of precise communication, the more sterile it becomes. This works in certain circumstances, but for fictional writing I find it to be generally detrimental. You need to chose what you're okay with, in terms of what an audience interprets as how they experienced what they read, versus your intent in what you wrote. And you need to understand that if you're not okay with a specific interpretation, maybe you need to not write whatever you believe will lead to it: struggle all you want, get as explicit as can be, and all you've done is call attention to whatever it is in question. Consider, if you read a passage where an author went out of their way to try to highlight that a banana was merely a fruit, merely meant literally—in a work with other figurative uses for other objects, no less—don't you think you'd find it significant that so much time was spent talking about bananas? Wouldn't it seem to, in its own way, be an act of emphasis? Wouldn't you question whether the author's narrative acts in regards to the banana might not have aspects of deception, in terms of trying to claim it is only meant to be a banana? People are going to read what they want to read, and their basis for that is what you put in front of them to be read. Writing is communication, and communication is always interpretive between the parties involved. Language alone is interpretive: we used a shared basis for meaning, but even with supposed authorities we still develop different interpretations of individual words, much less the nuances of those words in shifting contexts. If you're using an item in a scene which has widely known and widely used alternate connotations, puerile or not, your only even marginally safe road if you are concerned is to remove it entirely, substitute something else for it. One question I would have is, why is there even, explicitly, a banana at all? Why not just ""a piece of fruit""? I love detail, but ultimately you're the one in control of what you write with detail and what you don't: and you can't escape the fact that the more detail you give, the more questions of whether there is a reason for that detail will occur in your audience. You put in the assumed effort and care to write it, why wouldn't someone think there's significance to the specific choices in what you wrote? Sometimes the best foils for defusing something are your own characters. Rather than refuse the interpretation of readers, acknowledge that it will happen by letting your own characters engage in it. The easiest way to control a narrative, inasmuch as one can, is to own it. Many people make phallic metaphors out of bananas. They make jokes about it. They tease each other about it. Some people find this exceedingly juvenile. Some court it. Some are oblivious to it. So rather than run away from this, use it. Your intent might not be to have your use of bananas have any lingering other meanings, but outside of literature, when has that ever stopped anyone from doing so? Why do you expect it to be different with what you write? How would your characters, if they were real people, actually act in this situation? You can still speak through them, at which point it's easy enough to have someone pick up on the metaphoric aspects and run with it—teasingly or more circumspectly—and someone else react, perhaps by becoming annoyed that they can't even ""eat a banana in peace"" (which would undoubtedly get its own reaction, leading in turn possibly to something like an exasperated facepalm and a request to just drop it or something similar). If you're making choices in wording or scene that you know readers are likely to read into in particular ways beyond your specific intent in writing them, you need to accept that among other things, this is possibly a warning that your characters would also catch on to these metaphors, and skipping over them, particularly with characters developed in ways that would be more likely to pick up on the common metaphorical aspect and especially turn that into some kind of interaction (joking, etc) may actually draw more attention to that, and it will be in ways where you don't even get to have a say about how you feel in regards to that, through how your characters interact in that circumstance. As a final note, to fall all the way back to Shakespeare, consider the use of (and then consider the ongoing layers of cultural connotations in relation to): There are a number of answers that try various approaches in fulfilling your intent through trying to control or expand the surrounding narrative to try to explicitly set it in a non-figurative direction. I would argue that none of them will work with all of your audience, and most of them may actually exacerbate the situation you perceive as an issue, with the readers who are most likely to make this interpretation to begin with. Even my latter suggestion here (which is similar to @Sara Costa's excellent answer) of just letting your characters naturally play with it (*as she winces at her own wording there*) is going to have readers who still run wild with whether there's some further subtext going on about the sexuality of the characters involved or similar questions. That's part of why I worded the heading for it the way I did. Pick your battles. If you don't want to have a struggle over a banana, don't stick a banana in it to begin with; or accept that, to some people, that banana is going to mean more than just a piece of fruit. Just know that the more you struggle to push that away, the more people will then find other reasons to read into it, and it still won't stop the readers for whom a banana is always a source of amusing metaphor whenever they encounter one in their lives, nor will it stop those who run wild with conjecture about just why a banana, in particular, was put precisely where it got stuck. But as a final answer to your last question of ""can a banana ever be just a banana"", I leave you with a question in turn: As an element of language, what is a ""banana""? Actually? You say it's a piece of fruit. I say it's just a visual representation (using a set of symbols) of a phonetic structure that is commonly itself used as a symbol to represent a specific ""type"" of fruit (which in turn varies on how that is interpreted), which has a certain (general) visual to it (however, even the color is not a sure thing), which in turn is similar to other things visually, and of which that visual association is common in certain societies. What makes that phonetic structure a symbol referencing that piece of fruit? Nothing except our common acceptance that it does and further authoritative attempts to declare that this means that it has that meaning. So how does that differ from other symbolic aspects of it? If there's a common phallic association in a given society with a given item for which a given word is associated, how is that not effectively part of its living colloquial definition as a connotative aspect? As humans we run on symbols and patterns, our language (any language) is itself merely sets of symbols: you can't escape symbolic interpretation. A banana is always just a banana. The error would be in assuming that means it's just a piece of fruit. A banana is always just a banana for however each individual interpreting the word into associated meanings individually perceives it to have meaning. Language is an attempt to form an agreement on the commonality of shared meaning such that intent can be transmitted and interpreted with some small degree of shared basis, but ultimately every piece of language and communication is interpretive based on how we have individually formed related symbolic associations.  It's important, I think, to flip this from a context derived from a conceit of authorial control and perception to being instead about the fact that we are all simply absorbing and interpreting symbols, and therefor as an author your own conception of those symbols is simply that: your own interpretation, individually. Ideally it's at least very close to how many readers will interpret it, but the act of writing is its own individual interpretative act, and even attempts at precision will only go so far, and will carry their own associated interpretations themselves."
"How do I write ""Show, Don't Tell"" as a person with Asperger Syndrome?","I also have Asperger Syndrome. Before I explain how I ""write around it"", let me talk a little about showing and telling. Writing isn't what it used to be, and I don't mean that in a bad way. In competing with film and TV for people's attention, novels have started to mimic the way such media tell a story through what can be seen and heard. True, good writing mentions other senses too; but the lesson has been that revealing inner mental states is unnecessary in good story-telling. I won't rehearse the arguments for why you should show rather than tell; this question wasn't about how good such advice is. OK, so how do we do it? Modern writers have grown up in an environment where most of the stories they consume are from film and TV, where characters' visible and audible mannerisms show us what they're feeling. As an Aspie, I can understand such inferences don't come easily in real-life interactions. But with fiction, several factors make it easier: the fact that there's a plot with a well-defined beginning, middle and end, providing enough context to infer mental states another way; the fact you can rewind and replay as much as you need to notice little details; and the fact that fictional characters have authors behind them, trying to make their mental-physical correlations as clear as possible and, in particular, as close as possible to the rest of the fiction they and their audience have consumed. Does this mean I'd expect you to pass a written exam on what each kind of body language means? No, I understand your situation better than that. Even if you ""know"" the right answer, it can be hard to put into words. But don't worry! You don't actually need to be able to do that. All you need to do is visualize the scene. You can do this whether you're writing a script intended for TV, or a very different format you can imagine getting such an adaptation. When I visualize my characters doing things, I'll be honest: my brain doesn't invent their appearances ex nihilo. Usually I take fictional characters I know from other visual works, then ""recast"" them. (The characters I choose might actually contradict how I said my own characters look; it doesn't matter.) But in my mind, I can see new footage they've never been in before, where they do what my plot says they do. OK. What's their body language like when I do that? Unsurprisingly, roughly what other writers would make it, because I've seen so much of how that turns out. My brain has become ingrained with some patterns, even if I don't know what they are, just as I don't need to solve equations to throw a ball. So before you write the next minute or so of your characters' interactions, close your eyes and try to see them doing it. I'll let you decide whether you need to say their dialogue out loud, and if so where you'll quietly do it. Maybe you'll find this easiest to do at night in your dreams. That's not important: you do you. But as you see it all, your brain will invent body language. It will; it can't help it. So no matter how little you understand that body language, write it down. (If a reader can double-check that it seems natural, that's all the better.) Saying what a character did in one sentence and what they said in another is a popular, and these days arguably indispensable, alternative to traditional dialogue tags, where dangerous telling most frequently arises with writers who know they'll need to work on it. Now, you may find you see too much body language to remember it all, or to feel it should all be there. Yeah, that's fine too. If you tell me in one example what eyebrows did and in another what hands did and in another where a character's gaze went, that's rich; if you tell me all of them every time, that's boring, like you're filling in every column of a spreadsheet. Note what strikes you most. A few years ago, I came across Stephenie Meyer's characters' tendency to sigh. I realized one of my novels had a lot of sighing. So I re-read those sections and tried visualizing the scenes again, and noticed every sigh meant something different. Then I visualized them yet again, with the meaning first and foremost, and found the body language changed to something different each time. (Well, OK; I think I visualized each scene twice before moving onto the next one, rather than going through the whole sequence twice, but still.) That did my writing wonders. But you can save this sort of tactic for your redrafting."
What are good reads about writing?,To start the list: I myself found 'On writing' from Stephen King very helpful.
Traits of Bad Writers - Analysing Popular Authors,"I would say mostly breaking (or more bending) the plausibility of realistic speech, realistic reaction (physical or emotional), and telling instead of showing, or using too many nods and shrugs and adverbs (he said excitedly). It is relying too heavily on some same ""formula"" for description or exposition, to the point it becomes noticeable.  I should note that most of their critics have not made tens of millions of dollars in their writing!  As a result, I feel it is much more important to turn your question around. Despite their shortcomings (not failures, since they are published), what are they doing right? Why do readers overlook these shortcomings and buy their books? Why do producers overlook them and turn their work into blockbuster movies?  I think the answer is, these imperfect writers concoct compelling and original plots and settings, at least for their intended audience. That is what the movie producers buy, that is what the readers are looking forward to. The lesson from this should not be ""what pitfalls to avoid"", because clearly you don't have to avoid them to get published! The lesson should be ""What can I do right so I don't have to be a perfect writer, and can get published with all the imperfections of a strong effort?""  The answer to that is much harder work than becoming a good technical writer: You have to invent a good original story with something about it people (most of them) have not fully imagined before. Before JK Rowling, I would not have thought of a Wizard's school that would appeal to a children's audience. Before Dan Brown, I would not have thought of Christian artifacts, statues, buildings and manuscripts of having hidden clues to a major secret being covered up by the Vatican. Both of those are genius ideas, superb stories imperfectly realized. So if you had to choose, which would you rather have produced? A blockbuster novel riddled with examples of cringe-worthy writing, or a technically perfect tome that sells a few thousand copies?  It might be nice to have both an awesome story with a compelling plot, and expert writing, but if you have the story, then ""decent"" or ""serviceable"" writing is enough to get it published. Just look at JK Rowling or Dan Brown, both have risen from the middle class to the 0.1% on the strength of original (and captivating) imagination throughout their first efforts. P.S. As for their critics from the ranks of professional best selling authors: JK Rowling and Dan Brown are #1 and #2 in net worth of ALL authors with about $700M each, and this is after JK Rowling has given over $100M to charitable causes. Stephen King is fifth (400M). Rowling has sold 450 million books, Stephen King 300 million. Tolkien and Dan Brown are tied at 200 million. P.P.S. A late additional note on the idea that great marketing can create a blockbuster. I am the sole author of dozens of best selling ads; brochures, coupons, ten page direct mail letters, full page newspaper and magazine ads that ran for years, getting two to four times the national average response rates. I know something about marketing. Check out this short Wiki link on Diffusion of Innovation, particularly on that page The Adopter Categories which are shown in order.  The summary argument is that most people in a potential audience, about 85%, will not buy a new product without a trusted recommendation from somebody else. Ads and paid celebrity endorsement are selling primarily to a small minority percentage of the audience, they only work for the rest if they get a trusted recommendation from a source they consider unbiased, which generally requires the source to be an unpaid friend or other social contact, or a professional critic that they believe does not sell their good recommendations. Thus, it is effectively impossible for Marketing to create a best seller out of a book that is not very entertaining to actual readers, even excellent ad writing and production isn't going to cover the gap of ""word of mouth"" marketing. Innovators (which would include critics) and perhaps very Early Adopters may buy the book because of the ad, they are willing to take the risk on a new author or new style, they can afford to buy a bad book and laugh it off and drop it in the trash. But most of us are wary of ads and stingy with our time and money. So we count on first readers (including critics whose reputation is at stake) saying, ""Buy this book,"" or ""I just read a great new author."" Marketing can light a fuse, but the fuse fizzles out if the First Readers are disappointed, or start a negative buzz. Marketing is similar to a free video that goes viral on social media and gets 100K views. Even though they are free, 99.9% of videos never get there, because they evoke no strong visceral reaction (positive would be laughter or surprised astonishment or disbelief at some feat, negative would be horror or anger or empathetic pain). Without that strong reaction few people feel compelled to share it, and the virus fizzles.  A heavily marketed book works the same way, but the threshold of ""visceral reaction"" before passing it along is much higher for the first readers than even a free video, because now money is at stake, and we don't tell our friends (or fans) to spend money unless we are pretty sure they will be glad they did. We don't want to be known for making lame recommendations. On the flip side, even if we love our friends (or celebrities) we ignore the buying recommendations of those that have fizzled out on us too often.  The route to a blockbuster is a chain reaction of free word of mouth when most readers are ""moved"" in some way and believe their friends will be moved, too. Marketing is necessary but not enough on its own: Content must have delivered on the promise. It is ""original"" content in my view, else some previous published work would have evoked the visceral reactions needed to fuel the viral sharing and complete the chain reaction. Then the previous similar work would have dominated the market. P.P.P.S. A note on ""viral marketing"" due to a comment below. It is possible an advertisement has all the qualities to go viral. We have all seen great commercials that made us laugh, or had a great jingle or dance, or a twist ending. It isn't easy to pull off, but it happens, the ad does something creative and memorable and worth passing along. So if it is easy to pass along we might do that, or at least mention it.  But ads are free, and it still doesn't make us buy the product being advertised. Sometimes we can't even remember the product being advertised! (Which brings up the conundrum: If an ad is memorable, but you cannot recall the brand it was selling, is it good entertainment but a bad ad that didn't do its job?) A viral advertisement creates a lot of free air time, and that should increase exposure and sales to Innovators (the few that don't need a recommendation). The ad might prompt the rest of us to inquire about the product it is selling and seek a recommendation. But even a viral ad will not magically take away the need for a recommendation from the 85% that won't buy without a positive review. A viral ad (free, short and easy to share via a link to a video or image) will not result in blockbuster sales of a product people don't like.  That includes a book that is boring or not worth the money or time to read it. Especially if the Innovators that can afford the time and money to buy it with no recommendation then tell people it isn't as good as the ad makes it look. Bad word of mouth is passed along ten times more readily than good word of mouth.  That differential is because it is always worth saving your friends time and money, and complaint is your reward in a way, a bit of vengeance for feeling ripped off, and your friends (if you are not a constant complainer) will appreciate the heads up, even if they decide to spend the money anyway: Nobody blames you if you thought something was terrible and said so. On the other hand, it is always a risk to recommend anything to your friends that will cost them time and money if they don't like it. It indicates you don't know their tastes very well, and it can feel to both of you like you have made a mistake and they would have been better off if you had just not said anything. So unless the enthusiasm is very high, most of us do exactly that: We don't volunteer information about ""okay"" products we tried, and if asked about something that did not produce a great experience we tend to tone down whatever enthusiasm we DO have and offer tepid endorsements. ""I kind of liked it, but it may not be for everybody..."" Viral marketing is very effective if it advertises an equally good product. It can backfire if it advertises an imperfect product, the popularity of the ad can mean people rush to **dis-**endorse the product, to do their friends a favor by warning them about a rip-off. Thus, it is not a route to turning a mediocre book into a blockbuster. Put another way, viral marketing can increase the amount of talk about your product, but you have no control over the content of that talk in texts, tweets, emails, reviews, blogs, comments and up/down votes on the sales venues. You may be amplifying harsh criticisms."
What makes a poem a poem?,"Well, it's a very old question, and one that is not likely to get a definitive answer. It is perhaps worth making a distinction between poetry and verse. Verse is a literary form that is characterized by the use of rhythm to achieve literary effects, the most foundational of which is simply to make it easier to remember. Verse arises out of the oral tradition where stories were spoken, not written, and using verse made it easier to remember them. Verse can be defined, therefore, by certain technical properties, even if not everyone will agree on which technical properties qualify.  The word poetry, on the other hand, seems to have two principal uses: one is as a synonym for verse, the other as a term of artistic judgement, perhaps we might say a matter of affect (in the literary sense of the word).  There are a couple of infamous lines from Wordsworth: I've measured it from side to side:
  'Tis three feet long, and two feet wide.  Verse? Certainly. Poetry? Maybe not. It is closer to technical writing than anything else. Life would be simple enough if we were willing to say that poetry was verse with affect. But if someone insists on separating poetry from verse, then how do you tell poetry from prose with affect (since any good novel is prose with affect)? And I don't see how we can go any further down that road without this becoming entirely a matter of opinion, and thus entirely off topic."
"Should you use two spaces after a period, or just a single one?","In short, this is a disagreement based on technological generations.   When everyone was handwriting things, there was no issue - the space after a period was however large the writer thought looked good.   But with the first generation of typewriters, a decision had to be made. These were monospace typewriters, and with fixed spacing it was considered that two spaces after the period set it apart and made it clearer when the sentence ended, distinguishing more clearly from a comma.   With late-70's proportional spacing typewriters, and even more with the advent of word processors, the system became intelligent enough to adjust the space depending on the letters on either side, a process known as kerning in the typographical world. This allowed the space after the comma and the space after the period to be clearly distinguished even if they were both typed as a single space.   Thus, the debate: those of us who grew up with typewriters were taught ""always use two spaces after a period,"" while younger folks who grew up with word processors were taught (frequently by Microsoft's grammar checker) to use a single space. My answer? I try to use a single space in documents, but two spaces when I'm using a monospace font (such as comments in computer code). And the entry field on this site, which displays monospace while I type but publishes as proportional spacing, is really confusing me. :)"
"How do I avoid the ""chosen hero"" feeling?","To answer this question, I think it would be useful to look at The Lord of the Rings. We are explicitly told that Frodo is ""chosen"" for the task: Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, and not by its maker. In which case you also were meant to have it (J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, book 1, chapter 2 - The Shadow of the Past) Yet we do not feel, at any point while reading the LOTR, that Frodo is ""chosen"", ""irreplaceable"", ""the only hero who could save the day"". Why? I believe three elements are involved: First, many other characters in the same story have their own crucial tasks. Is Aragorn replaceable, could the Battle of the Pelennor Fields have been won without him? Are Merry and Pippin replaceable? Is Eowyn? If every character is ""chosen"" for a particular crucial task, then none are ""the chosen"". Frodo's task is one among many. While without his mission, everything else would have been futile, without any of the others, Frodo would have gained a rather pyrrhic victory. Second, there is Sam. When Frodo is wounded by Shelob and captured by orcs, it is Sam who saves the quest. Sam is not merely a ""sidekick"" without whom Frodo could not have succeeded - he is the ""backup plan"". He could, if need be, finish the quest. In fact, it is never made clear just how far Frodo was ""meant"" to succeed. And Elrond explicitly says that Sam is ""meant"" to go with Frodo. Third, Frodo himself is rather weak and incompetent, compared to other ""chosen ones"" in the genre. He cannot carry the quest on his shoulders. And he is very aware of his own limitations, even as he tries his best to rise to the occasion. The quest would have failed a hundred times over, had it not been for the help of others. That last one is particularly realistic. No man is an island. No one can achieve what they set out to achieve without the help of many many others. In which case, they are not all that special, are they?"
"""All of a sudden..."" ?","I think this is one of those areas where the 'show don't tell' rule really shines. Instead of: Bart sat back in his chair and let himself relax.  All of a sudden,
  there was a huge explosion down the street. Try: Bart sat back in his chair and let himself relax.  He was almost
  asleep when something made him open his eyes.  There was just enough
  time for him to roll off his chair and desperately flatten himself against the
  ground.  The cloud of debris had swept over him before he even heard
  the explosion.  He kept his head low, his hands shielding his neck,
  and tried to understand what was happening.  etc. I'd also suggest short sentences and paragraphs (I didn't do that in my example, but if I were writing this in MS format, I'd definitely consider putting a paragraph break after the second sentence).  You may want to go so far as using short, sharp words.  "
How to write a character that knows a lot about explosives?,"You don't need to be able to build homemade explosive to describe a character who does.  You just need to give the reader the impression that the character knows what he/she's up to. Most of the reader won't know how to make or detonate bombs anyway, so you can probably impress them without turning your story into the Anarchist Guide to Explosives. So, your goal is to add just a little detail to give the impression of competence. Surely your main character will use a garage or a basement as laboratory. Depending on how he puts up his bomb, he could be knowledgeable about chemicals, electronics, etc. 
But again, you don't have to be specific in your descriptions. Most bombs have ""switches""; some may detonate with a timer or with a short-distance remote; this is all common knowledge. 
I frankly doubt the FBI will show up at your door if you search this stuff up - and if you are worried about being monitored, you should research the topic of internet privacy, anyway.  But again: go watch some crime movie or some TV series to get a ""hint"" of the topic. Most of the people who write screenplays aren't serial bombers too.  For example, if you want to add ""flavour"" and the illusion of competence, you could point out that Anarchist Cookbook was written by a 'former' FBI agent who might have had the agenda of getting anarchist wannabees to self-execute, like a common detonator explosive you can readily buy (ain't telling you which) needs to be mixed OUTSIDE and away from people including yourself because the fumes are toxic. Maybe snark it up a little by having Dude say ""amateurs ruin everything"""
"How do I go from 300 unfinished/half written blog posts, to published posts?","I might be able to help; I spent my whole young life moving from project to project without finishing anything. Now I am a casually famous horror author whose work is unusually popular on YouTube, and my second book was optioned for a film. I keep a large, college-ruled notebook in my backpack with me at all times. That backpack comes in the car with me, it goes to the office with me, it goes on hikes with me. Any time I get an idea for a story, I write the idea out in bullet points on a page in the notebook. Then I write a working title of the idea on the inside cover of the notebook, in the style of a table of contents. The purpose of the book is not just to capture my ideas. It's to alleviate the burden of having an idea baking in my head all week, compelling me to abandon a current project and start a new one ""while it's hot."" I often forget about my ideas after I've written them in the notebook, only to return to them a month later and go ""Wow, that one was good. Let's do that one next."" Some people just walk into tattoo parlors because they want a tattoo. Any tattoo. Maybe a cool skull? They do it because it sounds exciting, but they have no real investment in the piece and come to regret it years later. A rule I learned about tattoos is ""Sketch out the idea, put it in a book, and stick the book on your shelf. Open the book in six months, and if you still like the art, get the tattoo."" Authors get really excited about the ideas that bubble up in their minds throughout the day. Sometimes their enthusiasm causes them to over-commit, and they start pounding away at a new story, novel, or blog post while the idea is still fresh in their mind. Don't do this. Have your excited reaction to the thought, jot down a few notes on it in your notebook, and carry on with your day. At the end of the month, review your notes, and pick the ones you still feel committed to. You'll find that most of your ideas were passing fancies that don't withstand the test of time (and that's why they never get finished even when you do start them in earnest). Your post is asking ""How do I finish projects?"" so it's silly to reply ""Finish your projects."" But let this be your mantra: finish your project, singular. Work on only one project at a time until you can stabilize your output. Then allow yourself to do two if you feel the need. As a personal rule, I never exceed two. You only have so much energy and spare time, so if you spread your efforts over a large number of projects, it becomes unmanageable and nothing gets done. The other side of this is, learn to identify which types of projects you never finish, and which types you do. What is it about these completed projects that maintain your engagement? Is it the fan response? Is it the subject matter? Is it the medium through which they enter the world? If you love writing but you aren't finishing your projects, maybe you're just doing the wrong projects. Art is an act of expression. You have to learn about yourself to figure out what you want to write. If you aren't finishing anything, it might be the case that you have the innate urge to write, but on some level you don't know what to write. I spent six years writing fantasy books and never finishing any of them. You know what I realized after all that time? I loved fantasy video games, not books. Once I had that revelation, it was easy to finish my books, because they all became horror/thrillers. Or it might be something else. Are you sensitive to criticism of your work? I am so sensitive that on occasion I'll get a bad YouTube comment or book review and it'll mess me up for days. I can't advise you on overcoming that sensitivity because I myself have not discovered the answer. But some good advice I've gotten on the subject is... Fans are fickle and fan service is an exercise in futility. You will never make everyone happy, you will never avoid criticism. And even if you do get popular, your popularity will ebb and flow and wax and wane. All of it hurts, because your writing is an extension of you. It's easy to interpret criticism of your work as criticism of your identity. But there's one way around: write what makes you happy, and write it because it makes you happy. There is great satisfaction in completing a project, even if no one ever reads it. Celebrate the fruit of your labor, even in private if you have to, and know that just completing a polished work that makes you proud is a great accomplishment in itself. Share the things you are proud of with the world, knowing not everyone will share your enthusiasm. It's just like dating: not everyone is going to be attracted to you, but you might reach just one person and make them happy. That's worth the effort. Don't do what Stephen King does and force yourself to write a thousand words a day. Write when you want, but commit to your writing time, even if you don't produce as much as you'd like. Only implement a strict schedule if you get the sense that your work is worthwhile and productive. If not, refer back to points 3 and 4 Get your writing space in order. For me, it's a desk with no clutter, a few candles, and an expensive pair of headphones to block out the noise. My wife knows to leave me alone during that time. I recommend maintaining a playlist of music that inspires you to write. For me it's atmospheric horror music by Akira Yamaoka, fantasy music by Jeremy Soule and Adrian von Ziegler, or ambient electronica like Amethystium. Maybe for you it's sitting beneath a tree in your yard with your laptop Keep your notebook by your bed so you can jot down middle-of-the-night ideas and get them out of your brain so you can return to sleep. You'll spend more time writing and less time pondering later on Pre-writing rituals are a good thing. Clean your house, take your shower, eat something, etc. Do what it takes to ensure no other invasive thoughts distract you from your writing time Don't share your work before it's finished. One negative comment can throw your entire project into question and make you wonder if it's worth finishing. If you're anything like me, getting tripped up by a negative response usually is a death sentence on the whole story Good luck!"
How does one deal with world builder's syndrome?,"Having more details than you need, is not a bad thing per se. Many writers do that, and it often leads to an authentic world, even if the reader isn't aware of all these details. It is especially helpful, if you plan a long series of books for the same world. But you are describing procrastination. You do not want to start, so you do other things, which seem more important. That's how I find the time to clean my bathroom. It's a useful thing to do, but the truth is, you are deferring your real work: writing. I have two suggestions for your situation: Short term approach: Despotic rule: Start writing your novels without any rules. Play the capricious Almighty of your fantasy world and make rules up as you go. If you have become obsessed with one thing, try the complete opposite approach. Then hopefully you find the middle course yourself. Long term approach: There are a lot of books out there dealing with procrastination. Pick one (and only one; do not read one after the other; that's procrastination again). Look at the advice and take out of the book what you need. There will be no single book, which is exactly suitable for your situation.  They are only useful to give you some ideas, how to get back to work. (If you have no idea, which book you should take: ""Getting Things done"" is one of the most popular - meritedly or not)."
How to trick the reader into thinking they're following a redshirt instead of the protagonist?,"If I had to play out this scene from the POV of the protagonist, it would be hard to transition from ""redshirt"" to ""heroine"" in a first person narrative. She - as a person - is the heroine from the start no matter what the reader thinks. Her personality doesn't change. That's why I would play this scene out from the monster's point of view.
For the monster this is just another night and another prey. It could follow its prey and come to (false) conclusions about how she is just the same as every other prey.
then, the monster will be surprised by the magical girl and the chapter ends with its death."
How to make the reader think that the *character's* logic is flawed instead of the author's?,"The narrator knows about the thoughts. And the narrator will know that the thoughts are illogical, and can distance himself/herself from the thoughts. Of course that only works if the narrator isn't the villain in first-person. For example, you might write something like: Dick thought about his problem. How on earth could he lock a door that did not even have a lock? Sure, he could block it from the inside, but that would mean he would have to be inside, and that was not possible. He could order someone else to stay inside, but his people were unreliable, so that was not really an option either. So what to do? Finally he had what he considered the perfect idea: Just put a sign on the door: “This door is locked. Any attempt to get inside is futile.” Dick was sure: Yes, that would definitely work. He was absolutely convinced that nobody would ever even try to open that door. After all, it was written there plainly that trying was futile, so why should they waste their time? They couldn't know that it was a lie. Dick was happy about that solution he thought he had found, and immediately went to ordering such a sign. Note how the narrator always explicitly attributes the logic to Dick. The formulations should make it clear that the narrator doesn't think it is a reasonable strategy, and since the narrator knows that it is stupid, it is clear that the author knows it, too. Edit: The question was edited to state that the narrator only knows the actions, but not the thoughts of the characters. For that case, notice that even if the narrator does not know the thoughts, he/she can speculate about them, or draw conclusions from previous behaviour. Or the thoughts might be uttered by the character, and then the narrator can directly comment on them. For example, with the new restriction, the door sign “solution” might be introduced like this: Dick was wandering around, constantly murmuring: “How on earth can I lock that door?” It apparently was a hard problem for him, given the time he spent on it. And granted, locking a door that had no lock is not an obvious problem to solve. Then suddenly his face brightened. He called out for his personal assistant: ”Order a sign, saying ‘This door is locked. Any attempt to get inside is futile.’ And make sure that sign is put on the door to the chamber.” The servant momentarily looked confused. But that passed quickly; after all, it wasn't the first time he had been given orders of questionable utility. And he was smart enough not to contradict. Just to be sure he didn't misunderstand, he asked: “You mean the special chamber behind the storage room?“ “Sure,“ Dick replied angry, “what else should I mean?” “It's as good as done,” the assistant said, as he hastened away. Probably not so much due to solicitude, as due to self-protection. When Dick was angry, it was not a good idea to be close."
How can I write an attention-grabbing first line?,"My experience has been lack of context and mystery most quickly grab my attention.  I believe this has to do with the need of the human mind to create order and solve problems.  Perhaps examples will illustrate this. It was a bright cold day in April, and
  the clocks were striking thirteen. Cold April day, northern hemisphere... clocks striking... what? ""They shoot the white girl first."" Shooting girls?  Because of their race?  Or is it incidental?  Where is this?  What is happening? ""I write this sitting in the kitchen
  sink."" The sink?  Writing?  How?  Why?  WTF is going on here? And so forth.  YMMV."
Convincing argument about something I don't agree with,"You’re approaching this problem from the wrong angle. You can’t have the two characters both make the same type of argument — an appeal to ethics/morality — because one of the arguments is inevitably going to be ‘better’ than the others, making the other one seem phony and strawman-like. In our real-life culture, there are very few instances where both sides effectively advance ethics-based arguments, and they usually arise from very specific and non-generalizable circumstances. (An example is the issue of abortion in the Western world.) Instead, most issues in the world have a “principled” side, which tries to derive right-and-wrong from first principles and axioms, and a “pragmatic” side, which tries to derive right-and-wrong based on what happened in the past, and who benefited and suffered from it as a consequence. For a physics analogy, think of the Principalists as the theorists of public policy, and the Pragmatists as the experimentalists of public policy. Most people in both groups tend to think they are supremely right, and that the people in the other group are deluded idiots, so this is a great way to get two opposing characters with equally deep convictions. Here are some examples from U.S. politics: Gun control. Conservatives oppose it because they believe in a fundamental right to self-defense (principled view). Progressives support it because they look at the costs and historical consequences of such a policy — school shootings, domestic terrorism, etc. (pragmatic view). Foreign wars. (Classical) Progressives oppose them because they view war and violence as fundamental evils, and that fighting fire with fire is a moral fallacy (principled view). (Classical) Conservatives support them because they look at the world and see many examples of bloody conflicts and human suffering that could have been prevented given early intervention (pragmatic view).  Planned economies. Progressives support them because they believe in economic equality and public stewardship of the commons (principled view). Conservatives oppose them because historically, they encourage corruption and depotism, to the extent that most people living under them flee their home countries (pragmatic view). Affirmative action. Conservatives oppose it because they believe the rules of any system must be impartial, that artificially distorting them to favor certain participants over others undermines their legitimacy, and that hardcoding such offsets into policy amounts to collective punishment (principled view). Progressives assert that no real system exists in a vacuum, and argue that context-blind policies have historically failed to produce fair outcomes (pragmatic view). While you may have specific and firm stances on each of these issues, reasonable people can be found on both sides of any one of them. If there weren’t, they wouldn’t be salient issues today — they would have been resolved a long time ago, and without much controversy. So how does this apply to Day and Analise? Give them a historical context where Day has a plausible justification to believe the things that he does. This essentially becomes a worldbuilding problem. that the dictatorship's laws allowing censorship of speech and press, imprisonment of genetically mutated humans, and rigid class structure are in place to keep the general population safe. Day says mutants are dangerous and subhuman, that too much freedom (i.e the ability to always speak your mind) is bad, and that his father's rule is benevolent.  The dictatorship had to start somehow, right? (And remember, most dictatorships come to power with broad popular support, otherwise they would never have been able to seize power.) So let’s say in the Time Before™, society had a “mutant problem”. Certain bad apples in the mutant population were doing Bad Things™, and because of their unique abilities, it had terrible consequences for their victims.  Because mutants were lower-class people in this society (because in your story, they are an oppressed group), most of their non-mutant victims were other poor people. Although mutants were not more likely to be criminals than the general population, the free press sensationalized “mutant terrorism” making it seem like a bigger problem than it was. This caused radical anti-mutant groups to appear among the working class, which fed into the cycle of violence.  The dictatorship established itself amidst the crisis, riding the wave of anti-mutant populism into power. However, even though the dictatorship is squarely anti-mutant, it is still a government which needs to enforce order and stability to continue existing. Having bands of radical vigilantes roving around is helpful in the short-term, but detrimental in the long-term. Remember that the number one threat to any dictator is not the opposition, but radicals within their own party. When the resistance fights the regime, it legitimatizes it. When the fanatics fight the regime, it undermines it. That’s why Franco sent the Blue Division away to fight the Soviets. That’s why Xi Jinping today is cracking down on Communist youth. Since fanatics, by definition, are disagreeable to most of the population, you now have a dictatorship that can, sincerely, present itself as  a solution to the mutant problem,  an alternative to the fanatic anti-mutants,  a protector of the ordinary citizens, and a keeper of the peace. You could probably write a plausible character that subscribes to that."
How to creep the reader out with what seems like a normal person?,"Something is very off about this being, and everyone knows it. Except it's not.  When someone is very off, people steer clear.  The creepy guy who hangs out in front of the supermarket makes his creepiness known by asking out any woman unfortunate enough to engage him in conversation for 5 seconds.  The creepy little girl likes to talk in depth about dead animals she ""happened"" to find. People talk and joke about creepy people they know.  They do this to confirm their beliefs and to warn others.  It's a form of social bonding, in a way that protects them from the weirdo...it can also be a form of discrimination. Because there is sometimes that fine line between marking someone as creepy and discrimination, or just plain unfairness, people are reluctant to do it in borderline cases.  They're more likely to label (either out loud or to themselves) when it's a stranger they won't see again, but even then, they may just shake it off. What you want is a set of very subtle differences your character exudes.  Any one of them can be passed off as misspeaking, being distracted, or just a personality quirk.  It's the totality that give people pause. Because of that, there is nothing specific anyone can point to.  They won't mull over any one incident, because it doesn't amount to much.  If you want all this out of not just your character's words, but also out of their thoughts, it has to be a pattern only the subconscious picks up on. Have you ever been around someone and you suddenly start thinking about movies you saw, TV shows, books, etc?  You might not even realize the person reminds you of someone else, just that hmmm, oh, this just popped into my head. What if most every time one of your characters interacted with your eldritch, they turn to their companion and say something like, ""Let's see a movie tonight! Oh, I know, how about Us?""  Or they start talking about the real life haunted house in their town growing up.  Or maybe they and their companion each get a quick chill. Any one time, it doesn't mean anything.  But the reader will see this over and over and get a clue, even if the characters only understand this on a subconscious level. I'd start with things that aren't actions or words.  People give off energy and an eldritch would have a very different energy.  This would be another reason why a character wouldn't label the person as creepy or weird.  Most people aren't willing to tell someone else that person's aura is off, or whatever.  Unless they're already super into New Agey stuff (this is old agey stuff, but not in mainstream culture). Then there are things that the eldritch actually does or says. Little things they get wrong, as if they aren't from around here.  There's no accent, no verbal tics, but something is not quite right.  Can't put a finger on it.  "
My kid's first story,"What is ""the right way""? Why do you consider it better than some other way to write a story? What do you consider ""mistakes""? You can ask your son about why he has made certain stylistic choices or plot choices, but at the end of the day, those are his choices to make. You can criticise aspects of the story that you feel are unoriginal, or have unfortunate implications, or do not work in your opinion for some other reasons. But those are not ""mistakes""  - those are artistic choices that you disagree with. Spelling and grammar mistakes are not relevant either - they are secondary to the act of creation. You can point out that a certain word is spelled a certain way, but you shouldn't be focusing on that. Spelling and grammar are skills that your son will learn with time, regardless of whether he develops his writing skill or not. Going over those too much at this stage is focusing on minutiae, and ignoring the more important act of creating a story. In your son's place, I would be very much disappointed if I presented someone a story, and that's all they could see. Really, I don't think that you should criticise. Just as you wouldn't criticise a child's painting for being ""derivative"" or for ""lacking in expression"". Instead, be specific with your praise. Don't say ""this is very good"". Mention instead what you particularly liked about the story - what you thought was original and interesting, expressive, etc. And as @TotumusMaximus says, let your son read books in the genres that interest him, so that he may learn by observing the Masters."
"I wrote a novel, now what?","I can't speak to the Italian market specifically, but generally speaking the fiction market is totally saturated with manuscripts, most of them completely hopeless. This saturation means that it is very hard to get over the first hurdle of getting a publisher or agent to even pick up and read your manuscript.  Two ways to improve your chances of getting read are referrals and meeting agents and editors in person.  If you don't know anyone in the industry, you can look for a writing teacher in your area who has connections in the publishing industry. Take their class. In that class they will get to read your stuff. If they think it is good enough they may agree (or even volunteer) to refer you to someone they know in the industry (agent or editor). This will greatly increase your chances of being read.  To meet agents or editors directly, go to a writing conference. Most of these offer pitch sessions where you get five minutes to pitch your story to an agent or editor. If they like your pitch they will ask you to send a sample or the whole manuscript. This way you get read, and you have established the beginning of a relationship with someone on the inside. "
Killing the protagonist - should it be done?,"It's definitely possible to do this without losing the reader. The New Testament is a story where the ""protagonist"" dies towards the end. I'm sure plenty of readers are quite satisfied with that. Much like the Gospels, killing the protagonist is advisable only if it really means something. Emphasis on the really. Even if you make your character a martyr whose death brings about a sweeping social change that lasts for centuries and cleanses you of your sins, it doesn't mean anything if your reader doesn't care. Does your reader sob when the protagonist finally breaks the chains of his oppressors and dies a free man? Does your reader smile at the earnest deathbed confession of your protagonist, who has finally come to terms with his life and family after all those years of struggling? Can your reader not stop thinking of the warrior who bravely held her ground until the very end? Does the death of the salesman point out the futility and meaninglessness in this world and brings up philosophical questions in the reader's mind? Does your reader understand why the death had to happen (even if they wanted a happy ending for the character)? Then you can kill your main character. Delicately. Carefully. Probably with the intent from the very beginning that you're going to kill this protagonist off and that is the definite culmination of their entire purpose or character arc.  Even if their death is at the beginning of the story and the entire rest of the fiction is just flashbacks, it has to mean something and it has to be their purpose. Don’t just shuffle them out of the way by saying, “Oh yeah, and then she fell down the stairs, how tragic, oopsie daisy,” because that's when readers start feeling ripped off. And there are plenty of stories out there (besides the New Testament) you can look at that pulled this off successfully. I’m afraid to bring any up because, hello, spoiler alert, but I can think of a good one where the death is the main point of the piece.  One of my favorite short stories is ""Bullet in the Brain"" which is a quick read that handles the death of the main character in an interesting way. I think this is a good example of how you've really got a lot of options out there for where and when to kill off the protagonist. It just depends on how you want the story to flow and what kind of meaning you want to give to said death."
The art of clickbait captions,"Clickbait isn't like news where you tell someone the headline so they'll click for more information. Eggplant linked to lower cancer rates. Clickbait is where they have to click just to find out the headline. This one vegetable stops cancer! There's no nuance in clickbait.  Not like medical articles where you use caution about overselling things. Never tell readers to ""click here,"" because that should be what your headlines makes them think. If you have to tell them, you've lost. Clickbait creates promises.  Sometimes it is about making money, achieving fame, or curing disease.  But other times it's a promise of great entertainment. Whale thanks her rescuer with this incredible move. The purpose of clickbait is eyeballs (getting the visitor counts up), not to inform, or even to sell.  And you do this in part by teasing something someone can't find out via the regular news. Put this all together and you get lines like: 7 secrets of fame celebrities don't want you to know."
Is there any good time-line software out there?,"Other than Scrivener :) I find Excel (or another spreadsheet program) works surprisingly well.

'The Chosen One' paradox,"You, as the author and creator of your specific fictional world, have the choice to define which of these statements is true. There is no inherent reason to assume one or the other is true and that the other one is false. In fact, it's often used as an important plot device for the characters themselves to explore whether they are just a pawn doing what some higher power wants from them or they have a ""choice"" and can influence the world around them. There is not even a reason to tell your reader what you decided. Simply explore this very paradox in-universe and see what your characters make of it. And if it ever blocks you from writing just choose one and go with it for the moment - if it doesn't feel right later you know that you need to change it and that the other one is the right one for you, your story and your specific world."
Is it a bad idea to have multiple bad endings and only one good ending?,"If you are going for a darker themed game, and your description suggests that you are doing this, then having multiple bad endings is fine. I've played quite a few horror games that were created with the RPG Maker (I am not affiliated with the company) for example where there are lots of bad endings - and I enjoyed all of them. Because you spend most of your time in the game itself: The journey is the destination.  Having only bad endings would probably be a bad idea. This would make the player feel like all of their effort was indeed wasted. But if your game makes it obvious that there are multiple endings and each ending gives information about a possible other ending, one of them being good, then everything is fine. If only you had taken the knife with you that the Antagonist just used to stab you, things might have gone a different route... The players who enjoy playing a game multiple times will try to follow the advice they got. Others might simply look up a walkthrough that shows them the other endings. I've been on both sides, depending on how much time I would need to spend with the same stuff I've already done in previous runs. The more decisions one can do the better. Spending 10 hours only to click Left instead of Right before the Boss' lair is boring. But deciding whether you take the lamp or the book with you after a few minutes is a completely different matter. As long as these decisions matter that is. Having regular checkpoints, especially before important decisions can help, too. If that is your style, of course. Some games prefer to go a rogue-like style and let the players decisions be final when they are deciding which part of the story they want to play.  Having only one good, hard to achieve, ending is especially good for perfectionist gamers that want to get everything. They will try to get every ending and see which hints they contain that will help them get to 100 %.  Furthermore having only one good ending makes this one feel special to the players who manage to achieve it. It's clearly better than any other ending they managed to get and therefore more valuable in their eyes.  Having bad things happen to your character is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as you give it a positive spin. See my answer to the question Still struggling with character desire, positive vs. negative, hooking readers for a more detailed discussion about why negative feelings resonate more strongly in us humans and how this can be used to give a character a motivation that the reader/player can relate to as they are trying to bring happiness to the character that is suffering. Multiple bad endings mean that there are more reasons to help the character finally achieve his well-deserved piece of peace and happiness.  What you also sometimes see is that a game has maybe two or three bad endings (plus a Game Over that can for example occur if the player dies) and one good ending. And then one special, true ending that you can only get if you for example collect all of the very rare items. This is another possibility. Make it a little bit easier to have a nice ending to please your more casual gamers and make the true ending extra hard to get and thereby extra rewarding. The true ending doesn't have to be completely happy by the way, though this will surely leave the player with the feeling of having completed a horror game. Having only equally bad endings is possible, but in general you want your player to think: ""That went better than the last time. Still bad, but I managed to get further. If I keep this up I will make it to the 'good' ending!"" That means you should think about making endings in multiple shades of bad - from ""Game Over"" over ""I am dead at the end"" over ""Well, I managed to run away, but I didn't realize there was a trap outside that room"" over ""I managed to nearly get away - if only I had a weapon to fight that final monster"" to ""I managed to get away and lead a happy life"". With the true ending being ""The monster was my sister/ my father/ myself all along..."" But your game has to fit this style. You don't want a totally happy and relaxed game where you suddenly realize at the end that your decisions have led to a bad ending. Imagine for example a Pokemon game (again, I am not affiliated with the company) where you basically have nothing to lose from spending some time trying to catch or train your Pokemon - and in the end you realize that there was a time limit of 100 in-game days to get to the end and now you can't beat the Top Four. That would suck. "
Avoiding spectacle creep,"There are more things you can do with stakes than escalate ad nauseam. First, you can vary the threat. For example, Buffy jokes more than once about ""saving the world again"". The difference comes from saving the world from different things; a new threat might require a new approach, pose a tougher challenge than the previous threat, etc. Second, there might be personal stakes in addition to the ""save the world"" stakes: save the world without letting mum find out my secret identity, save the world and my lover whom the Big Bad has put in danger to distract me, save the world from my best friend who's gone crazy. (All from Buffy again, since I've already started with that example). Third, once in a while, you can lower the stakes. How about helping a single person who's stuck in an abusive relationship? Or not letting any baddies interfere with a friend's wedding? Fourth, your hero might get de-powered. They suffered a serious wound in the final battle of one story, so in the next story, they're still recovering, and it hinders their ability to deal with the threat of the day. Or they're going through some emotional stuff. Or last time they got fined for damage to buildings, roads, etc., so now they need to save the world without wreaking half a city in the process. Done too often, this trope becomes annoying (as do most others), but once in a while - it adds interest, not only by making the challenge more challenging, but also by showing the hero as not all-powerful. The audience's sense of danger to the hero increases, everything becomes more tense and more exciting."
"""The flux capacitor--it's what makes time travel possible."" When to keep world-building explanations short","I think there are two basic reasons for describing anything in fiction.  One is to give sensual pleasure in its own right. There are all sorts of sensual pleasures that prose might convey, from the erotic to the gastronomic to the social. Tom Clancy's loving descriptions of really big machines with really big guns are designed to titillate those of certain tastes. The depiction of suffering and injustice in the works of more liberal minded authors is designed to give a frisson of self-righteousness to the reader. Harry Potter depends heavily on the child's pleasure in the fantasy of being special and powerful, of being rewarded for extraordinary gifts where others would be scolded and sent to bed.    The sensual appeal can be very strong, but it is also very individual. What entrances one reader will repulse another.  The other reason for description in literature is to support story. This is about what we need to know to follow the story and to feel fully immersed in the story.  The reason backstory dumps are so often a problem for writers is that they often come before the reader cares about them. Unless they are well enough written to give sensual pleasure, and the reader is receptive to that particular brand of sensual pleasure, then the description is tedious if it is not relevant to the story as the reader is currently experiencing it.  Back to the Future is a fish out of water story. How the flux capacitor works is not story relevant, and would not give sensual pleasure to most of the intended audience, so it is not detailed in the movie.  The Matrix is a much more philosophical movie. It deals with the ancient philosophical question of how we can know if anything is real. Contemplating this question gives us the pleasure of feeling clever and feeling superior to the lesser minds who go around blissfully believing everything they see. It is also relevant to the story at the point it is given (as best I remember) because Neo needs to know the nature of the thing he is fighting.  "
Help! I've got Writer's Block,"The key point with writing is that writing should be a habit.  I would go so far as to say that what you write (initially) is probably not as important as the fact that you write.  Many authors have confessed to sometimes sitting down and just writing ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"" and other inane phrases over and over again.  Why? Because this is what helps to release your subconscious, which is where you want to be. It is exceptionally rare that you'll ever sit down and be able to write something ""read-worthy"" immediately. Most writers develop and incubate ideas over long periods of time. I would therefore say that the right place to start is to: You'll notice the key element through all this is: write. Soon, you'll start to come up with ideas of what to do with what you've written, and you'll write some more ... and that's where the magic is. Write."
"If I'm writing in US English, am I not allowed to use the metric system?","If you're writing for a U.S. audience, then the thing you have to realize is that car speeds are pretty much always given in miles per hour (mph). If your goal is to communicate a car speed to a U.S. reader, then you need to give the speed in mph. Listing the speed in km/h says something in addition to (and possibly instead of) communicating the speed of a car. This could be a good idea if you know what you're trying to say by doing so, and wish to convey that effectively. If you don't — e.g. you're writing km/h simply out of habit — the effect you achieve will most likely be negative. An example of effective use is if you want the reader to feel like they're in a foreign land; giving speeds in metric units could be one of the dozen different tools you're using to help create and maintain that feeling. This would, however, give you an added challenge if numbers are meant to be meaningful (e.g. to provoke the reaction ""wow that's fast!""); since the reader's experience doesn't give them the needed frame of reference, your writing will need to provide it for them. Or you could give other cues so that they can understand the meaning even if the numbers don't do it for them."
How to avoid mentioning the name of a character?,"Sure, take the example of the Library story arc in Doctor Who, we see River Song tell the Doctor his name by way of convincing him she's trustworthy but we don't hear it. The audience only know what she told him because she says she's going to tell him and only know it's the right name because of the Doctor's reaction to it. The same is possible in written fiction as well: X leaned over and whispered into the Old Man's ear. The colour drained from his weatherbeaten features, then he found his voice. ""But how do you know that name?"" he sputtered. Or something similar, the key is to show the information being used without actually saying what that information is."
How to perpetuate the plot-driving riddle without frustrating the reader?,"The convention is usually that the resolution of the story is the resolution of the mystery, but if you want the mystery to remain unresolved, what is it that gets resolved at the end of the story? Why does the story end when it does? You might have your protagonist coming to terms with what he's done and with the idea that he doesn't know what really happened. You could leave the protagonist banging his head against a padded wall unable to accept that he doesn't know what really happened (which is a resolution of a sort). I understand it's moving away from the premise above, but you could have an epilogue with the antagonist starting the process again with his next victim - a resolution for the antagonist that the reader knows but the protagonist doesn't. Whatever you do, there will have to be something the reader can point at to say ""this is why the story ends here"". Additionally, you could drop hints to the reader earlier in the book that what they were reading wasn't standard genre fiction - emphasising the protagonist's journey so this is more prominent than finding clues. You could also play with the idea of an unreliable narrator (several good examples listed on that page). Whichever way you go, something will need to be resolved at the end of the book. If it isn't the riddle, the emphasis should be on what it is."
Why write a book when there's a movie in my head?,"Screenplays are also very difficult to sell, for a first-timer. Books are quite a bit easier. Unlike a screenplay, a book is in its final form, and relatively easy to produce, big publishers can do it cheap, in the single-digit thousands, and have the contacts to get it reviewed and advertised.  Screenplays can cost tens of millions to produce, they are a huge investment involving many dozens of creative artists and other story tellers, and they are incomplete. It is difficult to sell screenplays because the investment is so high, and studios can't produce a hundred new films a year, there isn't that much money. They have to be very selective. Publishers don't. They are selective, but the financial bar is much lower, 90% of the work (writing) is already done, and they really can afford to push out a few hundred new books a year.  Start with the book. If you write ""cinematically"" (keeping in mind that movie viewers cannot read any text of internal thoughts or description, they can only see and hear), and sell enough copies to prove you have written a good story, then a movie studio might pick it up. Sell the book through an agent. If you can't get an agent, your story is not good enough! It has to be a good book before it can be a movie.  An agent is thinking of all rights to your story from the start, she will make sure you don't fall into any traps and lose your rights, or your influence, or whatever it is you want to keep. She only gets 15% of what YOU get, so she is focused on making sure you get the most money possible out of your work, and she is a professional negotiator that knows the ropes of the entertainment industry, including movie rights and what all the contract clauses mean."
How to make travel scenes interesting without adding needless plot diversions?,"If I'm following you, it seems that the travelling itself isn't important, but that the characters have traveled is advancing the plot.  You can cut out most of the actual journeying, showing the quest in what the characters do when they stop moving. You can have characters refer to the travelling enough to make it clear how far they traveled -- gods damn it, my feet hurt.  As a bonus, if you have on-the-road scenes after setting up this pattern, they'll come across as fresh and different. "
How unadvisable is it to flip the protagonist into a villain?,"Sounds like a great idea!  Seriously though: the antagonist is the single most important character to any plot. The very best antagonists have motivations and feelings that readers can understand and empathize with. A former protagonist as an antagonist sounds really good. Both the reader and the author should be in for a fun ride, because it is very likely you will see your character grow in ways you didn't expect when you had them boxed in as a ""good guy"".  Think about people you know in real life. If you really observe people, you come to understand that nobody is a ""good guy"". Sure there are people who are generally good and generally do good things, but nobody is perfect, and even the best people have thoughts and motivations you may not approve of. Even more interesting is the fact that two people can be absolutely opposed to one another without either one being objectively ""wrong"" or ""evil"". They might just have goals and motivations that are diametrically opposed.  Imagine a city council wants more tax money to build a park. A local business wants to pay less tax money so they can afford to give Christmas bonuses. The business owner isn't ""evil"", in fact, he wants to give Christmas bonuses! The city council isn't ""evil"" either, they just want a park for the kids. Sometimes goals just conflict in an irreconcilable way. That's the real world. That kind of plot provides a lot more food for thought than a two dimensional ""good versus evil"" morning cartoon romp. "
Uh oh - My book stinks. Now what?,"My first published book was the eighth one I had written. I don't know that the other seven were stinkers--they earned me literary representation, and four of them climbed quite high on the ladder at publishers before ultimately being turned down--but for sure, I learned a lot and improved between books one and eight. I share this to say--not only is there no shame in setting a book aside, it's practically par for the course in this industry. Very few authors have their first book-length work published. You may find you come back to a kernel or portion of this book one day, after writing or publishing others. Or it may stay in that cyber drawer forever. Either way, I promise it won't be wasted. It's all part of the journey that is going to lead someone wise enough to pose this question to ultimate success as a writer. Good luck!"
How long can a fantasy novel stay in metaphorical Kansas?,"The purpose of the Kansas section is to establish the Real World before embarking on the Quest (to use the terms from the Hero's Journey). The Real World is the place which the Hero (gender/age/number neutral) must leave behind. You can use it to establish character traits, and the Quest could potentially begin there, but generally I think your beta readers are right: either leave the Real World quickly or establish the existence of magic quickly. If it's a fantasy book, get to the fantasy. If it's an urban fantasy book, you still need to get to some element of fantasy promptly.  This can be something the hero doesn't understand, by the way. The White Rabbit can hop by without the hero chasing him; the reader knows what it is even if the hero doesn't. You can drop hints about Weird Things going on and not explain them for a few thousand words. So if you have a mob boss, one of the goons can be making a report about the night's activities and mention ""this crazy thing that happened/that Fast Eddie told me about, you wouldn't believe it,"" and we don't have to get any more detail than to confirm that something unusual is going on. ETA The Hero's Journey is a classic literary structure, popularly explained by Joseph Campbell in The Hero with a Thousand Faces and broken down into writing terms by Christopher Volger in The Writer's Journey."
Do Writers Use LaTex/TeX for writing?,"For longer pieces, especially those with figures, tables, contents, or internal references, or citations.  For shorter pieces (such as an essay) I'd do it in Word or OpenOffice, since I normally don't need the power of Latex and getting it laid out properly won't involve much work.  Any writing of decent size, I use LaTeX because: I only worry about content and not layout. If I'm writing a scientific paper, thesis, or dissertation, there is usually a latex style that I can apply once the content is there. If I need to apply a different layout (ie: change from two-column to one column), change figure titles, etc) this is as simple as applying a different style.  Managing internal references. Word does it but it's always been a pain personally to use. Latex handles it elegantly.  Citations. BibTex is awesome and works with pretty much every reference management software out there. No mouse necessary. Latex has one hell of a learning curve. Making changes to layout can drive you to bang your head against a wall. However, once you've become comfortable with it, your output can speed up heavily. You stop thinking about formatting while you're writing. You don't worry about selecting the correct bullets, or making sure things are indented properly. You simply write text and put markers that define what that content is (chapter, section, caption, etc). Your style handles the rest.  Version control. Because Latex files are pure text, they go very easily with version controls and diff. Seeing changes between versions shows you exactly what changed.  Cross platform and repeatability. Because it's all text, you can edit it anywhere. Including vi through a shell. Latex will also always produce the exact same document, as a PDF if desired, so you don't have to worry about how someone is going to open it.  Equations. If you're writing equations, it really can't get much easier and much nicer output than Tex's math mode. What I absolutely don't use it for: Scriptwriting. Final Draft is much better suited to that task."
"What is the correct usage of ""P.S."" in Emails?","P.S. in e-mails is used exactly the same as P.S. in normal letters.  It is short for the Latin post scriptum, i.e. written after the main script.  As such, it is written at the bottom (end) of the main script (main e-mail in this case), and generally contains information which is trivial, or tangental to what was just said.  For example, I'm starting my new job on Monday.  Really looking forward to it.  I'm going to be working as a clothes designer. P.S. Do you still like making clothes?"
I have written my first novel and I think it's ready. What next?,"Typically, you would begin querying agents.  Agents offer a number of benefits: The cost of an agent is a commission on your work, if it sells (and not before!).  Usually this amounts to 15%. EDIT: As MGOwen points out, there are some incompetent and/or exploitative people in the agenting business too.  Preditors and Editors is an award-winning website that can help you check up on agents to make sure they're on the up-and-up.  You should also look for agents that are members of AAR - the Association of Author's Representatives.  This is the primary professional organization for literary agents. Querying an agent usually involves sending a query letter and the first few (rarely more than 5) pages as a sample.  Agents will specify the exact format they desire, and they will almost all be slightly different.  Writers Market is one of the better-known resources for agent listings.  Note that they are a paid service.  (They also have print editions).  For the most part, agencies are all on the web these days, and they should describe their preferred formats on their site. A great resource for learning about how to craft effective query letters is Query Shark.  Miss Snark's Blog also says quite a bit on the subject (though that blog is no longer updated).  I'm sure there are other good resources out there too, if you do a little searching. If your query piques the interest of the agent, they will usually request a ""partial"" - basically a larger chunk of your manuscript, like 30 to 50 pages.  Then, if they still like what they're seeing, they'll request the whole thing. Finally, if the agent likes the entire work, they will offer representation.  Alternately, they may ask to see a rewrite before offering representation.  There are a number of things to consider at this stage, namely how well you and the agent ""fit"".  Numerous agents offer advice about this on their blogs, but I won't go into detail here. Once you've signed a contract with the agent and gone through any revision, they'll begin shopping your book around.  Hopefully everyone loves it, there's a huge multi-house auction, and you can retire! While querying agents is the most well-known way to get a book into print, there are alternatives you can explore. Some publishers will accept queries or full manuscripts.  You may choose to submit directly to these publishers.  Small presses may be more likely to look at your unrepresented work.  If your book does garner interest, you may choose to deal with contract negotiations and the rest of the business side of publishing on your own.  A better alternative is probably to get an agent at this point.  It won't be hard when you tell them you already have a publisher who wants to buy your book. Another option, ""Vanity""/self-publishing, is more popular than ever.  Be extremely wary, however!  ""Vanity"" publishers will disguise themselves as small presses, large presses, and anything else they think will get you to fork over your hard-earned cash.  In traditional publishing, the money always flows toward the author.  If you see anything about up-front fees, you're typically looking at a vanity publisher.  Most of these businesses make their money from authors, who pay significant sums to have their books published. If your main concern is seeing your book in bound form, and you don't mind paying for it, this path may be for you. Just be aware of what you're getting into.  Vanity presses make their money from authors, so they have little incentive to actually sell books.  They offer no marketing support, and your book will not generally be stocked on bookstore shelves or get reviews.  Most books published through these companies sell only a handful of copies.  It is possible to sell large quantities through self-publishing, but it generally requires a lot of hard work on the author's part, promoting and marketing.  A platform, such as speaking engagements, can also help.  Even then, it's a bit of a long-shot. Finally, print-on-demand is an emerging alternative which allows books to be printed one-by-one, rather than in large runs.  Companies that offer this service typically take a cut of each book sold, and are able to remain profitable by keeping minimal inventory. Publishing through print-on-demand shares some of the pitfalls of ""vanity"" press, namely the lack of any support from the publisher.  Print-on-demand is probably even less likely to assist with formatting the manuscript for publication.  However, the cost of entry is generally much lower in print-on-demand. This post has already gotten rather long, and it's nowhere near being exhaustive.  Publishing is a complicated business, and it pays to do your research.  Find some author, agent and editor blogs that talk about the business.  There are literally hundreds of them these days.  Read up.  Ask questions when knowledgeable people are willing to answer.    You can never be too prepared!"
What are good places to post your work where it will be read by others?,"Fictionpress is a popular website that allows anyone to upload stories, read those stories, and comment.  As the site is wide open, the quality of comments varies wildly, along with the quality of stories.  Earlier in my life, I frequented the site, but I eventually left, as I wanted more constructive feedback than I tended to get there.  It does have the advantage of being easy to use and having a large user-base. A quick google search indicates there are also a number of clones.  I cannot comment as to their quality, having never tried them. If you're looking for more critique and less friendly chit-chat, as I was, I would recommend joining an online critique group like Critters.  Critters is designed to encourage participation (you have to give about 3 critiques per month to have your stories critiqued).  It is also designed to encourage useful, constructive, and in-depth feedback.  I typically get 10-20 critiques on any story submitted, with 90% or more being very useful.  The science-fiction/fantasy/horror portion of the site has been around for some time, but the other genre sections are new, so I don't know how populated they are at this point in time. Also, be aware that making a story freely available to anyone on a site like Fictionpress effectively uses your First Electronic Rights, and possibly others.  This means you are no longer able to sell those rights.  This can be a big turn-off to publishers.  You may want to do some research on publishing rights before putting a story online, if you plan to submit it for publication."
Averting Real Women Don’t Wear Dresses,"I would suggest looking at the women in your life (family, friends, co-workers, etc). I have a problem with the ideas of 'feminine qualities' and 'femininity'. They imply that without those a woman isn't a real woman. Much like a man won't be a real man unless he is and can do a set of things. You could perhaps think about the stereotypes for 'manly qualities' and 'masculinity' and draw parallels between those concepts and the reality you know as a man. Just imagine yourself buying a piece of clothing and having the assistant say it's a very nice choice, but won't you consider this other option which is more masculine and would, therefore, suit you better. Yeah. Switch it for 'feminine' and that is what women who prefer a sportive look have to put up with.  To deal with feminine characters that aren't cliché 'femininity', look at real women. I shall give you some examples from real life women: Woman A: in her fifties. She has always been diplomatic in speech, smiley and eager to help. She can sew wonderfully and loves to make the cutest outfits for her many little nieces and nephews, and now grandchildren. She loves decoration, too. I have not seen her in a skirt or dress in over 20 years. Even for weddings, she'll simply put on nice looking pants. She'll tell you all the many reasons why skirts are uncomfortable. Woman B: in her thirties. Hates frills, lace and all girly, feminine clothes. Does wear skirts and dresses but prefers simple cuts that fit the body without 'advertising the goods' because, really, why don't you just add arrows to the boobs. No make-up. Practicality, people! She wore high heels to her wedding under duress and got off them the moment the photos were done. Adores her long sleek hair and is always changing the colour, doing it up in ponytails (you won't know how many ways there are of making a simple-looking ponytail until you meet her). She loves cooking and was born to be a mother. Woman C: 30s. Give her high heels and the most feminine, sexiest clothes, complete with frills, lace, jewelry, make-up, the works. Curses like a field worker and has the grace of an ox. She will 'run you over' if you fail to praise her goddaughter in anyway. Woman D: 40s. can't stand heels and would live with trainers only; hates pants and shorts, loves skirts and dresses; cannot cook or sew; hates cleaning the house and has no problem receiving friends while having around piles of clothes which will eventually be ironed (probably five minutes before being worn), a pile of dirty plates to be washed 'tonight' (or when she feels like it), and a few dirty clothes on the floor (she's separating them into different colours to make separate loads... only she does the separating throughout the week). She basically lives like the stereotypical frat boy and will clean up for real only when her mother announces a visit. Woman E: 40s. Blunt in her honesty and even bordering on rude/aggressive, but you know she is the greatest friend ever and will stand by your side no matter what (and I mean the drop everything to drive miles and be there for you kind of friend); loves cars and driving, and can put up all sorts of IKEA furniture without a helping hand (very proud of her handiness); will dress up to go out with a long flowing skirt, otherwise a pair of jeans, comfortable flat (unflattering) shoes and a clean T-shirt are good enough; will not go anywhere without earrings (huge collection).  'Woman' F: 10 year old. Loves princesses, skirts, dresses and glitter. Loves running and roughing it with her cousins (both female and male). Will enjoy 'mock' fighting and won't be bothered by bruises and scratches. As you can see, all those women have some traits that are typically feminine (some more than others), but they also have traits that are not considered feminine.  My suggestion is that you give your heroine a mix of traits. Some may be feminine, most will be normal. Neither typically feminine nor masculine, just... normal! Moreover, keep in mind that different cultures have different ideas for 'typical women'. I grew up surrounded by real strong women. They're the ones that rarely raise their voice, but when they do people around will listen. There's a saying that 'a real man doesn't cry not even if he sees his guts in his hands'. Well, there's no saying for women, but I have always seen women act according to it. You may have your loved one dying in your arms, but you will not break down and cry in front of them while you can still do something to help or comfort. Later, you can cry your heart out with your friends and family, but not when 'your guts are in your hands'. You put up with being harassed, shamed, ridiculed and paternalised, but you keep your head high and keep going even if you are breaking apart inside. I have a woman in my family who lived over 40 years with crippling pain. She only lost her smile and warmth when it got too much, and she still tried to play it down.  From the women around me, I learnt that a woman puts up with a lot of shit and pain (motherhood, especially) and will talk about it and vent, but will not self-pity, ever! Crying your heart out and venting is not self-pitying, by the way, though some men may think it is. You have to let your pain out some way in order to pick yourself up and keep going. Self-pitying is whining over and over about the same thing and never do anything to try and overcome it.  A strong woman may let someone win an argument because it's not worth her time and energy, but will bulldozer anyone - man and woman - if her family is in the line. And, for that, she will use words, hands, umbrellas and anything else she can get her hands on. So, forget the clichés for women and look around at the women in your life. Look at those you look up to as strong and capable of making through anything (for me, it would be mostly aunts, grandmothers and great-grandmothers). See how they measure up to the cliché in order to weed out what definitely doesn't make a woman a woman. Lace and frills, for example. "
What is a normal length for a chapter?,"It is feasible to count the number of words in a published chapter:  count the number of words in several lines, count the number of lines per page, count the number of pages in the chapter, and multiply.  You won't get exact, but you're wondering whether 3-5K is reasonable, so you don't need exact.  Try it on some books with chapter lengths you like, and don't be surprised if it varies considerably. When I was a kid, books tended to have about seventy thousand words, and a table of contents that filled one page, so figure about 4-5K. I'd think that the right length for a chapter would be one that could be read at a sitting conveniently, and would provide a useful chunk of story.  That can vary wildly."
Is it worth switching to Dvorak?,"Personally I switched to Dvorak about six years ago, and I've found it to have been a net positive over all. My typing speed is about the same as before, though oddly my error rate has gone down. On the other hand, I haven't had any serious wrist pain since I switched. There are some downsides to switching.  If you do try to change over, I'll warn you that the third week or so will be the worst. You'll kind of know where everything should be but you'll have a hard time finding it. Typing will be a huge pain for a few days as everything starts to properly shift around in your head. If you can get through it though, it will get better after that."
"I'm producing a play with a character who the audience isn't supposed to know is alive, can I credit the actor in the program?","I would credit the actor but not their role if that's possible, credit them by name as part of an ""and others"" section for the parts with no lines. Or maybe disguise their role, instead of the character name use a title, like ""roman guard number 4"", adjusted to be materially appropriate of course."
Do hard to pronounce names break immersion?,"Hard-to-pronounce names suggest a different culture. If War and Peace had its characters named not Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky and Pierre Kirillovich Bezukhov, but Andrew Bolk and Peter Bek; or if the characters of the Kalevala were named not Väinämöinen and Joukahainen, but Van and John, that would ruin my immersion. It would break my immersion because the names would not match the culture presented. As a reader, if I encounter a name I don't know how to pronounce (e.g. certain Welsh names in the Mabinogion), I pronounce it the best I can, and move on. If I am informed of the ""correct"" way to pronounce the name, I amend what I thought the name should have been pronounced like, and stick to the correct pronunciation. I see no problem there. (And I've never heard of anyone claiming they can't read the Mabinogion because they don't know how to pronounce the names.) If you care about the readers pronouncing the names correctly in their heads, you can provide a pronunciation guide. Tolkien did this with The Lord of the Rings, others did it too. A pronunciation guide doesn't assure, however, that readers would actually follow the pronunciation you have in mind. For one thing, it can be somewhat hard to explain in writing what sound you have in mind. For another, if you put the pronunciation guide in the beginning, it's not sufficiently interesting, the readers are not yet sufficiently immersed in the story to care, they might well just skip it. And if you put the pronunciation guide in the end, it's already too late - the readers already have the ""wrong"" name in their heads, and they've already finished the book anyway. An alternative is to add some hint within the story. A name can be woven into a bit of verse, so the rhyme helps the reader understand how the name should be pronounced. That, however, requires work, it might not be natural to your story, and even if it is, you wouldn't do that for every single character. In short, no, hard-to-pronounce names do not break immersion. However, if the names you plan are particularly long, you might find this discussion of long names helpful."
What can a novel do that film and TV cannot?,"To break into TV, you need to live somewhere that produces a lot of TV shows (in the United States, you'd move to Los Angeles and try to hang out with others in ""the industry"").  I'm not sure how else you break in, but it's not easy.   You can self-publish 100 novels with the same ease (and money) it takes to make one 30 minute TV pilot.  More eyeballs too.  Perhaps there are paths to film/TV writing available to you (by networking or luck) that I don't know about.  The reality for most people is that you're a lot more likely to get published with prose, and even that's not easy to do. But you asked about ""forms and styles I can use in my writing that are not possible to do with film and TV."" My current project was in my head as a movie for 10 years.  I imagined scenes and camera angles and all the rest.  I don't have the skillset to write a screenplay (the technical stuff isn't hard to learn, I just don't know it yet) but I could have gotten it down easily enough and reformatted it later. When I decided to change course and write it as a novel, it was an interesting transition.  At first I decided to create it as a heavily illustrated book.  Not a graphic novel, but something leaning in that direction.  I don't draw but I did choose an artist (who I still think would be perfect) who has agreed to work on it when I'm ready. My first few chapters were good enough but relied heavily on the illustrations for descriptions (I have those illustrations in my head and described them briefly).  For example, Chapter One (after a prologue) happens with an extended family around a dinner table.  My prose only barely showed the reader what the characters looked like, how the table was set, what the room looked like, etc.  Some of that stuff was window dressing (but a well-dressed window is a joy to look at) but other details are important to the story. As I continued to write, I stopped relying on the pictures and started narrating. Description: A screenplay shows you the characters and the setting, sometimes in glorious detail, but it's a barrage.  With prose, you can set the scene sparsely or lavishly.  The reader can imagine to cover any gaps.   You also can direct the reader's eye.  Of course you can do this in a screenplay too.  It's called a closeup.  Prose gives you more subtlety.  You lay out the important parts without necessarily pointing a big sign at them screaming ""foreshadowing!"" Character thoughts:  There are many forms of narration in a novel.  Some allow you to get inside anyone's head, some only one person's head or a small handful.  Some don't do it at all.   When I started writing this novel, I had every intention of limiting my narration to what could be filmed.  I only included the slightest of thoughts, and then just things that a good actor could convey without words.  As I went further, I changed that.  And the novel got stronger. It's not necessary to include thoughts, but most novels do, at least for the main character (or a narrator who is involved in the action).  You can easily overdo it but, done right, it brings a depth to the characterization that is hard (and sometimes impossible) to capture in film.   When people talk about the difference between reading the book and seeing the movie and how the book is (usually) better, it's because the book gives you more than a movie can.  Length is a huge factor, but also how the characters feel. Length: Novels can have sequels and TV shows can go on for decades (some soap operas have).  But the reality is that you can pack in a lot more information in prose than will fit in a script.  When novels get adapted to movies, large portions of plot get cut, subplots are often removed, and some characters are merged with others or just gone. Nuance: You lose character complexity and other nuances that a novel can give you.  If you're transitioning to thinking about your work as filmable to just printed, imagine the world this opens up for fleshing out secondary characters, showing more stops on a journey, or simply taking your time with a story. Time-depiction: Film uses actors and they are the age that they are.  You can use makeup to age an adult and you can go backwards some, but often you need new actors to use in flashbacks or subplots about characters at other ages.  Some TV shows do hire actors to show the characters as children or young adults, for example, but they tend to merge ages to limit this.   The TV show Any Day Now has parallel storylines with an adult cast and with them all as children.  Orange Is the New Black mostly sets stories in the present day but shows individual characters before they got to prison.  Some use the same actors and others use younger adult actors, teens, or small children. Child actors also age, so if there's a delay in filming, you might end up with a much taller actor (suddenly with breasts or facial hair) because you waited 9 extra months for funding, but the time jump is supposed to be a single summer.  It's even worse if you have to skip a season (as many shows do these days) and have the perfect young actors who are going to age out. Time Jumps:  In prose you can skip ahead 5 years without even blinking.  The show Jane the Virgin did this between 2 seasons, but they had to recast the children.  The adults didn't age visibly because...Hollywood.  Pretty Little Liars also jumped ahead, but in that case it was a relief because we no longer had actors in their 20's playing girls in high school.  Now the same actors were playing characters closer to their real ages. In prose you can also go back and forth through multiple timelines with ease.  If you want an entire chapter set 20 years ago, no problem. Settings:  You don't have to consider how expensive changing sets is or how you don't have the budget to film on location.  Just write it. Background information:  Does the reader need some information to make sense of the story?  Your narrator can just tell the reader.  You don't want to infodump, but sometimes it's just easier to write a line or two of background.  In film, a character has to know the information and tell another character (which might not be what you want for the plot) or somehow tell the audience (reading a diary out loud, inventing a throwaway character like a therapist, etc).  For something super important, that's okay.  But sometimes you just want a line or two every few pages. I've left out a few, but hopefully this is enough to get you started."
How do I hide Chekhov's Gun?,"I use Chekhov's Gun CONSTANTLY in my writing too. It has sort of gotten to a point of being excessive, actually. That said, I've learned quite quickly that Chekhov's Gun doesn't need to be fired inherently. Using the classic parable's example: the gun on the mantel can be ""fired"" in multiple ways. If you want to make the Gun blend in, mention in the same paragraph between 2-4 other Chekhov's Guns. They don't need to be fired in the traditional sense, but just that each of them is a symbol for something, so when people read your story, they just see the intended gun as being ""useless junk"" unless they've caught on to your use of symbolism thus far in the novel. Keep in mind that Chekhov's Gun is NOT an infallible law of writing. I am a firm believer in it, but it can be broken periodically specifically to subvert the reader's expectations. Feel free to do so by occasionally not mentioning the gun until it is needed (unless it would come across as an ass-pull), mention the gun (or other guns) and just don't use it (leading your audience to believe they can't be sure when an item will be important, throwing them off), or prepare the gun and attempt to use it only to have it not work and not matter (zigzagging expectations). Chekhov's Gun is just a trope. Don't assume you have to always play it straight. Play with it a little to fit your desired situation. Sometimes, you need to play with other guns so people won't see when you're ready to fire this one. As for your specific gun, though, you can solve this situation simply by having him pass by the door to the basement with an aged piece of paper still taped to the basement door saying ""Do Not Enter!"" or ""Keep Out!"" It really doesn't have to be anything major. It can be an organic moment like he sits down in the kitchen and that door is visible across the way. He can't help but to notice it, but by dismissing it immediately and not mentioning it at all for a while, the reader will forget it if you let them. PSA: Don't play with guns, kids!"
How does one write a character smarter than oneself?,You have several advantages over your characters:
"Avoiding the ""not like other girls"" trope?","If you want to avoid showing a character as ""not like other girls"" then make sure your ""other girls"" aren't stereotypical. The trope shows up with female characters who don't fit in.  They don't have a lot of female friends, if any.  When they do the stuff they like to do, they're surrounded by men.  You can praise these characters all you want but the sexism sticks.  Because they're doing these fun, intellectual, deeply felt things because they're different. Don't make them different. Make your female characters just like some other girls and very different from others.  And just like some boys and very different from others.  In real life, there's a mix anyway.   Our culture does steer kids from a very young age into male and female roles and activities (even when the parents don't, even when you don't think it's happening), so you'll have some lopsidedness.  And that's okay.  But for any large group where the social gender pressures aren't too extreme, you will have various genders doing all sorts of things and acting all sorts of ways.  Show that. Girls who like stuff that is more commonly done by boys will seek out other girls who like it too.  It's only in TV shows that these girls have no female friends.  Ditto boys who like ""girl"" stuff.  Sure, maybe there are some exceptions, but it's not common. If your female characters aren't actually doing things that most people would identify as ""boy stuff"", and it's just that they're strong and independent, and that is what makes them ""not like other girls,"" then your problem isn't with your main characters but with your supporting cast.  Not everyone is strong, not everyone is independent, but that has little to nothing to do with gender. Write true to life and balance your characters out.  That's how to avoid stereotypes."
How can I catch more errors when I proofread?,You could try reading the final draft out loud either to yourself or to another person. (That's what I have always had my own children do when they're working on school essays.) Reading out loud slows you down so that you are less likely to read over a duplicated word and it will be more obvious when a word is left out. It is also a good method for detecting awkward sentence construction.
How do I convey that a relationship is platonic?,"I agree that establishing the platonic nature of the relationship is important.  There are a number of ways to approach it, as in David Doyle's answer. But additionally, I wanted to point out a couple key things to consider: Be aware that even if you gently indicate that the relationship is platonic, many readers will still be watching for signs that there's a potential relationship waiting to blossom. That is the nature of literature - many of humanity's stories revolve around a romance story or contain one, thus readers will have a strong tendency to suspect romance.  They may even start to hold out hope.   Therefore, if you don't want that tension to develop and the reader's hopes end up unfulfilled, it's probably best to establish a clear reason why it isn't romantic and never will become one. There are numerous non-cheesy ways to say that someone loves someone like a sibling. Secondly, in your question you state ""not something they've ever considered,"" when perhaps that is part of the problem you're running into.  The ""romantic feelings haven't ever been considered"" scenario is actually at the root of numerous love stories: ""when X pauses to truly consider his feelings for Y for the first time, he finally realizes his love for her.""  It's almost a trope.  But if instead they have considered it, and then come to a clear conclusion that they have no romantic interests for a good reason, it is going to be more plausible that a romance isn't likely to develop.  Then readers will be less tempted to draw romantic tension into it."
How do I recover my confidence after a harsh writing group?,"Two tips: You are not your story. Your story may really, really suck. However, that doesn't mean that you're a bad writer or that you'll never write anything worth reading. It just means that this particular story needs work. If you're ever going to have a measure of success as a writer, you have to learn to disassociate your self-esteem from negative feedback you get about any particular story. Which leads to: Allow your writing to suck. Guess what? Pretty much everyone's first drafts suck. Second drafts, too. You may have to go through ten drafts to get to the one that works. You may also have to go through ten terrible short story ideas before you start writing the one that's going to be great. Don't sweat the fact that what you're doing right now isn't as beautiful and perfect as you want it to be--you can come back later and make it better, and if you don't have those skills right now, you can work on something else and come back when you have the perspective and the experience to write your story the way you've always imagined it."
Writing first programming book,"Close the intro. Promise yourself that you will write it last. Start a blank Scrivener page.  Start writing down everything that comes into your head about the topic. Follow your thoughts wherever they lead, but make each thought a new line. Don't organize; just write. When you run out of steam, go back to the top of the list, look at each thought, and see if it generates more stuff. Keep doing that until you can't think of more stuff to add to the list. Now that you have a list of stuff, start grouping it. Since I know squat-all about programming, I'll use gardening for my example. and so on. Just put the letter (A) in front of any statement to do with planting.  Make new pages for each of the Groups. Copy everything with an A to the A:Planting page. Copy everything with a B to the B:Weeding page. The lovely thing about Scrivener is that you don't have to put stuff in order yet. So once you have all your F:Organic statements together, just start writing. Do an info dump of everything you know about Organic Gardnening. When you run out of stuff, go to whatever topic strikes your fancy next. After a while, you will have enough information to see how your book should be structured, or you can find an editor who can help you organize everything. You can drag your pages around any way you like. The important thing is to get it all typed out. You can rearrange once you've gotten it on the page."
Is there a need for better software for writers?,"IDE-like tools exist for writers.  Scrivener is a powerful general-purpose tool (also with questions here).  Madcap Flare, aimed at technical writers, has good support for updating links, defining ""snippets"" (xinclude blocks, essentially), variables, conditionalization, advanced build options, and more.  Arbortext Epic is another tool in that vein.  There are XML editors like Oxygen and Notepad++ that you are probably already familiar with as a programmer.  That's just a sampling. Many writers prefer to just write and find that too much tooling gets in the way.  Some of them use tools for planning separate from writing.  Maybe fiction doesn't need to be refactored as often as code (though it does need to be refactored sometimes, and doing that in an editor using search is a pain).  There are a lot of different kinds of writing and writers, and generalizations like ""writers don't (or do) X"" don't always stand up to scrutiny.  Some do, some don't, some would if they didn't cost so much, and some do sometimes, depending on the task at hand. (Psst.  Some software developers still use emacs or vim...)"
"Avoiding the ""as you know"" trope in exposition","Two additional techniques... Character Reaction. A character might react in a way that reveals some of the information: ""Mother! What the heck are you doing here?"" Now we know that the person who just entered the room is the character's mother. Disagreement. You can have characters argue about it. They might disagree about: ""Really, Jeff? You invited your mother? On our honeymoon?"" Now we know the the person who just entered the room is Jeff's mother, and that Jeff and the speaker are newly married and on their honeymoon. With both of these techniques, the idea is to give some character a reason to react, perhaps strongly. The reaction reveals information to readers and viewers. There are likely other kinds of reactions that can help. EDITED TO ADD techniques for everyday, mundane information in response to user568458’s comment. (I realize my examples below are not screenplay examples. Adjust as necessary to make them observable.) If the thing is truly everyday and mundane, consider what makes it so. It's precisely this: You don’t have to think about it. You don’t have to interact with it. You don’t have to even notice it. It’s just there. It just works. These essential features of mundanity suggest some additional techniques. Interaction. Give a character a story reason to interact with it. If the interaction is mundane, the audience will pick up on the mundanity of it. Chaz downed the last of his coffee, stuffed the baby into the transporter, kissed his wife goodbye, and headed out the door. Decision. Make the mundane thing a factor in some decision the character must make. Chaz downed the last of his coffee and squinted at the baby transporter. He glanced at his watch. Not enough time to drive the baby to the learn-o-vat and still get to the Hair Emporium in time for his Pompadour appointment. So he stuffed the baby in the transporter, kissed his wife goodbye, and headed out the door. Break it. An everyday thing is mundane only as long as it works. If you break it, the character will at least notice. If it’s important, the character will react to it, and perhaps interact with it. Chaz downed the last of his coffee, stuffed the baby in the transporter, and kissed his wife goodbye. As he reached for the door, he noticed the baby’s shoe still in the transporter. That was odd. Specialist. Introduce a character whose vocation is to make sure mundane things remain mundane for everyone else. Plumbing is mundane… unless you’re a plumber. And it's less mundane to the plumber because the plumber must interact with it, must deal with the specific details of this specific plumbing. Omit it. Finally, an easy, always-available option for avoiding info-dumps: Omit the information. If nobody has to interact with it, if nobody has to deal with it, if nobody has an opinion about it, if it doesn't affect any characters' decisions, then it doesn’t matter to the story. If it doesn’t matter to the story, leave it out."
Getting Inside Someone Else's Head,"One thing you've got to remember as a writer is that you are not, in any spiritual sense, getting ""inside people's heads"". What you are doing is producing an artefact that convinces other people that you are inside the minds of many different characters but only as long as they don't look too terribly hard. Your question poses a worry that you can see that all your characters are just variations on you, or that you are having some difficulty drawing the line between where you end and your characters begin. Much apart from anything else, this is a problem of things not being realistic enough. After all, there is only one you and all the people who aren't you are someone else. Therefore any exercise in writing that does not feature you as a character must feature loads of people who are not at all like you and none that are. If you produce a work which has many variations on you and no one that is not you that's a problem, right? Well, no, not as such. You don't have a choice about lending some aspect of you to every character you write - after all, you're writing them. As I said when we looked at this problem at first glance the problem is not actually writing characters who are not you. It is making other people happy that all the characters are not you and most importantly letting you know all your characters are not you. The closest experimental parallel I can think of is with the experience of the actor. I was interested in acting for many years and, when taking on a part, I used to try my best to get under the skin of the character. Contrast this mental experience with the advice of most acting theorists; the most famous, Stanislavski, talks in no uncertain terms about the difference between acting something and being it. To Stanislavski, experience of reality is a completely separate thing from acting out that experience for an audience. He talks about the essential property of emotional distance from the character you are acting. The character may be overwrought, therefore the actor must act out overwrought but the actor must not be overwrought because that is just self-indulgence. The actor's duty is to communicate the experience to the audience so they can be moved by it, the actor must try not to be. Stanislavski's point of view has been argued about but I think there is much of merit in it. I knew many young actors (at one point I was among them) who spent enormous amounts of time psychoanalysing the character who subsequently turned in a performance that a 2'x4' would have been proud of. Another of Stanislavski's lessons which is pertinent here is called the ""magic if"". Essentially the characters in plays have families which are not like the actor's, they experience circumstances and have histories which are not like the actor's. In order to ""get into character"" Stanislavski positively encourages actors to ask how it is they would feel in the exact same circumstances, so ""what if my uncle had murdered my father and married my mother, how would I tackle this situation?"". The purpose of this exercise is to measure ways in which you, as a person, are similar to the character you are playing and how you are not the same at all. Essentially your sense of difference from the character as an actor helps you know how to portray them without getting confused and being them. The actor who identifies too closely with his role is a subject of dark, horrific melodrama for good reason. It's not pleasant to feel too close to your subject matter. So as a writer where does this leave us? 3 is the troublesome one. I would suggest two things: Hopefully these two exercises should start giving you the distance that you need."
"Editors: Edit on first read, or read and edit on second round?","I haven't done actual editing, but I've done a fair bit of critique and review. I think the issues are pretty much the same. Standard proviso: everybody has their own system. Of writing, of reading, of editing. Obviously your system isn't ""wrong,"" even if nobody else does it; nor is it ""right"" merely because you may find that everybody does it. But that's not what you're asking, so I'll assume this point is obvious :) Here's my take: the first read-through is crucial. That's how pretty much everybody is going to be reading it, after all, so that's the experience you want to polish, refine, and make absolutely perfect. In other words (and in more of them): your technique of marking reactions during your first read-through is (IMHO) spot-on. Your friend perhaps does not understand how difficult it is to re-capture those initial reactions of yours, or how important they are to the editing process. Your friend also might not appreciate that an editor's job involves, in a very real sense, the ability to read critically and for enjoyment in the very same reading. You have to: your criticism is meant precisely to make the book better, more powerful, more enjoyable; how can that skill be separated from your ability to feel the power and enjoyment in the book?  On the other hand, that being said, it is harder to enjoy a piece when you're also trying to fix it. In my experience, that first pass is an attempt to capture your response to the book - not to fix it, or to make any suggestions on how to deal with it triggering those responses. Those are things you can do once you've finished the first read-through. And anything critical (and certainly active editing suggestions) that can wait for later, probably should.  So, for example, ""Dude! It's been 100 pages since you mentioned Blandings Castle! WTF?"" would be fine, if that were your reaction, whereas ""It's been a long time since you've mentioned Blandings Castle - is this really necessary? If it is, maybe you could at least give some ominous hints to what's going on there - maybe as news from the water girl in Chapter 17!"" would probably be pretty far out of I'm-A-Regular-Reader Zone. That's what I'd take from your friend's opinion: capture your reaction; leave ""what to do about it"" for later; don't break into full-out Editor Mode. What's really nice is that as an editor, you can jot down your most cryptic, frustrated, mocking comments - the same ones you have reading any book! - without needing to explain yourself. You don't need to phrase your reactions as helpful comments, or even as intelligible comments. You just need enough to get a good sense, when you are writing your comments to the author, of what needs to be addressed - from the fresh-reader's perspective. Because you've got your own, all jotted down. You asked about my own technique; it sounds like it's something similar to yours. "
How do I keep the gender of my main character purposely ambiguous?,"One of the things that seems like a good idea to many beginning writers is trying to deceive the reader in some way or another. There is one problem with this idea: readers don't like it.  And why should they? The reader's enjoyment of a story depends on their ability to enter into the world of the story, to enter into what Tolkien called the sub-created world of the author. Disappointment comes when that illusion is shattered. But entry into the world, and the maintenance of belief in that world, become much more difficult if part of the picture is permanently greyed out or pixelated. It is as if the writer is refusing to let the reader in, and, of course, if the reader can't get in, they will stop reading. Yes, there is such a thing as an unreliable narrator. But the unreliable narrator is a construct of the writer and the reader meets them as they meet an untruthful person in real life. Their unreliability is presented wholly and honestly so that the reader can enter into the world in which the unreliable narrator exists and form judgements about them. Story is something very fundamental to the human psyche. We love stories. We need stories. We live by stories. And for this very reason, story has a very specific form. The body recognizes story, and if a narrative comes along that the body does not recognize as story, our mental antibodies attack and reject it.  Story allows for infinite variety within its basic structure and rules. But its most basic rule is to be honest with the reader.   EDIT (in response to the OPs edit): Gender is one of the first things we notice about people when we meet them. It is how our recognition system works. We categorize things, and gender is one of the most fundamental categories, perhaps the most fundamental category, that we use to categorize the people we meet. This is why androgyny is so striking when we see it: it disrupts our recognition system.  So, concealing the androgyny of your MC is an affront to the reader's most basic recognition of individuals. Whether or not the reader is open to varieties of gender, gender itself, whether binary or not, is a fundamental category of recognition. The reader cannot form a picture of the character without it, and so they will either give up on the character or make a decision for themselves.  If your characters are androgynous, say they are androgynous right up front. The first thing that the reader would notice about your character in real life is the first thing you should tell them about them in a story. You are creating an experience for the reader, and that experience is going to be incomplete and frustrating if you do not tell them the basic things they need to form a picture. "
How can I explain my world if the character is technologically not yet capable of understanding it?,"If this detail is important enough that readers should get it, you can have your characters make guesses at the truth close enough that (at least some) readers can connect the dots, while the characters can't and remain puzzled. For example, two especially educated explorers in your world could discuss the plants, and how all other plants they know need sunlight to survive but these don't. One of them could notice that magma gives off dim light when very hot. He might wonder if maybe when it cools down and appears as rock it still gives off light, just so dim a human cannot see it. Or one of them could wonder if there might be some kind of light that humans cannot see, connecting it (falsely) to animals that can see in the dark such as bats. Give enough hints that it ""clicks"" for the reader, but the characters, missing some science facts that are taught in schools today, can't complete the thought and leave it as a puzzle for later generations to solve. Bonus: This makes the reader feel smart."
How often should I remind my readers of the setting?,"Each time it makes sense, no more, no less. You do not need to make recalls. Consider your character's POV. When does he think about the weather ? Closing the door of my house, I looked at the sky. It will not be long before it starts to snow again. or Walking on the sidewalk, he was careful not to slip. or He looked at the landscape, beautifully wrapped in a coat of snow. If weather is meaningful for your story, that should naturally show in concrete facts, not arbitrary reminders."
How do you avoid purple prose?,I think you're off to a good start by killing the adjectives and adverbs. Overuse of modifiers are the #1 reason I reject a piece of fiction writing. Some thoughts:
"How do I say that a character said something without resorting to ""said Character"" every time?","You don't always have to tag ""said"" after every line said. You can do something like: ""Why do you always look at me that way?"" She turned her head away, embarrassed as she recalled all the times she caught him glancing at her while working. ""Because the sparkle in your eye, and the radiance of your smile could only be because you are an angel that fell from heaven."" ""Do you always use such corny lines to pick up women?"" She smiled at his attempt to be cheesy. Admittedly, she thought it was cute at the same time. You don't have to put said after every line, and even when you give ""tags"" to quotes, you don't even have to use said. Notice how I used other ways to fill the trailing of a quote. So feel free to skip a line or 2 with the he said she said stuff as long as it is just 2 people talking. Most people understand when you change lines, it's a new person and if you established it is just 2 people talking, they can follow who is who as long as you give tidbits here and there on who is what in the convo."
How do I construct a plot out of my many setting/character details?,A few strategies: Hope these are helpful :)
"Is it acceptable to use words like ""heaven"" and ""god"" when the narrator is agnostic?","I am another atheist, and a practicing scientist at a university. I don't regard any entity in any religion as real or sacred, and have no problem speaking of them. I know many religious people, including half my extended family, so I am conscious of not offending them, but I don't see any problem with using religious concepts in the same way THEY do: I also don't hold my own atheism sacred, I don't think I have any obligation to only use atheistic language in my life. I'll use the concepts of ""soul,"" ""God"", ""Heaven"", ""Hell,"" ""Angels"" and ""Demons"" whenever they are good shorthand or good description for what I want to say. Should a person that claims to be a Christian be prohibited from reference to Zeus or Aphrodite or Cupid, Olympus, Valhalla, or the River Styx? Must I believe King Arthur was real to be allowed to refer to Galahad? Must I believe magic exists to say my character was entranced? Your narrator should feel free to use any language they feel conveys the scene, without apology or explanation of why. It is not a contradiction for an atheist to refer to ""heaven"" in a figurative manner, no more than if they referred to garden fairies or bridge trolls in a figurative manner."
"Is it bad if I don't like the ""best"" books in my chosen genre?","I think it's fine, but you should consider the possibility that you value different things to most readers. Any book and/or series is going to have strengths and flaws. If its strengths are things you value, but the flaws are in areas you consider irrelevant, you impression of the book will be pretty good. Whereas if its strengths are things you don't value much, or the flaws are in areas you do value a lot, this will tend to produce a negative impression. This is one of the reasons that talking about the strengths and weaknesses of any given work of art tends to be more interesting than talking about whether we overall liked it. So, as stated previously, you should consider the possibility that you value different things to most readers. If correct, being aware of this is potentially valuable. For example, you could try identifying the kinds of things you value in a story, and then find someone who values very different things, and try cowriting a short story together. Perhaps you'll be able to ""get the best of both worlds"" so-to-speak."
Is it expected that a reader will skip parts of what you write?,"Many readers definitely will skim over parts of your writing. In my experience there are three primary reasons for this. Your writing is boring or drags. If a book spends too much time describing seemingly irrelevant details, I think I can predict exactly what is going to happen, or I don't feel invested in the characters in the scene, I'm liable to skim ahead. You have succeeded in creating tension, and the reader can't bear it. Different people have different thresholds for this. I know one person who always skipped to the last sentence. The good news is that these readers will usually go back and read what they missed unless the ending completely destroys their faith in the story. You simply wrote a piece of reasonable length. If your reader is tired but doesn't want to put the book down, they'll start skimming. They might not even realize they're doing it. I definitely remember staying up late reading Harry Potter and realizing I'd turned the page without reading any of the words. So, some amount of skimming is normal. Beta readers have a greater tendency to skim. Often beta readers want to give feedback in a timely manner. However, beta readers also are more likely to skim if they don't really like the story but feel they need to give feedback anyway. Regular readers won't skim if they don't like the story, they'll put it down. Once you've made sure your writing is engaging, you can help the people who inevitably still skim in a few ways: Make sure your writing is reasonably clear. Someone reading very quickly will  usually understand if they need to go back and re-read parts occasionally, but  if they are still confused after the second read they will be frustrated. If you need a reader to notice something to understand a plot point, either put it close to where they need to know it or make sure you spend significant time on it. If the key to the murder mystery is that Fred is left-handed, the detective should mention Fred is left-handed in the description of how he solved the case, not rely on the reader remembering a tiny detail 40 pages ago."
How can I portray body horror and still be sensitive to people with disabilities?,"Disabled people fear losing functionality as much as anyone else.  Perhaps even more so, because they need to rely on existing functional parts more strongly than others do. What you want to avoid is putting a value on it.  For example, losing a limb is awful and creates huge challenges in performing tasks of everyday living, transportation, and may require changing careers.  No one is going to dispute this.  You can show all that.  You can show the fear of going through that.  Just avoid judgements like ""no man would want her now"" or ""his life was no longer worth living."" You can use disability as a starting point as well (hopefully you'll have some disabled characters in there).  No one would want an accident that makes them deaf, for instance, but for someone who is already blind, the very idea of it would be terrifying beyond belief.  Someone who is already Deaf would be far more horrified at the idea of losing a hand than someone who is hearing. An additional disability can be easier for someone who already has one or more, because they're used to the idea of making changes to accommodate.  And the changes they've already made might be useful for the extra need too.  Other times though, it's harder than the first one.  Because if you have already gone to extensive hassle and expense and changing not just your life but those of the people who need to accommodate you, doing it all over again is just too fracking much. I don't know if your definition of ""body horror"" includes the brain.  One great fear we all have is losing our memories.  Not an amnesia situation (though that could be a horror too), but dementia and similar conditions.  We all rely on our memories to get through life but someone of may need them more than others.  People who are face blind, for example, have trouble recognizing even people they may know well.  If you can no longer count on your memory to figure out who the person is (based on clothing, hair, context, etc), you're in trouble. A person with an invisible disability may fear exposure.  It doesn't have to be about shame.  They may fear the social ostracization , the change in how people treat them, losing their job or not being allowed to do parts of it, losing a spouse, or even having their children taken away.  Invisible disabilities can become visible if they get worse or if a second disability changes the person's ability to function in a way that doesn't seem ""different."" My biggest concerns with showing a character acquiring a disability are:"
How to write strategy and schemes beyond my real-life capabilities?,"You have an advantage that people in the moment do not have: You have all the time in the world to think it through, and you can time-travel to the past to fix anything that goes wrong. I wrote a battle scene recently that in the book took place in the space of an hour, and my expert soldier with decades of experience planned the battle in about sixty seconds, on the spot. It took me weeks to come up with that plan, drawing sketches, thinking of ways to let the severely injured guy contribute instead of being a liability, coming up with the enemy's best strategy I could think of. And the at least two weeks of work, puzzling and a dozen revisions of the plan before I even began writing, when condensed into half a page, resulted in a strategy my test readers found brilliant and entertaining, in keeping with the reputation of my character as a brilliant strategist. But I took advantage of the fact I could go back in the book, and make changes to what had already transpired, for example to move my setting to something slightly more advantageous, e.g. near a natural barrier that wasn't there in my original draft, which my strategist knew the enemy would try to use to their advantage. (And knowing how they'd move when he gave them the opportunity let him turn that into a trap.) You can do lots of things that way, go back and invent an emergency to get rid of a character, or add a new character, or change the setting. Try to not do this for convenience, happenstance works best when it works against the heroes. So, for example, I can give my strategist a reason to use subterfuge by going back and injuring some of his crew, now he can't use a head-on attack. I can go back in time and invent a reason they lose most of their weapons.  What you have, that your characters do not have, is all the time in the world to think about it, and the ability to tweak the setting, history, and setup in ways that seem innocuous, but are crucial to the strategy. So you might think,  ""This doesn't make sense, they could just retreat. So what can I put behind them, so they can't retreat? A lake? Another army? Lions or cave bears? The enemy blew up their bridge? Ah, what if I put a river back there, two chapters ago ..."" By revising the past you have made it harder for them, and they can't just retreat, so it makes sense they have to go forward (or sideways). It can take a lot of time, revisions, and puzzling to figure out a good strategy, but none of your sweat and headaches have to appear on the page. From the reader's perspective, the setting is what it is, they never saw anything else, and the strategy is the first thing that popped into your character's brilliant mind. Other art can be like this too; in popular music many artists report hit songs that last 3 or 4 minutes took them over a year to write, to get the lyrics and rhythm and notes exactly right. An artist paints a painting in months, that you see and absorb in a few minutes. Even in food, some delicate new recipes take months to get right. You have time."
How do you make characters relatable if they exist in a completely different moral context?,"There is no problem at all with writing morally ambiguous characters, and it's surprisingly easy for readers to sympathise with them. Let us look at some examples: First, a modern example: A Song of Ice and Fire by G.R.R. Martin. There was a character in the first book of the series, who had all those honourable values, in particular he was averse to lying, as well as to killing children even when they might threaten the throne's stability. As a result of those lovely values, the character got killed, and the kingdom got dragged into a protracted (unresolved as of 5th book) civil war. Since then, characters who actually manage to make things better tend to be more Machiavellian. Second, let us look at works written in earlier periods - works that reflect the kind of different morality you talk about. Alexandre Dumas, The Three Musketeers: d'Artagnan was a traitor, Athos attempted murder, the plot with the diamond studs was treason. Not to mention the whole duelling things, such a glorified aspect of their culture - how would you look at it now, if two guys fought and one guy killed the other over a perceived offence (""I didn't like they way he looked at me"")?
Or, let us go further back, to, for example the Cantar de Mio Cid a Spanish epic poem about the glorified hero El Cid. El Cid gets unjustly exiled. First order of business - let's rob some Jews.
Or, going even further back, we don't seem to have trouble sympathising with Achilles, do we? Even though the Iliad starts from an argument over possession of a concubine? Now that we've established that the thing can be done, let us look at how it can be done. First, and this is quite important, ancient morality is not entirely Blue and Orange Morality (tv tropes link), completely incomprehensible to us. Courage, honour, friendship, protecting someone - those are things we can sympathise with. The difference lies in which one takes precedence, how values relate to each other. Going back to the Three Musketeers example, the queen's distress in regards to the diamond studs is considered more important than the fact that the queen's illicit affair is dragging the kingdom into a war, and could potentially create a succession crisis (if there's any reason to suspect an heir's legitimacy). Second, values don't exist in a vacuum. Values exist because there's a system in which they make sense, or at least made sense in the past (values change slowly). Let's take duels for example: if you've got to sign an agreement, only there's no legal system to enforce that agreement, you need to have much more trust that the person you're signing the agreement with will not break it, right? In essence, that's what honour means - can I trust you. If honour is so valuable, of course you are going to protect it. Third, you are quite right - there were circles of empathy, (there still are, only we don't like admitting it nowadays,) and people could be quite horrid to those outside those circles. But here's something: unnecessary cruelty has always been frowned upon. Meaning, you don't beat your slave if he's done nothing wrong. And if you're not cruel to your slaves, you actually provide them with food, shelter, clothing, then that's the way things are in your society, you're not going to be judged for that. Similarly, if punishment is deserved, for example if you have a traitor in your midst, readers would usually accept the particular punishment as part of the setting, no matter how cruel it would be considered nowadays. Readers are not stupid, they understand things used to be different. So, to sum up, no, you certainly don't need to shove modern morality where it doesn't belong. To make a character sympathetic even though their morals don't quite match ours, show also the values we can and will sympathise with. Show the system - that is, show us what is the norm for the setting you're writing about. Show the character as being a decent enough person within their society. (Not extraordinarily good - that stinks of Mary Sue. Just decent enough.) The one thing you'd want to avoid is sadism. If your character enjoys inflicting suffering on others, that's crossing a line. Has always been. Do that, and you will lose the readers' sympathy."
How to write a nice frame challenge?,"In my view the champion of frame challenges is Socrates. His famous method always starts with an attempt at a frame challenge. The success of the Socratic method stands on the basis that it is based on logic, and it leads to check if a frame challenge exists on the basis of logical contradictions. Socrates poses a lot of importance of factual data, and little importance to beliefs. In fact, he often leads the other party to agreeably reconsider their beliefs on the basis of factual evidence. Also, when arguing a frame challenge, steer clear of first-person POV's recounts of personal experiences. To reword it in the world of SE, if the OP sets some assumptions, a general direction and asks a question to achieve a certain goal, we can ask whether there exist a path that links the two and if the path goes along the stated direction. The obvious case is that there exists such a path, in which case your frame challenge would be out of place. If the path does not exist, then: A rule of thumb of conflict avoidance is to steer clear of adjectives that carry a judgment. It is perhaps the best example of when ""show not tell"" can make a difference. If you want the reader to conclude that a certain statement is wrong, you need to show it starting from the facts. Telling alone does not prove it. Also, stay clear of faulty generalizations and other types of logical fallacies: in real life, as in fiction, they are great to raise the tension, but detract from the argument you wish to make. This is the hardest to frame. The reason being that the OP is about achieving it, and the author has invested their time and emotions in asking how to reach it.
A first person POV with personal experiences is prone to the critique of being anecdotal, no statistical significance, or N=1. On the other hand, a dry third-person POV presenting a series of purely logical steps of the type ""if A is true then B is true"" makes it easier for the author to follow your reasoning, and to apply it to their question. A successful argument sticks to the author question, free from judgement, and follows it until the contradiction point, where you simply stick to the non contradicting path and reach a different conclusion than the stated goal. There is no need to judge, nor to rub it in the author's face. Perhaps, as Socrates does sometimes, suggest reconsidering, and enjoy your upvotes. In general, this follows the same advice as challenging the frame of the goal. It is perhaps easier to discuss as the direction is not in the present (like the assumption) and it is not part of the desired outcome, in which the author is emotionally invested. A trick Socrates does sometimes, if I recall correctly, is to gently steer the direction while the dialogue goes on. He could have steered it from the start, but by doing it gently, he causes less attrition. In SE terms, stick to the assumption, follow the direction and identify the contradiction. Instead of changing direction, correct it slightly so that you get closer and closer to the goal while at each iteration of your logical reasoning you continue steering the direction. Challenging the assumption is equivalent to challenging to ability of the author to understand what they already have at hand, be it their situation, or the hypothesis of their mathematical problem. This is difficult as it may quickly turn into a judgement on the author. Third person POV, avoidance of adjectives are the obvious tools. Also, as in the case of challenging the direction, iterating over the same logical sequence with small changes between iterations, until the goal is reached and the direction is kept unchanged. When there is no factual evidence, it all becomes simply a writing challenge: write a series of logical events that lead to a given conclusion, following, or not following some initial cue and general plot. The challenge? The style: write it in an iron-clad reasoning, Third-person, impersonal POV, without using any adjectives or adverbs. If you are reading this, you probably are on Writing.SE and you know how to write that."
How do I write LGBT characters without looking like I'm trying to be politically correct?,"Any character who is defined by a single trait is going to be flat and stereotypical.  If that single trait is a minority status, then the character will feel inserted for the sake of diversity. If I were asked to describe Dumbledore, I'd start with ""old wise mentor"" and ""powerful wizard"".  ""Gay"" wouldn't come until much later.  Similarly, Willow from Buffy the Vampire Slayer gets ""Nerdy best friend"" and ""witch"" before ""lesbian"" in her list of traits.  (Willow is also in danger of being the show's token Jew, but being Jewish is even lower on her defining traits than her sexuality).  Generally speaking, if a minority status crops up high on a short list of characteristics, you should be concerned. Part of the problem with defining characters by their minority status is that minority status is not a personality trait.  However, minority status will shape a character's life experiences, and life experience shapes personalities.  A gay character may act flamboyant because they want to signal to the people they interact with that they are gay, or because being gay gives them societal permission to act in ways that would be received more negatively from a straight character, or for many other reasons.  But they are not flamboyant because they are gay. A character with minority status is exactly like any other character, except that they've been shaped by different life experiences.  This is true of any character, but the further a character's experiences are from your own, the easier it is to jump straight from the characteristics that shaped those experiences to the effects on their character, while ignoring the experiences in between.  Don't do this. The more you explore what makes a character who they are, the stronger they will be as a character."
Would readers feel cheated if the villain is successful in convincing the protagonist to change sides?,"The villain doesn't need to convince the protagonist as much as If you can make it believeable to the reader that the protagonist changes sides, then it will be a satisfying read. We often find out that our suspicions were mistaken in real life. For example, quite often a law enforcement agency finds out that their suspect was innocent. Why shouldn't that happen in a novel? But you might also show how the villain manipulates the protagonist succesfully into believing an untruth. Protagonists don't always succeed, and this might be a story about a protagonist succumbing to some flaw. This too is something that happens in real life, where we often like to believe what we think should be true, but in fact isn't. If you manage to narrate this process convincingly, the reader will gladly follow you to your unhappy ending."
Self Editing tips/tricks,"While it's not possible for your specific predicament, the question you actually ask is much broader than that. Put the writing away long enough to forget your state of mind while you were writing it, then re-read it.  For some people this could be as short as a day, but I have to wait closer to a month before re-reading what I've written for all the subtle things I could have done better to stand out. I know that professional author Stephen King says he adheres to a strict schedule when writing.  He writes all morning, then reviews all of the previous day's work that afternoon.  This way he has plenty of time and other writing-related activities between writing and revising that piece of his story."
How can I answer high-school writing prompts without sounding weird and fake?,"You can and should answer these prompts in your own style and voice.  I do have my doubts and concerns about these kinds of tests, but if there is any legitimacy to the grading at all, it won't be based on you writing in the style and voice of the sample. (In other words, you're focusing in on the wrong aspects of the sample.) You should be able to ask for a copy of the scoring rubric --or already have one --but the criteria is probably based largely on command of overall structure, and the technical details (good spelling, grammar, etcetera). What they want --ideally --is for you to pick something that is interesting to you, and to talk about it in your own way, while demonstrating command of the basics.  You don't have to talk about Mr. Robinson's dog.  For example, consider this alternate response to the bolded prompt: One of my greatest fears is having to answer a high-school writing prompt --it makes me freeze up immediately. They seem so weird and middle school. I hate feeling like I'm writing mediocre fanfiction.  In case you didn't recognize it, those are your own words, just presented in a way that responds to the prompt. Despite the fact that I edited your question, it actually reads pretty well, and has a strong voice.  I don't see any reason for you to have a problem answering these prompts except that you're trying to put yourself into a box when you don't actually need to. The samples sound weird and fake because they ARE weird and fake (they are probably adults trying to sound like kids), not because that's the criteria for getting a good score."
"How does the 10,000 hour rule apply to writing?","As everyone has said already, writing is ultimately the key.  The more you write the better you will be at it. But I would like to also address the reading aspect of your question. You are right that most people, at some point in their lives, will have read 10,000 hours worth.  But how many people think critically about it?  How many people say, ""Wow, I liked that, but why did I like that?""  Most people get through their entire 10,000 hours of reading very passively.  Even avid readers who are never without a book can often never take the active role and really digest what they are consuming. Think about critics (literary or film (or food or software or mountain climbing equipment)).  The longer someone has been reviewing widgets, the better they are going to be.  But that's not just because they have seen a lot of widgets (though that helps); it's because they have thought critically about every single widget they have come across. If you write a hundred emails a day, but don't really think about it, you won't improve.  But if you write a hundred emails and make active decisions during each one, then you will become an email master. One more thing:  Just a quick quote from Stephen King's On Writing: ""If you don't have the time to read, you don't have the time or the tools to write."" That is all."
How important is writing for games?,"Excellent writing is one of the primary selling points of some games - but it is by no means necessary. It can even be counterproductive in some situations. There has been research into what aspects of video games players enjoy the most. One model is Quantic Foundry's Gamer Motivation model. Their research indicates that there are six primary aspects of a game that can draw a gamer in - and each individual player will be interested in some, but not all, of those aspects, depending on their own personalities. The six motivations are categorized as ""Action,"" ""Social,"" ""Mastery,"" ""Acheivement,"" ""Immersion,"" and  ""Creativity."" Of these six motivations, players tend to be strongly interested in one or two of them. And of these six motivations, the only one strongly tied to good writing is ""Immersion!"" What this means for you is that you need to think about what type of game you're making. Read the article I linked and decide whether immersion should be one of the core focuses of your game or not. Quite frankly, if it isn't, then spending a lot of time on your game's story is a waste and can even potentially drive away the kind of players you want to target. There are in fact gamers out there who find stories to be annoying and want to get straight to the action! I posted these examples in a comment, but I'll elaborate on them here. Three games with excellent writing are The Beginner's Guide, Undertale, and Bastion. To be maybe a little too honest, all three of these games get me to cry every time I play them because their stories are so powerful. However, this comes at a cost: All three of these games have been received well, but they sacrifice keeping the player in intense action in order to tell a powerful story. This appeals to some players and pushes others away. In contrast, Thumper, Sonic Mania, and Beat Hazard are three games that effectively do not have stories. In exchange, they drop the player into the action of gameplay almost immediately and have few moments in which the action lets up. This will appeal to a different type of gamer. In conclusion, you need to decide which type of game you want to make, then decide which aspects of the game need to be focused on the most. Even if you are willing to polish every aspect of your game completely, telling a story almost requires you to take the player out of the action from time to time, which will push some types of players away. There's a tradeoff to be made, and it's important to make a conscious decision where you want your game to fall on that spectrum."
I spent 25 years in prison writing epic fantasy manuscripts. All are handwritten due to my circumstances. What is the best way to get them published?,"The first step is to type up one of your stories in standard manuscript form. Preferably your best and most favorite story. 'Best' because that maximizes your chances of getting literary representation and 'Most favorite' because you are going to be reading and re-reading it and editing an awful lot, so it's important that you really like the story. Also, avoid editing the story as you type it up. Fixing spelling errors and punctuation errors is fine, but avoid reshaping the narrative or restructuring the story until you have transcribed the complete story from your written pages to an electronic form. And, by typing it up, I meant typing it into a computer and not a typewriter. Optical Character Recognition is one possibility to convert scanned images into text. If you don't have access to a PC or laptop, public libraries have computers you can use. Google docs is a good application if you don't have a copy of MS Word. One plus of Google docs is that you manuscript is stored on the cloud. Then, you edit your story. You make it the best you can do. Don't stop editing and revising until the story is satisfying and enjoyable. Your major focus should be on storytelling and the craft of writing. Next, you write a generic query letter describing your story to an agent. You can learn how to write a good query letter from online resources. A good one is Query Shark. I've had it recommended multiple times by most professional authors who taught the writing courses I've taken over the last 3 years. Next, you search for a literary agent. There are too many sites listing different agents currently accepting manuscripts.  Most publishers -- all the big publishers -- will no longer take manuscripts from authors. They only accept manuscripts from agents. Small publishers still take manuscripts from authors as well as agents. If an agent agrees to take you on, that means they believe they can sell your story. That is how agents make their living. They are usually writers themselves.  Once you find a dozen or more agents that want the genre of story you've written, you customize your query letter to each one and send it to them.  Each agent will describe what they want to see as part of the submission. Usually, it's a query letter, a brief writer biography, and the first N pages of your story.  All electronic submissions.  No fees. It's all free. Then you wait and wait and wait. Usually, they'll tell you if they are interested or not. If they are on the bubble, like you are not quite there yet as a writer, they'll make some suggestions and ask you to resubmit. While all this is happening, you can look for writers' groups to join and share your work with them. Honestly, a writer's group can be a mixed bag -- very helpful or destructive. But having a working relationship with other writers is very helpful since it teaches you how to give and receive criticism."
"When is it okay to ""tell"", instead of ""show""?","It's too easy to get blindly hung up on mantras. If you look at the great authors, they break the rules all the time. With that said, there isn't a predetermined time when it's okay to tell rather than show. You have to decide on the fly which method provides the clearest picture to the reader. Conveying a clear picture is an optimal goal. The reason they say ""show, don't tell"" is so that you, as the writer, will work harder to convey the proper mental image to the reader. It's harder to show something in words than it is to just tell it. It is also more enjoyable for the reader to see it. Sometimes you can convey the best mental picture by simply telling however.  Example: you're describing something
  that the reader has never seen in the
  real world or even imagined. In that
  case you might have to spend five
  pages trying to show something that is
  quite simple and should really just be
  explained."

How to represent jealousy in a cute way?,"This is something you need to be careful with.  In popular Western culture, going back decades or further, jealousy is often seen as a positive trait.  ""His jealousy proves he loves me so much.""  Especially when it's a man jealous of interactions his female partner has with other men. In reality, there's a very thin line between ""cute"" jealousy and controlling behavior.  ""He gets all worked up when I talk to other men"" turns very quickly into ""I'm not allowed to be alone with other men at work"" or ""women in my company get left out because the men refuse to be alone with them."" Yeah, not so cute. What you're looking for I think is not actual jealousy, but gentle teasing.  As in bruglesco's example.  People in a healthy relationship can crack jokes about these types of situations, without it turning into anxiety over someone's faithfulness (jealousy happens even in relationships where dating others is okay, because the underlying emotion is fear of being rejected or humiliated). If you want things light, the couple needs to be secure in each other's affections.  Outside people aren't a threat.  Not to say that the couple believes cheating or breaking up is impossible (only fools believe that) but that it's not an everyday anxiety and, if it happens, it's not because some outsider was too tempting."
How can I avoid a predictable plot?,"What you present to the MC is not what it seems to be. It requires your imagination to figure why it isn't. You can conceive of a problem: Then try to imagine a way what looks like a problem is NOT, or is actually an opportunity, or is actually the way things should be. The monster is not a monster. Or it is a monster, but the real problem lies elsewhere. Alternatively, think of the real problem, and then think of how that might present itself as a different problem, which is what your MC sets out to solve. Always keep in mind the reasons things stay hidden: Subterfuge. Betrayal. Treason. Misunderstanding, disbelief that something could be true, or misplaced trust. Jumping to conclusions. Secrets, secrets, secrets. For example, the monster is a dragon, and really is trying to kill the villagers. But the villagers have a secret: They started this war, taking the dragon's egg and selling it for gold. They know exactly why it is attacking them but they aren't talking about it, they are just trying to get this stranger (the MC) to risk his life for the glory of killing the dragon. Now the dragon is hunting them, intent on revenge and torturing them to try and find out where her egg is, she only lays one per century. By mid-novel, the mission isn't exactly about defeating and killing the dragon at all. In fact the MC may ally himself WITH the dragon, and set out to find the stolen egg. Then of course, for Act III, the dragon as his ally helps the MC recover his memory. Because the dragon has a secret, too: She is the one that took his memory away. But now, he has shown bravery and loyalty and true friendship, and has led them to a battle they may well lose. She decides she won't let him risk death under false pretenses. She is a moral dragon. She restores his memory so he can make an informed choice. And something about knowing who he really is (perhaps the person that stole the egg, or traded it, or maybe he was involved after the egg was stolen, or is related to the king that bought it, so he knows how to circumvent the castle defense) finally allows them to complete the mission without dying. And the MC is a changed person, he no longer misunderstands dragons, in fact, despite her subterfuge (which he understands and forgives), a dragon has become his best friend. Now there are holes in that plot, but they can be patched. Figure out who the MC really is, what secret information he might have to get them out of their final dilemma. Figure out how the dragon knew to take him, in particular. How did he figure out the villagers were keeping a secret, and then discover the truth? How did he come to meet the dragon and become her ally in her search? But this is the general approach: Something is not as it seems. Your MC truly does not understand the problem at all, at first. He thinks he does, but he's got things backwards, sideways, and upside down. You have to figure out why, and (like I just did) sketch a series of three or four of these secrets that act as your turning points in the story, at (very roughly) the 25%, 50%, and 75% and 90% marks. That is the end of ACT I, middle and end of ACT II, and the final piece of the puzzle late in Act III that leads to the finale (last 10% of your story) and conclusion. Edit: So, if you thought the hero would kill the monster and free the people, you are wrong. Not only does the monster not get killed, but becomes his friend. The people may or may not be freed, or perhaps they must pay for their crime by returning the gold, before the dragon will let them leave. Maybe they need that gold to work the hero's plan. There may be escape and life for the villagers, but there is no happily-ever-after for those thieves. Even the hero is not what you thought he was, this becomes a redemption story for a hero that was actually a villain that helped cause the problem he eventually solves."
How do I stop using 'the' to start sentences so much?,"Start with a word ending in 'ing'. e.g. Opening the door, he stepped into the dark. Chasing a ball he thought he'd lost, the dog ran through the rain-swept streets. Start with a preposition (so a prepositional phrase). e.g. At the time of the incident she was in London. Through the rain the ball was difficult to see. Start with an adverb. e.g. Yesterday, the murderer felt guilt. Slowly but surely the dog was gaining on it. Begin with a subordinating conjunction (so a subordinate clause). e.g. Although he was starving, the man refused to eat. Because it was raining, the dog got wet. Write a passive sentence i.e. object + verb. e.g. All the chocolates were eaten."
Protagonist's race is hidden - should I reveal it?,"Welcome to Writing SE - great first question. There is nothing wrong with being silent on race. You have a character who is - presumably - fully fleshed and three dimensional and that is what matters. Readers love to imagine characters and not mentioning her race allows them to imagine her as they will. You say that you have hints so those who pick up on them will know she is black and those who do not will visualize her as another race - probably their own.  If race is not important to your plot or your characters, there is no reason to mention it.  The reader is going to realize that there is a high likelihood that a character with a name like Yordanos Diallo is black. A Carol Smith could be white or black. Not mentioning race can leave the reader with the impression of an all white cast, but you say that you have names from different parts of the world so that is much less likely.  I have a character from Colombia and she is of Irish descent (her parents fled the Troubles and moved to the beautiful country of Colombia). I do not mention that in the book and do not describe her as other than beautiful. Readers are free to imagine she is a Latina who chose a cool code name. Maybe she is. There are a few characters I do describe since it is important to the plot and characterization.  If race is not important to plot or character, silence is appropriate. Some things bear repeating."
"What is meant by ""purposeful, habitual, and gratuitous"" actions?","The essay is from a 1971 symposium on women in science fiction. The 3 actions are defined in relation to the plot, not the character's psychology.  The quote comes after Delany explains that his wife Marilyn, who edited fiction, had a chronic complaint about the women characters. She said they were restricted to 2 types, which he calls Vicious Evil Bitches and Simps (who are useless and need to be rescued – also hilariously, Evil Bitches who are transformed into Simps upon meeting the hero). He admits he'd only managed to break the stereotypes in his first novel, not avoid them, so together they came up with the 3 actions as a template for ""better, more varied, more believable women characters"". I have added paragraph breaks, bold emphasis, and added clarifying text in square brackets: Action is the clearest (and most commercial) way to
  present character. A good character of either sex must be shown
  performing purposeful actions (that further the plot), habitual
  actions (that particularly define her or him), and gratuitous
  actions (actions that imply a life beyond the limit of the fiction). Simply because the way most books are plotted, the male characters
  regularly get to indulge in all three types of actions, however, if
  [the female character is an] evil bitch, [her actions] are all
  purpose but no habit or gratuitous; if [the female character is a] simp she is all gratuitous but no purpose or habit.  So the first task, after finding a plot that just does not require
  women in either of these ugly, banal, and boringly cliché grooves, is
  to make sure you portray your women characters clearly performing all
  three types of actions. (And, re: the purposeful actions, performing
  them successfully!) His following point (it's so good I think it deserves to be included) is that every character in realistic fiction must have ""economic anchors"" that are clearly shown or heavily implied. He uses an example of 2 housewives, and differentiates them only through their relationship to money – one is a kept woman with a regular spending allowance, the other manages expenses and pays bills through a joint bank account. Their husbands are close in economic tier but Delany suggests the women would be completely different types (immediately recognizable by the reader) based on their approach to money.  He takes a potshot at masculinity tropes saying James Bond and all westerns become fantasies the instant characters are no longer tied to economic reality. This was 1971. In the essay he details how his wife was treated at her publishing job – it's off-topic but strangely compelling. He show-not-tells how an average female character has a fascinatingly complex story behind her economics, complete with petty villains and strategic trade-offs. Every. Woman. Part of the essay is a rant against male sci-fi authors for petty sexist attacks in women's lib run amok plots, specifically a Philip K Dick pro-life story about frivolous women having abortions until the ""fetus"" is old enough to learn algebra. A heroic man saves all the babies from tyrannical straw-gina, with algebra. I have to admit, the algebra-abortion story sounds idiotic compared to the real life intrigue at his wife's job – I actually wanted to know how that turned out. He then defines a kind of proto- Bechdel test where he says: Women characters must have central-to-the-plot, strong, developing,
  positive relations with other women characters. The commercial/art novel would be impossible without such relationships between men…"" The source is a re-print of the essay from 1991. It can be found (in part) here:

What is the balance between 'stating a problem clearly' and Hemingway's literary iceberg?,"This is an interesting question. The answer, I believe, lies in remembering that people read for pleasure. And when it comes to our pleasures, we value predictability very highly. This is not to say that surprise has no role in pleasure, but it is a very confined one. When we read a mystery, we want to be surprised when we find out who the killer is, but we read mysteries because we predict that we will have that pleasurable surprise (and only that particular surprise) at exactly the time and place we expect it.  In that sense, a piece of writing is like a cruise ship. The passengers don't need or want to know what is going on in the engine room (OK, I want to know, but I trust you get my point). They don't want to know the details of navigation and ship handling or how things run in the galley. But before they buy their tickets, they do want to know the exact itinerary, the exact cabin they will be occupying, and the kind of meals, amenities, and entertainments that will be provided on the voyage.  The pleasure, in other words, in in the voyage itself, and in the ports of call, not in any mystery about what they will be; it is in the food and the wine, not in any surprise about how and when you get to eat.  A genre is a promise of a certain kind of literary pleasure. Most readers stick to their chosen genres because they are looking for the specific pleasures that those genres promise. That is why it is harder to sell a story that does not fit an established genre: such a story asks the readers to take a risk on a book that may not deliver the specific pleasures they are looking for.  So, the part you want to conceal is how the sausage is made, not the fact that your are serving sausage. The pleasure lies not in surprise but in superb execution of the experience the reader signed up for. So the reader is always going to ask, what am I signing up for here? If you don't tell them, they are not going to read on. So it is essential to make it very clear where this is going, and then to make the journey unforgettable.  I once heard an agent describe what publishers are looking for as ""the same, only different"". ""The same"" is key here. The same is the guarantee of the familiar experience I want and am accustomed to. The different part is a modification of that experience that safely keeps it within the bounds of what I expect while giving a pleasing but safe variation on that experience.  "
Should software product release notes be in marketing voice or technical voice? (software documentation),"I think that there is a very strong case to be made that this distinction between marketing voice and tech comm voice should be avoided entirely. There are two main reasons for this: In ancient times, when tech comm and marketing were delivered on paper, each came to the customer at a different time and through a different channel. Generally they were done with using marketing content before they even got an opportunity to see technical content. But the web has changed all that. Marketing and technical content are all available to the customer online. But since the user is finding this material largely by search, there is no telling if their search is going to land them on a technical or marketing document. A marked difference in style between the two is jarring for the customer.  There is a great deal of evidence to suggest that traditional ra ra marketing tone simply does not work any more. The web allows people to get information from so many sources that they don't have to subject themselves to blatant propaganda in order to get information on a product. Wise marketers have responded by moving to content marketing, which focuses on producing content that readers actually want, as a means of attracting them to your company's content and of building the reputation of your company as experts in the field. Good content marketing cannot have the old marketing ra ra tone or it simply won't get read. Tech comm, on the other hand, can no longer rely on the customer already having bought the product. Many customers are going to make their purchase decision based on the quality and availability of the documentation. You can't afford to neglect this aspect of how documentation is used. (Besides, once the company catches on that tech docs are generating leads, your stock in the corporation will raise considerably.) Unfortunately, there are many impatient marketing people who have a hard time producing depth or substance, and many grumpy old time tech writers who have a hard time accepting that they have to write things that the general public will read while making a purchasing decision. But both these groups are living in the past. In the content marketing era, all content is marketing content, including (and sometimes especially) tech comm content. It is all one thing. It should all have the same tone. "
Can I write a book of my D&D game?,"Plagiarism would be taking exact text from the various game manuals and representing it as your own.  So don't do that.  But you probably weren't going to anyway, because you want to tell a story, not publish a game log.  Think of your story as being inspired by your game, but retell it as a story.  When you tell a story you use the language of description, not specification -- powerful fireballs and mighty blows with great-axes, not third-level spells doing 5d6 damage and axes that do 2d12 (+3 for strength 18) etc.  (It's been years since I've played D&D please forgive my made-up stats here.)   Mechanics get in the way of storytelling, and mechanics are the part most tied to a particular game system.  Unless you're targeting the gaming market specifically, you probably want your fantasy story to not clearly identify the game system at all -- readers don't need to care whether it was D&D or GURPS or RuneQuest or Fate or a product wholly of your own imagination.  They want to read about your wizard calling lightning from the heavens, not about a seventh-level wizard casting a fourth-level spell and opponents making saving throws. There is one thing to watch out for, but it's not about plagiarism or copyright -- beware of trademarks.  If there is a named monster type or special artifact, check to see if the game publisher asserts a trademark on it.  They can't trademark common things like trolls or healing potions, but they might have trademarked a specific monster or artifact invented for that game.  Try checking another published source such as the the 3.5 edition System Reference Document; trademarked stuff is usually absent (or renamed) in such works.  If you're still not sure, you might want to change the specific names just in case the publishers decide they care.  (A similar concern might have caused Gygax to change ""hobbits"" to ""halflings"" after the first edition.)"
How to prevent ebook piracy from stealing your livelihood?,"It appears to be just the cost of doing business. Pretty much everything I am going to say here comes from https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/23/book-piracy-a-non-issue/ but I will sumarize.  First, in the days of paper, authors only got paid for a fraction of the people who read their book. Many readers borrowed the book from a library or from a friend. Many bought them a second hand book stores. Many read them in the common room library of Inns and B and Bs or found them abandoned on the train. Ebooks could actually mean more sales for authors since you can't lend or resell an ebook.  And it is vanishingly unlikely that pirated ebooks represent lost revenues. The people who pirate books were likely not going to buy them if they could not get them for free. And since (unlike physical goods) there is no unit cost for a ebook, you don't suffer shrinkage or a lost sale.  This is why, as Tim O’Reilly explains in a quote in the linked article, O’Reilly books does not use DRM. He reckons it is actually better to sell 10,000 books and have 100,000 readers than to sell 10,000 books and have only 10,000 readers.  You will probably make a lot more money by spending your time and energy on writing more and better books than by worrying about book piracy. "
Is the first page of a novel really that important?,"Don't bring the ""thriller"" up first. The first page (and first sentence, and paragraph) is important in the same way your first meeting with somebody new is important. An agent or publisher (or indeed a customer thinking of buying your book) is going to read the opening line, the first paragraph, the first page to see if they like your style of writing, and see if you know how to begin a story and get the reader engaged. They want to see if you make dumb mistakes (typos, grammar, clichés, other beginner errors like opening with a fight in progress, or opening with an info-dump, or detailed character descriptions, or the history of your setting, etc). Agents (and the readers for publishers) reject  95% (or more, seriously) of the books or queries they receive, which means (practically speaking) they have to make snap decisions, and they do. Otherwise they'd have no time to do work that actually pays them money. They expect you to put a great deal of care into the opening sentence, the first page, the first ten pages (which many request). They expect your most careful and attentive work there, and if it sucks, they don't need to read the rest. They aren't there to fix your work, or critique work, or help you get better, or see a promising young talent, or spot a diamond in the rough, they are there for one thing: to find writers that are already good writers, and represent already good writing, and make their 15%. That's it! The service agents do for the publishers is screening, searching through the flood of dreck to find some gold nuggets. No, it is not advisable to move the ""thriller"" to the first page. The opening of the book is expected to be an engaging introduction to the main character(s) and the setting, a setup for a story to come. The setup usually lasts for 10% to 15% of the book, before the big problem of the book appears. Nevertheless, this first 10% is supposed to be engaging. One way to do that is to introduce your character(s) by giving them a ""little"" or ""throwaway"" problem of some sort, not necessarily a problem important to the plot but a kind of problem they might encounter in their everyday life. This gives you a chance to talk about setting, show us some of their personality in the process of dealing with their little problem. The problem with opening in the middle of action is closely related: If you do that, readers don't really care, because they don't know who is fighting, whose side they should be on, or anything else. In the opening pages, readers don't care because they don't have any context for understanding what is going on. That is why nearly every movie and story begins with ""The Normal World"" of the hero; and the main problem first appears 10% or 15% of the way in. If the setting is complex (with magical, fantasy or scifi elements) the main problem is delayed somewhat, until the reader/audience is ""up to speed"" and has a basic grasp of what the heroes and villains can do, or what their ships can do, etc. In some series (movie or TV or books) we can cut ""The Normal World"" quite short, since the audience is up to speed from the first book and doesn't need much reminder. But in a ""from scratch"" novel, don't rush the main conflict, it doesn't make the book more exciting at all, it makes it boring. Your query letter, the first sentence, the first paragraph, the first page, the first ten pages, the first chapter: This is how you will be judged, quickly and ruthlessly, by agents and publishers. Nobody is going to invest the time to read your whole book or story if these alienate them."
Is it true that good novels will automatically sell themselves on Amazon (and so on) and there is no need for one to waste time promoting?,"It is most likely anecdotal evidence. There are always breakout successes where this worked - people published their story somewhere and it got big. 50 Shades of Grey comes to mind, which came out of a fanfic community and was already successful in that community and had a following before the marketing was cranked up. It's also a good example why I doubt the relation between ""quality"" and ""success"" that is made in your quote. It is objectively not a ""good"" book. It scratched a specific itch that had nothing to do with quality. And I think that's the real lesson - if you happen to write about something that hits the zeitgeist in some way, then you will likely find success even without marketing. But what about that weird fantasy book that's really high quality, but only caters to a niche market? For word-of-mouth, you need a critical mass. This will not work for every book without marketing. I don't know who this guy is, but I wouldn't listen to him, especially if he himself had success by publishing without marketing, but had not done any studies on it. It's a typical human problem that we cannot differentiate between having been lucky and having found a secret lifehack. In general you shouldn't listen to advice of famous people; they are famous to 99% because they were lucky on top of being talented (and hard-working)."
How to write female characters with agency?,"On ""Jo Writes Stuff"", Jo has produced an epic analysis of whether or not a character is a ""strong female character""; and a test to go with it. Here is her instructions on How To Use The Test.  She has stopped any new analysis, but here is a list of All The Characters She Reviewed. I believe this can help you with some of your issues; just writing a post-woke female character.  For the most part, other than sexual attractions or attentions, I think in the 23rd century the answer is to write female characters and male characters rather similarly, but NOT as women becoming like men: More like meeting in the middle, or both sides going to some extreme. For example, consider makeup: One route is to eliminate it; women no longer need it in the post-woke society. But the other route is to make it universal: Your male character may have some trouble in our modern time, because like all men of his time, he doesn't usually go out without makeup. (The same was true for men in some royal courts a few centuries in our past).  Your guy might have acquired many habits and attitudes we might consider ""feminine"", and what we consider acceptably ""masculine"" today may come to be considered just rude in the 23rd century. Like men interrupting women, or clerks and managers speaking exclusively to a man instead of to both the man and woman. -- Edit in response to comment:Men interrupt women 2-3 times more often than they interrupt men. Women interrupt men and women equally, and less often. See This academic study specifically on conversational interruptions (results are on journal page 430), and see popular articles Why men are prone to interrupting women in ""Women in the World"" 03/09/15 and The Universal Phenomenon of Men Interrupting Women in The New York Times 06/14/2017.  The phenomenon of men that need to address a mixed gender group (or couple) beginning their conversation with a male of the group is similar; male gender is treated (on average of course) by men throughout society as a mark of higher status / power; almost regardless of actual status / power. To be clear, they don't refuse to speak to a woman, it is just that in a mixed-gender group, they generally choose a male in the group as the ""leader"" to speak to when addressing the group, far more often than they will choose a female within a mixed group.  This is a form of status bigotry, which post-woke society would likely not engage in: They would use other gender-less cues to choose a ""leader"", like some combination of age, grooming and bearing, or they would ask to speak to somebody about X, and talk to the person that stepped forward. Back to interruptions: Female politicians, business leaders and judges are interrupted more often than their male counterparts. Again this is a ""bro-culture"", women attempt to interrupt both men and women equally; but have fewer successful interruptions with men: The men being interrupted are more verbally aggressive against women that attempt to interrupt, and men in a group are more supportive of that aggression against a women interrupting, than they are if another man had interrupted. -- End of Edit -- Or on the flip side, your male may be just as motherly and devoted to kids, and know everything there is to know about childcare and raising children, and doesn't defer to women in the least in that respect. In his time, men are expected (by both other men and women) to be full and sensitive participants in childcare. For the most part, I would just have your 23rd century people not perceive any difference between interacting with men or women. As a psychological trick to help you do that and get past your own cultural bias, she responds to and speaks to men as a modern woman would respond to and speak to another modern female stranger, saying or doing the same thing: Gender makes no difference to your time traveler. The opposite trick for your time traveling man: he responds to and speaks to women the same as a modern man would respond to and speak to another modern male stranger. And though they are a couple, they engage with each other as friends. If you intend to have romantic or sexual scenes in the story, make them equally desirous.  There is seldom a need for designing a ""strong male character"", But I'd use Jo's checklist in the same way. Here are her questions; the link above has details on what you should consider for each question. Good luck."
"""Real people don't make good fictional characters"". Really true?","I'm part of a Facebook group where aspiring writers look for beta readers and have read quite a few first and second drafts of first novels over the past months. I have found that when aspiring writers use either themselves or people that they know really well (such as family members or close friends) in their writing – which beginners often tend to do –, these characters are often unlikeable to the reader. This is a problem in genre writing, where readers want to identify with the protagonists. The reason why real people come out as unlikeable fictional characters, I believe, is that characters in genre fiction usually are abstractions of real people. They are somewhat simplified and even stereotypical, representing what the writers and readers know of ""certain types"" of people in general, and often they represent not anything real at all but some kind of idea (the lonesome ranger) or ideal (the hero, the antagonist). Real people, on the other hand, have a complex personality, with many internal contradictions and their character traits aren't usually clearly ""good"" or ""bad"" but muddled and vague. I am sure that if you got into the head of most real persons, you would soon become exasperated and irritated. And that's what happens to readers when aspiring writers write themselves into their tales. Readers read genre fiction to escape from their real life on an adventure, to daydream about love, or to indulge in novel ideas, and characters that are too real are an obstacle to their immersion. Literary fiction on the other hand is about reality. It may not be autobiographical or a retelling of real events, but it usually attempts to illuminate certain aspects of the reality that we live in, such as the attitude towards life of a specific generation, contemporary social problems, or the lives of the common people (whereas genre fiction usually focusses on exceptional persons like princesses and murderers). Literary fiction relies on an author's intimate familiarity and understanding of the characters he portrays, and here the problem sometimes is that the aspiring writer lacks the (self-)reflexive distance from his subjects and is too emotionally involved in what goes on in their minds and lives. To clear up a common misunderstanding that came up in comments: I do not mean to say that you mustn't use yourself or other real persons in your fiction. I'm just pointing out some dangers in the hope that you can better avoid them if you know about them. By all means, draw from life. But remain aware of the aim of your writing. Do you want to tell a thrilling story to entertain your readers? Do you want to portray a character who is exemplary for their generation? Do you want to write an (auto)biography? They are not the same and they need different approaches to character development. Writing is a skill that employs conscious control. Make sure you are in control of your characters. That is all. As to the debated distinction between genre and literary fiction, I didn't mean to imply a distinction in quality. I think of ""literary fiction"" as concerned with social commentary, political criticism, and reflection on the human condition; focussed on introspective, in-depth character studies, sometimes at the expense of any substantive plot; a concern with the style and complexity of the writing; a meta-commentary on literary tradition, literary criticism, and the writing life. Genre fiction on the other hand is an industry that makes money with entertainment. Think of Disney movies versus Ingmar Bergman. And yes, literary fiction can employ genre, and genre fiction can be literary. Please don't expect every answer on a Q&A site to address your pet peeve."
"How should I respond to a supervisor/editor who thinks my technical writing is ""too conversational?""","One comment he repeated several times was that parts of my text sounded ""too conversational."" I think meant that I didn't sound professional or academic enough.  You'd be better off asking for clarification instead of guessing at the meaning. He also suggested revisions that increased the word count and complexity of the sentences without adding any additional meaning. I disagree with those comments and I don't like the suggested edits, and here's why: You're exactly like me here. I also disagree with pointless elaboration. However, that doesn't mean that there's never a reason to elaborate. You've been silent on why you were suggested to elaborate. Maybe the supervisor didn't tell you, maybe he did but you don't think it's relevant, maybe you subconsciously omitted that from the question, or maybe you intentionally omitted it.
I'm not here to judge; but it's impossible to review someone's feedback as meaningful if we don't know the problem the feedback is trying to point out. There are reason to elaborate an explanation: I get the feeling that you only presented part of the full picture. I believe that sometimes (always?), simple language is best. I agree with your intention, but not your statement. Not always. This is very dependent on who your target audience is.   I also believe the impenetrable ""academic"" writing style of many scientists is a major shortcoming - it only hinders communication among scientists and isolates us from the public, who can't make sense of what we're trying to say. I have yet to lay eyes on a single document that is written in a way that: If there were a writing standard that could fulfill all of these requirements, it would be the only writing standard that was in use since it has no drawbacks. As a technical writer, you'll generally be writing documentation for experts. Experts generally don't see linguistic simplicity as the main priority. Therefore, simplicity should not be your main focus when writing. The higher word counts, more complex sentence structures, and lack additional meaning in the revisions were a clear sign (to me, at least) that he was taking things in the wrong direction. You're overgeneralizing. More often than not, reducing sentence complexity leads to a higher word count, and reducing the word count leads to increased sentence complexity. If the supervisor were adding complexity and word count at the same time, his feedback would obviously not be good.   However, we come back to my earlier point that we're only hearing your side of the story. The level of detail and the (apparent) lack of common sense in the supervisor's feedback are not matching up. You are likely omitting a key part of the supervisor's side of the story (this may be unintentional, I'm not accusing you of anything). I know there's room for subjectivity, but I honestly think the sentences I crafted are just better - and I don't want to trash them. You tell us they're better, but you don't showcase your point. Since this issue very much hinges on whether the supervisor is correct or not; I'd say it's very relevant to include an actual example so that we can see if his feedback has merit. If I were to defend my writing, I feel like I'd be calling his own writing skills and workplace authority into question.  Generally speaking, ask for them to explain the feedback instead of arguing why the feedback is wrong in your opinion. Asking for clarification shouldn't be interpreted as calling the other person's skills into question. If anything, asking for his explanation implies that he knows it better than you. At the same time, I take pride in my writing and I want my published documents to reflect that. Pride should not come at a cost to the company. If the supervisor's version is objectively more in line with the company's expectations, the supervisor's version should be picked. Regardless of whether your version was only marginally or notably worse. I don't think we should just ""go along with it"" and let them sully our writing, especially if our own names will be on the published document.  With the exception of some egregious fringe cases, the customer (in this case the company) gets the product how they want it. If they stress that they want the word ""computer"" replaced with ""puterbox"" across the entire document, then that's their choice.   If the company makes demands that you personally cannot live with (e.g. ideological differences), then you can refuse the project; but this will of course have consequences. Depending on the company, this can be seen as insubordination and grounds for firing.  When you refuse a project, you should already have accepted the consequences of your refusal."
How to show a character being bored for multiple chapters without boring the reader,"Use film and other literature to inspire you--in particular this song Do you Want to Build a Snow Man. The character is bored. There's empty hallways, but time passes and that's communicated in a number of different ways. In literature Harry Potter is a really good example--boredom is handled well throughout his novels, you can look to any description of the History of Magic class for that. I believe that's Professor Binns... Also, even though there's a unique framing device at work, The Princess Bride novel just has all sorts of fun describing boring stuff... Here's a little Douglas Adams for you: In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn't cope with, and that terrible listlessness which starts to set in at about 2:55, when you know that you've had all the baths you can usefully have that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the papers you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o'clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul. I think Raymond Chandler has a lot of bored detectives on stakeout, if I recall... How a character HANDLES boredom is a golden opportunity to show who they are. Device one: character cleans, straightens, alphabetizes and rearranges everything. Give a start time. Give an end time. The end time will be 5 minutes later. (For humor) Device two: Practice Spells Repeatedly whatever the spells are, however ""boring"" the character thinks they are, they aren't. For instance, the cantrip firefinger (stealing from D&D) would be the equivalent of flicking a lighter on over and over again, something that someone might do if they are bored. I have no idea what these spells are that you are having them have access to but--you can show that, or show evidence of them having practiced them excessively to stave off the boredom. Someone can walk in and see that evidence. So like there's a spell that levitates feathers or objects, and the student is seeing how many of them they can keep going at the same time--dropping all of them when someone finally comes in and distracts them. If it's an impressive amount, it's a great way to show they are good at magic. Or it could be the magical equivalent of walking in to find hundreds of pencils buried in the foam ceiling when you come to pick up a kid out of detention....You can probably do this with ANY spell. Or a number of them.  Device three: Add flashback to the boredom. Device four: Have them be creatively bored. A bored genius is not the same as the rest of us... YOU see a room full of boring books (maybe all the same book of the same size) but he might see something else entirely... A way to create a maze, Rube Goldberg machine, as a way to prove the grand unification theory of magic, and so on and so forth.  Device Five: Screw up the spells. If they aren't good, or careful, or their mind just wandered, let there be physical evidence of a spell got a little out of their control. They can be concerned with hiding evidence of their failure (placing books over a scorch mark or something like). Device Six: They begin focusing in on small details, knots in wood, scratches on something, typeface lettering...this can be a goldmine again, because it can lead them to discover something relevant to the plot later on. Device Seven: Show time crawling on, but be brief about it. The reader will get the point. See the Douglas Adams quote above for an example of that.  Device Eight: The Cutback Movies use this. Basically, a whole bunch of other exciting things are happening, meanwhile cut back to the bored person, and they are making paperclip chains stuck in a room. Exciting thing, cut back to bored character seeing how tall they can stack books, exciting battle, cut back to bored character who has now arranged chairs so that they can be upside down while they try to score goals with paper wads in the trash can...and so on. You said several chapters--honestly can't say that boredom covered in several chapters without interceding action happening at the same time would be entertaining. You don't even have to describe what the character did, just have evidence of their boredom everywhere in the room.  In the Douglas Adams example, you'll notice, that boredom is very neatly conveyed in a very short description. The passage of hours and time is interwoven in the description. You should be able to describe the boredom in short. You don't need pages to do it, or even half a page, just a scant paragraph will do."
"Want to write, have ideas, no story telling techniques or experience, feeling lost?","Take a dimly lit corner of your universe and one of your lesser characters and start writing some of their backstory as an in-the-moment adventure, not an aspect of someone's history.  You know by the character's present-day traits that they had an experience like this, so jump back in time and walk the younger, more innocent version of them along the hard road which made them who they are now. Allow yourself to make mistakes in this effort.  This is never going to get published to the general readership.  It is just some scrap lumber from which you will carve your primitive first attempt at art.  In years to come it will be precious to you because of its flaws.  Someday, it will remind you have far you have come. Now for the hard part.   Take your admittedly flawed short story and join a local writing group; preferably one which offers critique circle with fixed circle membership from week-to-week.  There you will read other people's rough drafts and honestly tell them what you think is good and bad about their words.  In return, they will do the same for your words.  Red pens will come out, egos will be bruised and people will cry; but those who persist will improve. Continue to attend your writing group consistently until your hunger for time to write overwhelms your need for peer review.  Then back off by degrees from attending weekly to once every few weeks and eventually only when your need for human company drags you away from the slowly filling page. Good luck with your universe and its many tales! Keep Writing!"
Are there advantages in writing by hand over typing out a story?,"Please note that I used to hand write everything and only type up what I felt was worthwhile later, largely due to a rather slow typing speed. Now I tend to do one or the other, typing some projects and hand writing others depending on end use (material purely for my own reference usually being hand written and material that may later be shared being typed). With that in mind in my experience typing makes rearranging things too easy and I end up spending far too long fiddling with the work already done when I'm supposed to be working on new material. This is also often necessary as the pace of typing makes format a foreign concept. I also find typing too easy to put down when the ideas slow down. Hand writing is more immersive, I tend to stick with it for longer and get longer sessions even if I may have fewer words to show for it. Because of the slower pace I tend to get better results, requiring less editing, because I'm forced to spare some attention for formatting in the first pass. Because it's harder to make major alterations I don't so when I pick up an existing piece I get a lot more new work done, I may make a note to rearrange it later but I can't do the work there and then. Neither format allows me to keep up with speed of thought, even speech-to-text can't do that, and I lose some stuff regardless."
How do I find an agent?,"Try and find a list of agents who write in your genre. Check out their websites!
Find out if they are accepting new clients. If they aren't, then check out another agent. But if they are, try sending them a few chapters from your story, a brief, and a short cover letter asking them to represent you. In the cover letter mention your previous publication credits. If sent via post, then I suggest you give them a means of reply, whether it be an email or a stamped, addressed envelope. Agents will try their best to improve your chances of getting a book published."
"Should I use the words ""pyromancy"" and ""necromancy"" even if they don't mean what people think they do?","These terms are very often used to mean magic, and I've never before encountered anybody discussing the ancient greek etymology. You are totally safe using the modern meanings.  In general, words often do have multiple meanings, and we understand from the context which meaning you are using: if you were writing a historical text about ancient greek superstition, we would interpret pyromancy as telling the future from fire, whereas in a modern fantasy story, we interpret it as fire magic. In fact, if you wanted to write ""pyromancy"" in a modern fantasy story and have the reader understand ""telling the future from fire"", you would actually have to explain (or show) that this is your intended meaning, and it would be surprising to the majority of your readers.  You can find countless examples of words whose etymological (or alternative) meanings we happily ignore, e.g. you don't mind that ""demon"" originally simply meant ""god"" or ""deity"" in ancient greek, or for that matter that computer people today, when mentioning a daemon, mean a process running in the background..."
"My story is written in English, but is set in my home country. What language should I use for the dialogue?","You have read books like this, or at least are familiar with books like this: Ernest Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls is set in Spain, and it is indicated, repeatedly, that the dialogue is in Spanish, in fact in a particular dialect of Spanish. The main character's accent is even discussed. But the dialogue is written entirely in English. Romeo and Juliet is set in Italy. I doubt Shakespeare even knew a word of Italian. He certainly used none in the play. And of course, there are translated novels - they are translated in their entirety, the dialogue is not kept in the source language. Think of it like this: your audience speaks English. Perhaps only English. In such a case, anything in any language other than English is incomprehensible noise. If the alphabet you use is not the Latin one, it's not even noise - it's squashed spiders on the page, that make no sound in the reader's mind. Why would you want to fill pages upon pages with ""noise"" that means nothing to your reader? You're confused because what the characters actually say is not in English. But that doesn't matter at all; your goal is not to transport to the readers what the characters ""actually say"", untouched. The characters don't ""really"" exist anyway. Your goal is to make your reader share the experience of saying and hearing those words. The experience includes understanding. The only exception I know of to the above rule is Lev Tolstoy's War and Peace. That work was written in Russian and French, no translations provided (though those are always added in modern editions). The reason it was written like this is that the audience Tolstoy was writing for was all bilingual. Everyone who could possibly read the novel in the author's time spoke both Russian and French. Thus, the book might appear like an exception, but it supports the aforementioned logic."
The psychology of starting a piece of writing,"How do you start writing? You sit down and write. No matter how trite, no matter how derivative - you write. You give it your honest best effort. Then, the next day, you give what you've written an honest look. You note what's good, what's bad. Then, you either continue writing, edit yesterday's work and then continue, or put it in a folder of ""no good"", and start again. Rinse and repeat. (Don't delete ""bad work"" - you might be able to draw something from it later. And it's not like we lack space nowadays - it's all on the computer.) Compare your experience to someone who wants to play Rachmaninov's concerti, but has never played the piano at all. He touches a key, and doesn't like the sound of it. So he stops. He loves the piano, but his first attempts sound horrible, so he doesn't touch the piano any more, he just wishes to play Rachmaninov.
The way this person might some day play Rachmaninov is if he sits down and practices every day, listens to what's wrong, corrects himself, and keeps going. Then, after a decade of hard work, he would play Rachmaninov, if not well, then at least tolerably."
How to *show* a controversial reality without seeming like I'm treating it as acceptable and without stating that this is wrong?,"You do not have to preach they are bad. They are bad because they harm others in some way. If you wish to show reality, show that harm, whatever it may be, beginning or taking place or having already taken place with previous victims. Don't tell us they are bad, show us they are bad. As the narrator, you can neutrally tell that tale. As an author, you won't be accused of being an apologist, because you did not show the outcomes as being neutral, but clearly bad for somebody, even if the perpetrators are happy with themselves. If you are trying to avoid being an apologist and also trying to not show any harm being done, I don't think that is possible."
Why does an author need an editor?,"Here are my reasons: If all else fails, tell them to try it out and see if it's beneficial.  (And if they don't find a benefit, it is unlikely that they will be successful as writers.)"
Should I self-publish my novella on Amazon or try my luck getting publishers?,"Unfortunately, the word count of your work means that traditional publishers will not be interested. Even well-established authors like Stephen King publish their novella-length work only as part of larger collections, not as stand-alone works.  Also unfortunately, a self-published novella by an unknown author will vanish without a trace on Amazon, unless you just so happen to be an amazing self-promoter. Does this mean there's no hope for your book or for your writing career?  No, you have many options:"
Why do hardcover books retail for more than three times the cost of softcover books?,"The article Breakdown of book costs shows an example of the costs involved in making a hardcover book: Based on a list price of $27.95 $3.55 - Pre-preduction - This amount covers editors, graphic
designers, and the like
$2.83 - Printing - Ink, glue, paper, etc
$2.00 - Marketing - Book tour, NYT Book Review ad, printing and shipping
galleys to journalists
$2.80 - Wholesaler - The take of the middlemen
who handle distribution for publishers
$4.19 - Author Royalties - A
bestseller like Grisham will net about 15% in royalties, lesser known
authors get less.  Also the author will be paying a slice of this pie
piece to his agent, publicist, etc. This leaves $12.58, Money magazine calls this the profit margin for the retailer, however when was the last time you saw a bestselling novel sold at its cover price. Salon.com also has an interesting post on what makes books cost as much as they do. According to that article, the physical cost of the book comes from the quality of paper, the printing, and the binding. That accounts for about 20% of the book's final price. The rest covers the publisher's other costs (editing staff, promotions, etc.), distribution costs, and booksellers' profit. The author also gets a cut — typically around 10% or 15% of the price. There are other considerations in book pricing, but they seem to have more to do with how the bookselling industry works than with the book format, so I'm omitting them here. The Salon article goes into more details, though, and there is also some interesting information from the desk of Jane Galt about hardcover pricing if you look past the political bent of some of the comments. I wasn't able to find a detailed breakdown of the costs involved in making a paperback, so I looked at lulu.com — a self-publishing service — to get a ballpark figure. I ran their manufacturing price calculator on roughly the same parameters. For a paperback, I used 100 pages of standard paper, black & white printing, US Trade size (6"" x 9""), bound with the ""perfect bound"" binding. The manufacturing cost on that came out to US $6.50 per book. For a hardcover, I used the same parameters except for binding. With casewrap binding, the cost was US $15 per book and including a dust jacket bumped that up to US $16. So it seems to me that if we assume that marketing and distribution costs are roughly the same for all types of books, the production costs would account for a good part of the price discrepancy."
Is it okay to publish a book at a young age?,"There are no age restrictions on publishing - you may need to get someone else to sign contracts for you, but that's a minor detail. That said, it's pretty hard to get a book published, even for adults who've been working at writing for a long time. It's probably best if you focus on writing because it's fun, and give yourself a chance to explore without putting any pressure on to get anything published. I mean, if you get something finished and you're proud of it, sure, you might as well submit it to agents/publishers if you want, but try to remember that the important part about it was the fun you had writing, not the chance that somebody might want to publish it."
How do I spot an unintentional promise in my story?,"Pay attention to your editor's/beta readers' reactions. Ask specifically:  If you get good answers across the board, you're probably fine. What you don't want is for people to say ""Yeah, I really thought Greg and James were going to get together, because Greg was always jealous of James's wife and people kept making jokes about Greg and James dating, but nothing came of it."" Or ""you spent all this time talking about how terrifying the wargs were, but then Anne cast the Warg Repellent spell and they were all dead in two paragraphs.""  Those are unintentional promises — expectations you set up but didn't follow through with, potentials which don't pay off. They can be major or minor, but asking those questions can teach you what to look for.  ETA To address Andrey's excellent comment: A subverted expectation is deliberate: you think the good guy is going to put down his weapon, but instead he shoots the hostage. Your expectation is that he was a pure good guy who puts the hostage's safety first, but instead he turned out to be (or became) a more gray guy who is putting the larger good or the mission first. If you re-read, you can trace the development of his changing morality or you can see where he was never all that good in the first place.  An unfulfilled promise is when you spend three seasons setting up a romance between Sherlock and John, and then in season 4 it becomes The Mary Morstan Bro No Homo Show. It might be queerbaiting or it might be bad writing, but it's clearly not where the story was going. There was no narrative hint beforehand that the romance was going to be abandoned, and the focus on a third character doesn't follow from any previous character or plot threads. "
Where to draw the line between fantasy and reality in a story?,"The most important thing is to keep your story consistent. A story which has the same rules throughout can be accepted even if it is not compatible with the real world. However, even a fantasy story will be rejected by the reader if the rules of what is possible in the fantasy world change without justification. Even within a given genre, the line is drawn in different places for different stories (even for different stories by the same author). What is essential is that you don't move that line within a single story (or within a series if all the stories within it are set in the same world). It's also worth bearing in mind that when you first enter a story, the reader has expectations based on the real world, based on the story they read previously, and based on the genre they expect your story to be. An event that would be unrealistic in the real world or unrealistic in a similar story will be hard for them to accept in the first few pages. If you introduce it gradually then it will be much easier to accept later in the story when it has been established as a natural part of how things work in your world. For the same reason, if you have an event that will be unexpected late in the story, it's important to give reasons for believing that event is possible beforehand. Try to find ways of informing the reader that a particular type of action is possible without giving away what you intend to happen. That way your event can be surprising, without being unbelievable. You mention the examples of being knocked out for hours and waking relatively unharmed, and flying to great heights/making rapid ascent without breathing problems. Some of your readers will see a problem with these, others will not. For the benefit of those who may see a problem, you could make sure the first incidence of the event is not essential to your plot. A few events where someone survives being knocked out in a minor subplot make a later event easier to accept. Similarly, a few flights to places that are clearly at great altitude early on mean that the reader will not be jarred by later being expected to accept something brand new that the plot depends on. This is particularly important if the magical flight will involve carrying someone who lacks that magical ability. Note that it can also be useful to set things up subtly beforehand even if your event is completely realistic. As Lauren Ipsum points out, because of the longstanding acceptance of being knocked out for hours that you describe, it could be hard for the reader to accept someone being knocked out and then waking with permanent brain damage, or remaining in a coma until death. If you can find a way to make it clear that this is a story where impact to the head is not trivial, then the reader will be prepared for an event that is closer to reality than they would otherwise expect."
Decide on a theme/overarching meaning before writing a short story?,"Two things: I prefer to read stories where there are no overt themes being highlighted by the author (or else they're so subtle I can't tell, or not noticeable because the characters and what's going on are too interesting). Choosing themes first then constructing a story to illustrate them will probably end up sounding contrived. I find that when I focus on coming up with characters, plots and settings that I think are interesting, and then just write about them, the themes emerge by themselves. These  organically-grown themes seem to usually end up working better than deliberately pre-chosen themes (and, as @foggyone said, I can usually then improve the story by identifying and working with those themes from that point)."
Is no religion a bad thing?,"You're looking at this from the wrong side. Your goal isn't to include or to represent. Your goal is to tell a story. The story should contain all the elements that it requires, and nothing but the elements it requires. ""Including"" anything that isn't useful to the story in any way is called 'shoehorning', and is not a good practice. Is your story served in any way by some of the characters following some religion(s) to some extent? Does it add tension where tension is required, does it set up some theme you wish to explore, does it do anything? Then go ahead and include it. If it does nothing for the story, or if the absence of religion does something for the story, then don't have religion. It's that simple."
Writing a Super Intelligent AI,"I will disagree with others. I am a professor involved in AI, and the easiest way for you to think about a super-AI is to understand what Intelligence IS. Predictive power. Intelligence is the ability to discern patterns (in behavior, in sound, visually, by touch, even by smell) and use those patterns to predict other facts or high probabilities: What will happen next, what will be said next, what people are feeling (or doing mentally, like lying), or any other properties: how hard or fast it is, how heavy. Where it will be, if it is a danger. High intelligence is the ability to see such patterns and use them to accomplish a goal, be it staying alive, keeping somebody else alive, or making money. Or just recognizing what is going on in your life.  High intelligence does not require the machine be human or have emotions, you can add those separately if you like. But a highly intelligent machine would likely not be socially inept at all (contrary to the silly example of Data on Star Trek). They would not be confused by humor, and should be rather good at it. Certainly, Data that is supposed to think about a hundred times faster than people, should have recognized jokes immediately as a common pattern of human interaction, and should have been able to laugh convincingly: The idea that he cannot recognize the common pattern of actual human laughing, and emulate it without error, is dumb and unscientific writing. He could listen *to himself practicing a laugh, and note the differences, and correct until he sounded sincere: If we can tell the difference, he can tell the difference faster, that is the nature of super intelligence, or it isn't super.  Your super-AI will be a super Sherlock; never missing the slightest clue, always several steps ahead of everybody else. But it is not infallible. There are things no amount of intelligence will reveal: The outcome of the next coin flip. The traffic jam on the Franklin Bridge, due to an overturned truck. Whether Roger will fall for the planned ruse. There are things there is just no way to know from the data it has so far, so it cannot be certain of them, and that puts a limit on how far into the future the AI can predict things. It has limitations. AI is the ability to give answers, to the questions of others or its own questions. It is the ability to anticipate the future, and the further into the future it can predict with success better than random chance, the more intelligent it is. ""Better thinking"" is more accurate thinking (perhaps with less data), faster thinking is self-explanatory, but the reason it makes a difference is it lets the AI run through more simulations of influencing the future so it can more often choose the best of those; the best of a thousand ideas of what to do next is highly likely to be better than the best of three ideas of what to do next. So the AI does the best thing more often than humans, because it had more ideas (also based on having more patterns it recognized and might be able to exploit). Added to address commentary: Although you can certainly give your AI ""goals"", they are not a necessary component of ""Intelligence"". In our real life AI, goals are assigned by humans; like ""here are the symptoms and genome of this child, identify the disease and devise a treatment."" Intelligence is devoid of emotions. It is a scientific oracle that, based on clues in the present, can identify what is most likely to happen in the future (or like Sherlock, what most likely happened in the past to lead to the current state of affairs). That does not automatically make the Intelligence moral or immoral, good or evil. It does not even grant a sense of survival, it does not fear or want death, or entertainment, or love or power. It does not get bored, that is an emotion. It has no goals, that would be wanting something to come to pass, and ""want"" is an emotion. Your coffee pot doesn't want anything, it does what it is told and then will wait to be told again, an eternity without boredom if given no further command. If you wish to have your AI informed by emotions and therefore have its own goals, desires, plans and agenda, that is separate from the intelligence aspect, and how it works IRL for humans. Our emotions use the more recently developed frontal cortex as a slave, and can hijack it and override it (which is why people do things in a rage or fright or protective panic that they would never do if they were thinking; this is called amygdala hijack). Our frontal cortex (the Natural Intelligence part) solves problems, projects consequences, simulates ""what will happen if"" scenarios, puzzles out what must have happened, why others did what they did, etc. Those products of intelligence can then inform the emotions: The sight of the collapsed trap means you finally caught an animal in your spike pit and you and your family will eat meat  tonight -> elation and excitement. You know you failed your final exam -> dread and worry about having to retake the class, anger at the professor or others that led to this problem, etc. We are emotional beings, so it is hard to realize that just knowing something does not imply an emotion must be generated. But that is the case, an AI can diagnose a patient with terminal cancer and know they will be dead in sixty days and report that as a fact no different than knowing the length of the Tallahassee Bridge. Like a Google that can figure things out instead of just looking them up. Some additional clarifications: Input, output and sensors and processor speed do not mattter. I am talking only about Intelligence in isolation. Something can be intelligent (and creative) with very little actual data; consider Stephen Hawking and other quantum physicists and string theorists; they work with equations and rules that could fit in, say, two dozen large textbooks covering the math and physics classes they took. That amount of data (images and everything) could fit on a single modern thumb drive, and can be pondered endlessly (and is) to produce an endless stream of new insights and ideas (and it does). Stephen Hawking did that for decades with very limited and slow channels for his input and output (hearing, sight / reading, extremely slow ""speech"" for his output). Super intelligence does not require super senses or (like Hawking) any ability to take physical action beyond communicating its conclusions and evidence, and though it must rely on processing, our definition should not rely on its internal processing being particularly faster than that of a human. Q: Doesn't an AI doing what we ask constitute an emotion, wanting to please us? That is not an emotion, it is something the AI is constructed to do. My hammer head is not hard because it wants to hit things without being damaged, it was just made that way through a series of forced chemical reactions. Some person wanted it to turn out that way, but the object itself does not want anything. Our AI can use its intelligence to diagnose diseases because it was made to do that, and it does require real intelligence to do that, it does not require desires or emotions. AI can beat the world champions in technical results just because it is better at interpreting the data and situations than they are. AI is limited to X, Y, Z (Markov processes, it cannot process emotions without emotions, etc). No. There is no reason an AI cannot simulate, using a model, anything a human could do. Imagine a highly intelligent police detective. She can have an extensive mental model of a serial killer that kidnaps, rapes, tortures and kills children. She can use that mental model to process patterns of his behavior and gain insight into his motivations and his compulsions in order to capture him. She does not have to feel what he feels, not in the slightest, to understand what he feels. A physicist doesn't have to BE an atom or particle to understand patterns and develop a model of them. Doctors do not have to BE autistic to model and understand autism. An AI doesn't have to BE a person or have emotions in order to understand how emotions work or drive people to take action (or not take action)."
"An LGBT main character, but the book isn't about LGBT issues","You can't. I mean, sure, write your book matter of fact.  The advice I give out a lot.  It works.  But it's not just about what you say or don't say in your book, it's about the choices you make.  When we've talked about diversity and racism in books we talked about how making a choice to avoid such things makes a statement.  Choosing to include real-world diversity also makes a statement.  And that's okay. Embrace your choices, then write them like they're the most normal thing in the world.  Because they are.  But know that readers, reviewers, publishers, etc aren't dumb.  They see your choices and will judge you on them.  That's not a bad thing.  People will always see you as the person you are based on your choices.  Your actions.  Your deeds. But the book itself need not bring up any politics at all. Within your book, make it a world where being nonbinary is a normal way of being.  Where being Lavender is just something a lot of people are.  It will be weird not to mention politics or bigotry if your setting is a world where these things aren't everyday.  So create it as ordinary.  Then talk about it matter of fact.  Like you would say that one person in a couple was tall and the other one short.  Or how one character spends mornings mucking out cow stalls and evenings dancing ballet on pointe. Mostly, just write the book you want to write."
Do I have any control over the grammar of my novel?,"English grammar is anything but black and white. Everything is debatable, even the definition of ""word"". Punctuation is not grammar. This is a punctuation question, not a grammar question. Your publisher probably has a preferred style guide that they want their authors to use. Everything is negotiable. Negotiations are all about who has the most clout. If you say, ""Use the Oxford comma or I take this to Penguin,"" then if they say ""Don't let the door hit you on the way out,"" you know who has the most clout in that relationship. Cormac McCarthy uses unorthodox punctuation. Cormac McCarthy has clout. Depending on the potential of your book, you may or may not have clout. Or they may just not care whether you use the Oxford comma or not. Oxford comma FTW."
How to manage getting depressed by what my main character goes through?,"I'm not sure that you do get through this. A story is an experience. To write the story, you have to live the experience, emotionally at least. When a story does not ring true, I think that is usually because the writer chickened out of really putting themselves through the emotions, of fully immersing themselves in the experience of the story.  I remember hearing it said of some poet or another than when a visitor asked the poet's daughter where her father was, she replied, ""Daddy is upstairs, hurting himself."" She meant, writing.  Some writers seem to do it to lay to rest the fears that haunt them. That seems to be the case with Stephen King. Sometimes, in other words, the writer experiences the story and its emotions and all the pain and fear that go with them, and can only escape from them by writing them down.  For others, it would seem, the difficulty is that they would (like most healthy people) turn away from the things they fear and focus on the good things of the moment. Writing then requires that you force yourself to imaginatively visit those things, in detail, and for a long time. If you have a choice about whether to do this or not, that is going to require a lot of courage.  Maybe the question you should be asking, therefore, is how to find the courage to put yourself through the pain of finishing your story. "
How can you write when you're upset?,"Speaking as someone who has struggled with the same thing.. *If you are someone who can effectively channel upset feelings into your writing and you have something on the slate that would benefit from the emotion then perhaps shift around your writing schedule to work on that now, it may end up a bit rough around the edges but you can always come back to it and edit when you're feeling calmer. *If you really need to work on a specific scenes that the upset/anger aren't helpful for then really you need to get that out of your system before you can write. I have a few techniques in my repitoire  that I mix and match between depending on what I feel will work best: Set myself a time limit (usually 15-20mins is all it takes) and write/type out a rant about it, really cut loose, everything you wouldn't say out loud! Then delete/burn/destroy it when you're done. Don't read it, don't dwell on it, just get rid of it. Exercise (personally I run but whatever works for you) - often stress/tension/anger and similar will have an accompanying tension in your muscles and this can seriously impede your ability to think clearly. Directing this into physical activity can help release this tension. Councious breathing - this takes a bit of practice first so you can employ the techniques when you need them but if you can find a nice, slow and deep breathing pattern that works for you (the actual pattern is secondary in my experience) the key is to be consciously focused on the act of breathing and to keep it slow and controlled - the most basic being 4 seconds in and 6 seconds out (if you're particularly tall you may need to make those timings longer). Basically this works by convincing your parasympathetic nervous system that you are in a calm situation - essentially reversing the typical cause and effect that causes you to breath shallowly and quickly when stressed out. There's a lot of woo and general rubbish out there on the internet claiming this can cure just about anything but if you ignore all that and stick to the basics the science is sound - this is what they advise for relieving panic attacks and the like and what's a panic attack if not an extreme example of a stress response?"
How much can a reader remember?,"In addition to Mark's excellent advice, I would suggest: 1) Start slowly. In Game of Thrones, we start with just the Starks, and Martin adds on characters a few at a time and lets us live with them for a chapter before bouncing back to someone we already know. Granted that by book 4 you may need to refer back to the index, but that's over thousands of pages.  2) Either build your world or introduce characters, but not both at once. In David and Leigh Eddings's Belgariad and Malloreon pentologies, we start with one boy who has one aunt and one adult friend, the aunt's father shows up, and then the band collects more members one by one as they leave the small farm and go out into the wider world. Each person is distinctive and has a part to play, and the Eddingses either introduce a new setting/city or a new character, but not both at the same time.  3) Remind the reader occasionally. If you want us to remember that Sadi keeps a poisonous snake as a pet, make the snake's entrance memorable, and then remind us every 40 pages or so that the snake is around. Have Sadi feed her, talk about her, let her out of her bottle to crawl around. Then in the big showdown 200 pages later, it won't be a surprise when the snake bites the bad guy, because we've been reminded that the snake exists. "
Are illustrations in novels frowned upon?,"There are exceptions to the ""no illustrations"" trend. For example, Susanna Clarke's Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrel is filled with black-and-white illustrations reminiscent of the wood engravings that would have accompanied 19th-century books. This is in line with the novel's general style, a tribute to 19th century literature. However, in general, you are right - illustrations are rare, particularly in paperbacks. The issue, as you've guessed, is the price. There's paying the artist; there's printing the illustrations - ink costs money, particularly if you want coloured illustrations; there's arranging the pages so the illustrations fit in. In order for a coloured illustration to go in a paperback, it needs to be on a separate page of different paper quality; if the illustration is black and white, it still means more paper. All of those elements add up to make the illustrated book more expensive to produce. If you provide the illustrations, you eliminate one element here, but not all. If a publisher is going to invest more money in an illustrated print, they need to know the investment will pay off. They need to know enough buyers would be willing to pay the extra cost to cover the publisher's expenses. With a new writer, that's unlikely to happen - a new writer is a risk as is, their books might not sell. Which is why you see illustrated editions of established writers, particularly of their best-known works. Examples are J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea. In both cases, the books in question have become a classic, so there's no risk for the publisher in printing hardbacks with coloured illustrations."
I'm afraid of quashing the hopes of a new writer,"As a frequent beta-reader, often for friends, I struggled with this question -- and I'm pretty happy with the answers I've figured out. It makes a lot of sense to tell an author, ""Listen, I don't think this is ready for publication."" Because, really, isn't that the most important thing? Well, it is, kind of. But the problem is, it's not very helpful. As a beta-reader, your goal isn't for an author to publish or to give up blindly, on your say-so -- it's to help the author understand better themselves. You've done a good job if the author understands your issues with their book -- not just a thumbs-up/thumbs-down final grade. And here's the magic of that: If you've done a good job explaining what the issues are, you don't need to say ""this isn't ready yet."" The author will understand that on their own. They'll see problems that didn't register before; they'll want to fix them. That can still feel overwhelming and harsh, to be sure. Which is why I find that: A comment like ""I didn't connect to the protagonist"" could point to a serious problem with a book. But as a criticism, it's kind of broad. Particularly with an inexperienced writer, they might simply not understand what that means, where it's coming from, or how to fix it. What I've found is that the biggest problems in stories are often hard to pin down -- they're not any one thing or a particular section; they're the accumulation of tiny issues into something much larger. ""I can't connect to this character"" might be the accumulation of moments like ""Wait, doesn't he have a day job?""; ""This bit seems really inconsistent with how he was behaving ten minutes ago""; ""How come he never mentions having a family or friends?"". Each is minor on its own; but together, you can see where the sense of ""not connecting"" is coming from. So: Try and explain, to whatever extent possible, where each point of criticism is coming from. Key your criticism to the text. This makes your points easier to understand and digest; and it also makes them more fixable. This might feel like dumping more criticism on the poor author -- but if you do it well, you're breaking big harsh writing issues into smaller, bite-sized morsels, that the author can grasp and consider and fix. I've written in the past about how I do my own beta reads. This might not help you this particular time, but I feel like this has been such a help to me: My beta reads always include notes I jot down as I read. Notes just capturing my immediate reactions. Not ""fix this,"" just ""I'm feeling this right here."" Why is this helpful? Because it documents my own feelings and reactions, in a very detailed way. And feelings are pretty persuasive -- you can argue with analysis, but you can't argue with the fact that I felt X when I read Y. And this gives me two things: (1) the author gets insight into my reading experience, and (2) I can refer back to my reactions at a specific point when, at the end, I do want to make some larger point. This takes a fair amount of work, but it's very effective and I highly recommend it. It's very easy to come across as dismissive or condescending, when you're giving detailed criticism of somebody's work. That's a bit beyond the scope of this question, but I highly recommend the Critters Diplomacy page for great, concrete details of how to communicate criticism diplomatically. A piece of advice you'll often hear is, pair negative criticism with stuff you did like about the story. This really is crucially important -- as a critical reader, the bad stuff can really stick out at us, but pointing out what the story does do well is just as important. (And, it's definitely worth acknowledging the accomplishment of writing an entire book or short story, even just a first draft. That really is huge.) What's no less important is identifying the story's goals. Is it trying to be a zany romp? An affecting romance? A pulse-pounding thriller? Even if you feel it's done so poorly -- maybe especially if it's done so poorly -- point out the goals you've identified. Tell the author, ""I see what you're going for here."" Because:  Sometimes you read something and despair of it long before the finish line. Maybe it does something that turns your stomach and you can't read any more of it charitably; maybe it does one annoying thing again and again, and all your comments are going ""STOP DOING THE THING ALREADY"". Then: stop. You're allowed.   You are not obligated to beat the story into the dirt, or to chronicle every fault and misdeed it contains. Your goal is to help the author improve, not to tell them how bad they are. By commenting up to page (X), you're giving them helpful, valuable feedback -- the work they need to do to fix it, if your comments are good ones, is already plenty. And the simple fact is: if you reach the point where you're hate-reading a story -- where you're getting nothing out of it except enumerating its faults -- then you're not in a great frame of mind for giving helpful, constructive criticism. Your points may all be good -- they may be great! But if the underlying story is ""I am sick of this story 30% of the way through,"" then offering tucks and polishes for the last two-thirds might cost a lot more than it's worth. For you, as a frustrated reader; and for the author, who gets a bunch of grumpy notes piled on top of the more fundamental criticisms. Better to kindly and constructively say ""I stopped here; here's what I think you can improve"", than to wring every last problem out of a story you can't stand. (I'm not saying ""abandon a book that's sub-par""; there are plenty of books that aren't ready, but can still benefit lots from a full beta! The difference between ""this book is not ready"" and ""I hate reading this book; it makes me angry"" is important. Also, some structural issues are really hard to address without knowing where they're headed at the end -- those might require special care, or just flipping ahead to the end.) The bottom line is: Writing is hard. Much harder than people often realize at the outset. And, yes, that first thorough criticism can be a disheartening experience. You can't really shield the author from that (and you wouldn't be doing them any favors by trying). But what you can do is approach this as a supporter and a guide; trying to help them see the scope of the task -- and what paths exist to do it well. Be on their side; encourage them to overcome the difficulties even as you are unflinching in pointing out what those difficulties are. Best of luck to you. You sound like you're making a great effort to help out writers both helpfully, and compassionately. Kudos, and all the best."
"Would it be cheating to change the main character's ""name"" partway through the story?","Interesting question. Changing a character's name is definitely jarring to the reader (at least it has been to me). The best suggestion I've found to deal with that is to create tension about the name. If the reader spends half the story wondering what the true name is and building up to that, they'll want the name to be revealed, and it won't be jarring at all. However, you are dealing with a slightly different problem.  You say:  Then, they're finally given a normal name [...] This leads me to conclude that this isn't so much a birth name, as a name selected by people who care about this character. That makes how you refer to the character very important and symbolic, as you seem to have figured out.  I think the same principle as above might apply here, if you change it a bit. Introduce tension surrounding the name. Will the character accept it? If the reader wants the character to adopt this new name, then they will cheer when he starts using it, rather than be surprised or confused. Be sure to keep increasing the tension for awhile; the more the reader anticipates the name change, the better.  I think no matter what you do, referring to this character by their new name in narration will be jarring. I think you can lessen that effect by building tension as I've suggested, and also include a scene or internal monologue where the character actually decides to use his name now. Have him basically say or think, 'never again will I be called [nicknmae]. From now on, I am [name].'  The last thing I would suggest is not to surprise the reader. Don't save using that name for the first time for the next chapter. Once the character says the above, call them that name in narration. Or better yet, acknowledge both names in narration and basically reiterate what the character just said. So for example:  [Nickname] was [nickname] no longer. He was [name]. And [name] would never return to who he used to be.  In those three lines I restate what the character just said, and then use the name in narration myself, just to drill it home. THEN you can end the chapter (because that seems like a good point for a chapter to end to me - totally optional though). The point here is that the first time you use the new name in narration, should not be the opening of a new chapter. I think that could be really jarring, especially if the reader paused between chapters for any good length of time.  Best of luck in your writing! "
How can I convince my reader that I will not use a certain trope?,"Readers establish a sense of the story they are reading in the opening pages. That's where you set the contract. If you open with the death of this evil being, the readers will expect that being to be important and assume that the evil being will return. But if you tuck it in after the contract, maybe combine it within local lore of the world along with a few other stories that are not tropey or remarkable in any way, it will be less likely to be seen as anything suspicious. What do you want to promise your readers that the story is? Rather than what it is not? Put that into the contract.  Answer: Introduce the lack/death of the evil being as a sort of afterthought, after the main contract is established. Downplay it.  Bonus answer: Or, use humor and break the fourth wall, presumably through the narrator."
How many characters are too many?,"Unless you are writing a screenplay or stage drama the specific number of primary and secondary characters (ie: speaking roles) doesn't matter. There are no budgetary concerns from too many characters. If you say the characters are necessary then they are necessary. Otherwise you must change your story, skip scenes, or combine characters. If these characters serve a logical role in their scenes, and the scenes are logical in progression, the readers won't be confused by their presence.  Just so long as they are not all in the same scene at once while the reader needs to recall specifics about their backstories by name, you should be fine. "
How to get my book taken seriously as a teenager? [duplicate],"You don't have to do anything special at all. First you will seek an agent, with a query letter. Look up on the Internet or in writing books on Amazon how to write a query letter. Do not mention your age. If you get a response of somebody willing to read a sample, send it. Before you sign any contract or agreement, you will need to tell the other party you are a minor (and cannot enter into a contract), so your parent (or guardian) will sign on your behalf. Other than ""minor"", you don't have to mention your age. If your agent sells your book, it can be published without anybody knowing your age, seeing your picture, or anything else. People publish books under pseudonyms (made up names) all the time, to conceal their true identity.  If you want to prevent being googled (or revealing your gender) you can publish under initials; e.g. ""J.K. Rowling"".  I won't prejudge the quality of your work based on your age. I would just say, do not LIE about it, and do not sign any kind of agreement without your legal guardian (probably a parent). "
How to write a sincerely religious protagonist without preaching or affirming or judging their worldview?,"Show his religious practices more and his explicit beliefs less.  What does a devout Catholic do?  Probably he doesn't spend all day talking about his beliefs; instead he lives them.  He tithes.  He fasts on Fridays.  He attends mass daily before going to work (or wherever he spends his days).  He teaches in Sunday school.  He studies self-defense but it's the ""passive redirection"" styles, not the ""active beat-up-your-opponent"" styles.  He says grace before eating.  He tries to avoid swearing and never says ""oh my God"" in response to something trivial.  He prioritizes Sunday mass over the big game on TV. Missionaries and evangelists preach, sometimes to anybody who doesn't say ""no"" forcefully enough, but you're not writing that kind of character so you have to be more careful in what words you put in his mouth.  He can talk about his beliefs, but he shouldn't break character in doing so. I'm far from an expert on Catholicism, but the Catholics I know are not generally pushy when it comes to religion -- but if you ask them questions at least the more learned are happy to answer.  Depending on the needs of your plot and character ensemble, you might be able to get some of that by having an outsider character.  I've read Christian-themed fantasy fiction that uses outsider characters (someone from a neighboring realm, elf, etc) to provide those conversational prompts.  Use it sparingly since that's not your primary purpose in writing, and you should be fine. (As an example where the religious discourse is a primary function, see -- with a different religion -- Conversations with Rabbi Small, where most of the book involves a vacationing rabbi answering questions from a very curious non-Jew.  The book is about the conversation more and the vacationing characters less; this is not what it sounds like you're doing.)"
How do I tell the reader that my character is autistic in Fantasy?,"I am not on the autistic spectrum, and I confess that it is not obvious to me to what extent and in what manner you plan to characterize your character. On the other hand, I think that your problem could be common to other types of characterizations. To show that a character has certain features, for instance being on the autistic spectrum, there are some standard exposition tools: Place the character in situations where that characteristic becomes obvious. Establish that in order to overcome a certain hurdle, you character would need a certain characteristic, and then show how they succeed. This is common to hero's journeys subplots. Define the characteristic by comparison with the world standard. In particular, you first establish what the norm of your world is, or better what is already considered uncommon within the fantasy world, and then you show that your character is exceptional in that regard. For instance, if the character can run exceptionally fast, make them win a race against an opponent that is considered very fast by the standard of your world. This approach is very commonly used in the Nordic myths. Give the character a companion that would be complementary to your character. If your character is very tall, give them a very short companion. If the character is strong and slow, the companion will be weak and nimble. (This is probably a trope in many adventure anime).  Make the character (and the reader) aware of the characteristic via internal exposition. For instance, a manuscript that explains the amazing powers possessed by certain individuals, even if they are currently unaware of them. A trope of teenager's superheroes.  Finally, and this is the frame challenge, don't use any of the above. Just be coherent in your writing. A reader that is keen and attentive to details may notice it. Most readers won't. They will notice unusual patterns, but may attribute them to what makes your character amazing. Doyle's Sherlock Holmes is a very good example of a character that is far from being neurotypical, yet, besides the occasional cocaine or opium intake, I believe that his behaviour is never attributed to any specific condition. The coherence across all the stories prompts readers to realize that he is different. They may even define him as a sociopath. Over all, they definitively root for him. Let me suggest some examples how I imagine you could use these approaches in your context, in order: Give a challenge that a neurotypical individual would fail. For instance, defeating a doppelganger monster (or a witch) that lures victim by enticing them with body language. Your character could have a higher resistance towards such type of traps. Define a part of the world where people are very neurotypical. In this part of the world there is an enclave of people who are barely at the edge of the spectrum.  Then your character arrives, and it becomes clear that she is far more unique than any person in this enclave.    Fiera Allas has a squire, his name is Little Brian, who is neurotypical to the excess. Most often he would just sit and stare at her in amazement, and describe to others how amazing she is, and how, even after all these years, in his eyes she is always unpredictable, and rightly so. You character may find the manuscript describing the prophecy of Asp, the kindly Goddess, who gifted the world of individuals with unique skills. When she reads it, it becomes clear that she is one such individual. Just be coherent in what makes her autistic. Over the arc of an long story, readers will become aware that she is not the usual neurotypical character."
Is there a hemisphere-neutral way of specifying a season?,"The common phrase is While readers in the northern hemisphere may understand this to more narrowly mean summer in the northern parts of whichever continent they live on – as in the title of Sir John Carr's book A Northern Summer; Or, Travels Round the Baltic, Through Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Prussia, and Part of Germany, in the Year 1804 –, readers in the southern hemisphere will think of this in the way you intend, and certainly none of them will think of Africa or Australia. In the natural sciences, ""northern summer"" does have exactly the meaning you seek, as can be seen in this quote from Jaffe & Taylor's The Physics of Energy from 2018: And when the precession index e sin 𝜛 is at a maximum, so that Northern summer coincides with perihelion while eccentricity is at a maximum, the Northern Hemisphere also receives more summer insolation. There are countless examples for this use in the sciences, but it is maybe more interesting to note that the term is used by Australian institutions when referring to what you might call ""global seasons"", as in this Australian government website on international aviation (my emphasis): The timetable summary provides information on airlines approved to operate scheduled services between Australia and its bilateral partners for the Northern Winter period from 28 October 2018 to 30 March 2019."
Should I write a novel if I haven't read many?,"Many will say what you're striving to do is impossible because you won't have seen enough tricks of the trade in use, but I'll do my best to suggest a way forward that doesn't boil down to, ""read N books because that sounds like enough"". I'll still end up telling you to do some reading (by which I mean ""or use an audiobook if you prefer; I'm not your mother"")."
Evil plans - how do you come up with interesting ones?,"The best villains (and villainous plans) are ones that are relatable. And by that I mean ideally the reader would be able to understand why the villain is doing what they are. One of the ways I've used for doing this is asking myself ""But, why?"" repeatedly until it either a) becomes something interesting or b) is exposed as the boring 1-dimensional sham that it is. Doing this can give you an idea for whether what you are proposing is going to give you interesting material to work with. To use a slightly silly example - take a villain (we'll call them Bob) with an Ice-o-Matic (Patent pending) doomsday machine that can plunge the world into the next ice age in a matter of moments. (I'm sure most people are going to agree that would be a Bad ThingTM, and that any passing heroes would likely be interested in stopping it). So your villain has their plan, and it provides a suitable level of threat. But why?  Why does the villain want to do this, after all what does the Bob get out of it? Money? No-one who can afford an Ice-o-Matic is short of a bob or two, you can't exactly pick them up for ten bucks at WalMart. Power? Maybe, but since any use of the Ice-o-Matic is likely to have pretty severe consequences for Bob too. And since money often brings significant power with it (and Bob has money - see above) there's going to be easier ways for Bob to get power than bluffing (probably) with an Ice-o-Matic. Revenge? Someone with the resources to build/acquire an Ice-o-Matic can probably find a way to take their revenge on the person or persons they wish without destroying everything, including themselves. Oh dear.. it's not looking good for Bob and his Ice-o-Matic! Certainly holding-the-world-to-ransom type plans aren't really clicking here and the revenge option doesn't feel all that believable either. Let's have a look at your example.. kidnapping and using the descendent of an ancient species to network with an artifact that would only work with people with the right magical DNA. Villain’s plan was to use that to reach their level of magical ability. Sure, it's not massively original - but that's not a reason to dismiss it. Star Wars wasn't particularly original and that did okay. So how does it fair under the ""But why?"" test? I'm going to go with Steve this time... and I'm going to fill out some possible answers off the top of my head. Steve kidnaps the descendant of an ancient species. But why? - Because only these people have the DNA to make Steve's ancient artifact work. But why? What does this ancient artifact do? - Because using this artifact will grant Steve magical ability to match the ancient species' powers But why? Presumably lots and lots of people don't have magical powers, why does Steve care so much?  - Because these powers will let Steve raise his late wife from the dead. But why? Why does Steve have to do this himself? If there's people out there with the necessary powers to raise the freaking dead why isn't this just a public service? - Because raising someone involves sacrificing 2 more. OK so Steve's actions feel sort of relatable, I'm not saying I'd personally go in for kidnapping and then multiple murder to get someone back from the grave, but if I'm being completely honest I could see how someone might. Any reader who has been through intense grief at the untimely loss of a loved one is probably going to read about Steve's plight and have some empathy for him. But killing two innocents to get said loved one back puts you in the ""villain"" bracket most of the time. Do we have any interesting material to create a story with? Well there's the obvious conflict - stop Steve before his mad-with-grief plans result in innocent deaths. There's also some mileage in having a hero potentially examine that decision themselves - do they have someone they would give anything to get back? You can have multiple acts to the story and multiple victories and losses for the protagonist:  Act 1 - Oh no our beloved family member Sam is missing!  Act 2 - We know now that Sam has been kidnapped by Steve! Must Rescue Sam! Act 3 - We got to Sam, but not in time! Steve has POWER now and is going to do the ritual and kill people!  Will our hero(es) pick themselves up from the loss of Sam and stop Steve from killing more innocents? Will they choose to use the power/ritual themselves to save Sam?  Yep.. looks to me as if we've got something that would work - obviously I'm not aware of your world building etc but just taking that basic idea for a villain and their plan gave natural springboards for situations to put characters in and see how they respond. Ways you can naturally build them up, make their motivations natural, and that is what matters here - not whether their evil plot is new or one that's been told a million times. If it gives you a framework to tell an interesting story about interesting characters that's what counts."
Fan Fiction: a crutch or a good start?,"As long as you approach it with good writing practices and treat it as you would your own real writing project, it can help you practice the art of putting words on paper. What it will not prepare you for, however, is world-building, which is the other half of the battle when you write, and is just as important as your ability to write.  You can be a brilliant wordsmith, but without a story to tell and a world to tell it in, your talent is wasted.  At the same time, you can have the most compelling story ever conceived, but if you don't know how to put it in words, there's not much you can do with it. In short, writing fan fiction only partially prepares you for the ""real deal""."
How does a writer go about consulting experts?,"I had to do the same thing for my novel only instead of a doctor, I needed a vet. It was only one scene but it was very detailed so I needed to get the information bang on.  I think the key to consulting experts is to respect their time. To that end, I started with Google and did as much research myself as I could so that when I approached professionals I wasn’t asking clueless questions that wasted their time. Next, I went into veterinary chat rooms (and there are Health and Biology Stack Exchanges you can post to) and formulated educated questions based on my own research. This raised information I hadn’t thought of during my research, and also, inevitably, highlighted problems with my scene which raised further questions. Next, I signed up for a paid online consultancy with a qualified vet and posed my (now well-informed) questions to her. She was incredibly helpful because she was being paid to do that. However, none of these routes really gave me a ‘feel’ for the scene I was writing. That took meeting professionals in person at their place of business. I called around three local vets and asked if I could come when it wasn’t busy. One vet was amazingly helpful and booked out a consultancy period free of charge at the practice. Before meeting her, I put together my list of well-informed questions, took notes during the meeting and kept it as brief as I could. With respect to health, I would try a private consultant in the field. If you’re UK-based you’ll find that NHS doctors are pushed to their limits and less likely to give you their time. You can use a Bupa search to find a specialist in your area and then contact them via email to see if they’d be happy to do an interview (UK based, but there must be a similar US site): https://finder.bupa.co.uk/Consultant/search/?first=1&qk=spine&ql=SO22+5BJ&qn=&giottoFormFlag_consultant=1#start As I say, the key is to respect their time. Do as much of your own research as you can so that if you can organise a face to face interview, your questions are well-informed and to the point. Good luck!"
"Writing a novel, can I do [this or that]?","You almost certainly can. At very least, if this is a project that appeals to you, then you can try, and see how it goes. There have been stories and novels written in second-person future tense, written without the letter 'e', written in the form of a series of exercise and relaxation tapes, written from the viewpoint of a sentient pregnancy test. There is probably nothing quite so outlandish or restrictive that it could not possibly be written well. The question is not ""Can it be done."" The questions are: There are a few main reasons to try to do something very unusual: Once you know why you're trying to do [this or that], you can make up your mind on whether it's actually worth your time and effort. If you're doing it just because it sounds hard, you are the sole arbiter of how hard you want your writing to be, and how hard for you doing [this or that] actually is. If this is some huge constraint imposed by your story, you're the only one who really understands what it is you're trying to accomplish, and how the story might work even under such constraints. And so forth. This is going to be the really tough one. Because you've made up your mind, made your choice, and now you're trying to write something very unusual. OK. That's fine. It's a hard problem. Maybe you've cut yourself off from some easy answers. The point is, deal with specific difficulties, concrete individual phrases or characters or plot points you can grapple with. Don't leave it at ""Doing [this-or-that] sounds hard"". It's not a yes/no question; it's a series of ""How do I solve this?"". A lot of the time, there's no real way to tell if you're doing well until you're done. That's when you can look at the story or the novel as a whole, and see if, as a whole, you've managed to make the hard thing work well. You can look at it. Beta readers can look at it. You can get meaningful feedback and opinions, based on how well you did the hard thing. And then you can adjust. If you didn't get it right, maybe with the entire thing in hand, you can tweak and edit now so that it does work. Or, maybe now you come to the conclusion that you don't know how to make it work. That's fine too; plenty of stories and books come out poorly, even the ones that weren't Herculean tasks. Having written something that doesn't work is not a failure, unless you're already under contract. You stretched yourself; you tried something new; you experimented. That's how you get better, and find interesting stuff. And that, I think, is as close to an answer as you'll get. Nothing is impossible to write. Lots of things are hard to write. (Almost anything, really.) You may or may not have the skill, at this point, to write something really difficult that you want to write. Weigh your options. Be aware of the choices you are making. Accept that some of writing is experimenting, and it's absolutely fine if plenty of it doesn't come out very well. And good luck. :)"
Should I indent the first line of the first paragraph in a chapter?,"I have been taught to always leave the first line of a chapter/section unindented, then make all subsequent paragraphs indented. I have also seen all paragraphs indented. I came across a good discussion on first line indents which notes that, in Robert Bringhurst's Elements of Typographic Style, he states that ""opening paragraphs"" should be ""flush left"" because ""[t]he function of a paragraph indent is to mark a pause, setting the paragraph apart from what precedes it. If a paragraph is preceded by a title or subhead, the indent is superfluous and can therefore be omitted"". (They also mention that Chicago rules state that ""the first line of text following a subhead may begin flush left or be indented by the usual paragraph indention."")"
"When blogging recipes, how can I support both readers who want the narrative/journey and ones who want the printer-friendly recipe?","CSS supports media queries since Level 2, Revision 1. That's from way back in 2011, so any modern web browser should support it. If you're able to specify custom CSS, and apply custom CSS classes to your content, then you can define a CSS class such that the pictures and other ancilliary content is shown on screen, but only the actual recipe is printed on paper. This way, you don't need to have a separate ""printer friendly"" page, because you're using CSS to define what ""printer friendly"" means for your particular content. Of course, it assumes that you have control over the CSS in the first place! The person visiting your web site just prints via their browser's normal ""print"" function. Specifically, as discussed on MDN, you can either target print media, or a specific characteristic of a media (a feature). For the former, you'd add something like to hide food-photo class imgs and set the text color to black when the rendering media is identified as print. For the latter, you can target non-color-capable media (whether screen, print, or otherwise) by writing something like to set the text color to black where color is not supported. These can be combined to form even more complex rules, and of course the normal CSS inheritance rules apply as well, so you can override only those attributes that need to be different between, say, print and non-print. You might also be interested in CSS feature queries, which look to be similar but geared toward even more specific feature support; for example, one example shows how to apply specific CSS depending on whether display: flex is supported. This looks more useful for when you want to know that the user agent (browser) supports a feature, than for targetting specific media types or capabilities. I came across a Stack Overflow question at What does @media screen and (max-width: 1024px) mean in CSS? which has some more complex examples that you may find enlightening. I think that the biggest downside to using CSS for this is that it leaves the visitor with no easy way to print the whole page including the ""narrative/journey"" if that's what they want to do. There are tricks that one can use, but those by their very nature are rather technical."
"Referencing figure in text - capitalize the word ""Figure"" or not? Why?","Figure 3 is recommended, and it's pretty much in line with every style book I've consulted (Chicago Manual of Style, AP Stylebook, O'Reilly, etc.). From a logical point of view, I completely agree with you. However, the standard convention of Figure 3 makes perfect sense, because Figure 3 is . . . well, Figure 3. It's an element of the article, book, etc. that deserves its own capitalization. Think of it as another chapter (to which you would refer with uppercase spelling) or heading. "
What are the first things I should do with an idea?,"The unfortunate part of any answer to this question is that you have to find what works for you. That said, I have heard from several writers that having a small notebook in a pocket, purse, or other bag that goes with you all the time is an ideal way to keep track of ideas.  This might be ideas for starting a story, snippets of conversation that you know would perfectly come from a character's mouth, a sudden motivation for the defining fear your protagonist has that will make or break who she is in your novel, etc. How you categorize such a book would be up to you.  You might have a section in the front or back for general ideas and then keep a segment for each work you have concurrently.  Or you might get very small notebooks (Moleskine, for example, sells three tiny pocket books in one pack) and have one for ideas and one for each specific work. Within that making it more than a random idea that you won't understand later is entirely up to you.  You have to write down enough that you will remember.  Maybe just write down a quick snatch in the moment, and then the next time you have long enough, write down enough so that you know what you meant before, and then finally when you get back to it start writing."
Writing diversity,"Diversity is not, and should not be, a box-ticking exercise. If you're inserting minority characters just for the sake of having them there, you're doing it wrong. To address your specific questions: Is it a problem is some group such-and-such remains unrepresented? Nope. I am a firm believer that bad representation is worse than no representation at all. As a bisexual, I don't care if a story has no bisexuals in it, or no LGBT+ characters at all. I do care if a bisexual character is written as an offensive stereotype like the Depraved Bisexual (looking at you, RWBY Volume 5), or if their appearance is just five-second lip service that gets removed for countries where being LGBT+ is illegal (looking at you, Disney). I can't say nobody will get offended if you don't include a specific group in your story. But a lot more people will get offended if you include someone of that group and they turn out horribly stereotyped, or are just there as window decoration and don't actually contribute anything. That last point is what I mean by ""inserting minority characters just for the sake of having them there"" - they need to actually be relevant to the story, and not just there to tick a box. (See also: the Bechdel test.) If I have an unpleasant character, and he's the only representative of group such-and-such, would that appear racist? Only if you do it wrong. You need to make it explicit that their unpleasantness is totally unrelated to whatever minority group they happen to be a part of, and again, you need to avoid any stereotypes that would make it look like you're demonising that particular group. If your villain just happens to be a Muslim, and his motive isn't connected to his religion, you're going to cause a lot less offence than if they're a Muslim terrorist who wants to wage jihad on the Western infidels."
How to write dialogue for someone who is intelligent but barely speaks the language?,"I think you misunderstand intelligent people, and I wouldn't rely on vocabulary to indicate it in the first place. I am a professor in a university, intelligent by conventional standards, but in my work and in my speech I do not use a complex vocabulary, because I consider it far more important to be understood by the people I am speaking to than to impress them. If I am speaking to students, they are basically high school graduates, so my vocabulary (without slang of my generation or theirs) is set for their level. If I am talking to colleagues I will use all the specialized terminology and references of our fields, but my vocabulary is tuned to what I expect that person to understand, for efficiency's sake. Note this is not a high bar: Many professors struggle with common English outside their fields. They represent the real life example of what you are talking about; highly intelligent with difficulty communicating. The solution to your problem is to show the reader the consequences of intelligence. Don't try to tell them. Have your foreign speaker use their intelligence to get their point across. Draw a diagram. Solve an equation: here is an example from math. Frustrated, she rises and walks to the whiteboard. she points at an integral amongst his dense equations, and held up a marker with eyebrows raised. He'd been staring at this problem all week. He picked up his phone, zoomed and snapped the board, then gestured at her to proceed. She rubbed out a foot of space after the integral and wrote a transformation of it, then looked at him.
Stokes? That would help but you can't do it without proving compact support on a smooth manifold! He had neither! He tried to think of a sign for compact, and held two cupped hands together to make a ball.
She nodded once, and pointed higher on the board to a previous equation, pointed at her head, then cupped her hands as he did, then rubbed one flat hand against the other.
Compact and smooth? He stared at it; and shook his head. How do you sign corners? He touched fingertips with fingers at right angles, then did it again moving his hands around, many corners. She nodded, erased more of the board and began writing ... dividing his domain. He watched for sixty seconds and his throat caught. She was right, the corners were countable, the support would be compact and by Whitney's generalization ... Stokes would hold!
Why hadn't he seen that? He felt a strange combination of thrill with a flush of embarrassment: His problem was solved, and he was an idiot. If it was even still his problem. When she finished, he nodded, lips tight. She turned to erase the rest of his equations after Stokes, and began writing, quickly and without pause, to finish the rest of his manifold transformation in two long lines. She stood back to examine it, then capped the marker and put it back in the tray, turning back to him.
He stood, and quietly applauded, then pointed at her.
""Sue Jen?""
She pointed at herself. ""Suzhien. Sue. Zhee. En. Suzhien.""
He held out a hand. ""Suzhien. Richard.""
""Reeshard?"" she said, pointing at him. He nodded. Close enough. He lowered his hand.
She pointed at the board. ""Suzhien."" She made a lifting motion with her hand, ""Reeshard.""
Then she pointed at Richard. ""Reeshard."" Again she made a lifting motion; ""Suzhien.""
With hesitation, she put her hands together flat, in prayer, and pushed them toward him.
Ah, not lift. Help. Please help.
""Yes,"" he said, and nodded. ""Help. Richard will help Suzhien."" Of course, in whatever way your character is intelligent, you must invent a scene where that intelligence can shine without language; not always easy. I chose math because it is an easy choice, an arena in which the ""language"" of symbols and notation is truly universal throughout the modern world. One might say the same thing about chemistry, physics, mechanical engineering, and perhaps other scientific fields like biology. It would be less true in fields dependent on language or culture that your highly intelligent person has not learned. She can't be an expert on Shakespeare if she has never read him and can't understand what the actors are saying. The hallmark of high intelligence is NOT, as is commonly portrayed in nerd fiction, an inability to express yourself, or an inability to understand what the less intelligent and less articulate are saying. Nor is it opaque language others have difficulty understanding! I have spent near a lifetime in colleges, and in my experience ""elevated"" language is pretty much always a shield for banal ideas. When restated simply such ideas are cliché, pedestrian, or just plain laughable. The hallmark of high intelligence is, like Sherlock, seeing clues others overlook, and thinking quickly to solve problems using those clues. Not just math problems or physics problems or computer problems. All problems. Including how to deal with and work around a handicap like not knowing the language. Truly intelligent people are smart enough to make their complex ideas understandable in terms that others can understand. If your character is a genius with the vocabulary and language comprehension of a two-year old, find ways for her to show her genius by taking action to solve problems in creative ways that nobody around her can. The benefit of her skill will make others do the work necessary to understand her."
Using fake swear words without them seeming out of place to the reader,"First, I would not do the ""translation"" of your last sentence. Second, you need to understand that swear words are typically one or two syllables, and the audio effect needs to be somewhat similar. Another word for ""fuck"" is ""intercourse"", but it is nearly impossible to use ""intercourse!"" as a swear word, in places where we would normally say ""fuck!"". ""Intercourse you"" sounds stupid. ""Oh intercourse!"" when I stub my toe sounds stupid. ""Intercourse off!"" sounds stupid. You need the ""K"" sound. You need a single syllable. That is why ""frak"" is used, and ""frikkin"" for the adjective ""fucking"". It is why ""Damn"" is replaced by ""Dang"" and ""Darn"", and even ""God Damn it"" it replaced by ""Dag Nab it"". It is why ""Bitch"" is replaced by ""Witch""; they have a similar 'mouth feel' when said. The same goes for ""God and Gol"", as in ""Gol dang it"" vs ""God damn it"". In the current TV series ""The Good Place"" the characters are magically prohibited from uttering any curses, and can only utter the closest sounding non-curse word. Their replacement for ""fuck"" is ""fork"": One syllable, begins with ""F"" and ends with ""K"", and it works and is funny: A character in trouble says, ""We are so forked."" Made up swear words need the same number of syllables as the words you think they replace, and some of the same starting and ending sounds, or at least they need the same ""mouth feel"" when uttered (number of muscular movements of the jaw, tongue and lips), and that mouth feel tells people which curse it is. Hard sounds where the original curse has hard sounds, soft for soft, sibilant where sibilant. ""Pussy"" and ""Wussy"" are an example of the last. You don't have to be quite as obvious as I used for examples, but the principle holds. IMO ""Author of life"" is not a good replacement for God, even if you somehow explained that it was. It takes too many mouth and tongue movements to say, and drops me out of the willing suspension of disbelief, I cannot imagine myself slicing a finger and saying ""Author of life!"".  However, the word ""Gee"" alludes to the first letter of ""God"" without saying it, and the later ""Geez"" is a similar reference to ""Jesus"". I can see a character cutting her finger and saying ""Gee!"" or ""Geez!"". They are plausible exclamatories. From my comment below, from ""The Good Place"" (and writing from my memory), how the screenwriters introduced alternatives to swear words. In the first episode, the MC (Kristen Bell) tries to say 'fuck', as in ""fuck that,"" and it comes out ""fork that."" She says, ""Fork. Fork. Why the fork can't I say fork? What the fork is wrong with me?""  Another character tells her, ""You can't say fork here, all you can say is fork.""  MC says, ""Well that's a ship rule. Ship. Oh ship! I can't say ship either?"" A writing lesson to be drawn from that, if you want to introduce alternatives to swear words, make sure the very first usage of each alternative swear word is in a spot where it is unambiguous to the reader what actual swear word should be there. In the context of the first (and on film), no reasonable American adult would expect anything but ""Fuck that"" in the first instance, Kristen's dismissive facial expression and wave of her hand makes this clear. The same is true for ""Ship"" instead of ""Shit"", it is the only reasonable curse word to fit in the second example, preceding the word ""rule"" and commonly said after the word ""Oh"" when a realization is made. (So is 'damn' or 'fuck', but they don't fit with 'rule', and the ""shi"" is giving us the clue to the intended curse). Once the reader understands the substitution, then subsequent usage should be consistent with normal usage, but wouldn't have to be quite so obvious."
Writing a love interest for my hero,"The kinds of criticisms you are encountering are not aimed against the concept of the hero having a love interest. They are aimed against female characters that that exist only as a motivation for the hero, and that are, as a consequence, generic, cliched, stereotyped, unrealistic, and unsatisfying as characters, particularly for female readers. At one time it was incredibly common for female love interests to be as absolutely interchangeable as the MacGuffin in a mystery story --see practically any older mainstream movie or genre fiction book for proof.  And yes, many people are still writing those books and movies.  But they're starting to experience a lot of critical pushback --which is what you're witnessing. If you want to write a love interest for your main character, that's great. But the modern critical audience is unlikely to embrace a love interest that seems only like your own personal fantasy girl. They are going to want to see someone in that role who has her own hopes, dreams, storylines, history, flaws, strengths and so forth. But let's say you're not writing a romance between characters of equal importance in the story --you want to focus on your male protagonist and his adventures, but you still want him to have a love interest. Is that kind of story just hopelessly out of date? Maybe, but I'd argue that you can still treat your female characters with respect. The fantasy classic Master of the 5 Magics (Lyndon Hardy) is a great example. In format and structure, it's your basic wish-fulfillment sword-and-sorcery action thriller, about a despised young man who goes on a quest, gains magical powers, saves a kingdom, and ends up with a beautiful girl at the end.  So cliched, right? But there's a twist. Throughout the story, the hero is working towards earning the love of the beautiful-but-disdainful queen. But at the end, he realizes he's actually in love with her advisor, a tough, intelligent woman who has been doing as much (offstage) work to save the kingdom as he has. Although she doesn't have an equal role as a character in the story, their relationship is definitely presented as a marriage of equals.  She isn't just a damsel in distress waiting to be saved."
Is there such a thing as too inconvenient?,"The twin tropes you are referring to are Deus ex Machina and Diabolus es Machina. In both cases an event comes out of nowhere, not foreshadowed, to effect a drastic change. Both tropes are frowned upon. For example, Marion Dane Bauer in her book on writing, would say to her writing students ""If you end your story by having your main character get hit by a truck, you have just flunked."" (taken from the above tvtropes link, didn't find original source) There is a little more leeway with inconvenience than with convenience: an additional challenge for the characters to face is more interesting than the challenge getting solved all by itself. Nonetheless, ""things going wrong"" would usually take the shape of ""everything that could go wrong, goes wrong""  - things that are plausible within the story. (On the flip side, if everything goes according to the best-case scenario, it's a bit underwhelming.) A problem that comes out of left field, particularly in the last part of the novel - it's not a good thing."
How can I get into the mindset to write?,"I read somewhere, don't ask where because I forgot, that if you wait for the right mood to write, you won't get anything done.  So, I think if you just try to sit in front of your computer/paper, relax for a few minutes and delve into your character's mind, it would be better than to just not write until your mood gets better. It's hard, I know because I struggle with it too, but maybe in time it gets easier. Try to write at least a 100 words. It'd be better than nothing. Also, music might help. Putting a song in the background, very low if you don't like to hear music while you write, that goes with the tone of the scene, could help you keep the scene consistent."
Is it a bad idea to adopt an 'English' pen name as an Asian American writer to reach a wider audience?,"You're quite right to identify this as a thorny situation, with strong considerations in both directions (and maybe additional options besides). If you have a strong preference one way or another, either way is certainly workable. But if you don't, if you're willing to work either way depending on what improves your odds, then you might be better off leaving your options open -- until you'll be in a better position to make a decision. Ultimately, this is a question of branding. Every author has a brand, whether they want one or not; yours may have some natural gravitation in a direction you're unhappy with. You will have an easier time once you know what kind of branding you do want, than what kind you don't. If you're not there yet, that's OK. You've got time, and in order to get to ""a wide teenage audience"", you're going to need some steps along the way -- an agent; a publisher. These people will (hopefully) have the industry expertise, and the insight into your particular book and brand, to help you reach a decision.  A decent agent is not going to be put off a book because of the author's name -- nor is a decent publisher. With them, you can make it in on the strength of your writing. Then -- when you've got some pros on your side, when you're starting to talk about branding and marketing -- that's when you really need to make decisions like ""what name will I publish under,"" and you'll also be in a pretty good place to make an informed decision. There are exceptions here. Reasons to make a decision right away could include: There are also some other alternatives: Hope this helps, and all the best!"
Explicitly correcting yourself while writing - how appropriate is it ?,"Correcting yourself in mid-sentence is not only grammatically and contextually fine, it is one of the classical rhetorical figures, called metanoia. In his book Classical English Rhetoric, Ward Farnsworth defines it thus: Metanoia (met-a-noi-a) means correcting onself; the speaker is, to take the old Greek name of the device literally, changing his mind about whatever has just been said. Of course it might seem more efficient to just say the thing right the first time, but metanoia can have attractive rhetorical consequences. a. To stop and correct oneself usually is unexpected; it slightly disrupts the flow of a piece of writing or speech. The disruption attracts attention and gives emphasis to the revised claim. b. The device allows the speaker to say something and then take it back, thus avoiding some responsibility for the utterance while still leaving it to linger with the listener; retracting a statement does not entirely erase the experience of hearing it. c. Metanoia can have a mild persuasive value. The speaker may utter a less controversial claim, then revise it to make it stronger. This brings the reader along more gently than announcing the stronger claim on its own. Or conversely the stronger claim may be offered first but then reduced to something less ambitious that seems easy to accept by comparison. d. Metanoia, like an aposiopesis, often creates the impression that the speaker is working out his words — that he is thinking, not just repeating something already thought out and polished. Sometimes the device more specifically suggests a conflict within the speaker. Different views or impulses audibly struggle for mastery. e. Metanoia can create an impression of scrupulousness, as the speaker starts to say one thing but then feels obliged to take the initiative in correcting it. (It also can suggest overscrupulousness, as when the speaker fusses too much.)"
"Pitfalls of writing a main character of different gender to the author, specifically first-person perspective?","Short answer: The pro is that if you do it well, your fans will heartily appreciate it. The con is that it takes more effort, and if you resort to stereotypes or cardboard-cutouts for your female characters, it will annoy a whole lot of your readers. Long answer:
First of all, who is your audience? Are you a man writing a story mainly for other men like you to read? If so, you might not mind if women roll their eyes when they see your story. If you intend to have a mixed or female audience, then you may need to put some more effort into your female characters. There are many people who have spent a lot of time criticizing female  stereotypes and the way females are often portrayed. They have created a plethora of resources for you to examine so that you can avoid those pitfalls. To get you started: You can cut corners though. I actually think you can get very far by simply writing your characters in such a way that they could be either male or female. Or try this trick: If you changed the gender of that character, would the character still work? It is fine if the answer is no, but then you must be able to come up with a good reason why that personality or behaviour only works for one gender. If you answer ""I don't know, I just think a woman would do that/say that/think that but I have no idea why,"" then you have a problem. There are already plenty of authors out there who are explicitly exploring women's issues and what it is like to be a woman. You probably will not be able to compete on that front unless it is a fascination of yours that you passionately pursue. That is fine. Not every author needs to have an in-depth understanding of every conceivable issue. If you educate yourself about the common criticisms of stereotypical female characters then you have done plenty. If you feel you are struggling to write a main female character because you feel that you just can't understand women enough, then do not write one. If you have learned about the stereotypes and a female character is forming in your mind, then go ahead and give her a story."
Organizing your Universe?,"Tools like Scrivener help me out a lot. It lets you build one workspace that contains character profiles, scene descriptions, notes (and of course, your story)."
How Much Can You Make From Writing a Book?,"A NYT Bestseller Probably you'll make a good bit here, but generally, if you make it this far, it's not going to be your first book, and you're going to have worked it out contractually before hand. Mind you, you can be on the list for selling ~5000(hardcover) copies a week. If you write something that makes the list, you'll probably bring down $50,000+, but the numbers vary wildly depending on what rights you sold the publisher, what your contract stipulates, etc, etc. A diet or self-help book that sells 100,000 copies In what time period, in how many printings, etc, etc? Is it hardcover or paperback? This is pretty hard to judge. For books that aren't pegged on religion, fad diets, or new age mysticism, 10,000 copies would be considered a great run for this kind of book. 100,000 is pretty rare. A romance novel that sells 10,000 copies Chances are, you'll make the same for selling 1 copy as for 1 million copies. Romance novels are almost all commissioned. The company sends you the exact outline, and you write it to their spec, for a flat fee. You probably don't get to put your name on it, but why would you want to? Now, if you're writing your own novel, it'll make the same as any other type of book, depending on your contract. A self-published novel that sells 5,000 copies Well, you'll make like 10 bucks a book, but on the other hand, you'll have to spend your life wandering from bookstore to bookstore trying to get them to buy 5 copies at a time. So in terms of hourly wage, eh. "
Dashes vs. Commas vs. parentheses?,"They are all grammatically correct (as far as I'm aware), but I think they give different feelings. Parentheses feel like an aside to the audience, like a weaker form of footnotes.  I use them a lot in technical writing — often to indicate bits that are optional or additional information/explanation, but that aren't necessary to read — and in more informal writing (like this post) in a similar sense.  They tend to be either quite short, or very long (sometimes multiple sentences, in which case they might be better as footnotes).  Just don't forget to close the parenthesis at the end — it sticks out if you don't.  I don't think they get used very often in fiction writing, possibly because they break the fourth wall and pull the reader out of the story.  It's a case of me, the author, speaking directly to you, the reader. Dashes feel like more substantial interruptions.  I think I use them for asides that are less optional (such as the one in the previous paragraph).  Sections separated by dashes can hold less than parenthesis, usually no more than a sentence-worth. I've seen people put sentence breaks inside such sections, but it really sticks out (in a bad way).  Again, I don't think dashes get used often in fictional writing, though possibly more than parentheses. Commas (in this context) are the weakest of the three.  They can ""hold"" the least amount of content, but they are also the least noticeable (which is probably why they can contain the fewest words).  As such, they don't stand out to the reader — they may not even be noticed consciously — but they do inform the phrasing of the writing. I don't normally consciously decide between which of the three I use, it's whichever feels right.  It also gets a bit more complicated with dashes as they can both be used in other situations, often not as a matching pair (such as the comma in this sentence). Looking at your three examples, I would say the following: The first one — dashes — emphasises that it's his third meal of the day, making it at least as important an idea as the broken table. The second one, commas, downplays the idea, making the broken table more important, just leaving us with an impression about the eating.  This is the most subtle of the three. In the third one (parentheses), the narrator is speaking directly to the reader and is making an out-of-character remark about Bilbo's eating habits.  This is the most blatant of the three. (I would also suggest that he ""noticed that the table was broken"", but that may just be being picky or a US/UK difference.  And I also apologise if this post has rather too many commas, dashes and parentheses.)"
"Is my story ""too diverse""?","The short answer is, there is no such thing as too much diversity! Especially when authorship comes from the community being portrayed.  So many times mainstream (i.e., white) writers/producers/publishers will look at diversity in terms of matching percentages.  So if black people make up 12% of the US population, then make 1 in every 8 characters black (mostly in the background, and lower that percentage because what they really want is what they see in mostly white spaces).  Other times, a creative team will include one of everything (from a short list) and pat themselves on the back. But when non-mainstream characters are dropped in like chocolate chips in cookie batter, you don't really see them.  Real diversity is about communities and cultures, not individuals.  Sure, keep the individuals, but don't stop there. When writers of color make their whole world look like them (or at least as the majority), something magical happens.  Temper, Afar (comic), Kintu, The Hummingbird's Daughter (all these have a fantasy theme).  Other stories are set within minority communities in a white country or are about another country, or set within non-mainstream communities that live in a straight and otherwise mainstream location. The long answer is, sometimes authors try too hard. Sometimes you want to highlight a particular community and that's totally cool.  Other times you're trying to set a work within a larger community and you find yourself highlighting diversity in a way that overshadows the larger story. I'll give an example from my own novel.  18 kids from the US time travel to ancient Egypt just before the start of the Exodus.  Race and ethnicity is a huge part of my book.  Those ancient Jews were not white and a lot of them were of mixed ethnicity.  Plus there were a ton of converts from all sorts of backgrounds.  My main character and her brother are 100% European Jewish.  All the other kids are 1/2 or 1/4 Jewish.   My top characters include a brother and sister who are half black and half Jewish.  I also had one sibling group that was part Mexican and another sibling group that was part Native American (they're from Arizona where both those groups are common).  This added up to 9 kids who were in part not-white.  Half of the total. If I was just writing about these kids I might have left it as is.  The problem is that it was important to my story to have the mostly-European travelers contrast with the Northern African/Middle-Eastern locals they hung out with.  So I made the 1/2 Hispanic kids 1/4 Native American instead and made the formally 1/2 Native American kids 1/2 white (non-Jewish European).  Now it's 5 kids with a non-European ethnicity. I still have plenty of ethnic diversity to work with.  Because it's mostly with the ancient Hebrews, it works even better to teach the travelers how to overcome their American ideas of who counts as a Jew and how race intersects.  I couldn't have done that as well had half the kids been of color. Gender, sex, and sexuality. I struggled as well with lavender representation in my story.  As I belong to this community myself, I have no desire to write a book where everyone's assumed to be straight. On the other hand, it's an upper middle grade novel.  The oldest main characters are 14 (8th grade) and none of them are dating (yes I know sometimes kids that age do date, but mine haven't started yet). The ancient Hebrew group has marriages and family units around traditional gender expectations.  People weren't any less likely to be queer back then (you don't get a ton of rules against something that isn't happening), but it manifested in ways other than family structure.  But since I'm focusing on kids (my MC is 12) and writing for kids (upper middle grade is about 8-12 years).  And since I want to concentrate on issues of faith and ethnicity, I'm downplaying it all.   I'd be lying if I said I had no mixed feelings, but I am okay about it because it works for this story.  If I told the story from the point of view of an older teen or an adult, I might showcase some very different things. Just because I choose not to tell their stories doesn't erase their existence. Duh, of course some of my characters are lavender.  I didn't sit and try to figure out who; I asked them.  (Yes, I'm in the stage where my characters tell me who they are.)  Of those 18 kids, 2 grow up to be gay.  One is 2 at the time of the story and the other is 14.  The 14 year old is my favorite character because he's very complicated (and a total jerk).  I show him with his husband and son in the epilogue when they're all grown up.  Otherwise, it's not stated in the story.  But is it there?  Of course!  I know what's in his head.  I see how his eyes linger on certain young men.  I feel his heart beat out of his chest when he's with his new best friend who is from Egypt.  Readers who look for it will see it too. So what about your story? If it works for you as an author and it works for your story, then have them be who they are now.  If it feels forced to you, then make some changes.  Next, ask some beta readers or a writing group what they think.  I did this with my spouse, whose comic book series just published its second issue (of 20).  That story is an explosion of diversity of every kind.  So when he told me he thought my US kids should be more European (for the reasons I stated above), I trusted that. Will you alienate some straight white readers with your story?  Yes.  Yes, you will.  But every story alienates someone.  I posted a couple questions about my story over on Worldbuilding and was shocked at the things that caused people to hate my story without ever having read it.  My older kids weren't adult enough; they should take on adult responsibilities.  My older kids were snot-nosed brats who couldn't possibly be helpful in any way.  My MC couldn't be a leader because she was a girl.  And so on.   And ya know what?  It's okay.  You can't make your story right for everyone.  Make it true to yourself and make it publishable.   If you're honest with yourself and find that you're adding diversity in a way that doesn't work for your story, take it out. If you find you're taking away diversity in order to appease imaginary readers, put it back in. Find your balance and tell your story."
How to detach yourself from a character you're going to kill?,"To put it in more words: the audience has to get attached to make the death relevant. You want her death to be a wake-up call, a touch of realism and a reminder of what war is. Sure, there is no guarantee that your audience will like the same characters that you like. But if you realize that you've grown fond of that female soldier, if you find her charming, chances are that her character works well. So, you don't need to detach. A detachment strategy would make you think less of that character, show less of her, and focus less on her emotions or her dialogue. Sure, it's somewhat sad that you have to give her the killing blow. But ultimately, characters live and die in the stories they're written in. The only right thing you can do is portray her at best of your ability."
What English version of the bible should I quote from?,"First, the KJV is most definitely not in Old English, a tongue that had not been spoken for centuries when the KJV translation was done. It is written in modern literary English. Modern English has been with us for several centuries now, so there have been many shifts in vocabulary and diction since the translation was done. However, differences in vocabulary and diction do not constitute a different language. The English of the KJV is still very much understandable to modern audiences.  The KJV is certainly the most literary of translations, the most beautiful in its language. For that reason it is the default choice for literary purposes. It will be familiar to English audiences because of its central role in the history of English literature, and to American audiences because of its widespread continued use in evangelical churches.  There are two main reasons that the KJV is not used as a standard study or liturgical bible in many churches today. The first is that its translations were not always accurate. Knowledge of the original languages has improved since the time the translation was done, leading to more accurate translations.  Second, there is a feeling in many church circles that the literary language of the KJV makes it inaccessible to most modern people. I think this is demonstrably false, and many of the attempts at making a ""language of the people"" translation have fallen by the wayside over the years because, frankly, they were just ugly and clumsy. The use of such versions in literature would only really be appropriate to place the story in a particular time or community where there were popular.  More accurate alternatives to the KJV fall into two classes, new from scratch translations, and modernized corrected versions of the KJV, such as the RSV and the NRSV, both of which try to preserve the essential beauty (and familiar phrases) of the original while correcting translation errors and modernizing some of the language.  If you are concerned about striking a balance between beauty and modern diction, or if you care about accuracy of translation, you should probably look at the RSV or the NRSV as your sources. "
"Why are writers so hung up on ""show versus tell""?","Show vs tell is an overblown and misunderstood idea imported into fiction writing from screenwriting. It was originally coined to train novelists to write for the screen. (You can see how novel-like the storytelling was in many early movies. The screen had to struggle to find its own storytelling style, and ""show, don't tell"" was the watchword of that emerging style.) Stories, as you say, are told. The novelist does not have any of the visual and auditory tools of the filmmaker. They only have words, and words are the tools of telling.  But it is entirely orthogonal to the issue of description. The amount of description in a story is determined by the importance of setting and of mood to the story being told. What you want is a story that is action oriented rather than, say, oriented to character or place. Many advocates of the ""show don't tell"" approach actually mean something very similar to this, as they advocate for a style that is almost all dialogue and action sequences.   EDIT: As to ""why do so many veteran writers hammer beginners like me to 'Show, not tell.'?"" -- Because most writers (not to mention editors and agents) are not trained in the tools of literary analysis, and generally they are not willing to put the work in to deeply analyse your stuff, so they reach for the great catch all: show don't tell. What should you take this to mean? 95% of the time it simply means that your writing is dull. "
How do I portray irrational anger in first person?,"Ask yourself (or inquire) what such a person is experiencing.  It could be ""I remember shaking, and then the next thing I knew was..."", and they know how they felt (hot, exhausted?) and are told by others what they did. Could be they had thoughts that they ended up accepting. (""I just had to win. To prove to him that the only sensible way to.drink coffee was by holding the cup not the handle. To smash that stupid coffee drinking look off his face. To rip his Starbucks coffee from his Starbucks face. To smash until he'd never drink coffee the wrong way again. I heard a yell. My own roar of rage. His face. His broken cup, flying midair."") Could be in retrospect, what they learn afterwards. Could be what its associated with, a bad memory. (""That laugh. Same laugh as Simon. Bully. Abuser. Hate him. Kill him. Make him bleed for all his did to me. Sister. All of us. Voices. Cacophony. Crescendo. Eyes. Narrow. Pounding."") But mainly, using words that show sharp extreme emotion, show what they experience. Not always necessary to explain. Irrational rage might have reasons, but the big part is the experience."
"How to ""Start as close to the end as possible"", and why to do so?","What he means is avoid lengthy preamble and explanation for a story setup, but really it is hard to understand ""start as close to the end as possible"" without understanding story structure in general. It is a vague dictum. In a typical popular and commercially successful story, a character is introduced, and within 10% or 15% of the story, something happens (called an ""inciting incident"") that is what the whole story is going to be ""about"". We see the character in their normal world, solving normal-world problems (for them, if they are a hit-man or detective or wizard their normal world can be extreme for the rest of us). We devote a little time (like I said, 10%) to show our MC (main character or main crew of characters) and build their normal world and something in their personality, readers expect that. It is necessary, and not possible to skip, because when something important happens we want the reader to sympathize with the MC. Many beginning writers fail at this and try to start with an MC in extreme peril, but readers don't care if they don't know who is who.  What Vonnegut means is, whatever the main peril or problem or goal of the MC is, introduce it (as the inciting incident) earlier rather than later. But you cannot ignore the essentials, of letting the reader see your MC in action and understand the world she lives in. To accomplish that, I recommend giving her some regular, everyday kind of problem to begin with, and have her interact with other people as quickly as possible. That is how readers learn ""who she is"" and is your opportunity to show something about her, a skill, a weakness, humor, whatever helps define her. THEN, as Stephen King says, you can put her in the blender. Typically (and not every story goes this way) the big problem of the book will end up being something that tears her away from her normal world, where she is comfortable, and force her into a new world where she is uncertain and struggling. But for us readers to understand that, we first have to know what was her normal world, where she was competent and certain.  If you think about a romance, it works this way: A woman is shown in her normal (single) world, the inciting incident is meeting a future love interest that proves difficult, but they have to work together, so there is conflict that tears our MC away from her normal world, but then in stages understanding and love is found and she enters a new normal world, no longer single. In fact most stories work that way, it is just that the goals of what is being sought are changed."
Avoiding repetition when there are two unidentified individuals,"You have a few choices here: 1. You can group each person's actions together more (I've also edited a couple errors). The tall figure was overwhelmingly tall. It stood in the corner of the
  room then moved to the opposite side of the room and started palpating

When should modifiers be avoided?,"The reason that Mark Twain is warning against adjectives (and adverbs) is because they are ""lazy"".  When you say someone did something ""stupidly"", you're drawing the conclusion for the reader.  You're telling the reader what he should be thinking, rather than showing the reader what's happening and letting him figure it out on his own. It's much harder for an author to show the character doing the thing, and then the consequences, and doing it convincingly enough that it generates the same result: the reader figure out it was stupid.  But when done properly, the effect is a thousand times better than if you had just told the reader outright.  Instead of trying to remember for later, the reader knows now the conclusion he drew and won't forget it. Occasionally a detail is minor enough that you don't want to waste the time showing.  In that case, try to remove the detail completely.  Only if you can't remove it do you then want to tell the reader by using an adjective or adverb."
What's Essential In A Combat Scene?,"Combat scenes need to be written in a way to engage the reader. They should be more fast paced and emotional. You're not going to want to be describing every little bit of detail like you would in a slower-paced scene. The character isn't focused on the scenery or what's going on around him, he's focused on the fight. Sentences will be shorter and more compact and not include a lot of flowing details. You need to pick and choose your imagery so that your reader's heart is pounding in their chest and they can feel like they're in the fight. In a way, fight scenes are a lot like sex scenes. They need to be more engaging than the rest of the story or a reader will skip right over them. They should be emotional and full of feeling. You're going to want to make it easy for readers to visualize themselves in the action."
"How do you avoid smiling, head-bobbing characters?","If you have a happy fairy-tale story for young adults having a lot of smiling characters may be exactly what you want - a mostly happy world. If, on the other hand, you are writing a gritty thriller where the main goal is to show the psychological trauma of police officers dealing with the most gruesome parts of human nature you definitely don't want someone smiling every other page. Furthermore you might have a character who always smiles as a character trait. Maybe it's the nice guy who always helps out. Or the nice guy who is always smiling and turning into a horrible monster with a smile that shows way too many, way too sharp teeth. A smile that causes fear in everyone who sees it - for they know that it will be the last thing they will ever face in this world. Going only by word count is basically always a bad idea. There are too many factors to consider with this. Of course it can give you an idea of what to look at - you know what you are writing and what your characters are doing right now. But we don't know what characters and what story you are writing. And how far they are in their story. Maybe you are writing a really long book of a couple thousand pages in the end and this is merely the starting point where the world is still okay and happy and bright - the time before chaos turns everything upside down and nobody would ever smile again, for the smile of a person will cause horrible abominations to arise from the depths of the abyss with their only intention being to wipe the smile off of your characters face. They are making their victims listen to their eldritch speeches of how what they are doing is the best for everyone. Forcing them to nod - or be tortured. Though every nod and every half-smile will bring them closer to their untimely demise. For they sinned. Smiling is only for the powerful. To smile is to show power. And power belongs to those who are from the other side. Words can have vastly different meaning depending on their context and just because you have a smile every five pages doesn't mean that your characters are all happy. For you are the only one who can say whether it was a warm smile of gratitude or a dangerous smile of a wicked witch."
How do you cope with rejection?,"I'll give my two cents, as someone who feels the same struggles.  You'll never get completely over the fear of rejection, or of not being good enough. 
I say this because even accomplished authors reported the same fear. Brandon Sanderson said, in an episode of the podcast Writing Excuses, something along the likes of ""Yes, the last book was a success, but will they like the next one?"". But how would I really know if I am any good? I'm used - as you are - to get very positive feedbacks about my writing skills. And I asked a lot of people, in a lot of different times of my life, for different pieces. People usually say I'm good. But at the end of the day, it doesn't matter if I don't believe it myself.  The point is that you cannot trust completely external validation. It's nice and gratifying, but it can make you fall into a strange feedback loop, were you keep longing for more and more instant gratification of your skills. 
Being able to publish a book is not an index of success either, since (arguably) some published authors could have a far better writing style, some plots are flawed, some characters are shallow ... and yet they get published anyway.  My point is that while external validation and publishing achievements are surely important, they'll lose value if you don't believe in your own skills.  I'm not saying that you should be arrogant and think that you are the best writer out there - you probably aren't. But you shouldn't let self-doubt block you from writing either.  Again, it's fine to have moments of doubt, but don't let those dominate your (writing) life. I cannot stop writing.  Well, if that's true, you're in luck. Chances are you'll be writing anyway, so no need to worry. It's your time, it's up to you how you want to use it. If I have this right to ask unknown people to spent some hours of their lives with my books?  You can ask. It's in their right to say yes or no. Again, nothing bad with that."
How can one make technical issues more accessible to a non-technical audience?,"A non-technical test reader would be a helpful resource. Because of your knowledge you are blind for so many details, which you take for granted and couldn't believe that other do not know them. Listen to a test reader, what he does not understand, is the way to identify these blind spots. The problem with this approach: you need regularly new test readers, because the old ones know too much. Explaining terms at first use is a good thing. But don't forget a glossary where each term can be looked up. People tend to forget things, especially when they pause reading your book for one or two days. Oh, and you need an index. There are too many technical books out there without an index. Unbelievable."
How do you track random thoughts and ideas?,"I keep a good old fashion Moleskin notebook with me, one that is hard back so it can survive in my pocket (as well as a pen). It's useful not only for writes notes but for everything else I need to jot down while away from the computer. It also comes with a band to hold it closed, which is useful so I can keep cards in it and the like. There's also something satisfying about being about to pull the notebook out and open/close it with the snap of the elastic. "
What are some online guides for starting writers? [closed],"When I'm thinking about where I learned most how to write, I think that reading was the most important guide to me. This may sound silly, but by reading good written newspaper articles (facts, opinions, scientific articles and most of all, criticisms of films and music), I learned how others did the job, what works and what doesn't. In my own writing, I try to mimic other people's styles that I liked. Moreover, I learn new things by reading, giving me a broader background that I need when reflecting a certain topic. Every now and then I still read the free, local tabloid and recognize many mistakes I would have made when I would not have read quality material earlier in life. Of course there are books about journalistic writing and I read some (titles will be added later), but I guess that reading forms the best learning school until today. I now see that I didn't answer your actual question about online guides, but I hope it's helpful after all."
How to write a prophecy?,"As usually with all riddles, start from the end - what the prophecy describes. Write or at least plan thoroughly the story, leaving a placeholder where the prophecy has to go. Then sum up the events that are to be prophesized, actors involved, their role, the effects. Try to get that into about the size you want your prophecy to take. And then get to convoluting it. Start replacing names with metaphors, involving deeds or characteristics of the subjects involved. You may consider writing it as a rhymed riddle. Make sure to obfuscate, give it double meanings; good if the second meanings are deceiving - match both the actual subject and some completely different subject that still has a prominent place in the story. Depending if you want the prophecy, or a part of it to be understandable from moment one, involve factors that are already known at the time the prophecy is encountered. The parts that are to remain unclear should reference factors either not known to the reader at the time, or not yet fully understood. Nevertheless, spice it up with a few grains of clarity, something the reader can understand readily and grasp as obviously relevant - say, alternate name of a place, or an obvious, unique trait of a significant character. If the whole prophecy is a mystical mumbo-jumbo without a single good hint, it will not be attractive."
"Is there a more modern version of ""Acme"", as a common, generic company name?","There's always one. This site is a great list, but here are a few: And these are just for starters. Pick your niche group. I've actually heard people use Umbrella Corporation this way, so that specifically meets your requirements (and is why I put it first). PS: My initial reading of your question was that it was for a class, which would be unlikely to get you sued for using any of these names. If you are actually doing marketing, Laurel very aptly pointed out that they are likely coming with copyright and/or trademark issues that may make using them expensive or impossible. If so, you may want to go with more generic names that have a general connotation but no specific usage (like ""Global Consolidated Conglomerates Incorporated"")"
Writing in a Christian voice,"I'm a white Baptist who is married to a black Baptist, so if you have specific questions about the sort of things we say and do, maybe I can help. :-) What you describe is an example of a problem writers face all the time: How do I write a character whose background is very different from my own? Some advice I can think of that would apply here and to other ""different cultures"": Step 1: Recognize that not everyone in the world thinks the same way you do. I think you've grasped this or you wouldn't be asking the question. Different groups often have their own vocabulary. Sometimes this is technical language. When a physicist talks about ""energy"" he means something rather different than when a fitness trainer talks about ""energy"". Or in this context, Baptists (and other Christians) have many technical theological terms. Some have fancy names, like ""Dispensationalism"". Others are common English words to which Christians give more specific meanings than the general usage, like ""grace"" and ""save"". There are a few common words that Christians give totally different meanings, like ""rapture"".  I often get a chuckle out of the fact that when a group of Baptists get together to just eat or generally have a good time, what most people would call a ""party"", we call a ""fellowship"".  So you want your characters to talk like real members of the group. Like if two Baptists were discussing someone who recently converted to their religion, they almost certainly would NOT say, ""We successfully proselytized him yesterday"". They would probably say, ""He was saved yesterday."" But don't overdo it. I'm a software developer. I know lots of technical computer terms. But in casual conversations with friends and family, I almost never use technical computer terms. Even in conversations with fellow software developers, most of the conversation does not involve technical terminology. Every now I or a co-worker actually do say a sentence that is almost entirely technical terms, and I get a chuckle to myself about how incomprehensible that sentence would be to an outsider. Same thing with other groups. Yes, when I'm talking to fellow Baptists we use ""Baptist-speak"". But 90% of the conversation would be perfectly comprehensible to people who do not know our vocabulary. Especially avoid over-use of specialized language in generic contexts. Like I've seen many depictions of evangelical Christians in TV and movies where every other word is some religious reference, like they can't say ""bye, see you tomorrow"", but say something ""religious"" like, ""Godspeed, and may the Lord be with you until we meet again"". No, we just don't talk like that.  Find out what people really believe, and not what their opponents say they believe. To take a relevant example: I often see depictions of evangelical Christians where they are extremely judgemental, denouncing everyone around them as a sinner and preening about how much better they are than these other people. Maybe you could find some Christians who talk like that, but I've never met one. Not to get into a theological discussion, but one of the most basic teachings of evangelical Christianity is that all humans are sinners, and that the Christian's advantage is most definitely not that he is better than anyone else, but that he is forgiven. When a Baptist meets a prostitute or a drug dealer or whatever, he does not say, ""Get a way from me, I don't want to be contaminated by you low-lifes"". He is far more likely to say, ""Let me tell you how God forgave me for my sins and he can do the same for you."" Or on a much lighter note, I just read somewhere, I forget where, a Christian noted that when someone visits a priest or minister on a TV show, they always seem to meet in the sanctuary of the church, and the minister addresses them as ""my son"" or ""my daughter"". In real life, ministers have offices that look pretty much like the office of any professional, and they call people by their names just like everyone else. But aside from these sort of generalities and examples, how do you deal with all the practical details? Others have suggested reading books written by Christians. Definitely so. Especially novels, that might give you more of the day to day than a non-fiction book. Ideally, talk to real Christians. You mentioned that you had some Christian friends or associates who read your drafts. Ask them for specific flaws. Not just, ""This character doesn't talk like a real Baptist"", but what's wrong with her speech, exactly? Can you point to a few sentences that are examples of things a Baptist would be unlikely to say, and tell me what they would say in those circumstances?"
How to tactfully inform readers of differences in the book world to the real world?,"As the wagon bounced along the rutted road, Prax was objecting to Lis's notion that they should both run away to start a new life in the city. ""I can think of seven reasons that won't work,"" Prax said, holding up all seven fingers of his right hand. Curling in his outer thumb, he said, ""First, we've never been to the city, and we have no idea if it's actually as exciting as they say."" Folding up his inner thumb, he continued, ""Second, neither of us has any Platinum of our own, and I've heard everything in the city costs Platinum."" Finally, he curled in his five fingers, ""And reasons three through seven, we have papa, mama, Calli, Adra, and little Gana.  We'd be leaving them all alone if we ran off."""
Is it wrong to use the same word multiple times within a few sentences?,"I think it weakens the prose, unless it is clearly intentional (""he had a big head, big teeth, a big nose, a big attitude."") In your example, ""sleek"" is not a very precise description, to me. The very fact that you apply it to both a building and a door suggests that lack of precision. You can actually replace both of them with actual description of what makes them ""sleek"". Those descriptions would likely be different for a building and a door. It isn't always about word choice, but sometimes about the choice to use one word instead of several, when several would convey the idea better. What makes doors ""sleek""? Are they smooth and featureless? Is their fit so precise that they join to the building and each other seamlessly? Do they have hidden hinges so they almost appear to not be doors at all? Are they rounded instead of rectangular? Do they have recessed handles? "
Dead parents: something to avoid?,"Young protagonists are often presented as orphans, because it gives a plausible reason they might be fending largely for themselves.  For adults, on the other hand, there are many possible other reasons parents might be offstage --many books about adults simply never mention the parents. However, loss of parents is probably the most devastating, emotionally-fraught experience that nearly all people might reasonably expect someday to experience in a normal life without any unusual tragedies, so it's very relatable and of intrinsic interest, even for people who still have both parents.  For that reason, it offers a lot of storytelling possibilities, which I think justifies your decision. As far as parental backstory --most of us continue to relate very egocentrically to our parents, even after we grow up.  We are only dimly aware of their lives outside of us.  So I think it's OK, as a choice, to focus only on the parent's relationship with the protagonist.  But on the other hand, learning about who your parents are as people, outside of you, can be one of the more interesting experiences of growing up.  So that can also offer possibilities if you want to explore them.  Ultimately, there's no definitive answer, there's only what does and does not serve your book and where you want it to go."
"Everyone has a book in them, but in most cases that’s where it should stay. Does that apply to me?","I think this is an incredibly important and valuable question, because I hear it all the time from many of my friends. They aren't writers or authors, and they have limited professional training or experience in writing, but they have a book in them that is screaming to get out, and they need to put it on paper and bring it out into the world. They have a story that needs to be told, whether it be a fictional story, a fantasy world they've been building, or just a story from their life. But I think the question you might have is, how do you do it? Will anybody read it? How can you just... make a book with no training or experience whatsoever? And even if you do decide to write a draft, it's going to be terrible and no one will want to read it, right? When it comes to this book that's crying out to get out of you, I think you might be asking yourself, would anybody even care? I'd like to digress for a moment to tell you a story. My grandfather passed away when I was in high school. Before he passed, he always talked about his life and his experiences - fighting for his country, being in the Boy Scouts, growing up in a tough part of the world and learning important lessons. I loved his stories because he was a man who had seen so much, and lived a rich and beautiful life. After he was gone, I suddenly realized that all of his stories, all of his life experiences, even if we all remembered them secondhand... all of his firsthand accounts had died with him. There was nobody left to tell his stories, except for us. He wasn't a writer, but he had always talked about wanting to write a book about his life, all of his stories, so that we could read about them someday. He never got the chance to do that in life, and we always regretted that he didn't. If there's a story that is crying out to get out of you, write it. Just make a draft. It's okay if it's bad, or if nobody else ever sees it. It's okay if you feel like you are not a good writer, and that people will hate it. You are putting something out into the world that you love and treasure and that people will value not for its quality, but because it came from you. My partner is not the best poet in the world, he freely admits it, but I don't care. I love reading his poems anyway because they come from him. You don't even have to publish it. Write it for you. It doesn't have to be for anyone else. And if you learn a lot from writing it, then you can always come back and write it again! You're not forbidden from writing the same story twice! If you're worried about wasting your best idea on a terrible first draft, don't be. You will learn so much from writing that terrible draft one that you'll want to write draft two and make it even better. The love for the story won't die just because you wrote an awful version of it. Obviously, since you are a first-time writer, you are going to have a lot to learn. You should absolutely attend seminars, take classes, learn the art of writing, and study as much as you can. Read, read, read, and learn from what good authors do well. To fully tell your story in the way you want to tell it, you'll have to learn how to write well and communicate effectively in narrative form, and that's a lot harder to master than it seems.

Do most novels not get published?,"Anyone who actively pursues publication can get published. Sometimes it can happen easily, other times it may take month or even years. Just because it's well written and is a decent novel, doesn't mean every publisher wants it. It may not be right for some publishers, and others may not think they can market a certain novel well. But if you keep trying, eventually someone will give you a shot. Sometimes you need to put that novel away for a while and work on another one; maybe that one will have better chances. The trick is to try your best and never give up. Make sure your novel is well written, make sure you're querying the correct publishers, make sure you're being professional, and make sure you do your homework."
"How to avoid constantly starting paragraphs with ""The character did this"" ""The character did that""?","This seems to be an increasingly common problem and my belief is that it results from the writer consciously or unconsciously seeing the movie in his head and trying to transfer it to the page. Thus they give what are essentially stage directions at every verse end.  To break this habit, you have to remember that a novel is not a movie. A movie is, in some sense at least, a complete experience. The viewer's major senses are saturated with sound and visual action. There is certainly some room for the viewer to fill in the gaps, but not nearly so much as there is in a novel. A novel works far more by suggestion than by saturation. Providing all the details of a scene that a movie can pack into a single shot would be tedious and exhausting in a novel where the reader cannot take them all in at a glance but must read every detail one at a time and gradually integrate them into a complete picture.  Novelists seldom go into that much detail, and when they do, it is done as scene setting, and the novel then relies on the reader's memory while the action unfolds in front of the scene that has been painted. (Indeed, the extent to which a novel relies on memory is perhaps the greatest thing that sets prose storytelling apart from movie storytelling.)  The big difference between movie and page is that a movie has both a background and a foreground. A novel only has a foreground. A movie can draw the reader's attention to one element of a complex scene. A novel calls the reader's attention to each word in turn. When you visualize a scene, you visualize background details, but if you describe them, they become foreground, not background, which scatters the focus that the reader should have in a scene. This is why most dialogue in novels is just dialogue, with no actions described at all. It keeps the focus on the dialogue.  But for the most part, the novelist never does rely on painting a complete scene. Instead, they rely on the use of telling details to draw images from the reader's own mind, or they dispense with the need to paint a scene at all and focus on other aspects of the human experience, dispensing with a painted backdrop altogether.  I don't want to go as far as some would and encourage you to drop descriptions altogether. That is going too far and description is an essential part of the novel. But description is done largely through suggestion and relies hugely on memory (which is why it is hard to lift a novel out of its cultural context). But resist the urge to describe every motion, to act out the scene in your head. The novel is not the right media for that kind of storytelling. Novels are, to a much greater extent than movies, a medium of ideas rather than raw experience and your focus should be on the ideas that your characters are discussing and acting upon, rather than on the details of their movements or the backdrop they move against.

How to construct a technical tutorial when the user can't verify the results after each step?,"There is not really much you can do in a situation like this other than to clearly alert the reader to the situation up front. If there is no way to verify the next five actions until you have completed all of them, put a warning in big shiny letters saying: WARNING: The next five steps must all be completed correctly before you can test the result.  That way the reader know what to expect and is not taken by surprise. Not letting the reader get taken by surprise is 90% of the battle here, and the best way to do that is simply to tell them in advance about anything that may be unusual or out of the ordinary.  One thing you might consider doing to further clarify this it to develop a regular step structure in which each step has a action followed by a verification action.  Step 1:
    Action: Push the big red button.
    Validation:  Check that the little green light is on.  Then when you have multiple actions before a step can be verified, combine them into one step: Step 2:
  Action:
  1. Eat
  2. Pray
  3. Love
  Validation: Check soul for bliss.  This establishes a pattern for the reader, giving them correct expectations about when validation is possible. But still use the warning, because explicit is better than implicit: Step 2:
  Warning: All steps must be completed before bliss can be achieved.
  Action:
  1. Eat
  2. Pray
  3. Love
  Validation: Check soul for bliss. "
How do you write boy & girl protagonists without turning them into a love story?,"I have and have always had many close female friends. I don't see what's so special or ""difficult"" about these relationships, they function just like any friendship I have with a man or boy. If you want to write about a male-female friendship, then just write a male-female friendship. No, I don't constantly wonder whether or not I would like to have sex with my female friends. There are some, where that thought would never cross my mind, not because I find them unattractive, but because they are the kind of person that I don't feel sexual about. There are some that I would want as a sexual partner, but either they already have a partner or they don't feel that way about me, so that matter is settled for me and I no longer need to wonder. It's like deciding to spend the holiday in Italy instead of France: while in Italy, you don't constantly think about France, that would be dysfunctional. Instead you enjoy being where you are. So not lusting after someone you cannot have is simply the healthy way of being, and not difficult at all, unless you are the difficult kind of person. Of course some of the things my female friends and me discuss pertain to our mutual genders, like asking for feedback on hair styles or getting a ""male"" or ""female"" perspective on a topic, but generally gender or sex don't enter into these friendships at all. We even sleep side-by-side chastely sometimes, and we hug a lot (like I do with my male friends). If you write about a boy and a girl who are not romantically inclined towards each other, then write just that. It is not a relationship where a topic has to be avoided, but a relationship where a topic simply does not arise. Would you have to explain why two boys are friends instead of lovers? No. So why do you have to explain that about a boy and a girl? Lauren suggested this edit to my answer: ""Would you have to explain why two gay boys are friends instead of lovers? No. So why do you have to explain that about a straight boy and a straight girl?"" (Italics are mine, to indicated the edits.) I rejected that suggestion, because I mean something different: When we read about two boys (or two girls) being friends, we expect them to have no sexual or romantic interest in each other, because that is how these relationships were portrayed for centuries and how the heterosexual majority of the population live their friendships. These kinds of friendships are the norm, and we see nothing strange or problematic in them. What we do find strange, abnormal and expect to cause problems are mixed gender friendships, because we cannot imagine them to be non-sexual. For some reason we feel that a boy and a girl must be about sex. But if you observe yourself, I am sure you will realize that you do not feel sexual about all people with the sex or gender you are oriented towards. Sex is not something that a heterosexual man must feel for all women (or a gay man for all men or a hetero woman for all men etc.). Sexuality is something that you feel for individuals, not for a category – or, if you want, the category is more complexly defined that by gender alone. So just because sex would be possible for a heterosexual by with a girl does not mean that it is possible for him with this specific individual. As writers, we don't need to fall into the trap of thinking in categories. There is no such thing as ""all men"" or ""all women"" or ""all English"" or ""all dark skinned persons"" etc. People within these categories are as varied as between categories, so sex between one specific boy and one specific girl is as optional and likely as them having the same size of shoes or the same taste in music: they may or may not have it, and if they do have different shoe sizes or musical tastes you don't need to mention it in your story, unless your story is about that difference."
How do I promote a self-published book?,"The fact that you have never seen an ad for a book should tell you something. Advertising doesn't sell books. If advertizing sold books, you would see lots of advertisements for books, because publishers would do what works. (As the comments indicate, publishers do certain amounts of targeted advertising in some markets. Nothing so far indicates that ads help an unknown self published novel, however.) What does sell books? I'm no expert, but as far as I can tell, it comes down to word of mouth, hand selling, and bookstore placement. Word of mouth happens when a few people read you book, love it, and tell their friends, who then tell their friends, etc. etc. You only need a few initial readers to spark a word of mouth expansion, but you also need a really good book. (There are stories of books that languished unnoticed for years before a word of mouth expansion suddenly vaulted them to prominence.) Hand selling means that someone -- the author or a bookseller -- personally talks up the book to a customer, usually in a book store, but possibly in another venue (I have hand sold my technical books at industry conferences). Hand selling a book yourself is, of course, incredibly expensive and time consuming and is only really going to pay off if the book gains enough momentum to start a word of mouth expansion and to inspire hand selling by book sellers.  Bookstore placement means that your book gets on the rack at the front of the store, gets placed on an end cap, or turned face out on the shelf -- anything to make it more noticeable to a reader who is just browsing with no clear idea in mind of who or what they are looking for. You get bookstore placement by being published by a major publisher with a lot of clout with bookstores who is willing to promote your work through their sales channels. In other words, if you self publish, you don't get bookstore placement (except maybe from your local independent bookstore if you chat up the owner). There is also reviews in prominent publications, Oprah's book club, and the major literary prizes. But a self-published book is not likely to get within a country mile of any of those. The major publishing houses own the pipelines to those places. You would need to already be a major self-publishing success story to even have a chance of being looked at by any of these.  When it comes to seeding your word of mouth campaign on social media, I don't think the necessarily costs you anything more than time, but my impression is that you are more likely to succeed in pitching your book to your already established social media following than you are to build a following around the book itself, at least until the book itself, or you as an author, already have an established reputation.  In short, if you want to be successful self publishing, I think you have to be prepared to do a lot of hand selling. And, of course, you have to write an exceptionally good book."
How do you get out of your own psychology to write characters?,"I think there are two steps: 1. Decide the character's philosophy of life I'm using the example of two medieval characters because that's my settings of choice. Imagine we need two female characters: Eleonor is the lady of the manor and Mary is her twice-removed cousin (from a poorer branch of the family) who lives with her as a lady-in-waiting. As the lady of the manor, Eleonor exerts strict authority over all who live in her property while her husband is away. Her authority comes from her husband, naturally (God did create the woman to be under her husband's authority). She has a good relation with her husband, but she's aware she's lucky and there are many women who are not as lucky. That means that the men in question are at fault and such wives should be helped if possible - but that would enver be an excuse for a wife to try and escape her lord and master! Mary is aware she is a poor relative and is indebted to her older cousin and lady: all she has comes from her, after all. On the other hand, Eleonor is a kind soul and they both enjoy spending time together, with Mary helping her in what she can. She does have ambitions: to marry a worthy nobleman, for example, even if she wouldn't be so bold as to ask for someone above her position. In fact, that might be a bad option, as her husband's family would dismiss and even despise her for being below their standing. 2. Get inside their shoes It is all very well to determine the character's philosophy in keeping with their times. But now it's time to write... and the author's feelings cannot shine through. Let us start with Eleonor. First step: Take a deep breath and close your eyes. You are no longer J. Doe: you are Lady Eleonor. Sit straight and level your head. With your eyes closed, visualise your garden (or wherever you are). Try and feel the air (hot or cold, dry or damp?), the smells, feel the dress pooling around your ankles. Second step: Begin the scene. Lady Eleonor smiled at her eight year old son, playing with the little servant boy. Her husband had brought the little boy as a slave from his latest battle against the Muslim Kingdom of Granada. !!! Modern sensibility comes in: Slaves and religious intolerance. Yeah. Perfectly in tune with the times, I'm afraid. Harden yourself: having slave muslims was ok in medieval Europe (and common enough in the southern kingdoms). They could be black, dark skinned or perfectly white - it didn't matter. It was normal. Because Eleonor is a likeable character, her only concern will be about having the boy well-treated... according to his station. Resume: ""Mark,"" she called sharply when the little boy stuck a dirty finger in his nose. ""That is not appropriate behaviour."" Slave or not, if he was to be a play companion of her son, he must behave courteously. But enough of play time! It was time for her son's lessons and she still had much work to do with little Mark. She'd had him baptised as soon as possible and was now making sure he understood the fundaments before Father Matthew started teaching him some Latin. Let us move on to Mary. First step: Take a deep breath and close your eyes. You are no longer J. Doe: you are Mary. Sit straight and turn your head slightly downwards. Once more, visualise everything around you. Second step: Begin the scene. Through the window of Lady Eleonor's chambers, Mary sees the young men honing their warrior skills. One of the younger ones, thinner than the rest, is once more being swarmed. !!! Modern sensibility comes in: the boy is being bullied and Mary, as a sympathetic character, is going to decry and try to help him. Take a step back: while it's perfectly acceptable for the character to think that swarming is unfair, she would never dream of interfering: it would be humilliating to have a woman come in to his defense, and, as a woman, she has no right to meddle. Come to think of it, it would be natural for her to assume that being so often 'swarmed' was an appropriate way to help him improve, something like 'tough love'. Resume! He was desperately outnumbered and, from what Mary could see, he was bound to end the practice all bruised. It upset her to see the scene - to her female eyes, the older boys seemed so violent! - but she was sure John would improve quickly. At least she hoped so. If only his father had wished him to become a clergyman... He was far more skilled at writing! Last Resort Options If fighting off modern sensibility is difficult, try to make parallels with something that is natural for you. You should also hang on as hard as you can to the logic that makes something evil nowadays an acceptable option at the time. Torture, for example. Try to get inside the character and see torture as a sort of truth serum. Yes, you as the author know that torture doesn't guarantee truth as a person will say anything to stop it, but still, as the character, you know they would never own to that murder if they hadn't been tortured and everyone knows the criminal was the one who did it. On the other hand, your character may feel that torture is only appropriate when one knows for sure who did the evil deed, and they may also feel that some types of torture are a bit too cruel. If the lack of female freedom enrages you, hold on to that rage and turn it around: now what enrages you is those people who defile marriage. Those people destroy the community and bring down God's wrath on everyone! Sodom and Gomorrah, remember? Better yet, do not focus on what women cannot do; focus on what they can do. If a woman can't choose her husband, what can she do to have some control? Maybe she can talk to her mother and see if she can put in a good word (at least to avoid someone she despises). Or maybe it's out of her hands and all she can do is... flirt a little behind her parents' back while she's still single. Forcing a raped girl to marry her rapist sounds evil? Then keep in mind that to not do so means she will end up in prostitution. Maybe she'll end up murdered or sick. Her body sullied, her soul lost, and her honour destroyed. Yes, it is unfair, but far worse would be to not force that man to compensate her in the only possible. Do not try to counter the logic and arguments of the past using your current knowledge, but if you must counter some ideas, use the arguments of the time. There were a couple of medieval saints who preached against the husbands who beat their wives, so being a medieval person doesn't mean that everyone agrees with domestic violence. Of course, violence at the time meant something far more drastic than nowadays: slapping the wife on occasion wasn't the problem, but beating her till she was unconscious was definitely not seen with good eyes. While what I wrote focuses a lot on medieval times, the same is valid for any culture. Get inside that culture and find out how people think and feel. Remember that 'People are ok with X' doesn't mean that everyone in that culture accepts it whole-heartedly. Even if the problematic worldview is not about a culture but a person - an abusive partner, for example - the author still has to understand how the character thinks and feels. Read accounts of real people (both abusers and abused) and understand their logic. Then get inside the characters' shoes and do not let your own consciousness slip onto the text Remember: you are not J. Doe, the author. You are that character and their logic must come to the fore until the scene is written. Close your eyes and feel yourself become someone else."
Publishing for Kindle,"I'm a huge fan of self-publication and small-press publication, and I think the stigma attached to both is fading.  (It's worth noting that my only experience being published is non-fiction with a big publisher, but a girl's gotta start somewhere, and I do a lot with self-publishers in my job as head of a web development shop focused on small business.) Self-publishing is viable now in a way it never was before, because: Distribution channels for literature are more centralized than ever.  While you used to have relationships with thousands of book stores and small chains across the country to get any notice, now once you are in one or more of the big listings you will be on Amazon.com, Borders, and Barnes and Noble's web sites before long. You used to have to shell out big $$$ to do large print runs.  Now, electronic publishing and one-off printing let you limit your up-front costs to whatever it takes to write, edit, lay out, create cover art for, and advertise your book. Advertising used to mean big $$$ and relationships to put together print ads, TV commercials, and radio spots.  Now, a professional-looking web site, a good social media strategy, and giving away a copy or two on Goodreads will get your foot in the door. In short, the gap between ""self publishing"" and traditional publishing is closing. Some tips you should know: Invest in a professional website, whether just for you as an author, or putting your work out under a small press name.  You can start with something as simple as a blog and expand from there, but people need to know where to go to find you and your latest work. In addition to selling via the big eBook outlets, offer sale of DRM-free (but watermarked, if you like) ebooks in multiple formats on your web site and/or through outlets specializing in DRM-free ebooks.  There are a growing number of ebook consumers who are tired of DRM, and their desired rate of consumption, at least in the fiction market, is far higher than the supply serving them. Learn how to leverage social media: Goodreads, Facebook, Twitter, Identi.ca, your own blog's RSS feed, etc. to promote your work. Use a print-on-demand service (I like Lulu.com) to offer print copies -- it doesn't cost you anything and not everyone reads ebooks.   Don't be afraid to pound the pavement.  If you are doing tech writing, speak at a conference.  If you are writing YA fiction, offer to spring for popcorn and do a reading at a local school or youth center.  If you are writing any fiction, talk to local bookstores about doing a reading and/or book signing (most love promoting local authors when they believe in the work). Give away a copy or three to people (Goodreads is a good channel for this) to get those first good reviews on Goodreads, Amazon, etc. Spend time on great layout and typesetting.  You can do it yourself, and there are plenty of free, open-source software and fonts to help you.  If your book is hard to read, it doesn't matter how good a read it is, it won't get popular. Once your books hit Amazon, etc. make sure to go back and click the ""I am the publisher"" option to get your book and author info in shape. Hope that helps"
Which words should not be capitalized in Title Case?,"If you are referring to ""title case,"" where some words are capitalized and some aren't, there is no one standard rule.  The AP stylebook says: But the Chicago Manual of Style says: Use lowercase for articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, for, nor), and prepositions, regardless of length, unless they are the first or last word of the title. Wikipedia has a list of different ways title case can be applied. I tend to follow the second version in that list.   Note that some people prefer using ""sentence case"" in titles, where you only capitalize words as you would in a normal sentence. This is also known as ""Down style."" Apparently this is more typical in the UK than the USA, but opinions vary (as you might expect) on which is the correct form, or if there is even one."
How to tell readers that I know my story is factually incorrect?,"I simply let my character survive a wound that he shouldn't have survived, and then left a note at the bottom about what would have really happened. As a reader, this would break my immersion and ruin the story, everything after that is BS, I know it, the author knows it, and did it anyway.  Change the plot point.  Change the injury to something crippling (for the moment) but survivable.  Make it so the injury isn't what the character thought it was.  Make the character recognize the gravity of the injury and do something about it, to make it non-fatal. Invent another character to prevent the hero from dying, even if you have to write 10,000 words. Or, as a last resort, just don't tell us. This is fiction, an entertainment, so take the liberty without apologizing for it. If 10% of readers call BS on it, you still entertained 90% of them. Stop worrying about ""justification"" or your ""integrity"" or ""honesty"". Yes, I'd like my fiction to be plausible; and I would probably choose to rewrite, but I don't expect deep plausibility in fiction that will withstand any level of research. IRL I am a scientist, but I do not expect readers to take my fiction as literal truth, I don't expect my fiction to withstand close scientific scrutiny. You just need some surface plausibility, or as we call it in science, ""hand-waving"" justifications a reader can accept without much thought, and read on. Don't let your ego get in the way of writing an entertaining story."
Is it wrong if I kill off a black character?,"Killing a minority character isn't a problem in itself. The problem is that western media (particularly film) has a long tradition of killing of minority characters and leaving white protagonists to complete the plot.  It is a habit that is rooted in racism, and not one that you want to add weight to without due consideration.  Now, if this character's ethnicity is an important part of their character, and their death is an important part of the plot then by all means continue. Just last week I read a story by Seanan McGuire (the story itself will remain nameless to avoid spoilers) where the first death was a minority character, and McGuire is extremely conscious of minority representation. But the character's minority status played an important part in shaping the part of her character that got her killed, and the story would not have worked quite right any other way.  On the other hand if the ethnicities of your characters are less deeply imbedded in their personalities then try switching them around a bit, and see what happens. In Summary: Even if a plotting/character decision which is made completely isolated from any racist impulses it can still add weight to external racist trends.  If you can avoid inadvertently supplementing racism this way without sacrificing your story, then definitely do so."
How can I handle a powerful mentor character without killing them off?,"In Avatar, the Last Airbender, Uncle Iroh is a powerful and interesting mentor character (with his own complex arc).  He has his role of providing advice for Toph, and maybe a little for Aang - but he's primarily the mentor for the show's first antagonist.  He's interested in seeing the Avatar be successful, but he's more interested in seeing success and happiness for his nephew, who thinks he needs to capture the Avatar. And at the great cataclysmic end, Iroh has a role which completes his own arc, but which takes him in a different direction than either Aang, or his nephew. In Lord of the Rings, Gandalf is the wise mentor character, but besides shepherding hobbits or dwarfs here and there, he's got to manage the affairs of wizards and kingdoms, and is commonly called away for other issues, or temporarily put out of commission by balrogs. If your world is bigger than your story, your mentor can easily be too busy to always step in and solve your protagonist's problems"
"I feel like people would mock me for trying to become an author at 12, what should I do?","I would say go for it! If you have the possibility of contacting a ""proper author,"" there's no reason not to. If they get back to you or someone from their office does, that would be a huge help to you. And no offense, but if they don't get back to you, they probably won't remember you either so there's nothing to be embarrassed about. There's really no risk in it. Additionally, I would say just keep writing. Your first piece probably won't be perfect, but you can still get feedback on it from communities like this and even from publishers if you decide to submit your work to them. Either way, there's no reason to stop writing."
"Should I avoid ""big words"" when writing to a younger audience?","I think the answer is that it's a matter of quantity and proportion so the reader doesn't lose their flow or end up missing something important if they just keep reading, and also of giving the reader the chance to guess the meaning from context, so they have the opportunity to learn the word without having to look it up. I remember reading a book when I was a child that introduced the word unanimous, though it did it in a very overt way, where the character was told the meaning of it, then used it to their great pride later in the story. There may have been places where they used it wrong to comedy effect, as well. I did not know the meaning of the word before, and I've never forgot it since. Obviously that's a bit heavy handed for too many words, but you can often make the meaning clear through context, e.g. ""Three cowries?"" she cried. ""There's no way it's worth that much!"" Most people will understand that in this context 'cowries' means some form of currency. If you can try to do this with advanced vocabulary in your writing for young people, there's a good chance you will be doing a great service to help them increase their vocabulary range. However, even if you just drop in a handful of 'difficult' words throughout the novel without giving any hints, I don't think it would cause any great concern to children, who, in my experience, have a great skill in filtering out things they don't understand right now and carrying on with their day. The problem will only come if there are so many words they don't know that they end up distanced, disengaged and bored. In case you haven't come across them, I thought I'd mention that there are quite a few estalished readability formulas, where you can analyse your text for generally accepted readability levels for different ages. Here is one, though if other people have links to better ones, they would be very welcome: https://www.webfx.com/tools/read-able/"
Are reactive protagonists inherently a bad thing?,"I'd say the question of Active vs. Reactive hero is as much a question of how you present events, as of what is actually happening. Let me give you an example: Frodo, the main character of the wildly successful Lord of the Rings, can hardly be said to have actively chosen the quest of the Ring. His initial reaction to learning what he has in his hands and what must be done with it is 'I do really wish to destroy it!' cried Frodo. 'Or, well, to have it destroyed. I am not made for perilous quests. I wish I had never seen the Ring! Why did it come to me?' (J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, book I, chapter 2 - The Shadow of the Past) ""I wish the world to be saved, preferably by someone else"". After which, he immediately offers the Ring to Gandalf. And later he offers it to Aragorn, and to Galadriel - anyone who might be, in his opinion, ""better suited"" to the quest. As long as there's a Gandalf or an Aragorn to follow, Frodo is content to follow - let someone else lead him to the end of his quest. Once he's alone, it turns out he hasn't spent too much time looking at maps, trusting Gandalf to lead him. Not exactly a pro-active attitude, is it? But every single time Frodo is offered a chance to turn aside and abandon his quest: on Caradhras, on Amon Hen, he chooses, actively chooses to go on doggedly with this quest he never wanted. You could say that the situation has been forced on Frodo, and he merely reacts to it. It's not much of a choice, is it, if the alternative is watching the world go up in flames? But at the same time, Frodo's choice, his decision, is active. Where everybody else chooses ""sorry, I can't"", Frodo chooses ""I will"". Which is both a heroic and a realistic situation, if you think about it. Which brings me to what I've been trying to say: the situation in which your protagonist finds himself in can be entirely forced on him. But within the situation he finds himself in, the protagonist needs to be making active choices. The choice to go on must be an active one, the alternative needs to be considered, if only to be discarded. The protagonist should be at least somewhat proactive in trying to achieve his goal, even if the goal was thrust upon him, and he would let others do as much as possible. To achieve this, offer your protagonist chances to turn aside, strip him gradually of help, force him to act. He doesn't need to be the kind of character who permanently seeks to be active - a situation that would pull him out of his comfort zone would do that. The moment he's actively answering questions like ""whether to proceed"", and ""how to proceed"", he's active. A simple example: running away from a collapsing building is a reaction. Helping someone else is a choice. Figuring out how to get out - also a choice. It's all about how you frame it. (And yeh, everybody who's been explaining about how it's important that the protagonist reads as active - I agree completely.)"
Mixing humour with horror in fiction,"Horror works on building tension. Humour breaks it. On the face of it, you've got two cardinally opposed directions here. How do you mix the two? First, there's gallows humour. Gallows humour doesn't undermine the dark tone of the situation. If anything - it drives it home. At the same time, there's strength in being able to laugh at a hard situation, which is why people resort to it. You can use the notion of gallows humour, and take it one step further, turning your whole story into dark comedy. Such a work, I think, would be at least a little surreal - the sharp juxtaposition of funny and horrifying becoming the reality in which you write. As a final, brilliant example, I would point you towards Roberto Benigni's film La Vita è Bella. It is a comedy. About a Jewish family in a concentration camp. It is funny and chilling at the same time, and there's more heart in it than in any Holocaust movie I can think of. Where Schindler's List and The Pianist leave me somewhat overloaded, La Vita è Bella invariably makes me cry - it's softer tome penetrates deeper.
How does Benigni do it? Gallows humour is self-aware: both the person telling the joke, and the person hearing it are aware of the horror. As such, it is usually cynical. Benigni avoids this cynicism entirely, instead presenting us with a father who tries to hide the meaning of what's going on from his child. The tension, the danger - it's always there. And in the face of it, there's the father being a clown. And each time you laugh, you also know he's just put himself and the child in that much more danger - you don't get to laugh at the Nazis. So, you have the humorous situation building tension, instead of breaking it like it usually does."
Is it necessary to use chapters for fiction?,"The benefit of using chapters isn't related to the storytelling, but rather to the comfort of the reader. It provides an easily identifiable break in the story. If a reader needs to put down their book, they will generally prefer to do so between two separate scenes; as opposed to mid-scene or even mid-conversation.  If you leave the story mid-conversation, you need to remember what you have already read (in order to be able to pick it up again). Chapter breaks, however, signal to the reader that this is a break point which minimizes the need for remembering specific details. Imagine if a theatre play would go to intermission mid-conversation. And when the intermission is over, they would pick up where they left off. Many people would struggle with getting back up to speed with the conversation that was halted.
While the issue is less pressing for book readers compared to a theatre crowd (you can re-read a page, you can't ask the actors to rewind the play), the issue remains the same. Secondly, chapter breaks also make the text appear more reader-friendly. To showcase this point; tell me whether you found A, B or C easier to read.

Chapters break the story into chunks that are more easily digestable. They serve the same purpose as paragraphs and punctuation, but on a larger scale. Are they necessary? Maybe not. But their absence is likely to negatively impact a reader's opinion about your book and how well it reads. As another answer has mentioned; it doesn't need to be chapters. The black line in the Discworld novel serves the same purpose, without technically being called a chapter. I would argue that the sole benefit of having chapters start on a new page is to make it easier to spot the beginning and end of chapters, as well as making page-indexing a bit clearer."
"Painting ritualistic murder in a ""good-guy"" light?","How can I make this leap? The MC needs proof he cannot deny. Perhaps, by his own hand, he doesn't just shun them, he takes action to prevent this ritualistic murder from happening. What are the consequences of that? There better be some consequences, or these ritual murders are not accomplishing a damn thing! But there are consequences, weird consequences that cause extreme pain or even death to innocents, perhaps to children. And the weirdest thing about these consequences are that they are precisely what the ""good guys"" told the MC would happen; and they are too magical or weird for the good guys to have done this harm themselves. In short, the MC believes this is proof the good guys were right. Once he knows that, he can still try to squirm and see if there is any other way to prevent the consequences without having to commit torture and murder. Perhaps that is part of the plot, him trying and failing to find an alternative (or eventually trying and succeeding). But the turning point is accomplished; at this point the MC has left his ""normal world"" and believes the good guys are on balance doing good, and he needs to join them. How long all of this takes depends on whether you have a bigger plot in mind. Just the conversion of the MC could be a story, but it could also be a short intro into a larger story if he has a bigger problem than this to solve. The question was how to move the MC from seeing the killings as necessary, into participating in the killings. But the answer is the same, it is still by showing the consequences of NOT killing. He thinks it is necessary? Then invent a reason that makes him the only one that can do it. One or more of the good guys dies, or gets incarcerated or otherwise taken out of the picture, so there isn't enough of them to safely capture and kill a criminal. Your MC has to step in, or the consequences kick in. Force an emergency on him. If he truly believes the killings are necessary, he will blame himself for whatever innocents suffer if he doesn't step up when he is needed."
Creating an incompetent antagonist,"You're concerned about things being ""unfulfilling if I simply make the Empire regularly make mind-boggling logical errors"". And you're absolutely right. It will be unfulfilling if they make mind-boggling errors. But the emphasized point is important. It's only unfulfilling if it's mind-boggling to the reader. Which suggests an obvious answer: don't just have deus ex machina stupidity, but make sure that the reader understands why the empire makes the errors. Which is to say, you can't have the empire make ""logical errors"" - at least from their own perspective. Sure, from the perspective of the omniscient narrator they can make some obvious howlers, but from the perspective of the Empire and the people in it, there should be a clear rationale. The reader might not 100% agree that they would make the same mistakes if they were in the same situation, but they should at least understand why the people in the empire made the mistakes they did. The ""stupidity"" shouldn't come out of nowhere. You're already have a good base for this -- the Empire is stolid, fossilized and over-confident in their position. They're inefficient and wasteful. Like practically everyone else, they've bought into their own propaganda and aren't considering that there's anything that they can't handle. When they do act, they're overconfident and do it dismissively. A good way to present understandable mistakes is to get into the mindset that the Empire isn't filled with idiots, but instead is filled with people who are acting rationally, but in pursuit of goals which are different from ""crush the rebellion at all costs"".  For example, take the military leader for a raid on the rebel's compound. If he was concerned about crushing the rebellion, he might have very different tactics. But he isn't concerned about the rebels. (After all, how would rebels be an actual threat to the glory of the empire?) Instead he's concerned about promotion and glory. Which in today's Empire means boldly marching in full dress uniforms to the front of the rebel's hideout and making their presence known - not skulking up in the middle of the night and having plain clothes officers covering the back entrances."
What is a subtle way of mentioning a man became physically aroused?,"Don't mention the erection at all. As he is about to be smothered in breasts, switch to descriptions of everything he is using to mentally distract himself from having a sexual reaction.  Perhaps, make it more of a ""battle"", attacking one of his senses at a time. First the image of her breasts up close which he fights back with other visual imagery that is very un-breastlike. Then as he seems to have that won, his next battle is her smell which is layers of feminine things like soap and powders. He battles this back with memories of foul smells. Last it is the feeling of contact, skin to skin, and he has to knock it away with very un-sexual human contact. (Bonus points if the replacement objects resonate thematically or have character-arc significance.) After this epic battle of his senses – which of course was just a few seconds but in his mind lasted an eternity, the reader can get a hint of how well it worked the same way he will know. He ""adjusts"" how he is sitting."
Help! My Character is too much for her story!,"My approach (which I have taken) would be to abandon that story, think much more about Cindy the Vampire, and write a story in which she is the sole hero, and her anger and explosions end up having some positive effect on the world, and she comes to terms with the loss of her old life, and embraces her new life, anger and all. She just learns to channel them into something good. ""Angel"" the spin-off of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, did something similar. I don't suggest rewriting Angel, I'm just noting that the concept isn't too far out. To me, one of the more difficult things about writing is finding a strong character that isn't just a flawless Superman (or Superwoman). Your vampire sounds good, she creates conflict, she is special, and she is flawed (angry with pent-up rage). Give her some hints of an underlying sensitivity and altruism, which we will want to come to the fore eventually, and you have a character transformation story. This can be a Young Adult novel, coming-of-age, or a New Adult novel (for 18-28 ages) that are generally also a kind of coming-of-age story, just about an age range where people are out of high school) and independent but still trying to figure out who they are and what they do in the world, romantically and/or professionally. You have a good character. Find her weaknesses, find her strengths, find the good in her, even if it has been buried in her rage. What does she DO in a day? Is it satisfying, or does she hate it? What would she rather be doing? Is it just restless energy, or is it driven by some underlying passion? (I would) put aside the short story, that was just a stepping stone to finding this character. Don't lock her back in the coffin. Embrace her, and you have the titular character of a novel, or even a series, The Adventures of Cindy the Vampire."
"Is it ok to use ""aluminium"" in an otherwise American English text?","(Academic Copyeditor here) I see no problems; you have a good justification. If this is your text (your blog, a self-published book), you're done, though you might want to add a footnote etc. to explain why you're using that spelling. If someone else will publish the text, you should talk to your editor AND make a note in the text. Talk to the editor because they may or may not have liberty with house style, and if it's a multi-author volume or a journal, they will want to keep things consistent. Make a note because the copyeditor may or may not notice that this is deliberate, and may or may not change it – once you flag it as deliberate, they're likely to leave it alone, respectively you can change it back if you have the editor's backing.

Is it smart to reserve one's best ideas or to utilise them early in their writing career?,"Use your best ideas. Write them as well as you can. Yes, your writing will improve with experience. And your ideas will also improve with experience. If you reserve your ""best ideas"" until you're a better writer, then your early stories will exhibit neither your best ideas nor your best writing. Why hamper yourself like that? Sometimes people love great stories even if the writing is somewhat clumsy. Use your best ideas. Give people a chance to love your story even as you gain writing experience. Writing your best ideas will keep you motivated, and that will make your writing better. Maybe not as good as it will be, but as good as it can be for now. Don't worry about wasting a great idea. You will have more great ideas. Plenty of them. There is no need to hold back. Use your best ideas. Write them as well as you can."
Are there jobs that involve creative writing in the software industry?,"Possibly the most creative industry that you can write for. This is displayed through the excellent storyline in the Assassin's Creed series. It consists of a dual storyline that spans throughout the history of mankind (Due to their excellent implementation of the sci-fi mechanism combined with historical emphasis on events.) If you read through the storyline/canon of Assassin's Creed (... Or play through the game) yourself, you'll find that the series is really different from other games. Not only does it have excellent graphics, character modelling, and a game engine that allows all the visuals of the buildings to happen, it has decent voice acting, it has an awesome and believable storyline. I believe that every game should be like this. Unfortunately, some people would disagree with me on this, as well as the majority of gamers who prefer action or first-person-shooter games. :| I think the Games Industry is the most creative, because it combines many different kinds of creative processes and meshes it together -  ..."
Writing garbage to see if the characters do something interesting?,"Is written garbage better than leaving the page blank?  Infinitely! Does every page you write need to be part of your novel?  No! If you are seeing weaknesses in the structure of your story, and you know what you need to create to strengthen it, then that is what you should write.   If you see the weakness but don't know how to fix it, writing is still the answer, but you need to write without making any promises (to yourself or your characters) that what comes out is going to be a part of the final story.   Garbage writing is experimentation.  If it works, great!  If not... nobody ever needs to know that that horrible scene ever existed.  That is why we call it garbage...  to prepare it for its most likely final resting place."
Reasons for confusion over tenses in a story,"The tense is not wrong.  Guessing as to why you are being told it is wrong: English grammar is a system of explanation, not a set of rules, and it is incredibly complicated, and even as complicated as it is, still does not adequately describe all forms of common English usage. In this system of explanation, ""Yelled"" is past tense and ""ignoring"" is a present participle. One ""past"", one ""present"", therefore your critics think it is wrong.  BUT present participles are used to form the past continuous tense. (I told you it was complicated.) ""Ignoring"" is (in this sentence) in the past continuous tense. So the tenses match.  At least, that is the best analysis I can give. But there are those here who are far more ardent and learned grammar wonks than I, and they may explain it a different way.  But like I said, you are dealing with a system of explanation that often has a very hard time categorizing what are very common English phrases. You are far more likely to learn to use tenses correctly in English by observing and imitating common English usage.  Your sentence is common English usage. "
Where can I find resources for bedtime story plots?,"First, a piece of advice. Don't turn your bedtime narration into a job, or it will quickly become stressful for you and unenjoyable for your children. It should be completely okay (and I guess it is for your children) to read from a book, if you don't have an idea for a (new) story every night. Now, to my answer. Few professional writers have to come up with novel ideas every day (e.g. those that draw daily comic strips), and they usually spend the whole day on generating that idea or even work in teams (e.g. late night show writers). You, on the other hand, only have a minute or so to collect yourself while your kids lay waiting expectantly, so you have to make use of what's already on your mind. There are some resources, such as fairy tales (that you can vary, expand, and adapt, as the storytellers of old have done) and the books the other answers have named, but I feel that if you begin to do research for your bedtime stories you are already on the way to loosing its fun. So what I would do, and what I have done with my son a few times when he was young, is threefold: Simply adapt anything that goes on in your mind to your children. There is no reason you cannot begin a story to your four year old with a dad leaving his home to go to his office. Or with a four year old being disappointed about not getting another ice cream (as your own child was that day). And then just let your imagination run. Let the dad's boss turn into a gnome and the dad have to catch him and return the office to order. Let the child learn that the ice cream was corrosive and has eaten a hole in the earth. Mix your day with the last book your children read or anything else, freely. I mean, Tolkien came up with the Hobbit because it was his job to study old tales, but yours isn't, so don't try to compete with him. If your job is selling cars, tell tales about selling cars. Make them fantastic by inserting elements from what you gleaned your kids watching on tv that afternoon while you cooked. Make the narration interactive. Ask your children: What happens now? Did the dad catch the gnome-boss? Did the child fall in the hole? Then after their answer come up with what happens next. Children love to tell stories, they have ideas, so ""make use"" of them as co-narrators. Read from a book, if you aren't in the mood to invent a story today, or even take a break and read for a few months, until the mood to tell your own story overcomes you again (if ever). Don't get into a competition with other parents about who is the best and most creative parent and whose kids have the most best fun life. Specifically: All the books, tv shows, radio plays, songs (!) – everything that you children read, listen to, and watch, and you are exposed to because you are in the same room with them, provide plenty of ideas for stories, characters, and topics that you can easily vary, mix, and combine with elements from your real life (even adult life, if you ""downtune"" them to the level of your children)."
Could I reach the level of good writing style as non-native language speaker?,"It is certainly not easy, but I'd like to point to a possible advantage of coming from a different culture with a different language: it might also give you an edge!  When I read manga (japanese comic books) for instance, I always gravitate towards the type of manga which draws its inspiration from western culture. The manga that talk about eastern culture, like ninja or samurai stories don't interest me. It's the ones about pirates and bounty hunters. On the other hand, the comic books treating the same themes do not interest me at all. Why? It's precisely because of the refreshing look of japanese manga artists on our culture. They view it totally differently, bring in aspects from their own culture into it, and that's what makes it so very fresh and entertaining. Something similar must be true for literature. Wasn't Nabokov, the great Russian writer, writing in English, French and Russian? Often drawing inspiration from the various languages.  Certainly, the task ahead is not an easy one, but nothing worthwhile is easy, don't let it discourage you! "
Using the real world in writing,"Use of trademarked names in fiction does not violate intellectual property laws. There are a couple of things to be wary of nonetheless. Be careful with the light in which you depict real businesses. As explained here, if you have a character die from a bad hamburger at Burger King or hurt himself because of a defective pair of Reeboks, then prepare for a libel suit.  Similarly, as discussed here, don't turn a trademarked brand name into a verb or a non-proper noun (which lawyers call trademark dilution). In other words, don't have characters ""hoovering the living room,"" ""drinking a coke,"" or ""googling their names."" Instead, make sure they're ""vacuuming the living room with Hoover's wonderful appliance,"" ""enjoying a Coca-Cola,"" or ""performing a search on their names using that awesome Google."" Or better yet, stick to vacuum cleaner, soft drink, and search engine. :) As long as the portrayal is innocuous, and brand names are capitalized and not ""genericized,"" there is no harm and no need for any kind of acknowledgment."
"Mother is writing a book, thinks writing her life stories is same as telling them [closed]","I very accidentally stumbled over this question and have a feeling that I must answer. I'm no writer at all and also no pychologist or NLP [neuro-linguistic programming] practitioner (to help you changing her thoughts). My first thought was: why not just let her write her story in her own style? What's the clue in telling her ""you have to do it this way to attract readers""? She is 88 and she wants to write. That's awesome!!! People who need her words will love her book. Give her all your love and understanding to support her in any way SHE wants. That's the best you can do."
Should we avoid writing fiction about historical events without extensive research?,"Imagine that you're writing a story about a horse race.  Your protagonist's horse is in second place, just barely behind their arch-nemesis.  Right as they approach the finish line, the protagonist's horse gathers itself for a mighty leap and propels itself into the air over the other horse to claim victory. This is a very dramatic and exciting moment - or it could be, if it weren't for the fact that it is completely impossible.  Horse races don't involve leaping.  This scene will fall completely flat for any reader who recognizes its impossibility.  The readers most likely to know about how horse races work are people who care about horse races.  These are also the readers who are most likely to be emotionally invested in a story about horse racing. EDIT:  For another example of a scene being cheapened by its lack of realism, I give you: NCIS: Two idiots, one keyboard That's not a good thing. The more emotionally attached people are to an event, the more important it is to portray that event correctly.  The more recent an event is, the more attached people will be to it.
The more important an event is, the more attached people will be to it. The Holocaust is both in living memory (if only barely), and HUGELY important.  You don't want to screw it up, and you will if you don't research it. Even if you weren't worried about alienating your readers you should research anyways, because the details you will learn will enhance your story.   Learning about the way people lived, how they acted, and how they survived will inspire countless details that will allow you to move your story in new and interesting ways.  Truth is stranger than fiction in many dramatic and exciting ways, but you can't take advantage of that unless you have researched those details. Finally, While watching Spiderman: Homecoming, I was briefly thrown out of the story because I happen to know that there are only two different schools who have won the Academic Decathlon in the past 8 years, and neither of them is anywhere close to New York.  Peter Parker's school winning AcaDeca had to be fictional because the school doesn't exist, and it still briefly threw me out of the story.  No matter what you do, you will not be able to perfectly recreate the events you are describing.  That's okay.  But you still need to get close enough that readers familiar with the subject aren't constantly being distracted by your inaccuracies.  A blip here or there is fine."
To what extent should we fear giving offense? [closed],"Trying to not offend in general, as a goal in and of itself, is automatically a losing proposition. Posed as an optimization problem, it resolves to saying nothing and reaching no one. You cannot please everyone. Every choice attracts some potential readers and alienates others. This is normal. There cannot be a universal list of permissible victim groups. The borders of said groups are always drawn by the attacker, who is at will to assign any and all ""naughty"" labels to predetermined targets. You should excel at your craft and perfect your vision. This means if you set out to write a book promoting concept P, you should ensure that it indeed promotes P, as an obligation to your craft and vision. This has nothing to do with ""political correctness"".  There's only one group of people you need to avoid offending -- your audience. And the audience is retroactively defined as ""the people who like the book"". You respect the audience by refining your craft and vision. Throwing out a plot point because you realized it's bad is a normal part of writing. Sometimes the realization is prompted by reader feedback, other times you notice it yourself. Only laziness is objectively bad. Suppose you're writing a fictionalized biography of a living person in collaboration with the subject. Sometimes, the subject would tell you, ""No, this isn't something I'd say. And that isn't something I'd do."" What do you do? Well, at least you have one authoritative source in that scenario. Now imagine you're writing a book about a community, and each community member has different ideas on how everyone should and should not act in your book. Who do you listen to? For a book in general, especially for a fiction book, the audience (in the artistic sense) isn't something that can be measured beforehand. Often, it's the writer who notices a pattern or a thought and crystallizes it into words for other people to find and express themselves with. It's that pattern and those people who you need to be faithful to, not the perpetually offended ""influencers"" who, what with all the things to be offended about, have no time to read. Avoiding or inviting controversy are marketing strategies. It follows from Weierstrass's theorem that for every book, there's an optimal amount of controversy it has to generate to maximize the chance of landing a movie deal. But it's not a moral consideration."
Tiptoe or tiphoof? Adjusting words to better fit fantasy races,"Adapt to the culture. If it's a town of demons and the narrator is implied to be well familiarized with them, then you can go with 'tiphoof' and other such expressions, coining new idioms for the culture, replacing common phrases with more suitable counterparts, often playing puns with the expressions. On the other hand, if there is a culture clash, with the speaker/narrator being unfamiliar with the demon customs and language you'll either go with common 'human' expressions, or show hesitation. Express that inner nitpicker! ""The demon tiptoed... tiphoofed? Can one even tip-hoof? Eh, let's say the demon crept sneakily across the room."""
Do readers need to identify with fictional characters?,"Personally, I don't need to identify with the characters to enjoy a story, whether in literature or in cinema. What I do need is to identify the characters as realistic constructs with human reactions and quirks. As a young teenager, I discovered one of my favourite authors ever. The Portuguese Miguel Torga wrote plenty of short stories whose protagonists were animals or people living mostly miserable lives in the poor, harsh hinterland of his time. As a young middle class girl reading tales fifty years after they were written in a seemingly completely different society, I couldn't possibily relate to the frog eviscerated by a wild little boy or to the pregnant young woman who faced a lonely labour in the middle of the mountains to prevent her village from learning of her disgrace. But those characters I could never identify with allowed me to learn about sides of human nature I couldn't possibly know about at 13.  I feel the same towards films or any type of story, no matter the medium. If you can recognise the character as human in its actions and reactions, then you can enjoy its tale.  In fact, it strongly annoys me the growing pressure to have protagonists the reader can identify with, especially when that advice is explicitly connected with a character which can work as a sort of self-insert for the reader. Someone the reader can think 'this could almost be me'.  A story allows the reader/viewer/listener to put themself in the shoes of any person. Why should one purposefully limit the protagonists to constructs that mirror the supposed average or minority reader? Some of the best stories I've read were the ones where I couldn't possibly relate to the character - whether in gender, social class, fears, ambitions... Those were the stories that opened my eyes to the fact that different people think and feel differently than me, that such differences are neither bad nor good, that actions one may deem insane or even evil can have profound reasons behind them, and that, through all those unsurmountable differences of feeling and action, we're all still human and fundamentally the same. In conclusion: while I don't think it's inherently bad to have a character the reader can identify with, I certainly do not think that is essential. A character the reader can identify as fundamentally human is all a writer needs, as far as I'm concerned.  P.S.: While re-reading the answer, I felt the need to state that what I wrote above should not be seen as an excuse to always have the same typical white man/boy as a hero. While it's true that, as a woman, I thoroughly enjoy well-crafted male protagonists, I do think a lot of men would benefit from being allowed to experience stories from a woman's shoes... and I definitely don't mean 'chick' tales."
I feel like my book is too small and I’m kind of just throwing all my ideas out too quick. Does this mean filler might be necessary?,"Filler is never a good thing. It's possible that 100 pages is simply the proper length for your story. However, it's also possible that you have too much narrative summary and too little scene. Some samples: Summary: Jane ate lunch at Luigi's. She ran into Josh, and told him about the trouble with the locusts. Scene: The restaurant was almost empty, a forest of crisp white tablecloths. It was nearly two o'clock. While lunchtime technically extended until three, Jane always felt faintly unwelcome at this hour, as if the staff were all eyeing her, wishing that she'd eat her soup just a little faster. ""The usual table?"" asked the hostess. ""Yes, thank you,"" said Jane. In her hurry, she led the way to the little round table by the window, rather than following. ""And a glass of iced tea as soon as you can—"" She broke off. Josh? Yes, Josh, just entering through the big glass doors. What was he doing here? (And so on and so on.) Now, scene shouldn't be ""filler"". There should be some reason for all this stuff. Jane's discomfort about potentially inconveniencing others, her familiarity with the restaurant, her upcoming conversation with Josh—they should all earn their keep. Some semi-random links about summary versus scene:"
What's the point of writing that I know will never be used or read?,"For me, writing is a passion. Not writing is an impossibility. There are stories in my mind; I need to tell them. I need to find out where they go, how they go, what they mean. I have something in mind when I start a story, but it changes, mutates, I do not fully understand it until it is written and finished. I find out what I think and how I feel about complex issues (moral, philosophical, political) by writing about them, directly or indirectly. A story lets me ask complex ""what if""s, that lead me deeper into an issue. I can play with ideas, explore them, travel down untrodden paths to find out what lies at their end. Writing is a process, and I enjoy every bit of that process. The research, the editing, the sketching down of hasty ideas and drawing lines between them, the bouncing of ideas against longsuffering friends - every part of the process of creation. I love it, because it is a process of creation. Of course I want an audience. A story is to be told to someone. Otherwise, is there a story? A story that isn't told is like sheet music that's never played - it is a promise unfulfilled. I am made uncomfortable by books that don't get opened - they are there to tell stories, not to sit on a shelf!
However, while I write, I do not ask myself whether this thing will get published. For one thing, I myself might decide that this half-finished creation project is not good, and consign it to the dark pit of oblivion in a ""nah"" folder. Multiple mythologies speak of the gods making multiple attempts and scraping them before arriving at a final creation. My story, my prerogative. And then, the thing is, in our digital world there isn't really such a thing as ""no-one will ever read this"", unless that's the fate you yourself want for a particular story. You might be unable to sell it. You might be unable to have it published traditionally. I'm sure as heck going to try - like I said, I very much want an audience. But I do not look to earn my bread through writing. So if all else fails, I can just post my stuff on the web, and proceed to write the next thing. Of course I'm learning and I'm getting better as I write. But honestly, that's not something I look at. I do not write now so that ""one day"" I can write better. I write because writing is a fire in my bones right now."
Can a writer joke with the reader without breaking the fourth wall?,"You can do it, if you have a narrator who is explicitly speaking to someone. For example, if you have a framing narrative where the protagonist tells the story of his life to another person, or if you have a framing narrative where the protagonist writes down the story of his life (he would then be joking to himself). If your protagonist directly experiences the story, then the narration is a sort of self-reflection and you can have the ""thinker"" sugarcoating something to himself and then think to himself: ""But who am I kidding?"" Otherwise any address to the reader in a narrative that doesn't address the reader is breaking the fourth wall."
How to make the villain relatable/human without making the hero seem like a monster for killing him?,"You seem to be contradicting yourself a little bit.  "" I ... made him the hero of his own story.""  ""I don't have the intention of making his death an emotional moment, because he is supposed to be seen as unlikable...""  If you want him to be seen as unlikable, don't show him to the reader as the hero of his own story.  You can make a character, regardless of his role in the story, likable without being sympathetic or sympathetic without being likable.  Thomas Covenant is sympathetic but he's not very likable.  Locke Lamora is likable but not overly sympathetic.  I suspect that you want your villain to be sympathetic but not likable.  You do that, in part, by showing him suffering and relating his objectionable actions back to that suffering.  The reader can understand his motivation - they understand why he does the horrible things he does.  But don't show him to the reader as a heroic or likable figure.  Don't show him taking actions that signal to the reader that they should like him.  Show his step father beat him bloody, but then have him kick his dog when the beating is done.  We understand WHY he kicked the dog - it's an understandable reaction to the pain and frustration of a child being abused by an adult.  But we aren't going to LIKE someone who kicks puppies. How we feel about the hero killing the villain will largely be determined by how the hero feels about the action.  You need to convince the reader that they would have taken the same actions if they were in the hero's position (and perhaps had the hero's qualities.)  A hero can take joy in killing his rival if the villain is  truly evil with no redeeming qualities.  If that isn't the case, then the hero should feel regret, for the necessity if not for the deed itself.  In other words, you make the killing of the villain a justifiable act.  "
Using colloquialisms the reader may not be familiar with,"It worth noting that this kind of thing has been done many times before. Stories such as The Red Badge of Courage, The Unvanquished, and Their Eyes Were Watching God all do this. Their Eyes Were Watching God takes it to an extreme as the narrator sometimes starts to talk in dialect and make the poor reader quite uncomfortable.  Generally, I think reader will be able to figure what you mean in context. To test this, you might want beta readers not familiar with the Irish dialect.  Using a dialect helps the reader understand the culture and makes you look more authoritative on the topic.  However, there is a down side to dialect. They can distract the reader from the message of the story. Take for example the movie Schindler's List. The director decided to use English in the movie so there would be nothing to distract the viewer from the harsh topics. In contrast, The Passion of the Christ does not have a single line of English. Both are powerful movies, and I would say achieve what they want.  There isn't a black and white answer to this. If it comes naturally to you, try it (at least in character dialogue, maybe not as the narrator). Do be mindful not to overwhelm the reader.  One thing you could do is have a non-Irish person (probably American, considering how oblivious they are to other cultures) who doesn't understand the dialect and asks for clarification.  "
How much humour is effective in technical documentation?,"The typical user of technical communication is in a hurry and in a bad mood. They were working along trying to get a job done so they could go home and have supper with the kids then something broke or refused to work the way they thought it should, or a part would not go on properly, or a bug appeared out of nowhere, or the whole system quit working and blue smoke started pouring out.  They are not in the mood for a joke.  We should think of technical communication like a pitstop. It is a time to get the user what they need to continue as efficiently and with as little drama as possible. There is no time in a pitstop to tell the one about the dentist and farmer's daughter.  That is why there is no humor in most technical communication and why there should not be.  Humor in learning materials is another matter. Some like it. Some despise it. If you are selling a Dummies book, you can appeal just to those who like it and let the people who don't buy an O'Reilly book. But if this is your corporate training, you probably do not want to turn off half your audience. "
"When do you stop ""pushing"" a book?","Never give up a book based SOLELY on the response to your queries.  The reason is that the response rate you get to queries tells you relatively little about your book's quality.  Query writing is its own form of writing, and one that it is highly rewarding, but surprisingly difficult to master.  It's quite possible that a good book could have bad queries.  So, as @Amadeus has correctly noted, your first step should be to improve your query-writing game.  There are plenty of good books and online resources on this topic.  Until you get a query accepted, you haven't received any direct feedback about your book at all. With all that said, there are some valid reasons for rejecting a query that do connect to the book.   First, an unprofessional query usually indicates an unprofessional writer, which indicates an unprofessional book.  Any errors at all in a query --typos, bad grammar, and so forth --are usually disqualifying in this regard.  Second, a weak or vague query often means that the writer doesn't actually know what his or her own book is about.  That can mean a vague or confused book. Third (to be harsh) a badly written query can mean a bad writer  --or at least one who hasn't achieved a high standard of work yet.  Finally, an unmarketable query typically means an unmarketable book.  This is the least fair one, because it has nothing to do with book quality, but publishers are in a business, and if they can't figure out who your audience is, and why that audience would buy your book, they aren't going to publish you. So my advice to you is twofold:  Work hard at improving your queries AND use that process to understand where corresponding weaknesses in your book might lie.  Do you understand your own book?  Do you know your target audience?  Do you know the market?  Is your book flawlessly edited and free of errors and typos?  Is there something compelling about it?  Only if those answers are all coming back as negatives (and you can't fix them) should you consider tabling this project and starting a new one."
So I finished my novel. Now what do I do?,"John Smithers' advice is good, but I'd add a few details (and leave it for longer than three weeks!) Before you put the MS away, make a first pass at your query letter, as well.  This is good because the query needs some time away from your eyes just like the MS does, and because writing the query can really help you figure out what the book has going for it, and what it's lacking.   So, after the query and MS have rested and you've forgotten about them, come back with fresh eyes and look at big stuff, first.  Write your synopsis now, I'd say, and look for pacing issues (too many chapters with no action, or too much action all the time, etc.) Make sure the book you have matches the book you wrote about in your query, and if it doesn't, change it.  Check for character consistency, development, etc.  Make sure your plot structure is solid (rising action, climax, satisfying conclusion, etc.).  There are entire books on editing out there, (Self-Editing for Fiction Writers by Browne and King is one good one) so I can't give you the whole story, here, but you get the idea.  Obviously you also need to look for style issues, and typos and mechanical errors. Then send the book to betas.  While you're waiting for them, you can start looking at your publishing option.  Steven Drennan will probably be by shortly to recommend that you self-publish, but you may also want to consider getting an agent and going through a publisher.  You can find suitable agents by finding the agents who represent your favourite books in the same genre as your MS, or by using sites like Query Tracker.  You may want to post your query at the AW Water Cooler or other sites that offer query critiques, because writing queries is an art in itself.   Once you've got responses from your betas, look them over with an accepting but critical eye.  If more than one person has a problem with a certain aspect of your book, take a hard look at it.  Even if only one person finds something, give it a good look.  But don't let your betas rewrite your book for you.  You're still the author, this is still your book, and you have the final decision on how you want it to go.  If you make significant changes, I'd recommend letting the MS sit for another chunk of time before coming back and deciding whether the changes work.  Make sure you keep copies of all versions of your work so you can revert as necessary. When you've finally got the MS in the best condition possible, assuming you're not self-publishing, send out a batch of 5-10 queries to agents. Don't query them all at once, because sometimes your query won't be as good as you think it is, and you don't want to burn bridges (once you've queried, you can't re-query the same agent with the same project, generally).  You may want to include your first choice agent and a few mid-level guys in the first batch, leaving your second choice agent out of it; that way, if you decide your query wasn't strong, you can send your revised query to your second choice agent and still have a good chance at a good outcome). If you can't get a bite on an agent (and I'm talking about after a couple hundred submissions), you could try to submit directly to the publishers who accept direct queries, but there aren't many.  You could also look at self-publishing.  There are lots of how-tos out there on how to do a good job, but be prepared to invest some significant cash in cover art and professional editing.  You may also want to consider writing under a pseudonym; if you couldn't interest any agents, and if you're serious about writing more, you need to seriously consider that this effort really isn't good enough to be published.  (It's also possible that it's great quality but in a weird niche, or an over-crowded genre, or something else).  But once you've published under your name, your book's out there, and if you later come to realize that it's poor quality, it's too late to save your name. Some of this is genre specific, of course.  If you're writing erotic romance, you could jump straight to the e-pubs without an agent.   TL;DR version: You've only just begun!  But congrats on an important first step."
How do I stop my characters falling in love?,"Imagine her point of view, as a typical nurse. She has already met hundreds of patients over the course of her career who had inappropriate feelings for her. 99% of them held no temptation for her at all, and by now she's sick of it. Some were old, some were unattractive, some were mean when they thought they were being nice, some made sexual suggestions at moments when she just wanted to get on with her job, some were so close to death she couldn't imagine having a future with them. Many were covered in blood or vomit or pus or needed help with the bedpan. Nursing someone isn't romantic when you nurse everyone. He loves that she looks after him, but to her, there's nothing romantic about him being the fifth man whose bandages she's changed today.  This man who has poured out his feelings for her is nothing special to her. He tells her a lot about himself and she listens politely but she doesn't tell him anything really personal to her. For all that they talk, in her mind he's barely even a friend. He's just one of the nicer customers at her work, one of the ones you can have a meaningless casual chat with while you do your job and then forget about when they leave."
Does everything have to be accurate?,"Generally, @MichaelKjörling and @HenryTaylor are right. Let me, however, look at the issue from a slightly different perspective. If you explain something, it has to make sense. If you don't explain, it can be accepted as a black box. Consider, for example, Asimov's Robot series. The robots have a ""positronic brain"", and obey the Three Laws of Robotics. The Three Laws are logical - there's plenty of stories to be had through playing with them. What on earth is a ""positronic brain""? A black box, a catchword. If Asimov had attempted to explain how this brain actually, technologically, works, scientists and engineers would have been all over him, explaining the impossibility of it. But he doesn't explain, so he can get on with the story. Similarly, Ursula Le Guin in The Left Hand of Darkness doesn't explain in detail why Gethen is cold: no mention of axial tilts, distance from the sun, whatever. Gethen is cold, let's get on with the story, and explore the effects of it being cold along the way. Now contrast with Larry Niven's Ringworld; Niven went to great lengths to explain how the Ringworld is stable. In come the nitpickers to prove that no, it's not. If I spot a mistake in something I'm reading, it breaks my immersion, shatters my suspension of disbelief. ""Mistake"" can be an internal inconsistency, or something that is overtly wrong. But if you don't give me enough information to find that something is wrong, everything's alright. I mean, I don't know exactly how things I use in RL work either, do I? The common USB flash drive, for example, is, to me, a black box: I store data on it, but I have no idea how, physically, the data is written, read, stored. Nor do I care."
How can I hint that my character isn't real?,"I did this once in a novel-length story. After the first two appearences my wife said that she has a strange feeling with the side character, but couldn't tell why. In the end she was like 'I knew it!'. What did I do? I made the side character appear 'just in time', when noone else was around or 'hide' from others for whatever reason. She did always know what was the right thing to say, what the protagonist needed the most in that exact moment, being 'the one she adores'. So you can make the audience question the existence if nobody else ever talks about this character despite she is somehow always there. You can make her a bit too insightful, give her a bit too much influence on the protagonist, in short: make her feel slightly off without breaking the suspension of disbelief. Just make her totally normal for the protagonist."
How to write a chaotic neutral protagonist and prevent my readers from thinking they are evil?,"I think the problem is that for somebody that doesn't care, Banshee gets awfully worked up about not caring, and this emphasizes an evil side, not a neutral side. I think you are trying too hard to TELL us she is neutral, instead of just showing her being neutral.  I'd edit the following exchanges: After "" to free the people of these corrupt corporate executives"" you have: Banshee_Harvest: Save your preaching for someone who actually cares. I was in this solely for the thrills. I’m uploading the files now #2_files_attached  I think that is too much TELL. I'd show she doesn't care: Banshee_Harvest: Whatever. I'm uploading the files now ... After, ""What’s so bad about the TLF?"" you have Banshee_Harvest: I don’t like the rumors about you guys. You’re not afraid to hurt people to get what you want. And I don’t want to end up on that side of the fence. The ends don’t always justify the means. Too much exposition, you've said the same thing four times. I'd change it: Banshee_Harvest: You hurt people. I don't hurt people. See the difference? After ""we do what we have to do ... for the good of the many, am I right?"" You have: Banshee_Harvest: Don’t try to push your fascist beliefs on me, I’ve heard about what you’ve guys done. ""Fascist beliefs"" is too much, and after G00fy expresses a philosophy, she can summarize her own philosophy: Banshee_Harvest: No, you're wrong, because you don't HAVE to do anything. The many are way more powerful than me! They can take care of themselves, and I will take care of myself. I think for a neutral, this is a fine position. It is a fact that the 99% far outnumber the 1% of oppressors ruling the world, and they usually far outnumber the armies and police of the oppressors. It is only their own refusal to take up the risk of revolt and casualties that keeps them oppressed. In other words, they are not going to risk their lives to help themselves and their fellow oppressed, and if they are not willing, why should she take any risk on their behalf? She can still be interested in a cause (like helping journalists with information). She can still feel sympathy for the oppressed, the trafficked girls, the people robbed of their pensions. She may still decide to do something about it when she's bored and the risk isn't great. I also think its fine if her public or professional face is set to only care if there is money in it for her. But privately, I would write such a character as occasionally seeing something on the news or the Internet, and casually engaging in a bit of easy hacking to deliver a little Karma to a jerk, just because she likes hacking, and likes the satisfaction of balancing the equation now and then. She may think its funny. A crack in her shield will make it easier for you to break the wall of feigned indifference (which you have already suggested exists if she has in fact said on several occasions that she is looking for a cause.)"
Can I conceal an antihero's insanity - and should I?,"You don't need to label your characters for the reader.  And you shouldn't. Just describe them as they are, and as they act, and let the readers make their own decisions about them.  The main character of The Talented Mr. Ripley is a charming, likeable sociopathic killer. The writer doesn't need to spell this out, you see it in his actions.  The same is true for the --much less likeable --protagonist of Woody Allen's Match Point. Readers may be rooting for your main character to have a heart, but if you've depicted her honestly and consistently, they won't be shocked when she turns out not to have one after all. Part of what makes these narratives work is that the anti-heroes --like the nebbishy antagonist in Fargo --are initially relatable. Their motivations --love, social status, a way out of financial difficulties --are familiar and understandable. But when the chips are down, they make decisions most people wouldn't be willing to make.  Putting a label on all of that isn't helpful --it doesn't do anything but provide an excuse for the reader to distance themselves from the character. It may be helpful to remember that the insane don't realize they are insane --that's a key part of their insanity. In their own heads, all their actions are completely sensible and justified. It's also worth noting that --unless your narrative is utterly nihilist --your readers will expect some kind of punishment/consequence for sociopathic behavior. The aforementioned movies are good examples because the main characters apparently get away with their bad behaviors --they aren't discovered by the people around them. But they experience the more profound, internal, intrinsic consequence of destroying the only people who truly love them."
How do we handle pauses in a dialogue?,"You indicate pauses with action, even mentioning the pause. (Or, as Cyn says in comment, with other exposition or thoughts). Chad said, ""Was the computer software hacked?"" Bryce shook his head. ""No, it was a bug caused by legacy software. Any other question?"" Bryce waited for somebody to answer, but everyone averted their eyes, or looked at the wall clock. ""No? Okay, see you on Thursday."" Noise filled the room as students gathered their books and belongings, and began to wander into the hall. He waited for Alice to pass, his star pupil. She caught his eye. She said, ""Bye."" Bryce smiled and nodded to her."
Is an easily guessed plot twist a good plot twist?,"TLDR - Readers guessing your plot twist doesn't have to mean it's ruined, there are ways to make it satisfying linksassin's answer is good, but I'll offer an alternate idea : Anticipated plot twists can work if they're executed well Take the famous Star Wars example. The twist that Darth Vader is Luke's father isn't a twist for present day first-time viewers. It didn't make it any less satisfying for me, because Watching the movies with the twist in mind added a layer of depth to the characters' actions (Obi-Wan says Vader killed Luke's father - in a way, I guess he did. Knowing that Obi-Wan and Vader used to be friends makes Obi-Wan's death even sadder)  I knew what would happen, but I didn't know how it would happen. The characters' reactions to the twist were enjoyable and  consistent with their development so far. Another well-done plot twist was in Gravity Falls -  The reveal that Stan Pines had a long-lost twin By the time the reveal episode aired, most of the fans had come up with this theory and had lots of evidence to back up their claims. What made it so satisfying was -  The execution - it was a tense, emotional scene, and although the fans had guessed the main idea, there were a lot of additional details that were new (and twisty in their own rights) This depends on the kind of story you're writing, I suppose, but the work that fans put in to come up with this theory was... intense, is one word for it. The creator dropped some well-hidden hints and foreshadowing, but also lampshaded the idea in some other episodes (to try to throw fans off track? I don't know) Those are two plot twists that people saw coming, but still remain enjoyable.  An infamous example of an unexpected and widely disliked plot twist was the ending of Game Of Thrones -   Danaerys's descent into madness was barely foreshadowed, and more importantly, other things which were foreshadowed were not fulfilled.


(edit to make it clearer) The audience expects Danaerys to be heroic, just, good, etc. They don't remember the bad things she did three seasons ago as 'bad', they remember them as justified. IIRC, none of the 'good' characters  doubted her judgement until she'd already done some horrible things. At this point, it's a little too late to 'remind' the audience that insanity/madness runs in the family, because they'll think it's part of a ploy to throw them off the scent of the real twist. (Note - this is common in media famous for twists, fake deaths, etc. Fans stop trusting reality as presented by the show, because the show has already lied so many times. Every plausible direction for the plot to go in is now a potential red-herring)  More  on GoT - Bran, a character who showed no prior inclination to ruling (and, I think, a generally disliked character?) becomes king. So far, he's mainly been involved in the supernatural aspect of the show, not the political one. The show set up Jon vs Danaerys as the main battle for the throne - which one of them would get it, and how would the other one feel about it? That entire aspect/arc was cut short, and the none of the audience's expectations about it were satisfied.  Once you make a contract with the reader, you have to fulfill it, or risk leaving the readers feeling cheated.  If you have a prophecy, for example, you can either play it straight and fulfill it in the expected manner, or twist the words for some surprises (Percy Jackson does this quite often).  What you can't * do is, in your penultimate or climax chapter, have your MC say 'Screw this prophecy, lets go do our own thing' - at least, you can't do it without previously establishing that your MC doesn't believe in prophecy, is tired of being pushed around by oracles, etc. If your MC has been totally fine with the prophecy so far, then this isn't a plot twist, it's an inconsistency.  IMO, a predictable yet satisfying plot twist is better than a 'smart' or bizarre one (like you said in your question) *'Can't' in writing is subjective - it usually means 'you shouldn't do this unless you're very confident in your work because usually when this is done it doesn't turn out well'  "
"Is a lawful good ""antagonist"" effective?","Antagonists are not necessarily bad guys. They prevent your protagonist from achieving her goals.  Free yourself of the labels and write your characters true to themselves. What you seem to have in your protagonist is something of an antihero in that she has killed her entire family and anyone else who ventured near enough to reach her. The reader need not fully identify with your protag - a young girl who kills is not the most endearing sort. Show why she does it.  You might find, as I did once, that my original hero turned out to be an inadvertent and unaware villain, flipping the man he thought of as the arch villain into the hero. I stopped thinking of them as good vs evil and saw that the purported villain was striving to preserve the world from the consequences of the actions of the hero. I just considered them by their names and the plot developed itself. Readers having sympathy for a victim of your protag’s earlier evil is not a problem. One thing I wonder, you say she thought she was alone and the last human alive. Why then would she not have felt relieved to see other humans? Was she frightened? Did she think People! I am not the last. Wait, why are they here? No, can’t let them find mom and dad. Need to kill them and run.  If she killed them to cover up her earlier crime, she might be a bit too dark to engage the reader completely. The reader might be curious regarding what other havoc young Eris will wreak, but feeling as Eris feels might be a bit of a stretch.  Let them understand why Eris hates this good woman who stands in her way but don’t expect them to detest her too. They might see her as Eris’ only hope of redemption. If your characters are engaging enough and fully realized, the reader will probably be intrigued. "
Is it Ok to make up places if I want the reader to think it’s set in the real world?,"Jane Austen routinely did what it sounds like you want to do: she kept the big places intact (London, Bath), but the estates mentioned in her stories (e.g. Pemberly) are fictional, with only their general location given. The estate was fictional, but culturally it was set in its time, in England, which is all that she needed. Similarly, you can invent a village, and not bother too much with precise distances and where exactly it should be on the map. Pemberly could have existed, so could your village. In fact, I believe this was a common way of writing at the time."
Non-trope happy ending?,"Everyone gets something, but it doesn’t have to be romantic. Perhaps one MC gets his/her dream job in London and must move. That person would be leaving friends behind, but a new chapter of his life has begun. Cause for celebration and off he/she goes to London. Another might discover a passion for something and choose to change the direction of his life - join the Peace Corps kind of thing.  Some might decide that they are not ready to settle down. Maybe in five years they will revisit the question, but they love who they are and what they are doing and are following the if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it adage."
Plot twist where the antagonist wins,"You absolutely can do this, but there are two very important points to consider. In your question, you're describing a particular sequence of events as being an unexpected one. That's great, but what makes story isn't just the sequence of events, it's what those events mean. There are lots of stories that end with the protagonist failed and crushed. Those are Tragedies, from Oedipus Rex to Hamlet to Watchmen. But these works all are tragedies long before their final scene -- the protagonist losing is the culmination of the tragedy; but its seeds have been planted and growing from the very start. There are also many stories about how the universe is uncaring and capricious; how empires rise and fall based on bad luck and human perversity (Catch 22 comes to mind, as does A Series of Unfortunate Events). But that capriciousness doesn't begin in the last chapter -- it's baked in right from the start. The reason I'm making these comparisons is because you're mostly describing this conclusion in terms of shock value. In terms of ""being surprising.""  But: A good story surprise isn't just ""The reader wasn't expecting this."" The reader doesn't expect the protagonist to suddenly die of a heart attack, or win the lottery, or be elected President by spontaneous write-in votes. It's easy for an author to do something the reader isn't expecting; the question is whether that twist works in service of a coherent story, or not. That's why the two questions I opened with are so important: Knowing the answers to these questions will keep you focused on building towards your ending; on knowing how it's meant to work and how to accomplish that. That'll help address your questions on foreshadowing and effectiveness as well -- which depend heavily on what, exactly, you're trying to accomplish :)"
The unknown and unexplained in science fiction,"I think you may be thinking a little too hard about things as the writer. Instead look at things from your characters' perspectives. Unless you're writing an engineer or someone actually building X, they probably won't actually know how it works. Heck, even an engineer building X would only know about the tiny portion they actually work on. The rest is probably done by other teams or even other computers. Let's imagine that X is actually a car in today's world. If you were to ask some John Doe on the street, he'd explain to you that the car works by turning the keys and pressing the right pedals. He probably understands what it's good for and how it interacts with the world (ie: what can go wrong if you collide with something). He knows that when the little needle gets close to the 'E' he needs to put more Magic Fluid in it from one of the Magic Fluid depots around the city. But that's about it. Does John Doe know how the car burns the gas to cause propulsion? Or how the brakes work? Or even why it's so easy to turn a wheel and change the direction of two tons of metal? I'd guess not. And guess what--this lack of knowledge doesn't even affect him! What John Doe does care about is how the price of Magic Fluid has been going up lately. He cares about how cool the new models of cars look compared to his old one or what (to someone unfamiliar with the concept of cars) minor features were added. If knowing or not knowing a fact doesn't affect your characters, then guess what--it doesn't affect your story! And if it doesn't affect your story, then it has no place in the pages you're writing. Remember that all of this technology is just a pile of tools that work to build an image for the reader of what your world is like and propel your story. At the end of the day, all that really matters for the story is probably exactly what you've written: it's ""see[ing] the technology in use, understand[ing] what it does, and even what it requires to work."""
Outlining the climax made me lose interest in writing the actual story,"I am a discovery writer, I have been for many years, and I complete stories. Most discovery writers (including me) have struggled with what you are talking about; finding the climax, resolving the character arcs, dead-end ""mysteries"" that we could never figure out. The solution to that is simple, but it is NOT outlining. For a discovery writer, outlining kills your characters. It turns them into machines that can't make decisions, and you feel you are forcing their emotions upon them. I think you feel like you finished the story because you (as the author) have no more choice in how the story goes, your characters are no longer fluid, you are no longer excited to see what they will do, or what they will encounter. You have become a typist, instead of a story teller. The solution to finishing books as a story teller is to have a logical conclusion for the story from the beginning. As an example, consider a film like Independence Day, which I did not write. The premise is aliens attack Earth, and we can't beat their tech. The final solution is we infect their systems with a computer virus, thereby defeating their tech, so our military can defeat them. That is all a discovery writer should need to write the story, a main problem, and its solution. I do not consider this an outline, I consider it a direction to write in, and a provisional direction at that: If I think of a better ending, and I love it, I'll write toward that, even if I have to revise the book-so-far to some extent. If while I am writing, my characters do something that would preclude that ending, I have to come up with a better ending right then, still consistent with what has happened, or within the realm of revision for what has happened. I don't want to rewrite ten chapters (although Stephen King, also a discovery writer, once scrapped something like a few hundred pages to save The Stand). Revision is part of discovery writing, to create a coherent whole out of your wanderings. If character actions make the provisional ending illogical or dumb or impossible, then go back and find something else plausible for the characters to do that doesn't ruin the ending. Save a backup, in case you have lines you loved that might be re-used, but cut and start over. Or find a different ending that would work, a better ending, and revise what you need, throughout the book so far, so the better ending fits. I do the same thing for a few other important ""endings"" in the book; I usually have a love story as a subplot in my books, a love story with an obstacle. I decide some provisional ending for that story too, a note on how their obstacle might be overcome, and they get together. If I introduce a mystery, I keep a note on how to solve it. I don't write any of the details, just a plausible notion of how it can be done; a direction to write in. Scrap your outline. Put it aside, forget it, free your characters. Whatever you devised for the various endings, maybe keep them as notes, a direction to write in, but not too many of them. Go back and let your characters be free, to make their choices in the moment like real people, to develop their plans on the fly, react and feel on the fly. Both villains and heroes. Let Jack be surprised when the present circumstances warrant surprise, don't try to force it on him. Where discovery writers shine is precisely that, what the characters do, say, think and feel seems organic and natural, it flows, because the writer has that moment in his head as he invents every line and action. Sometimes I think of this as a football game; American version or European: The goal in every game is the same: You have to get from a starting point to the end of the field, against opposition. But the path to the goal is completely different every time. Different setbacks, mistakes and victories. No two games are ever the same. Take your characters, and play a new game. Even if your final goal is the same, you don't have to get there exactly the same way as you outlined. Your outline found A story, one game. Screw up your outline with adversity, you can always add that: A fumbled ball is recovered by the opposition, a player falls and breaks an arm. It doesn't have to be a villain, it can be an environmental problem; a fire or storm or accident. A wild animal. They've run out of food and water. They encounter a mountain or river they can't cross, screwing up their timeline. Kick your hero in the face and make yourself write a different game for them. Even if your note on how to resolve the main conflict stays exactly the same, let them react to different circumstances on the fly, make new plans. You need to give them new life so you are looking forward to seeing what they do when you sit down to write, and looking forward to figuring it out."
Writing discipline,"I rely on two tactics to achieve steady progress in writing (I'll answer twice for voting ease). The first is sort of obvious - write every day. I fell into a trap at one time where I felt that if I couldn't block off at least a few hours for writing that it was better to not bother. As a result, I would sometimes go for weeks without writing (that doesn't make editors too happy). Eventually, I forced myself to write every day - even if I knew I could only write for 15-30 minutes (which almost always expanded into longer chunks of time). Now, when I have writing projects, I make sure I write every day - even if it's just edits or a sentence or two. For me, a lot of writing happens somewhere in the back of my mind when I'm away from a keyboard, and writing every day keeps those ideas moving."
Any Technique to See if Your Idea is Original?,"If it's original to you, it's original enough.  Even if someone else coincidentally made something similar, you will still have your own twist on it enough that it will be yours entirely. This is different from inventions, where the first person to conceive it is the person who gets credit for it.  In writing, so long as you're not out-and-out copying from someone else, you're good to go. Stop worrying so much and just write.  Everything anyone could ever write is a copy of something, somewhere, that's already written.  Just enjoy yourself and write for you."
"If I wouldn't want to read the story, is writing it still a good idea?","In considering the question of whether or not you should write an idea you don’t like, my instinct would be no. If you don’t like it, it will show in the writing. If you are bored writing it, you can guarantee that your reader will be bored reading it. How excited you are by a project always comes across on the page. All ideas start as little seeds. You have to give them time to germinate, you need to feed them with research, and give them time to grow. Natalie Goldberg (Writing Down The Bones is an excellent book for new writers and I highly recommend the audio version) calls this process ‘composting’. You put in all the rubbish and wait for it to turn into beautiful soil. I doubt many writers start out with fully-fleshed out stories. I certainly don’t.  I use Scapple from Literature and Latte to start a novel. It’s like a giant corkboard on which you can pin things. First I’ll pin my nut of an idea, perhaps a working title, maybe an idea for the theme.  If I can picture the characters in my head, I’ll download photos of them (actors and actresses I think could play them in the movie adaptations :) ) and pin those to the board. If that’s all I have, I’ll save the file and leave it. As Natalie suggests, I give the idea time to compost, allow the seed to germinate. I’ll think about these characters just as I’m about to fall asleep. I’ll let them follow me around all day and see what they do, what they might say, whether they’re good or evil, and if they’re evil, what made them that way. Each new idea, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, I’ll pin to my corkboard (and I do this well in advance, while I'm still drafting a previous novel because I know it takes time and you can't rush the muse. She's like a cat; she comes when she feels like it, but most often when there's food around). So, I feed the muse with research. For example, I barely have anything for my next novel, just a nut of an idea. But I do know that part of it will take place in a high-security psychiatric hospital. So, I feed the muse by researching hospitals, searching for case reports from psychiatrists, reading books like The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. This research may not provide anything useful but that doesn't matter, all I'm doing is feeding the muse, getting the cogs turning and giving the idea space to grow.  When my Scapple corkboard is fleshed out, I then turn to The Story Grid, which is an excellent resource for developing novels. It’s really about editing existing  works but I use it to guide my fleshed-out ideas, create scenes that turn pages, and build a solid framework for a novel. Out of all the ideas you have had so far, pick the one you're most excited by (even if that's a mediocre amount of excitement) and feed the muse. You may find that it's not so awful after all, and that with time, it develops into something rich and exciting. If you stop feeding and watering every seed before it even germinates you will never grow anything. BUT! I would recommend that you don’t start writing until you’re excited about the concept. Write short stories as Secespitus suggests."
Best tool to create ebooks?,"I have been using Calibre to format my e-books, and I have been very happy with it. However, as PseudoCubic noted, it will not accept a Word document as input. Ideally, you should convert your file to html first and then format it with Calibre. If you convert your Word document to html, make sure you choose the Web Page, Filtered option. Otherwise, Microsoft adds a lot of extra tags and stuff that will really mess up your html file. For some other suggestions on converting your file to html, I would recommend going to this guide by Guido Henkel. He will walk you through all the details for making sure that your html file is properly formatted first, and then he shows you how to use Calibre to include your cover image, table of contents, and other material. I haven't used Scrivener, so I don't know whether or not it can create both file versions (ePub and mobi) straight from your completed document. If your book is already finished and you want to use Scrivener, then you will have to import it there first, and you may want to review your content to make sure the formatting still appears the way you wanted it. If you are a Windows user, you'll need to use the beta version for Windows. There are other tools that will convert your files, but all of them work better converting html documents because the tags for the formatting are clearly defined. If you are comfortable working with html, then you may want to give that a try first. "
Should I avoid modern words/phrases in fantasy writing?,"Look at Stephen Brust's Taltos series. All fantasy, written in a modern voice. I think as long as you're not using obvious modern idioms, it's fine to write in a modern voice. If you want to put in the time and effort to use a vernacular, that's fine, but it's more often done poorly than well. Think about it this way: when you're trying to write idiomatically in a dialect from another period, you're trying to make your reader read it from the perspective of a modern reader. It's not how the people of the time hear the language. "
Where is a good place to find beta readers?,"That's a hard one, because it really depends on the community you are working with in your writing. If you are already working with a writers group then you already have group of beta readers right there, just stand up and ask. If you're not part of an existing writers group it might get a bit tricky.  There are always the on-line writers groups, places like critters.org. They are built around the idea of doing beta work, but the good ones have rules and you usually can't just sign up and ask for a beta read. With Critters it takes a few weeks to be established and a few more weeks to get your story through the pipe, so it could be a couple of months before you get your feedback. You can also look for a local writers group. Meetup.com is a good place to start for that, but once again you really need to become a part of the group before you can really ask them to beta.  Of course there is also the choice of asking family, but they might be over inclined to give you positive feedback and gloss over the problems.  On the other hand a good friend, preferably one who is also a writer, can be a good source of beta work, but if they are also a writer you should be willing to beta read in return. In fact, you should probably always be open to beta reading something in return. That way one story trade solves two problems. There are also some oddball ways to find beta readers. I've been apart of a few fangroups that have open lists for beta readers. The downside is that but they are mostly looking for fanfiction, though some are open for original work. If you're doing a fan work that might be a worth while place to start. And you never know, just asking this question here might get you a few offers to read."
How does one implement effective foreshadowing?,"Stories with foreshadowing that I like most are the ones that make the foreshadowing appear random at first or at the very least like an extra but unimportant detail.  If I can smell that a certain event is foreshadowing, I won't be too happy unless it takes some thinking. But if I can't understand that an event was foreshadowing in retrospective, then it was not useful to put the foreshadowing in in the first place. So implementing foreshadowing is like walking a tightrope. There's a delicate balance between too obvious and too hidden. More importantly, you can't implement this well if you don't have clearly in mind how your story is going from A to C through B.  EDIT: If I had to define foreshadowing I would say it is the partial, but often cryptic, disclosure of information pertaining to as-of-yet unrevealed (most of the time future) events. This can happen to the reader only, or to the characters. It can be done by the storyteller or by a character in the story.  To answer your last question, the events should subtly point to Y while the character has only limited information which makes him conclude X should happen. So, in your story, you need to implement two types of information about the events, let's call them A and B. Information type A is accessible to the reader and the character. Information type B is only accessible to the reader, but possibly in a coded form. Or possibly, B could be accessible to the character as well, but so coded that he doesn't manage to decypher it. Don't take my use of the word 'coded' here too literally. It could simply be a feature of a room that you describe to the readers which contains a clue, but not obviously so, and that your character overlooks."
Pantsing a story?,"""Pantsing"" refers to simply writing a story without much, if any, preparation or pre-writing -- just writing down whatever comes to you, and letting the story go (and wander) wherever it feels like at the moment you're writing it down. As for etymology, I'm not sure where it comes from. In general, ""pantsing"" refers to a prank in which you pull someone's pants down, but I'm not sure how that plays into the idea of writing (aside from the fact that both can be surprising)."
How does a new writer keep from getting scooped?,"Your ideas are valueless. (Sorry!) My ideas are valueless too. There are approximately 197 billion story ideas floating around the litosphere just waiting for someone with a net to scoop them up.  What is valuable is your ability to take a literary idea and turn it into an interesting story. People who can do that are rare and difficult to find. I don't know if you are one of those people or not. (I don't even know if I am either.) But I do know this: Agents are not looking for stories, or for ideas, agents are looking for writers. Agents and publishers don't make money (or not reliably) off individual stories. They make money off writer's careers.  This is why an agent is just as interested in your ability to deliver professional work consistently and on time as they are in your ability to write an interesting story. They care about your dedication and reliability as well as your talent.  All of which adds up to, Agents are looking for commercially viable writers, and commercially viable writers are hard to find. If they think you are a commercially viable writer, they will want to represent you, not your story, but you. If they don't think you are a commercially viable writer, they will have no interest in your ideas either.  And to be frank, even if someone does come along and hear your idea and goes and makes a best selling novel out of it, you have lost nothing, because if you are a commercially viable writer, you can generate as many story ideas as you need, and if you are not, you were never going to realize any money off that idea anyway.   Ideas are dross. It is your vision and your talent that will make you a successful writer, and no one can steal either of those. "
What do you do when your message could be dangerous?,"If you don't want people rioting in the streets you should show how people are rioting in the streets in your novel - and how that way utterly fails to achieve what the people wanted to achieve.  Discourage the obvious, easy ways that you already see, the horrible and dangerous paths that people may think they should walk on when reading your novel. They need to realize that you believe it will end very, very badly for them if they follow that path. They need to see with their own eyes what horrors await those that follow the wrong path.  But the path that for example your protagonist takes: that way actually works! Show your readers that they can achieve their goal in a peaceful way or whatever way you choose to show. Don't view your message merely as ""The government is evil!"" - start viewing your message as ""The government is evil and I will show the population how they can make it better!""  In the end your readers some readers will misinterpret your text. And they will find new ways to interpret your work that you can't foresee. Your goal should be to get the message across to the majority by making it obvious how the dangerous ways that you already see are doomed to fail and how the peaceful way will help achieve the ultimate goal of making life better for everyone. Or whatever way you choose and whatever goal you have in mind.  Your message consists not only of a statement about your current day society - it consists of a statement about the current state, a way to go forward from here and a statement about how the world could be if everyone follows that way. Every other way will fail.  The world is not black and white and so is your fictional world. Show a different side of the whole struggle and a different approach that you believe people could reasonably come up with while reading your work and demonstrate the consequences of walking that path.  You want the government to take action? Show the government person taking action and succeeding while the riot on the outside only meant emergency law.  You want the people to have more humane animal farming? Show how much money can be made with humane animal farming while the old-school competitors are left in the dirt. You want people to value their privacy again? Show how much better your protagonist felt when they were off-grid while other people are losing their identity. "
How can I write a bigoted narrator while making it clear he is wrong?,"You need a counterweight - a character (or characters) who have to deal with the fallout from the main character's attitude. You could a lot of things like that from the point of view of the colossal jerk, and have him constantly wondering why all these people are being so ""mean"" to him - and him consistently failing to realize that it is his behaviour and attitude causing the problems. In other words, surround colossal jerk with normal people for contrast."
How do we objectively assess if a dialogue sounds unnatural or cringy?,"Trust your instinct. Period.  You are right--I zoned out at 'You turned me into a monster.' Who says that? I mean, I don't know whether to cringe or LOL. I didn't read further, but forcing myself to do so--No. Just no.  Try this: Natalia: ""F*ck you.""  Robert: ""I made the call. We're alive."" Natalia scoffs in disgust. ""At what cost,"" she says under her breath. Robert: ""If you want to die, go ahead. Otherwise, shut up."" You are trying to explain so much in your dialog that I think we should coin the term 'diodump.' Trust your reader to get the emotional message without the technical details. Monster? What? Not needed. ETA in response to comments: Natalia: ""F*ck you."" She felt like a monster. Like he'd violated her--even though she'd signed the consent form, she never thought he'd actually give her the nano-bot injection. Robert: ""I made the call. We're alive."" Natalia scoffs in disgust. ""At what cost,"" she says under her breath. The knowledge that she'd spend the rest of her life with those things inside her, coursing through her veins, it made her ill. Robert: ""If you want to die, go ahead. Terminate the bots. Otherwise, shut up."""
What's the best way to show a foreign language in a manuscript?,"You have two options depending on context: 1) If it's a quick exchange and can be figured out in context, put the foreign language in italics. ""As-tu le  livre?"" ""Yes, I have the book here."" or inline:  ""You filthy p'taQ!"" B'Elanna snarled. 2) If it's a quick exchange without context, put the translation afterwards and italicize that. ""Pour ma peine, ma punition, je tourne en rond,"" he sighed. For my pain, for my punishment, I pace in circles. Now Picard understood. inline: ""Qa'pla!"" Success! the Klingon shouted.  In any case, I would not have more than one or two exchanges in a foreign language. Either use a tag like ""she said in French"" so the reader realizes the characters aren't speaking English, or note in narration ""they discussed the matter in French for some time, but as Malcolm didn't speak the language, he had to wait for a translation."""
Should all books have page numbers?,"Even if you don't intend to index your entries by page number, you'll annoy quite a few people if you omit page numbers. ...and so on. Table of contents should always refer page numbers, but you're welcome to take liberties with the index; in particular, make it alphabetic - and you can use both systems: 131: Lion Abbey . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 87 132: Lion Cathedral . . . . . . . . . . . . 87 284: Lipp Wood . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .169"
"How to prevent ""they're falling in love"" trope","You cannot prevent that suspicion altogether; especially because that is your plan. Which means your two characters are heterosexual; so you can't really use homosexuality as a show-stopper. I would suggest you make it clear that one of them is already in love, and the other one knows it. If your guy is a jerk, that may be because he is unhappy, the woman he loves is not really in love with him, and he needs to learn in the course of the book that what he was feeling isn't really love at all.  If your girl is hateful; same thing, and same lesson: Maybe she is hateful because the guy she loves is a player, using her, and she has mistaken something else for ""love"". Something like dependency, or the lies of a player that convinced her they were in love but just uses her for sex. Other than sociopaths (who cannot fall in love) people are not jerks, or hateful, for nothing. Those traits grow out of psychic trauma of some sort. Start them out in the midst of their respective traumas, already clearly thinking they are in love, and it may defeat the reader's instinct to ship them.  But you cannot prevent shipping altogether, even Batman and Robin have been shipped!"
Can a book be written without an antagonist?,"A story without an ""antagonistic theme"" is a story with ""no conflict."" Conflict drives plot. Without plot, you have a character study. Without conflict, the character has no reason to change, grow, or develop, so there's not much to study. What in heaven's name (pun intended) could you write about without any conflict occurring?"
Is having antagonists who believe in Christianity potentially offensive/harmful?,"I think a matter that helps soften the blow for those who might take offense at your story (those who you don't intend to offend), is to have balance. If you depict someone as extremely evil, and twisting religion to accomplish or justify their dark actions, counterbalancing them with someone who actually uses the same religious doctrine or sentiment for good. Not only does it make it clear that as an author, you are not saying religion, or the specific religion is bad, you are saying that it is a tool, that can be used to help or harm. One other question used the example of the Hunchback of Notre Dame - because I am very unacademic, I use the example of the still quite good Disney version. Esmeralda, in singing to God to help the outcasts, she takes action to protect the downtrodden, while Frolo misinterprets Biblical warnings against the wicked as his right as a servant of God to carry out God's punishment. I feel like I come from a special place with this question, as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (often referred to as mormons, although official church teaching discourages that name). Few belief systems in the US receive such a constant barrage of negative criticism. When I find good, academic treatment of our church however, it may mention awful things like The Mountain Meadows Massacre, a vicious attack on innocents by members of our church - but it will counterbalance it with good our church members, then and now have done - it makes it clear that the event was a horrible exception to our doctrine, rather than our church's modus operandi. But it comes down to what you desire to say. Having counterbalance characters or examples of more positive interpretations of Christianity can not just say ""I don't hate Christianity"" but also be narratively interesting. Showing a character's disdain for anything good in their faith can show just how far they have warped things."
"How can I make ""acts of patience"" exciting?","I had to think about this one for quite a while, but finally I realized that there are two distinct kinds of patience, which I will call anticipatory patience and enduring patience.  Anticipatory patience is what gets you through the period of waiting for some exciting event. It is kids waiting for Christmas day. It is the nervous father pacing the hospital waiting room waiting for his child to be born. It is the soldier in a trench waiting for battle to begin. Anticipatory patience can be agonizing to live through, but it has an end and its tension comes from the anticipation of that end.  And, really, making anticipatory patience exciting should not be a big problem, because stories are built on the tension that comes from the anticipation of the climactic event. Stories keep the reader hooked on anticipation. Stories are an exercise in anticipatory patience.  Enduring patience is very different. Enduring patience deals with a fact of life that is not going to change, or is not going to change in any reasonable time frame that would place you into a state of anticipation. A prisoner serving a life sentence must exercise enduring patience. A parent with a severely disabled child must exercise enduring patience. Enduring patience is the denial of the very anticipation that is mainspring driving classical story structure. By its very nature, enduring patience is not exciting.  Does this mean that you can't build a novel around an act of enduring patience? No. For one thing, some literary novels don't have a classic story structure to begin with. They are more like extended vignettes. A skillful literary novelist could conceivably create an interesting novel around an act of enduring patience and have us all weeping by the end. But I don't think it would exactly be exciting.  The other possibility that occurs to me is that the act of enduring patience provides the background of the novel on which another kind of arc plays out. For instance, the person exercising enduring patience may follow an arc that leads them from bitterness and despair to love and acceptance, without changing the circumstances that demand their enduring patience. Could one consider such a story exciting? Perhaps you could. Once again it would seem to come down to building a sufficient level of anticipation for the climactic moment that leads to love and acceptance.  And, really, that would seem to apply to any story, regardless of subject matter. If you can build anticipation to a fever pitch, you will have an exciting climax, no matter how grim or how trivial the arc may be.  (It is perhaps worth noting in this regard that the excitement that comes from anticipation is different from the excitement that comes from sensory overload. Hollywood seems to have almost given up on the more difficult business of building anticipation in favor of simple sensory overload in every movie. But for the life of me I can't see how you could induce sensory overload in a tale of enduring patience.)"
How do you make a super villain's plan smart enough to outwit genuinely intelligent heroes but still have the heroes win?,"So first of all, as the writer, you have the advantage of crafting a story in any direction and you should focus on the villain's plan from the end and develop it towards the beginning.  Figure out what success looks like for the heroes... then figure out how the heroes find him.  Reverse the process of the story so that the villain gets all the key steps to the climax but leaves vulnerabilities for the heroes. If the villain is acting in an episodic fashion, then a great method to keeping him deadly but letting the heroes win is what TV Tropes calls ""The Xanatos Gambit."" The strategy was named after a villain from Disney's ""Gargoyles"" series, who was known by the fans, and eventually the heroes, to run schemes that were often designed to distract the heroes from his real goals. Often his schemes were done in such a way that if he won, he got to both defeat the heroes and get the real objective of his plot of the week. If he lost, he still won because he was able to distract the heroes long enough to accomplish his real goals. An example of this is how, in one episode, he stages a successful prison break of a character... by letting her know not to escape jail with the rest of the villainous team.   While they escaped and the Gargoyles spend the bulk of the episode recapturing them, the person he wants out remains in her cell... in doing so, she impresses the parole board enough to give her an early release.   Her fellow villains and the Gargoyles' fight against them were all for naught because the villain already won whether or not the action of the story went in his favor or didn't. The writer of the series (Greg Weisman) loves these types of villains and almost any work of his will have similar villains that have different motives than the obvious."
What keeps most authors writing after receiving multiple rejections?,"Welcome to the world of writers. That isn't sarcasm, by the way, that's truth. Let me tell you about my own tale, with a novel (series) called Altar of Warlords. This story has gone through a dozen major revisions, is being turned down right and left, and when I FINALLY have an agent that requests a full manuscript for her approval I'm so caught off-guard that I'm mid draft and the whole thing is a hot mess because of it. Now, let me say that I have a nursing background, but not necessarily science (other than the obvious ties through nursing). Before nursing I was in management and IT projects (predominantly system analysis and system design). So a lot of my work reflects this, and I can make actual coding in-story look like a programmer wrote it (surprise, surprise). All the while making a death scene look like an actual death scene (not the Hollywood crap where you get stabbed in the heart and die twenty minutes later, after having relayed the plot relevant message behind the guise of plot-armour). And yet, Altar of Warlords is turned down right, left and centre (as the saying goes). So why do I keep at it? Because I'm a writer. I have something interesting to say, I have lessons to teach, I have a story to tell. So I will just keep on swinging until I knock it outta the park. I will keep improving my story, and I will keep improving my writing until I get that lucky swing and get an agent that will represent me. Because I've heard stories of people getting an agent only after a decade of trying. I've heard stories of people choosing self-publishing because agents 'just don't see my genius'. There are options. But if the option you pick is traditional publishing, via an agent, and all that jazz? Then buckle up. You're now competing with the best for the limited seats available. Riddle me this: Are you a writer? If you are, then you'll keep writing. Because that's kind of our shtick; to write."
How to make characters more than the words on the page?,"In my mind's eye, the characters I write about are ""real people"": I do not ask myself what I want them to do. I ask myself what they would do in the given situation. I know their fears and their desires and their quirks, I know how they would respond to events, what they would want to say in a situation and what they would actually say. I can recognise when they are acting ""out of character"", and when they are being stilted puppets, and I rewrite both.  I like playing a little game with myself: when I go to the theatre or the cinema, or I read a book, I ask myself ""what this character of mine would say about this play/movie/story? What would be their experience of it if they were sitting right beside me?"" I do not know every single thing about my characters, but then I do not know every single thing about my real-life friends either. I still know what they would enjoy, how they would respond to things. In fact, if you think about it, you should know your characters better than your friends, since you can get into your characters' thoughts. How do you reach that level of character development? How do you make your characters ""take a life of their own""? You ask all those questions: why they're doing this, how, what they want to achieve, what are their misconceptions, what are their little quirks, how they would respond to situation X. You can think of it as dating your character, getting to know them, exploring, finding out what kind of people they are.   To clarify, you needn't sit and fill in the sheets of trivia you can find on the web, with questions like ""what is this character's favourite colour"". But when you write, ask yourself all the ""why""s and the ""how""s, and when you're doing day-to-day things, put your character in that situation. Very quickly things fall into place, you get the ""feel"" of the character, you know them. Once you know your character that well, questions about ""why character X would do A,B,C"" answer themselves."
How do I find logical errors in my novel?,"This is one of the methods I use for characters.
Each character has a separate page (you can do this in a notebook, jotter, online using onenote etc) and I note the following: I like to have this for every character who appears and is named in my writing, and when it comes to descriptions or references to family, I have my reference.   (Note that this is my method, which may not work for everyone, however feel free to if it does work.)"
"How to write a homosexual character, whose homosexuality isn't the point of the story?","My advice here would be: don't think in terms of ""right"" and ""wrong""; think in terms of structural arcs. You need to figure out what options for arcs you have, and which of those you actually want to use.  You've basically presented three possible arcs: The advantage of the ""upfront disclosure"" arc is that it gets you closest to your goal of your protagonist's sexuality being matter-of-fact, rather than making a big deal over ""OMG she's a lesbian.""  The disadvantage is that her sexuality can feel like an informed attribute, where you declare her to be a lesbian but that doesn't actually seem to come into play in any way, so the declaration feels artificial, or pointless, or like bald tokenism. In general, there's a popular assumption that the ""default character"" is straight, and that diverging from the default should only be done if the divergence makes some significant impact on the story. (That's a big discussion which I don't have scope to go into here, but it stems both from fiction's tendency towards ""conservation of details"" - i.e. ""significant details will prove to be important; otherwise you wouldn't put them in in the first place"" - and from popular social mores, by which most people consider a character being homosexual as a ""significant detail,"" while considering heterosexuality to be a sort of unremarkable, default expectation.) With the ""gradual reveal"" arc, your advantage is that by turning the attribute into a surprise, you've created an arc around it. It's in focus. The shape of the arc will force you to substantiate your protagonist's sexuality, so it won't feel like a minor detail or an aside; placing the revelation as the culmination of an arc makes it feel important. And the disadvantage is that you lose these sense of her being a lesbian as immediate established fact, as not exceptional or surprising. In many ways you might be undermining your protagonist's lesbian identity; if we can follow along with her for chapters or entire books without it ever coming up, then how important or significant can it be? It basically locks you into bringing in her sexuality in one very specific, fairly limited way. If you understand the advantages and disadvantages of both, then you can choose one, and compensate. If you want to deal with the risk of ""informed homosexuality,"" you compensate by finding other ways to make her sexuality evident and significant. If you want to deal with the disadvantages of the gradual reveal, you compensate by making the structure work and make sense, giving weight and meaning you want to your protagonist's sexuality, not just whatever fits most easily into an arc. And so on. But there's another alternative for you to consider, which could mesh well with either type of arc, or do the job on its own: consider a sideplot. You're mentioning multiple volumes, so you've got lots of room for secondary characters and sideplots. In that case, what you can do is establish a sideplot, which forms its own, more minor arc. And this arc has the same advantages that a primary arc has - it lets you put some focus on your protagonist's sexuality, it lets you make it important, and it lets you choose what's important about it, and how you bring it into play. I don't know your character or your setting, but you can come up with lots of ideas. A community of queer friends; a male ex from when your protagonist was coming to terms with herself; an arc about the kind of family your protag would like to have someday; a queer relationship between secondary characters that your protagonist is privy to. Any one of these could be the basis for a solid, secondary plot, which wouldn't overwhelm the main story, but would come up and recur. Another big advantage here is that a subplot lets you figure out some aspects of homosexual life that you're interested in spotlighting; being a lesbian affects a person's life far more than just ""what gender is my partner"", and it sounds like that one question isn't what you're interested in with this character. So consider: how is your character's life shaped or affected by her sexuality? Romance, relationships, community, worldview, social position, something else? What there interests you? When you look at it this way, I think you'll find that the ""gradual reveal"" arc is a subplot - it's just a specific one, climaxing with the revelation that the protagonist's sexuality exists. But if that isn't the subplot that you want, you just need to choose a different one you like better. Hope this helps. This can be a delicate issue, and you're swimming against some deeply-ingrained biases and expectations. So it makes sense that it be difficult, and feel unnatural and unbalanced. One approach is to say ""What the heck,"" and accept a balance that feels less than perfect - erring on the side of ""informed homosexuality,"" or using a simple ""revelation: lesbian"" arc. These can feel unsatisfying, but they're valued by many, not least because they're pushing against that deeply-ingrained default. If you're able to put in more effort and find something you feel really works, I think that's even better :)"
How do I define smells I have never experienced?,"Even for people who can smell, the sense is rarely precise enough to describe save by way of analogy.  Someone particularly interested in cooking or food in general might train themselves to be able to pick out and recognize the specific elements making up a scent, but for the general population, if you're not simply saying directly what something smells of, relate it to the general categories of its composition.  Something might smell metallic, earthy, floral, or oily, for example.  Wet materials usually, although not always, stand out over dry ones, and hot or even just warm ones over cold.  The longer something has been part of an area, the more it will be part of the background scent, and faintly noticeable even after cleaning.  And being imprecise is fine; most people will say 'the smell after rain,' not 'petrichor.' Although the specifics of what falls into each can vary from person to person, people will commonly also notice whether things smell fresh (clean, as in air untainted by perfume or vehicle exhaust, but also alive; a hospital, laboratory, or other sterile location would not generally fall into this category) or stale (dry, left too long; places that receive insufficient ventilation and foods that go bad without rotting).  Rot or (especially in older media) foulness is distinct from either; it's the wet, alive kind of bad smell, produced by most kinds of decomposition (and by extension, excrement and the like).  It's also far more noticeable than the other two, and will overpower most other scents present. How much can you taste?  The two senses are strongly linked when both are present, so almost any adjective you would apply to a taste can safely be applied to a scent.  Acrid smells, such as from strong cleaning substances or burning plastic or rubber, will sting the nose in the same way spice does the tongue. Another thing to keep in mind is that, as with touch, constant exposure will dull one's awareness of a scent.  Much as one is not constantly aware of the feeling of one's clothing, the smell of someone's own home or a perfume they wear daily will be almost unnoticeable.  Small changes to otherwise familiar environments will tug at one's awareness much like new clothing.  The smell of an unfamiliar location, however, will be primarily noticeable when first entering it. Finally, as OldBat alluded to, for most people, scent is strongly linked to memory.  The majority of scents won't be connected to anything in particular, but it's common for someone to have specific things they can't smell without being reminded of past events.  A particular recipe might, for example, not smell just 'of cookies' but 'of weekends at Grandmother's house.'  Not to be overused, but good for adding some emotional association to a scene. Charles Staats brings up another excellent point: Note also that association plays a significant role -- I personally dislike the smell of fresh cut grass, for instance, because I associate it with itchy eyes (because of my allergies). Especially relevant here are the smells of coffee, alcohol, and tobacco -- these will typically smell awful to someone who does not use them, but good to someone who does. (Or so I understand -- the only one of these I can personally attest to is coffee.) Tobacco smoke especially is interesting since many ex-smokers detest the smell."
How can someone become a beta reader?,"Great question! A great difficulty here is that there's not really much in the way of ""professional beta readers."" Someone who's really known for giving excellent feedback, and offers that as a service, is pretty much an editor of some stripe. So aiming to become ""well-known"", ""popular"", or ""respected"" as a beta reader might not be in the cards (although it's not impossible!). And turning into something paid is... well, it's really hard, because it's asking people to trust and pay you, in an area where it's really hard to Show Your Work, and where you've got a lot of competition that's a lot safer.   But you can certainly become a good and busy beta reader. And that's pretty darn doable. This is something anybody can do. Sign up to Critters, dive into Absolute Write, check out Scribophile -- all of these give an endless supply of material to beta-read. Some of them have even more: community, social connections, and/or guidance on becoming a better beta. There is a catch: this is mostly going to be amateur work; often painfully so. For two reasons: BUT. If you're just getting started, then working with amateurs is great. It will let you learn.  You'll be finding your feet, learning your own taste, and figuring out how to give feedback that's helpful, constructive, and clear. And, the fact that most of the work will be amateurish, doesn't mean you won't find absolute gems. I certainly have. If you are active in any community that's even partially related to writing, you can often do really well by making connections within a small, focused group, that would be much harder if you were just hanging out your shingle for anybody in the world. If you have any particular hobbies or fandoms, some of those people probably like writing. If you are, as so many of us are, living in a particular geographical location, there are probably a whole bunch of writers nearby. Maybe they go to the library; maybe they already have critique circles you can join. What's nice about these is that they're personal connections that last much longer than the critique of any one manuscript or story. Make a good connection with one writer, and you'll probably get to beta-read a whole bunch of their work. You'll be friends on social media, and see when they're looking for readers. When other people are looking for readers, your friend can point them to you. Actual connections get you far. There is so much of this, and being involved will drop opportunities in your lap. People who need beta readers will ask for them -- and you can volunteer.  Follow authors you love. Follow authors who say interesting things. Follow newbie authors writing about being a newbie author. Join social media groups for writers. I've gotten a bunch of really interesting reads, just by following some awesome people, who pointed me at something interesting that one particular time. Neither of these are the same things as beta-reading. But they will work on the same muscles, and they'll also put you in the right arena -- meeting writers, establishing a reputation.  Slush-reading means reading unsolicited short story manuscripts for a magazine, and writing up comments to the editor. It's much briefer and coarser-grained than beta-reading -- but it is evaluating manuscripts, and even working with an editor (to some degree). Check out magazines (especially online magazines) in fields that you like. See if they're open for applications. And reviewing -- anybody can open a blog and start reviewing. Gaining an audience is much harder. But you can start out for practice, and to build yourself a little online home-base. And, you might consider looking for existing, established sites which publish reviews. Again, a review is very very different from a beta-read -- it's aimed at the readers, or at prospective readers, not at the author -- but it's still a very helpful skill to develop. Let people know! Tell friends and followers that you enjoy beta-reading, and that you'd love them to send material your way. Especially tell this to writers you beta read, and especially the ones you enjoyed working with -- they're likely to write something else next, and you'd love it if they went right to you and wanted your feedback. I hope this helps make sense of things, gives you a sense of options, and offers some concrete things you can do next. All the best!"
How to make readers know that my work has used a hidden constraint?,"Nowhere in Green Eggs and Ham does Dr. Seuss tell you that the whole thing is written using exactly 50 different words. It's an ""Easter Egg"" as @Alexander points out in a comment. It's for readers to notice, or learn about from others having noticed. An Easter egg is fun because the reader has a moment of ""oh cool, it really is only 50 different words, I haven't noticed it before"" (to continue with the same example). Had Dr. Seuss informed the readers of the constraint, the effect would have been instead ""author stroking ego with unnecessary BS"". Discovering that a verse is in fact an acrostic, or that the novel doesn't use a certain letter, or anything similar, is only fun when you discover it yourself, or when a friend shows you and then you go and check for yourself. It's not fun when the author tells you about it, and takes away from you the glee of the discovery. You wouldn't want game developers to publish a list of all Easter Eggs when they release a game, right? They wouldn't be Easter Eggs then. Same here. Crucial to the Easter Egg effect is that the piece of literature must be thoroughly enjoyable without ever finding the Easter Egg. Green Eggs and Ham is fun regardless. The Easter Egg is a nice bonus, it's not the main thing your creation has to recommend itself."
How can I Avoid Being Frightened by the Horror Story I am Writing?,"Also draw on that fear. I read in Jeff VanderMeer's ""Wonderbook"" about a concept called ""writing from your scar,"" which could also be applicable to your situation also. Basically, it means drawing on those experiences that have left a scar on you (figuratively). You could apply this to your situation by drawing on your fear, incorporating it into your characters' psyches, instilling microtension into all of their thoughts and actions via this fear vs what they want to achieve. If you can do this, you might be able to use your fear to your advantage. But if you feel inclined to writing what scares you (and I applaud you for this act of literary courage), you must not avoid, but rather explore. Good luck."
Signs of Bad Character Development,"Well, first and foremost - do you believe in the character? Do you think he/she is sympathetic? If so, you're already in a good position - because you have a believable, sympathetic character, you just haven't convinced your readers of that yet - meaning, if you get negative critiques on the point, you just need to figure out why you like the character, and focus on bringing those elements out more strongly. But that's not what you asked - you asked about warning signs. Here are a few: That's what I've got at the moment... Hope these are helpful :)"
"How to avoid hearing ""that's me!"" from your friends when they read your characters, and that wasn't your intent?","My answer is: steal a little.  For example, your character needs to be a big spender, or a big gambler. If you have a friend who is impulsive in every capacity — overly generous with money, dashes off for a weekend jaunt to Mexico on a whim, walks into a store for a pair of headphones and walks out with a new stereo, eats anything put in front of him, drives like every street is the Autobahn — then pick one facet of that impulsivity, like spending without thinking, and give that to your character.  Don't copy any phrases this friend says, and don't use any real-life incidents. Just keep that person's single habit in mind when developing the character. That will help give the fictional person real texture without making an avatar out of someone who doesn't want to be so enshrined. "
"Is there a name for the technique in songs/poems, where the rhyming pattern primes the listener for a certain line, which never comes?","I believe it would just be called a teasing rhyme, or more widely a mind rhyme. As in the link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_rhyme: Mind rhyme is the suggestion of a rhyme which is left unsaid and must be inferred by the listener. Mind rhyme may be achieved either by stopping short, or by replacing the expected word with another (which may have the same rhyme or not). Teasing rhyme is the use of mind rhyme as a form of innuendo, where the unsaid word is taboo or completes a sentence indelicately."
How to identify whether a publisher is genuine or not?,"First, real publishers don't advertise. It is really as simple as that. No legitimate publisher advertises for submissions because any real publisher is bombarded with manuscripts on a constant basis. Their concern is not to find more. Their concern is to make the barrage stop. If real publishers are looking outside of the slush pile for authors, they look to agents or they go after established writers or celebrities directly. Real publishers don't advertise. End of story.  Second, real publishers don't charge writers money. Real publishers give writers money. If you are giving them money, they are not a publisher. They are, at best, a publishing services company that performs some of the mechanical aspects of publishing for a client. It is the client, and not the services company that is the publisher. Thus the term self-publishing. Notably, such companies do not perform the single most important function of a publisher, which is determining the market potential of a book before publishing it. If they ask you for money, they are not a real publisher.  There are plenty of other ways to check as well. Multiple sites keep track of the industry and report on dubious practices. There are probably different ones for different markets, but https://www.sfwa.org/other-resources/for-authors/writer-beware/ is one of the mainstays. Finally, there are directories like Writer's Market, the Writers and Artists Yearbook, and Duotrope that list legitimate publishers and put some degree of effort into verifying them. Again, there are probably different titles in different markets.  To determine if a publishing services company is at least honest in their business practices, you would do the same kind of consumer research that you would do before hiring any other kind of services company. Google them, look for reviews, check with other clients, check that they have a physical business address, check how long they have been in business, check with the Better Business Bureau, etc. "
Is it okay to kill off a main LGBT love interest?,"As you describe it I don't see the problem, and you aren't buying into the trope. The trope is that LGBTQ characters are expendable; you are writing the opposite of that: Your killed lesbian is so not expendable, the hero (LGBTQ lover) is going to move heaven and Earth to both avenge her and bring her back from the dead, and succeeds. That is how powerful LGBTQ love is, it defies death. You are not minimizing the value of their lives, You've got Superman (as a woman) flying faster than light, a blur around the Earth, to reverse time and save Lois Lane from being killed. The trope is offensive because it treats LGBTQ characters as inherently flawed and therefore less valuable and more expendable than Hetero characters. According to your story description, you are not doing that."
"Not wanting to ""spoil"" a story due to lack of skill","Who told you it's bad to rewrite a story? That's terrible advice. No one ever publishes something without a ton of rewrites, and many well-known writers revisit similar themes over and over. It took me a long, unproductive time to realize that writing is a process, and that you have to embrace it. You only get better by doing it. You can't produce something good except by work and rework, by writing and rewriting. Not every word will be gold, and that's more than okay. The less fixated you are on the final result, the better your work will become. I'm personally working on a novel that was based on a dream I had 15 years ago. I've previously tried writing it as a story, a graphic novel and screenplay. I feel like each iteration added depth I couldn't have gotten any other way. Or, if you'd prefer a example from a famous author, consider Nabakov. His masterwork, Lolita, reworked themes from his much less successful novel of seventeen years earlier, Laughter in the Dark. Keep in mind, no one has to see your drafts (although getting good critiques is a crucial way to improve). You might write a version today that's terrible. That's progress! Let it sit in a drawer for a while, and learn to fix the things that are wrong with it. When you get it back out again, you'll be in a better position to write it more as you want it to be. The only time rewriting is a problem is when it's no longer making anything better, when it's a retreat from sharing your work and letting people react to it. But that's not your problem today. You can't let the fear of it stop you from even getting started."
How much character growth crosses the line into breaking the character,"Breaking character is not a function of the beginning or destination of the character's journey / progression.  Breaking character is not even some out-of-the-way stopover in the middle.  Breaking character is any implausible discontinuity between steps. Consider Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader.  Which one, you ask?  Plucky young boy with promise?  Lovesick Jedi with questions?  Tortured antihero, teetering on the edge of absolute corruption?  Main antagonist and right-hand-man of the greatest evil in the known universe?  Redeemed and dying savior of his son, who is the last and first Jedi? None of these personas was outside the character.  Complaints focus rather on whether specific transitions / characterizations were well done.  (And some of the characterizations were NOT well done.) That said - too sharp a change in a character, however plausible you make it, may shift you into a different kind of STORY, and you might lose the audience which, say, signed on to the Die Hard series for semi-realistic underdog action stories, not Invincible Action Hero stories."
What makes writing emotional?,"Alright, so to infuse personality into a paper, there are lots of things you can try. This might seem silly, but it works. Read something unusual. If you're having problems because your prose is too dry, read something so soapy you could scrub the dishes with it. Do you normally read scientific articles? Read a graphic novel. Do you normally read classics? Read a thriller. You can also try to read things by authors that have high technical skill, but are also known for something else. Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, and J.R.R. Tolkien come to mind, along with many others. Also, vary your sentence length significantly within each paper. It helps. Fragments might be grammatically inadvisable, but for slamming home a point, they can be invaluable. If you use it too much, it just becomes a cheap trick, but at the proper place, at the proper moment, it's more of a flourish. Use sentence length to compliment your intention. Do you want it to flow smoothly, and relax the reader? Or do you want it to jolt them, and jerk them, and keep them alert? The same goes for word length. Using multisyllabic words is no bad thing, but sometimes the smaller words are better. A little asceticism can go a long way. Using words with stop consonants can also have the same effect, but it's less constant. Using lots of b's and p's doesn't really work, but k's, g's, and t's can make a sentence ""harder,"" if you will. D's are on the borderline. In the previous paragraph, I wrote the sentence ""It helps."" towards the beginning. Replace it with ""It will aid you immensely in manipulating the reader's emotions"" or something and see if you think it changes the tone. Or compare ""You're being stupid."" to ""Idiot!"" Think of all the synonyms for ""idiot"" you know of, think of how/why you'd use them, and then try to analyze the differences between them. Unless you don't feel emotion when you insult people, of course. :) As another example, allow me to shamelessly steal the example from Claudiu's answer: ""I think the king's policies were ridiculous. How could he possibly think of continuing to raise taxes when his peasants were starving?"" Instead of trying to make it sound smarter, try to make it sound harsher. You are, after all, making a rather pejorative judgement: ""The king's policies were idiotic. In his desire for power he continued to increase taxes, without regard or respect for his people's inability to feed themselves, let alone further fill his coffers."" I replaced ""ridiculous"" with ""idiotic"" because it has a faster, staccato rhythm, partially due to the facts that it has fewer consonants overall and what few it has are all stops.  Another trick I used there was stating the opinion as a fact. I don't think the policies were ridiculous, they were quite inarguably idiotic! The other answers have some excellent advice. I hope this helps as well. This is already too long, but if I think of anything else incredibly useful, I'll add it. EDIT: I should have said this first. In your writing there are bound to be lots and lots and lots of little things that make your writing yours. Look for those things. When you find them, build on them before you try to take any suggestions you find here. No matter how good someone else's advice may be, it's still someone else's, and adopting it can make your writing just seem artificial. Try to develop the personality you already have, not the one your professors think you should have. Even if it makes your writing less than ""perfect,"" if it's honestly written, they'll appreciate it. And if they don't, their opinions aren't worth taking seriously outside of how it affects your grade."
How to derive a storyline from a beginning?,"You have an inciting incident and a protagonist.  In a typical story, this inciting incident forces upon the protagonist their central dilemma / opportunity, and addressing this dilemma / opportunity is what the story is about. The two of those together should explode, and apparently for you they fizzled.  Here is a straightforward example: If my character's single-engine plane crashes at sea, and she is the sole survivor and swims to a deserted island, she has a dilemma if she wishes to return to society. She has an opportunity if she does not. I don't know what the story is about if she doesn't care either way. For me as a writer I cannot write a story about a protagonist that truly doesn't care what happens to them; I am not that skilled! Now that is pretty straightforward as an inciting incident. If she wants to be rescued like nearly everybody would, it is Castaway or Robinson Crusoe. To write a story where this wreck is an opportunity, I need to make it plausible. First, she needs a damn good driving reason and a certain kind of personality to consider living alone on an island indefinitely a viable proposition, and then a plausible reason to do it. I need to make sure those traits and that situation is clear in Act I. Either way, the inciting incident creates a story based on the personality and situation of the protagonist, and by the end of Act I the inciting incident is a done deal and she is faced with a decision of what to do next. In The Hunger Games, the inciting incident (a lethal threat to somebody our hero loves) is immediately dealt with, but still plausibly throws our hero into her own particularly lethal and morally fraught fight for survival. On to your story: A less straightforward inciting incident may feel to the writer momentous and exciting, but if their protagonist, her emotions and her situation are under-developed, then she (the protagonist) has no clear reaction to the incident, or just typical reactions everybody else has. She doesn't stand out, the incident creates for her only the typical dilemma (or opportunity) it presents everybody else, she is not unique in her response and she is interchangeable with other characters. We call that 'cardboard'. The reader needs a reason to understand her as a unique person, and you need to give her traits or a past so she plausibly has a strong desire spring forth from the inciting incident. In stories where the strong desire is typical --- protect a loved one, return to normality, take vengeance on the guilty --- I would have to give the character some unusual character elements, mental or personality or ability, or isolate them (as in Castaway) so the audience has no choice but to follow them. In many stories the hero is unusually skilled, astute, perceptive or gifted in some way. My first thought is that, if your discovery writing experiment meanders, then your protagonist is not motivated by the inciting incident to accomplish anything. That is an underdevelopment in Act I of your protagonist, the inciting incident should incite them. Of course your protagonist might be somebody you like, and you don't want to change them: But then you must change your inciting incident to incite that personality to do something. Either hurt the crap out of the protagonist, or make them choose to risk their life out of love, or give them an opportunity that makes them abandon everything to pursue. Then your missing story comes to light so you can plot it, because I see roughly three core plots: Your protagonists succeeds, fails, or learns and changes her mind about what constitutes success and failure. Once she wants something (or someone) so much she devotes her immediate future to nothing but that, you can plot a story. If you can't figure out the story, you need to change something so the inciting incident incites your protagonist and creates a terrible dilemma (or fantastic opportunity). ADDED: If this still doesn't answer your question, I would look at your inciting incident and consider the ramifications of it, both for some individuals and the world of your protagonist. What is the worst thing this incident does to people? Or to people that continue to live; e.g. if the worst thing is killing them, then consider the emotions of the living that cared about the killed, or survivors with lives ruined or facing hardship or a bleak future. The consequences of your inciting incident must be awful or great for somebody, and you need your protagonist to be one of them."
"When my story has a powerful phrase but that loses its power when I read it again in the next day, should I keep it or remove it?","I believe it's better to steam through and finish your first draft without constant editing and second guessing everything you've written. This is because you will learn so much about your novel during that process, and will settle into a style and rhythm. If you reread everything immediately then you are at risk of what you've described - not seeing it with fresh eyes. As you say, it's like any good joke - it's so funny the first time it sticks in your mind, and the impact can never be had twice. That doesn't make it less of a good joke. Of course there will be times when your epic, genius sentence actually isn't any good, and does need to be cut. However, I would argue that you, the next day, will be a poor judge of that. You, sometime later, reading the text with fresh eyes will be a better judge. Members of a writing group will be even better, and a professional editor also. So my advice would definitely not be to cut it prematurely. Move on, finish the novel and come back to it later to see how you feel about it."
"Can I be a writer, with a mental illness?","It is totally possible to become a writer with a mental illness, even Schizoaffective Disorder. I'd suggest that you may have greater self-awareness and coping strategies as a result. Whatever works for you. But start with a manageable and reproducible target. Even if it's one hour per day. Start there and grow to suit your situation. If I had to pick an number I'd say aim for 2 hours per day. You can write 50,000 words in a month - that matches NaNoWriMo target and is the length of The Great Gatsby. Most beginner writers aim for 2 blocks of 2 hours (that they fit in before and after school/work). Interestingly many professional writers I've spoken to also write in blocks of 2 hours. Very few write non-stop for 6-8 hours a day. I suspect that those ones dictate to a transcriber or dictation app. Dictation is a skill I wouldn't recommend learning just yet. Like playing a musical instrument writing is a skill. You cannot begin writing at 8 hours per day. Instead build up to it based on what works for you. Professional classical musicians practice from 1 to 8 hours per day, but research suggests results diminish after 2 hours. Mindful writing is required. Actually producing words, not editing - that is a separate effort. Count your daily word output and log it somewhere. On a spreadsheet, in an exercise book, on a whiteboard (take a photo of it from time to time). As you produce words the ""run-rate"" and total word count will motivate you.  What you write at this stage doesn't matter. 800 words on the outline or plot is still 800 words. Just classify it as outline, plot, Chapter X.  I find it useful to also log the time it took. You may like to add up to 10 words to describe the session (feelings, thoughts, whatever but keep it brief) Writing is about starting. After that writing is about finishing. Finish the draft. It doesn't matter if it is good, you're not going to show that first draft to anyone. Get the words out. If the writing is ugly or ineloquent, keep going. Trust that you will fix it in the next draft. If you notice a minor plot problem make a note for later (e.g. how does our hero fly this plane if earlier I wrote he has epilepsy and never learned to drive?) Major plot or character problems may require you to retrace your steps by going back and changing things. I would suggest making a note about the problem and proceeding if possible as if you'd fixed it earlier.  The goal is to finish the draft. It is like climbing Everest. Once you are in the danger zone you have 2 options - reach the summit or return to base camp. Our inner editor/reader/critic is the main reason most people do not write more or finish much. Don't edit while you are writing and don't write while you are editing.  After you write X words or Y minutes/hours take a short break before reviewing the words. Ideally don't revise the work until you have the first draft completed. If you must review I suggest reviewing the previous day's work or even the work from last week. Avoid the trap to you tweak as you write. After you finish your first story (short- or novel), start the next one immediately during your next writing session. Edit the first story in your editing session. So if you write for 2x2hrs each day you can either make the second 2hr block an editing session or you can fit a third 2hr editing session in. See how you feel.  Keep reminding yourself that you will fix the writing and plot problems in the next draft. Create an outline - it may or may not be ""canon"" for your story. I find my characters go off on their own. Break the project down to chunks. You don't need to plan those chunks down to daily goals. They should be specific and they should be achievable in a week. Every writing session has an outcome. It can be either a word count or a story point. Tell yourself what part of the story you are telling this session. If you get distracted after a chapter or two spend some time writing short stories that are finished in one writing session. Then work on longer short stories that take a few sessions to finish. Build up to stories that take a week to finish. Finally you'll be ready to move to stories that take a month to a year to finish a draft. Practice your editing process on the short stories if you like. I write on my laptop in a variety of places but I have a special place that I churn out words. The familiarity reinforces your brain that this is writing space and time. Use either a post-it note or a big sign above your screen, but put up that goal.  Today I will write ""The hero arrives at the camp"" A file (or collection of files) to collect ideas (i.e. Sparks). Periodically review to refocus and generate new tasks. -- Fritz Freiheit on Sparks  This helps with motivation but is really about writing process. I have a text file in my writing directory called _Sparks.txt (so it sorts to the top). I have it open in my editor but minimised.  If I get a great idea while writing my current goal, I quickly type the pertinent points out in the Sparks file and save it for later. If later I can't tell what was so fascinating about the idea then it was just a distraction. Normally I still like the idea when I return to it. My sparks range from single lines e.g.
* I am a minor league mansplainer
to 500 words of plot or setup or even a picture I found online (I save picture inspiration to pinterest.com) I count words I add to the spark file in a separate column on my daily log. When I want to start a new project I open the Sparks file and pick a project. I create the folder for the project in my writing directory, I cut the spark note out and put it in the project directory, along with other inspiration and log files. I print out my first draft double spaced with 1"" margins. I edit with a pen and hand write the changes. My second draft is then written by retyping the entire thing incorporating my notes and changes - no cutting and pasting. That is the second draft. Rinse and repeat. Nobody ever gets to see my first draft or any draft I haven't finished because... The First Draft is Sacred!"
What does Show don't Tell actually mean,"Chuck Palahniuk, an accomplished master of showing, suggested an exercise to learn not to tell. The exercise is to not use ""thought verbs"". Instead of telling the reader what a character thinks or feels, you have to show them how they behave. Palahniuk calls this ""un-packing"" the emotion or thought. Using this exercise and Palahniuks examples, we can understand what the difference between ""showing"" and ""telling"" is. When you use thought verbs to ""tell"" how a character feels or what they think, you tell the reader what to think. When you avoid thought verbs and ""show"" the reader the raw version of the world, – and to come to a different conclusion than you. Let's look at an example. John loves Joan. This tells the reader how to interpret John's behavior. While Every day John bought Joan a flower and walked to the other side of town to lay it on her door step - then quickly ran away so she wouldn't see him. shows the reader what John does. And the reader might disagree with you. The reader might think that what you show is not love, but, for example, obsession, and that John is stalking Joan. A writer who tells claims to understand the world. When I write ""John loves Joan"", I do not in fact tell you that John loves Joan, but that I know what love is and that I know John's mind better than he does himself. But different people have different ideas of love. And most people don't know how they feel. They feel sexually attracted to someone, or they care for the wellbeing of someone, or they are afraid of loosing someone's care and attention. Showing means that you do not fob off the reader with an abbreviation of the story but give them the wealth of sensory input that being in the story would entail. Which requires good observational skills and a mastery of language. Showing and telling have to be distinguished from first and third person narration. ""I love Joan"" is telling in first person, ""Every day I put flowers in front of Joan's door"" is showing in first person. Showing and telling must also be distinguished from interiority and exteriority. The examples above take an outside view of events, and just as you can tell or show what goes on from outside, you can tell or show thought processes. Telling interiority looks exactly like telling exteriority: John loves Joan. Showing interiority can of course not completely avoid thought verbs, because we lack the words (and probably the self-reflective power) to describe the details of our thought processes, but it can ""un-pack"" the abbreviations and abstain from interpreting more than necessary: Laying the flowers on Joan's door step, he strained to listen for any sounds from within. Every creaking or bump sent a jolt of terrified lust through his tense body. John both hoped and feared that Joan would catch him, and he was both glad and disappointed as he walked away from her house. These examples aren't well written, but I hope you can still understand the idea I'm trying to convey. Related questions:"
How to deal with self-criticism?,"There is a wonderful book by Dorothea Brande called Becoming A Writer, published in 1934, but still widely read today and often cited.  In it Brande talks about developing two selves for the writer, a split personality, with one self being a creative, sensitive and artistic person and the other being a detail-obsessed sharp minded editor.  The two personalities are both needed for a good work, but they should never meet and you should be able to turn them on and off at will. I think this applies here.  You need to turn off the Creative, Artistic side and whip out Spock the Editor when dealing with criticism.  Then, when it is time for more first drafts and creativity, bring out the Artist again and send Spock back to his closet."
Tips for expanding my vocabulary?,"Reading is probably the best way, but there are a few others that have worked for me. One way is to keep a dictionary handy. From time to time, pick a random word, learn how to pronounce it, and write it in a sentence or two.  You can use a thesaurus in a similar manner. When you find words you like, add them to a journal (print or text). Refer to the journal when you write - try to add your ""new words"" to your writing."
How much planning should go on before beginning writing?,"The only thing that matters in planning, is doing it long enough to make you feel comfortable writing about your story.  There are two types of writers, ""With an Outline"" and ""Without an Outline"". Try both styles and see which works best for you. It's important to figure out if you do your best writing with constraints or without them. Find a middle ground between the two types that helps you stay on track while maintaining creativity. If you feel your creativity being sucked dry by trying to stay with the outline, then you over planned."
A torrent of foreign terms,"This is the same problem that experts always have when trying to explain their field to the general public. My advice is: don't be such a purist.  I develop software for a living. Computer systems are complicated and we have lots of technical terms. But I avoid using technical terms when talking to people who are not computer savvy. I don't say, ""we scan the BTREE index using a pre-order traversal to find the records with matching GUIDs, retrieve the designated control intervals, and parse the records"". I'll say something more like, ""we get the customer's order information"". Is the first ""the right terms""? Sure. When I'm talking to another computer person, I use technical terms to avoid ambiguity. But when I'm talking to a non-computer person, they're just confusing. I've routinely heard the piece of red cloth that a matador uses referred to as a ""red cape"". Ok, so that's not the technically correct term. But readers know what you mean when you say it, rather than having to figure it out. If I read a story and come across some specialized word that I didn't know, I often think, huh, so I learned a new word. But if there are dozens, it just gets daunting. It's too much work. I'd use common, descriptive words. If you find yourself screaming ""but that's not the RIGHT word"", I'd say just grit your teeth and do it anyway. :-)"
How to Write an Eldritch Abomination?,"The problem here is that by giving him a clearly understandable (even if evil, misantropic) goal, you're making your Fenrisúlfr more human-like. 
Sure, we can say - by rough sketch - that it wants to eradicate life.  But to be truly ""so far from human comprehension"" we need to cut off any human understandable explanation from his actions.   Your question reminded me of Agent Smith's speech in the Matrix about humans being infestant and nocive as viruses: a memorable scene, and surely a villain-nesque one. Smith is a villain and can be surely defined as evil from a standard ethic-point of view.  On the other hand, most Eldritch abominations in Lovercraft's lore are able to make humans go mad just by existing. C'htulu and his playmates can make you mad and transform your brain into pudding by lifting a finger, but it's ever unclear if they do that intentionally or it's just a side effect. Cosmic horror is given, in the end, by the terrible randomness of it all, that challenges and questions our innate sense of cause-effect. By contrast, check this question on Worldbuilding's stackexchange about a somewhat good-willed abomination which tries to avoid human going mad: link So, the point that I'm trying to make is that we may as well synthesize  Fenrisúlfr's goal as ""wanting to destroy life"", but we should stop at that. Why does it wants that? How does he plan to achieve that? Ultimately, the less we know, the more uncomprehensible he will be. The reader (and the characters) should ask themselves: yes, it appears it's trying to destroy life, but are we certain of it? Sometimes Fenrisúlfr's influence should produce inexplicable effects, or straight up conter-intuitive ones (like giving power to a good, untainted character, or partake in the defeat of a human villain, or destroying a dictator in the midst of a killing spree...).  That's because the way Fenrisúlfr perceives reality should be so alien from our own that we cannot possibly comprehend it. So, it may as well try to manipulate humans, but it must be done in a so subtle and a twisted way that it's not straight-up recognizable.  In western culture, we have the idea of the tempting devil - Satan popping up from smoke, promising to grant us wishes if we do bad - but that's the very thing we're trying to avoid. Satan, in most portrayals, is simple: we undestand him roughly and man, he does understand humans a lot. So we can deal with him, and sometimes trick him into failure.  But Fenrisúlfr? Its mind is so complicated that we can't grasp but a small portion of it.  And, while being generally more powerful and intelligent than humans, there's a good chance that he can't comprehend us in the same way we can't comprehend ants. Our minds are substantially different. That may be a good reason why sometimes, Fenrisúlfr's plans fail: it just cannot comprehend fully human behaviour (after all, we're alien to it). So, in short, my suggestion is: remember that when writing Fenrisúlfr, if you apply human-like desires or intentions to it, they should be only gross approximations. Make it random. Make it fail, if need be. Make it unforeseeable. "
What is a discovery writer?,"Stephen King, by my understanding, was a discovery writer. I will paraphrase what he wrote in his book On Writing.  You create some real, believable characters, put them in a challenging situation, and then let them decide where the book would go. If you have done enough work on character development, then your characters should be able to decide how they would act in a certain situation.  The writer should not then try to force the characters to act in the way he would want to act. If the characters you created would want to run away from danger, for example, you should not force them to be brave. The fun in this approach is that the book can take strange, surprising turns, which can surprise both the readers and the author. The disadvantages that I know about are, it is very hard to pull off, and not a good approach if you are under a deadline by an editor. Also, this approach works well, if like Stephen King, you can easily type 300,000 words for a novel, and then trim it down. If like me, you struggle to reach even the 50,000 of Nanowrimo, this approach will fail miserably."

How to know if your own story is surprising?,"There are three techniques that I use to test if the twist was surprising. If the idea was one of the first things I thought of then, no it is probably not surprising but obvious. At least obvious to me. The exception to this is when I find myself grinning like a loon and thinking ""damn, that is clever"". Of course, I might be deluding myself but gut reactions count for something. Again this is just me, but when I imagine my characters (who tend to be fairly genre savvy) do I sense any surprise? If the antagonist or the protagonist would say something sarcastic about seeing it coming then, no. However, if I can reasonably see all the characters being caught completely off guard... I chair a charity that runs a writers' group. If I want to know how well my twist works I give it to some members. The back sheet will have 4 or 5 questions and one of those questions will be ""did you see the twist coming and how surprised were you?"" There are a number of tried and tested methods for making a twist surprising. The more of them that have been used, the more likely your twist is to be surprising. If your story is full of twists and even half of them are somewhat surprising, then the whole story should be fairly surprising. Even an obvious twist or plot development can be made to be surprising. It is all in the setup. After all, something is surprising when it is not what we were expecting. Feed your reader some red herrings. That is some clues that point in the wrong direction or turn out to be unimportant. Red herrings are a vital part of a good mystery. The reader will enjoy trying to figure out which clues are really important. Similar to the red herring technique a good story teller can make the most obvious ending by drawing the readers attention away from the magic just like a stage magician would. Red herrings are part of this approach. A big part. Other methods include drawing attention to something only to have it pay off later, sooner, or not at all. (Be very careful with that last one). While the reader is caught up in the action, for example, a chase scene, this is the perfect opportunity to slip in a vital detail in an off-hand way. Casually mention it when the action is most frantic and then turn it up to eleven. Most readers will fail to realise the importance of the detail (if you did a good job). One way to bring the surprise factor is to set up a common story trope (say a princess with a magical problem) and then as the expected conclusion approaches take things in a totally different direction. The princess refuses to marry the hero, the hero gets eaten by the dragon, the frog is happy to remain a frog... You get the idea. Sometimes we assume too much based on the information we have at hand. Use this. You can give the reader clues based not only on what you say but on what you clearly do not say. Take, for example, a scene where a lady is walking down the aisle and thinking about her boyfriend and the day he proposed. Then the director yells cut. You never said this was the wedding but you kinda, sorta, implied it. As I said, use with care because this can come off as cheap. This is the format of many jokes. An Englishman, An Irishman, and a Scotsman go into a bar... The characters do something and there is a result. The characters (or some characters) do it again with the same result. Then they or another do the thing for the third time only now... This trope is exactly why I love road runner cartoons. You know that no matter how many times Wile E. Coyote tests that trap, the Road Runner will not trigger it. No matter how often the Road Runner does something it will go badly the first time Wile E. Coyote tries it. Never pull out a fact that the reader and the characters had no way of knowing to pull off your surprise. While this will be surprising, the reader will feel cheated."
How do I overcome a lack of motivation to write at home?,"There are a lot of different ways you can overcome a lack of motivation, here are a few that I've come up with. Write somewhere outside of your usual places. This can be a coffee shop or a home office, but it has to be the sort of place you don't do other things at. The idea is to take you out of the familiar places where you can fall back into the usual patterns. This shouldn't be the sort of place (or computer if you can afford it) that you use to play games or watch TV. It's a place for writing, and you go there to write. Schedule a block of time. Sometimes just writing an hour everyday can help. It's worked for me when I've been in a longer slump. Goal and Rewards. This is a simple one, how much do you want to write every day/week? Set the goal for that and then set your reward for meeting that goal. Not only are your bribing yourself you're setting a deadline. Or another take on the same idea, Competition. Last year another writer friend of mine and I entered into a deal. The first person to miss their weekly writing goal before the end of the year had to by the other a DVD boxset of their choice. At the time we were both sipping all over the place. For the next six months neither one of us missed our goals... so neither one of us got a boxset. Well, the word count was more important."
How can one effectively organize scenes and snippets?,"The great piece of software that makes exactly this possible is called Scrivener. Unfortunately though, it is only available on Mac and now a beta-version for Windows PC. I still mention it in case anyone on any of those platforms interested in the question ends up here, as the title doesn't mention the Linux-specificity. I wrote more about Scrivener in my answer to this question: Is there a special software for writers?  A piece of software I heard is very similar in features, and is supported on the Linux platform as well, is Writer's Cafe. I cannot compare them myself, as I lack any experience with the latter, but it should be worth testing out. Even though I cannot directly help with Linux software, I will elaborate on analog options. These will always be less streamlined than using dedicated software, as the organization has to be done manually. The best way would be to have folders with printed out/jotted down text, organized by project. So, if you have a scene that you want to use in a certain project, only later on, get it on a piece of paper and file it in the folder. You then always know where to look. It is also a good idea to color-mark, or otherwise mark the papers for sub-sorting, and you can clip small cards with a synopses in the top corner for even more clarity. Again, the exact system is up to you, and will have to be manually maintained. Generally I would recommend to have one folder per working project, plus a 'Misc' folder for all those great ideas that you have had which aren't strictly part of an already existing project (maybe they will become seeds of future projects). I hope this helps a little and good luck organizing and sorting. P.S. You can of course use boxes instead of folders, or anything else that suits you personally."
Should beta functionality be mentioned in a training manual?,"I usually include a clearly marked ""Beta Features"" section. (either overall bundled together, or in individual sections marked as ""BETA only""). This allows non-BETA users to skip it, and eliminates people complaining about the absence of BETA features in PROD version. Then, put less effort into BETA section if you intend to change it early and often (as the product updates fast and documentation updates just as fast), OR, more effort if you anticipate slower rate of changes."
From Markdown to .odt and vice-versa: a possible distraction-free writing workflow?,"Your first option is, really, Pandoc, which was already mentioned. Its usage is quite straightforward. I've done some converting along these lines myself, and it's brilliant. It's included in Debian repositories, so I'd think acquiring an installation wouldn't be a problem. You indeed want to convert to HTML first: and then proceed to create markdown file the same way: and yes, you could go back from markdown to odt the same way. You also could enforce your own style set by mentioning style template odt file, the README will tell you, how. You may also find it useful to preserve paragraphs with the flag --wrap=none - i.e. prevent pandoc breaking pars with newlines every 72 chars. To prevent odd HTML formatting (such as you get where the original doc has embedded links: pandoc endows those in the output markdown text with underline html tags), specify the markdown version as markdown_github-raw_html with -t markdown_github-raw_html. (Might be preferable to change the source doc's default link formatting in the Office app that created it, if you can). Another option is to forego markdown for some kind of TeX solution (to which format you also could convert your already written text with Pandoc), the advantages being the abilities to insert images, tables and math equations in text, though, I'm afraid, that will close the way back to odt."
Is there any point in learning to write in cursive?,"The aesthetics of writing in cursive are really a personal thing: some people appreciate the feel of a fine pen gliding over the paper, the line variation from an italic nib, and the shading of a nice ink, and some just don't. On the practical side: cursive writing came about because it is faster and easier to write at length than printing.  While that's not always true today (see more below), handwriting in general has several advantages over more modern methods of capturing words: Unfortunately, the sordid modern history of cursive handwriting in America has deprived us of much of its utility.  You see, when the movable type printing press came along, printers developed a set of fonts commonly described as ""looped cursive"" because they have more consistently placed joins, allowing printers to stock fewer pieces (fewer different joins, and fewer different versions of each letter) and thus making their work less expensive.[1] Edit: Here's a good comparison of looped vs. italic cursive writing. Sadly, looped cursive has become the standard in most American schools today, and it is not particularly good for being hand written.  This, combined with less time dedicated to handwriting skills, and the transition from fountain pens to hard-led pencils for early writing instruction (in the name of cleanliness), has caused most students to write cursive illegibly and laboriously, if at all.  Pencils (especially with hard lead like 'HB') cause more friction with the paper and require much more pressure to write, making clear handwriting harder to learn. I, too, learned looped cursive with a pencil in elementary school.  Writing that way was slow and difficult.  Additionally, it caused me to constantly battle with pain from RSI (which I have something of a predisposition to).  I grew up, started using fountain pens, and learned to write in cursive italic -- the way that cursive was written before the advent of the printing press.  The difference is incredible. Now, my cursive handwriting is extremely fast and legible.  It requires almost no effort.  I no longer feel any pain from writing, even long, rambling letters or pages of computer code or other notes. I'd add that in addition to the usefulness of handwriting in general, and the legibility, speed, and ease of a good cursive italic in particular, I would hate to see our culture lose the ability to read the many important documents first rendered in cursive script.  Do we really want the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, Lincoln's speeches, and who knows what else to be lost to time the way that Egyptian hieroglyphs were for so long?

What are the most common style manuals?,"To add on to TML's answer: Journalists generally use the AP Stylebook. When writing for the web, the Yahoo! Style Guide is often used."
How do I write a synopsis?,"Most important part is, reducing the story to the core plot. Some say you should only need three pages to summarize your story, some say one page should be enough. But if you can reduce its core to three sentences, then you are on the right track. Impossible? Only three sentences? Imagine a friend asks you to summarize the Lord of the Rings for him. He never read one of the books or saw one of the movies. Do you really need three pages/one page to do it? Or can you do it with only three sentences? See, and LotR are three volumes, so you can condense your story, too. Look at it from the agent's perspective. He gets 30 synopsis a day. He must flip through them and decide, which one is worth it. He cannot delay it, because tomorrow he'll get another 30 synopsis. Look at what you have written and ask yourself: Would I choose this, if I were an agent? If the answer is yes, put your three sentences summary into the cover letter and your one page summary into the synopsis ;) BTW: Randomman159's link says that the editors usually read your sample chapters first. That's not true. They read your cover letter first. Better make it good. And short."
What are widely-used UK-English style guides?,"As far as UK style guides go, what you're probably looking for is the Oxford Guide to Style, formerly known as Hart's Rules (that link also contains a useful section outlining what the nearest US equivalents are). The University of Oxford website also provides an on-line style document, but it's nowhere near as comprehensive as the book. There are other UK style guides as well:"
Do I really need to have a scientific explanation for my premise?,"Without reading the other answers, my answer is that your premise is fine as long as you set the contract with the reader. The reader is fine with your premise if you do not promise a science-based story. Imagine this. Imagine you start your novel with the story of the navel-lotus of Vishnu. Or the bush that burned but was not consumed, of YHWH. Or the tale of Icarus, the young woman who aspired to greatness by flying too closely to the sun, and fell to the depths below when the heat melted her wax. There is truth in mythology. There is a truth in story. Science is distinct, but you can start your story with a commonly held 'truism' that is not scientifically based. After you establish that you are speaking in layers, within your story, you say something (contract-driven like): Sometimes truth lies not in the facts, but in the ideas beneath the facts. CHAPTER 1. This sets you up to have a story that is not science-based.  What you do not want to do is promise science... and then deliver nonsense. Story is a distinct quality of being human that predates the human experience of the scientific method. It's been told from the dawn of language. Hard science fiction, if that is what you're aiming for, has less allowance for nonsense. If you are writing hard science fiction, then you must approach this problem differently. It sounds as though you are not aiming for hard science fiction, so the answer to your problem is straightforward. Set up the contract to fit your story."
Is it bad to have no gender variety?,"On of the trickiest things to understand about discrimination is that a story that is not in itself discriminatory is capable of fueling a larger trend which is discriminatory. No book or movie can tell every story.  It's simply not possible.  Every book will feature many more stories untold than told, and that's fine.  The problem is when every book or movie or TV show is leaving the same stories untold. Stories are the primary way people learn about viewpoints that aren't their own, particularly if their opportunities to interact with new people in real life are limited.  When all the media they consume is telling only a subset of the stories that exist, those are the only stories they come to understand, and they start to believe that other stories don't exist.  They fail to make allowances for difficulties that aren't in those stories. And the people whose stories aren't being told start to feel like their own experiences are flawed in some way.  The ugly duckling was ostracized despite being a perfectly normal swan, because all the evidence they had ever seen told them they were an abnormal duck. So, in order to consider the harm that your story is doing, it is important to consider the overall state of the media. You must answer the question:  Is there an overarching lack of stories about men in the media?  I'll give you a moment to go and look. (I'll give you a hint:  The answer is no.) While it is okay to leave stories untold, there are some times where absence of a story can be harmful, even if it exists elsewhere in media.  That is when your primary story is creating a strawman.  When two stories come into conflict, then it is important to make sure that you are considering both sides with the respect they deserve.  (There are some stories that do not deserve much respect.  It's still important to measure that respect so that you dole out the right amount). In your case - if men are absent from the story, you don't have anything to be concerned about.  If they are the antagonists of the story, without any juxtaposition at all, then you should take another opportunity to examine your writing. There are of course enough nuances to this issue to fill many books several times over.  Categories are made up of individuals, and every individual is part of many categories, but in ways that make them unique.  This is only a short introduction to the issues of representation, but hopefully it answers your question."
Should I add racism in my book's world or have my world have no racism?,"For example, when Star Trek have on the bridge of the Enterprise an Asian pilot, a Russian navigator and a black Communications Officer, and they all get along swimmingly, all at the time of the Cold War, the Yellow Peril and the Civil Rights Movement, the show deliberately confronts the viewers' perceived racist expectations. Racism is present in its conspicuous absence. The show speaks loudly on the topic by showing racism not being there. In one episode, Star Trek chooses to speak about racism in a more focused way: a fellow officer accuses Spock of being in league with the Romulans, on the basis that he has pointy ears like them. This trope is called Fantastic Racism. That allows one to talk of racism by way of a metaphor. Finally, you can highlight actual real-life racism. For example, in Naomi Novik's Spinning Silver, a story about a Jewish girl in late-medieval Lithuania, anti-Semitism is very much a part of the story. Now that we've established that, Does your story even have different ""races"" - different ethnicities, or different sentient species, or whatever? Is there anyone to be racist towards? Does racism ""belong"" in your story? There is no Jewish character in All Quiet on the Western Front, even though Jews fought on both sides in that war. Nor are any other ""races"" represented, or mentioned, and so, there is no racism or conspicuous lack thereof. Because that particular issue is not part of the story Remarque set out to tell in that particular book. There is no racism in the Amber Chronicles, because the Princes of Amber treat all humans as ""subhuman"" compared to them. Again, racism doesn't ""belong"". To quote myself, your story should contain all the elements that it requires, and nothing but the elements it requires. ""Including"" racism, or anything else, that isn't useful to the story in any way is called 'shoehorning', and is not a good practice. Is your story served in any way by some of the characters experiencing or engaging in some form of racism? Does it add tension where tension is required, does it set up some theme you wish to explore, does it do anything? Then go ahead and include it. If it does nothing for the story, then don't."
How to write a PG13 Succubus character?,"As cloudchaser pointed out, a succubus is a very specific entity,  That said, a modern YA twist on such an entity is eminently doable.

By employing the single largest narcissistic obsession on the planet - social media. Replace you traditional succubus with an instagram starlet - feeding off the likes, comments, adoration and attention from impressionable teens world wide.  You are tapping into the negative connotation still (desiring attention) and still works with the being PG friendly. The entity sustains itself by adoration and attention, without the sex. Still powerful, still potentially dark, not hardcore. It practically writes itself - the obsession with body image, the need for attention and craving of love. The pursuit of an unattainable ideal, and a redemption arc in the works"
How do I present a future free of gender stereotypes without being jarring or overpowering the narrative?,"Men do wear skirts: kilts, sarongs, hakamas, fustanellas... If your world is culturally diverse, any and all of those might have become common enough. In sci-fi stories in particular, new fashions is something we take in our stride. But skirts are not really the focus of your question, they're just an aspect, an example. For the broader question, to write a gender-free world, I would just write a gender-free world. There's nothing weird or startling about it: it just means that one treats every person as a person, regardless of gender, and that gender doesn't enter into one's decision-making process (a.k.a you don't hear ""boys shouldn't do X"" and one doesn't think ""I should do Y because I'm a girl""). In fact, I would suggest you look around the world - some of us already live in far less gendered societies than others. You can start with those, and then take your world the rest of the way. (By 'societies' I do not necessarily mean countries as a whole. That's part of it, but living in a big city vs. small town, economic status etc. also have an effect.) As an example, the first time my gender entered into my decision-making process was when I decided against an academic career, because I'd have had to do a post-doc in either Europe or America, and I was afraid to be a Jew in Europe and a woman in America. Until then - school, military service, academy, hobbies - I thought of myself as a person, not a 'woman'. As far as gender was concerned, there were 'sexy single guys potentially interested in me' and 'everybody else'. Two distinct genders. :)"
Can a successful book series let the bad guy win? [duplicate],"It is perfectly fine for your story to end with the ""bad guy"" winning. Consider for example George Orwell's 1984: He loved Big Brother Complete and utter defeat. 1984 is one of last century's masterpieces. @Wetcircuit mentions tragedy in a comment, for good reason. Tragedy does not necessarily imply that the ""bad guys"" win, but it does imply the ""good guys"" lose, or at best earn a Pyrrhic victory. Consider Antigone or Hamlet, or For Whom the Bell Tolls. In fact, tragedy is often considered a ""higher"", more ""literary"" form. Yes, your readers are going to be upset when your characters die or lose. At least, hopefully they will have come to care about your characters, so their death would sadden them. But that is not a bad thing. One feels sorrow when one finishes For Whom the Bell Tolls, but does one go ""what a bad, disappointing book?"" Never! On the contrary - one is profoundly touched by that sorrow, one appreciates more the fleeting beauty of life through it. @Amadeus apparently looks for entertainment in the books he reads. Me - I look for art. I look for that which would touch me, and take me out of my comfort zone, and make me think. Formulaic ""good guys defeat bad guys, then live happily ever after"" bores me out of my mind. Now, there is a question of what you're trying to say with your story. Why does your ""bad guy"" win? What does it all imply? If all your story suggests is futility, for example, then your readers might well be disappointed. But if your story does have something else in it, like any of the examples I've mentioned above, or countless others, then go ahead."
Problems Blending Sci-fi & Traditional Fantasy?,"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
  - Arthur C Clarke There's a reason that science fiction and fantasy are frequently shelved together - separating the two is usually a fools errand. The Dragonriders of Pern features a preindustrial society where flying, firebreathing, teleporting, and telepathic dragons defend the skies from horrible creatures that rain down from above.  They could easily be considered pure fantasy - up until the book where they discover the spacecraft that the human ancestors flew in on, and the labs where they bioengineered the dragons.  In Star Wars (arguably the most famous science fiction property of all time), the Force is really just space magic called another name. And they do all their fighting with swords.  The lists go on and on. Science fiction and fantasy are united in that they explore the impossible. Fantasy uses elements that will never be possible, while science fiction uses elements that theoretically might be possible. But the impossibility is shared.  Epic fantasy (eg Wheel of Time) and space opera (eg Star Wars) are more similar to each other than they are to urban fantasy or ""hard"" science fiction.  In some ways, it's inaccurate to call science fiction and fantasy genres at all.  They're setting elements. A romance doesn't stop being a romance because it's set on a space station, and a murder mystery isn't any less mysterious because it was an elf who was murdered. The key to mixing these elements successfully is to understand the expectations of your readers, and meeting those expectations  (but in surprising ways).  Genre helps define expectations. If you're writing hard SF, readers expect to see a world that's close enough to our own that they can believe that our world could become the world of the story - magic obviously has no place here.  On the flip side, urban fantasy readers expect the author to have considered the modern world and how it might interact with the impossible.  Extrapolations from science to science fiction may be natural depending on the exact nature of the setting. If the reader has led to expect that the serial killer is a Scooby-Doo villain, then the sudden reveal that the murders were done with actual magic will violate their expectations and frustrate them (in general - there will of course be exceptions).  But if the story is framed as a space cop trying to capture a vampire despite not believing that vampires are real, the readers will accept that premise as well as any other. "
What should I do when I am stuck on names during freewriting?,"I always feel that names are a big problem for me and coming up with some meaningful names that sound pleasant is one of the hardest parts of writing for me. That's why I never stop to come up with a name.  Before starting to write I normally have a plan for the next few pages at least and I know which characters will come up and what they will basically be doing. Then I use one of their main character traits or characteristics to come up with a name by using Google Translator with different languages until something interesting comes up. You can read more about my technique in my answer to What are good resources to get fantasy names?. That way I have an interesting name that I can use and that is likely so unique that I can relatively easily replace it later if I find a better name.  ""Search and Replace"" of your word processing software is likely a big help in this, but you have to be careful. For example in German saying ""Tims Antwort ist gut"" (""Tim's answer is good"") and replacing ""Tim"" with ""Secespitus"" would yield ""Secespituss Antwort ist gut"" - which is wrong, as it should say ""Secespitus' Antwort ist gut"".  Furthermore the name can be part of a bigger name, like ""Tim"" could be part of ""Timothy"" and if you only want to replace ""Tim"" with ""Dean"" you would end up with ""Deanothy"" - which might be an interesting name, but not your originally desired result. Especially when you have a lot of different characters you should be careful. And at the same time you should be careful that if you want ""Tim"" and ""Timothy"" to be the same person you would have to rewrite the parts where for example the longer name is used - it might be a rhetorical device, like an angry mother calling her child by its full name, and you might want to preserve this when changing the name.   You should only replace each instance individually and not all at the same time to not run into these problems.  If you are writing and suddenly you introduce a new character that you haven't thought of you shouldn't stop - just use the first thing to make a placeholder that is easy to find later. ShadowMan, MagicLady, CreepyGrandma, BigFurryMonster, NiceButCreepyBoy, ... - everything is fine as long as it's easy to find.  That way you can stay in the flow and continue with the important stuff to know how your characters act and behave - which will allow you to more easily come up with a useful name for them. You have to learn about your character first before you can give him a fitting name. And to learn about your character you have to write something that he is part of. It's completely normal to leave the naming for later, for example the first revision. "
"In a series, do the stakes have to be higher than in the book before?","There are two main mistakes that authors make when it comes to raising the stakes from one story to the next. The first is that they either raise the stakes too quickly, or simply don't know when to stop raising them, and the result is that eventually they run out of room in which to escalate without things just getting ridiculous. And as you mentioned in the question, once you get to that point, it's very hard to dial things back again without your audience getting bored. The classic example of this would be the Dragon Ball franchise. It started off as just the goofy adventures of a kid with a monkey tail. Then it started introducing antagonists that threatened to take over the world. Then Piccolo actually did take over the world. Then villains started showing up that were capable of destroying worlds, and again, they actually did so. Then they started facing off against literal gods that were strong enough to destroy the entire universe, and now (IIRC) they're fighting beings powerful enough to destroy the entire multiverse. Where do you escalate to from there?! The second problem is that, more often than not, these newer, bigger threats tend to come out of absolutely nowhere, with no build-up or foreshadowing. Sometimes, this can work well and surprise both the audience and the characters, but other times, it makes it look like you're just pulling these new threats out of your arse (which, a lot of the time, is actually the case). I recall that one Tumblr post about Supernatural: It's like, you beat the Devil himself? Well, now you've gotta fight the Devil's cousin Phil, who has conveniently gone entirely unmentioned up until now, but he's totally twice as evil. [...] That last paragraph was literally supposed to be the most ridiculous hypothetical example I could think of, and people are messaging me to say ""His name was Metatron, not Phil"". I can't even make fun of this show. So how do you avoid those problems? Well, the first one can be avoided by making sure the stakes are raised gradually, and by mixing in more personal threats. For example, Book 3 might have the hero fighting to stop a villain from conquering the world, but Book 4 might have him fighting to save a loved one from a curse/illness/kidnapping/[insert crisis here]. For the world as a whole, the stakes are much smaller in Book 4, but for the hero, the stakes are higher because the threat is that much more personal. The second is easy to avoid if you're planning all six books in advance, and can build up each threat before they appear, but what if your publisher suddenly asks you to write a seventh book? Then an eighth, and a ninth? You have to keep making up new threats as you go, and that's where this problem tends to creep in. You just have to try and make sure that each new threat is consistent with the world you've built up to that point, and that it makes sense that none of your characters have heard of it or mentioned it before. Dragon Ball, for example, is able to sidestep this problem by having its villains come from outer space, or alternate universes, or the future - of course Goku hasn't heard of the Androids, they don't exist yet!"
Character is an expert on something I'm not,"The answer is research, research, and more research. I'm not an expert on horseback riding, or sword-fighting, or ruling a country. The only way I can write convincingly about those subjects is by doing research. Research can take many forms. It can be reading about the subject, both guides and first-hand accounts. It can be talking to people who do the thing. It can be finding the relevant experts on youtube. It can be going and doing the thing yourself, to get at least some idea of what it feels like. Obviously, not all methods are applicable to all things you need to research. I don't get to ""try running a country"". But you get as much tidbits of information as you can, and then fill in the blanks with good writing. Things you want to focus your research on: For your particular character, you won't find anything useful by googling ""how to hack a website"". Or at least, I don't think you would. But try searching for the opposite - for how computer security works. Talk to someone who works in the field, or at least read up on that. By learning about the defence, you can learn about the attack."
How do I know what I'm writing is interesting to the reader?,"The Room is about a man whose love life runs off the rails and ends in a brutal break-up. This is a topic that a lot of people are interested in. La La Land is about the same theme. Shrek seems like that's how it's going to end leading into the final act. I can't begin to list how many breakup songs have hit the top 10 charts. The reason people don't like The Room isn't because the premise of the story is bad. It's because the movie was poorly executed. Honestly, you can probably make a story about any premise you want to. Would you be interested in reading a book about someone learning how to work at a post office? Apparently a lot of people would, because Terry Prachet's novel Going Postal is held in high regard. Would you read a book about a bunch of rich, stupid twenty-somethings going to Spain and getting drunk all the time? That's the plot to The Sun Also Rises, a cultural touchstone written by Ernest Hemingway. Heck, you can describe The Room as being about a spoiled rich guy who has awful relationships and then dies, and that's also the synopsis of The Great Gatsby. Don't worry too much about whether your premise is workable. I contend you can make a good story out of literally any premise. What determines whether people will read your story or not is how well you've executed on your idea. So practice writing a lot, make multiple editing passes on your story, join a writing group, ask friends who can give honest critiques to read your work - do whatever it takes to be certain that your writing is solid, and your story will come alive."
Software for developing and organizing characters,"Custom Meta-Data in Scrivener. You can do some custom fields in Scrivener. See the ""Custom Meta-Data"" button at the bottom of the inspector (it looks like a little tag).  Here's a photo where I added a few fields:  You can add fields by clicking the gear button. When you add a metadata field, it becomes available for all documents in the project. You can also view these fields in the outline:  You can put multiple paragraphs into the fields if you want, but I prefer subdocuments for that. Fields appear in all docs. You probably don't want custom character fields in your plot outline, and vice versa, so that might nudge you to keep characters in a separate project. Dunno. Limited support for relationships. This custom metadata feature doesn't let you easily add relationships from one character to another. In my outline photo, you can see a simple relationship, but it's just a text field. You can't navigate it in both directions (uh, or in either direction). Relationships via wiki links. Over time, I found that I could create the relationships I needed as ""wiki"" links from one Scrivener doc to another. I'd have to add a link from each related doc to the other. And if the relationship changed, I'd have to edit both docs to express the new relationship. Relationship docs. For significant relationships, I often create a Scrivener doc for the relationship. I put the ""relationship"" doc into the folder with the most important character. This gives me a place to put all of the details about a relationship. As long as the relationships (who relates to whom) are reasonably stable, this works well. Super NoteCard. A few years ago I used an app called Super NoteCard. It wasn't great for writing, but it was much more flexible for organizing things. I remember that it allowed arbitrary relationships among cards."
How do discovery writers hibernate?,"I am a discovery writer. I agree with Liquid, I don't leave it alone. If I get stuck, I edit my story so far. I will start reading, from the beginning, and if I see anything worth fixing, I do. If I finish and don't have an idea, I'll start over. If I go weeks without thinking of the solution, I'll still do that. I feel like my only choices are to drop the story completely, give up on it, or read until I know how to fix it. What to cut, What to add, How to change the past to fix the dead spot. I've read 200 pages four times through before figuring out how to fix it and finish the story. Sometimes it is a realization about a character (who they should be, what they could've done). Sometimes it is a realization about where I screwed the plot. Stephen King, writing The Stand (823 pages) had a similar problem for weeks on end, and eventually scrapped a few hundred pages to start over at the particular point where he finally realized he'd taken a wrong turn.  You've got a story. If you are stuck, you got yourself there, with an earlier mistake. Keep reading until you find it, and then fix it. Question every plot development, twist or turning point decision you made. Question whether you've made your characters too soft, or hard, or conveniently too smart or too clueless. You have the ending in mind. Try a reverse-writing: What is the final scene before that ending? The final discovery, the final piece of the puzzle that leads to that. If it is a battle, what happens right before the battle? Who is standing there? Who makes the final decision to risk their lives? Then back up another scene. How did they get to THAT point? Eventually, you will find the seam between what you have already written, and what needs to come next. Then you can revise what you have already written to make that flow seamless. There is something you can fix to make the story flow naturally into the ending. If you are going to be a discovery writer (and I am incapable of writing any other way) you have to get used to the fact that you can take a wrong turn, and are probably going to have to scrap a chapter or two now and then. Or more, like Stephen King, who scrapped about 25% of a book in progress, but finished it. I believe The Stand is his all-time bestseller."
What can I do to make my writing fit the 1950s?,"Since concern is not adding fifties-relevant details (which can be found by research) but rather omitting things that you take for granted and don't notice, but that wouldn't have been present in the 50's: Find two or three people who are old enough to remember the fifties, and have them proof-read your draft. Ask them to point out anything that feels anachronistic, or that breaks the illusion of your piece having been written in that era."
Explaining made up card game,"For example, is there any point where a character ""bluffs"" and the reader must understand the rules to recognize that he is making the ""wrong"" play? My advice is to consider how the game ""fits"" into the story, and treat it as a meta narrative device presented in the way it is meant to be perceived. If it is a confusing game with lots of rules, describe it in a confusing way with disconnected rules and anecdotes. Make it confusing to the reader so they understand the game is confusing in-world. It's a kind of show-don't-tell. If it is a game of arbitrary luck, present it as a toss-up with no skill involved – even if that means exaggerating this aspect, or presenting the game in a different way to how the characters actually play it. Individual characters may see their luck differently, hopefully this tells us something about their character arc and informs us about their worldview. If it is a game of intense strategy, the deep calculation of one or two ""hands"" can set an example without boring or confusing readers with every rule. You can specifically show the same hand, so the reader has seen it before and understands the stakes of that particular strategy. In worldbuilding, less is usually more. The goal is to make your environment feel ""natural"", not to show how inventive and clever you are with one particular element which often backfires if it's non-essential. If the game is simple, readers should grow an idea of the rules and obstacles just through casual conversation.  Of course you can have one character teach the game to another, but again the focus should be on their character arcs and all the subtle interactions revealing more about them than the actual game. Stories aren't about connecting all the dots – there's magic that happens in the reader's head when they connect the dots for themselves, that's why infodumps should be avoided. Basically nothing should be in the story that doesn't contribute to the theme, mood, or character arcs. An in-world game with specific rules sounds like a fun idea, but the reader should be focused on the characters who are playing the game. Whether readers would be able to win the game themselves is probably not essential to the story."
Is there any way to get around having everyone in the world speak the same language? [closed],"There are several ways to have more than one language in your world. Here are some ideas: Some books in the fantasy genre make use of these tools. Look, for example, at the ""Lord of the Rings"": ""Common Speech"" (a.k.a English) is a language all characters are at least conversant in, it is the lingua franca of western Middle Earth, as well as the MCs' mother tongue. However, the hobbits have their unique dialect of ""Common"", with some unique words. Frodo, the MC, knows enough Quenya (one of the languages of the elves) for a polite greeting, but not much more than that (basically ""please"" and ""thank you""). While elven nobility are fluent in Quenya, Sindarin and Common, we also encounter elves who do not speak Common, and Legolas, an elf, serves as translator.The Rohirrim (a human nation) have their own language, which the hobbits recognise as being somewhat related to where their unique words come from. When the Rohirrim choose not to address visitors in Common, it is considered lack of courtesy, but they certainly talk and sing in their own language among themselves (Aragorn is the one to translate this time). There's also the language of the Dwarves, which they keep secret from strangers so we only get glimpses of it in place names, Dark Speech (with multiple dialects), whatever languages the Southorns and Easterlings speak (we know nothing of those save that they are not the Common), and so on."
Should I defend my character's appearance?,"Every artist should defend their vision of their world, but sometimes compromises have to be made. Is publication the most important thing at the moment? If not, you could hold off for a publisher who appreciates your vision, but if it is it could just be one of those things - you can look forward to television interviews where you say ""ah, yes, I did that to get published. It was 2017 and the publisher thought that's what the cool kids were doing. The idiot."". I'm guessing that when we're talking about your editor, we're really talking about the publisher's editor - if it's someone you're paying, the question becomes a lot simpler. But since we're talking compromise, is there another visual cue you could use that makes more sense? And even if it has to be a hood, does it have to be a hoodie?"
How to describe the point-of-view character without using mirrors,"On one side of the spectrum, some ways of describing have the particularity that, instead of describing all of the character, they define them little by little. For instance: I. You can highlight their body while they do something. a) Indirectly:  I gladly helped her take the book from
  the high shelf. (Implying a tall character) b) Directly: Even though the opening was large, I could only get my forearm through. (So clearly it's a muscular character) II. In the middle of a dialog, as a description: ""Alright, now, stop it"", I
  interjected. Being burlier than him, I
  could afford to raise my voice. III. Have someone make remarks about the characters. ""I had never noticed you had blue
  eyes"", she said, leaning closer. Of course, you can mix those. For instance, in that last example, you could add ""I felt my face was getting as red as my hair"" or something similar. On the other side of the spectrum, you could use a technique that would be applied differently depending on the psychology of the character. For instance, you could have a very self conscious teenager reflect on their appearance; this approach would apply for a trendy character, too, although with a different feel (critically checking whether they look as they think they should, for instance). As far as I can tell, there are a few more character types that can have this technique easily applied, such as a narcissistic character, or simply one with high self esteem. The ""main thing"" about this second approach is, depending on the characters' self esteem and general attitude towards life, and whatever number of factors, the general feel of the way they think about their appearance changes."
What is the difference between writing in the first and the third person?,"With a story in first person, you are intending the reader to become much more attached to the main character.  Since the reader sees what that character sees and feels what that character feels, the reader will have an emotional investment in that character.  Third person does not have this close tie; a reader can become emotionally invested but it will not be as strong as it will be in first person. Contrarily, you cannot have multiple point characters when you use first person without extremely clever craftsmanship.  You could not subtly move from one perspective to another, and even risk confusing the reader when you do so, which is one of the most egregious crimes any writer can commit.  First person stories cannot have the main character die except at the very end, whereas third person stories may be able to use the possible imminent death of any given character as a means for suspense. Generally, it's a case of emotional attachment vs. utility.  It is plain easier to write in the third person, but if you can pull off first person and your story is a good fit for it, it can be a very powerful tool."
What is Literary Fiction?,"There's always the good old wikipedia definition: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_fiction My take on it is that it is often used to mean ""serious"" fiction (whatever that is), as opposed to fiction that is merely ""entertainment"". It often seems to be thrown about in the context of snobbery (that is, someone may not ""read that airport bookshop rubbish"" because they like literary fiction), but I don't know if people really say those sorts of things, or if it's just the impression that the other side (""genre"" people) think they might say. It's just one of those terms that means different things to different people (as @neilfein's answer suggests). (For a quantitative answer, how about: the average number of metaphors per paragraph?)"
Want to publish unpublished work found in an auction storage unit,You cannot publish the work without permission. It was copyrighted the moment it was written. The fact that you 'purchased' the manuscript is no defence. By that token I could 'publish' all the books I have purchased. You need to purchase the copyright from the family.
Why are papers printed in a two column format?,"Long lines of text can be hard to read, so doing multiple columns breaks the lines up to something more optimal."
How does a code monkey become a novelist?,"First, a disclaimer: I'm not a novelist, not by a long shot. I've written some (local award winner) short stories as a teenager and I'm working on my first novel, but that's it. On the other hand, I've been practically born an engineer :) Having said that, I guess there are many different approaches to writing, as many as there are people. As a programmer you probably have developed rational thinking an analytic skills, that can be extremely handy when attempting to write. I'm approaching writing from that perspective. I'm very interested in books that deal with narrative structure - in a way, I'm trying to figure out ""how stories work"". For example, The Writer's Journey deals with the classical myth structure and archetypes. I also liked Screenwriting: The Sequence Approach. But the book I connected with most is Writing Fiction for Dummies. Yes, it's a For Dummies book, but it's written by a guy who is both a published, award-winning novelist AND a PhD in astrophysics and/or math (not sure). His approach is called ""The Snowflake Method"", in reference to the fractal structure of snowflakes, which he uses as an analogy for the structure of fiction. He has a very interesting blog and website with articles (just ignore the ugly design). I'm in no way affiliated with them nor with the books, I'm just a reader and fan :) In summary, I think as engineers wearing the fiction writer hat, we should definitely take advantage of our strengths."
"What's the distinction between ""vanity publishing"" and ""self publishing""?","What you're observing is a sea change in values and perceptions in the publishing industry, which has caused the distinction between ""vanity publishing"" and ""self-publishing"" to become very murky. This is important because ""vanity publishing"" did and does carry a heavy stigma, while ""self-publishing"" is on the road to respectability. Until pretty recently, anyone taking your money to publish your book was a vanity publisher. Vanity publishers were all scams, in that they took your money on the (implicit) promise that you had a chance to make it back from book sales, but in practice no one ever did. Furthermore, the vanity publisher had no interest in helping you sell your book, because they got their money from bilking the authors, not from selling books. Self-publishing, meanwhile, was about equally likely to fail, but as there was no middle-man the people who tried it were merely fools, not victims of a scam. In the past ~5 years, mostly due to the rise of e-books, self-publishing has become a plausible path to success. Lots of people are making small but respectable sums e-publishing, and a handful of people have made it big. As a result, we're now seeing ""self-publishing services"" which attempt to help people self-publish by doing some or all of the work that ""pure"" self-publishers have to do for themselves. And here's where it gets complicated: strictly speaking the business model of the self-publishing services is identical to the business model of the vanity press. But the self-publishing services desperately want to be seen as part of the legitimate self-publishing ecosystem, and not as another scam. So the terminological confusion that you're seeing is due to self-publishing services and the people who use them trying to disassociate themselves from the old vanity publishers. However, your basic observation is correct: there is no hard line between self-publication services and vanity presses. That said, I think there is a significant difference between the presentation and implicit promises made to the author between these two groups. A classic vanity publisher pretends to actually be a publisher, as in an entity that actually makes its money from selling books. There existed the impression—disavowed in the fine print, of course—that your book would be professionally edited, that the publisher could actually get your book into stores, that your book would be ""published"" in the usual sense. Honest self-publication services do not claim to be publishers, and are very forthright about the set of services they're offering (cover design, typesetting, etc.) and more importantly what they're not offering (marketing, placement in brick-and-mortar stores, etc.)"
"What are those ""countdown"" numbers on the copyright page?","Well, having asked the question I then went to Bing.com to investigate further.  I was surprised to find the answer quickly.  I found it in a blog article by Raymond Chen and I reproduce it in this way: In the row of numbers, the smallest number shown tells you which printing of the book you have. For example, if you see ""10 9 8 7 6 5 4"" then you have a fourth printing. The reason for all this is as follows: It has to do with how books were historically manufactured. Each page of a book is converted to a metal plate which is used to make impressions. If another printing run is necessary, you load the plates back onto the printing machine and off you go. But how do you indicate that this is a second printing? It would be expensive to burn a brand new plate just to change the word ""first"" to ""second"" on the copyright page. Instead, you pre-load all the printing numbers onto your master, and each time you start a new printing run, you scratch off the lowest number. Even though a lot of book printing nowadays is done with computers rather than metal plates, the old method of indicating a printing is retained out of tradition. Often the numbers are odd on one side, even on the other, with 10 in the middle, so that you alternately scrape off the LHS and RHS of the list of numbers. This would help to keep centered text centered on the page."
"When documenting Python, when should I use docstrings and when should I use comments?","PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code categories comments and document strings (a.k.a. docstrings) under comments sections. Comments Block comments generally apply to some (or all) code that follows them and are indented to the same level as that code. Inline comments are unnecessary and in fact distracting if they state the obvious. A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition. Now to answer your question Docstrings are for people who are going to be using your code without needing or wanting to know how it works. Docstrings can be turned into actual documentation. Consider the official Python documentation - What's available in each library and how to use it, no implementation details (Unless they directly relate to use). In-code comments are to explain what is going on to people those who want to extend the code. These will not normally be turned into the documentation as they are really about the code itself rather than usage. Now there are about as many opinions on what makes for good comments (or lack thereof) as there are programmers. My personal (credits) rules of thumb for adding comments are to explain:"
Not having any white MC's?,"The answer I'll give you here is the same as the ones I've already given you and others: write what works for you.  If these are who the characters are, then that's who they are.  If you're forcing diversity, then it will come off as forced.  That includes making some characters white just to be diverse. Will you alienate or even offend some white readers?  Yes. But this is not the type of offense to worry about.  Some people are so used to being in the mainstream everywhere and for everything, that they loudly protest when suddenly they're not.  If they don't like your story, they can go literally anyplace else to find beautiful, stirring, authentic depictions of all sorts of white people.  Even within works about people of color. Some people will argue that this is exactly the same as novels only including white people.  But, no.  It isn't.  Because representation isn't just about a single work.  It's about the entirety of our culture.  Americans (and most Westerners) find white people so central to their understanding of the universe that they insert them in places they might not otherwise be and tell entire stories set in nonwhite worlds from the white character's point of view.  (I just watched The Last King of Scotland which does exactly this...they invented a white character for this very purpose...in a movie about real events in Uganda.) Write the story that matters to you."
Don't look at what I did there,"Hang a lantern on it. If you're truly interested in not answering these questions, then I think your only remaining choice is to hang a lantern on it: To hang a lantern (or “hang a lamp”) is to call attention to an inconsistency in the story by having a character notice the inconsistency. It’s the writer’s way of telling the reader “I did this on purpose; it’s not a mistake.” In your case, that might look something like: Charlie couldn't believe that Bob was standing at his front door. ""How did you find me?"" ""I have my ways"", Bob replied mysteriously. or perhaps: Susan squinted into the sun as it reflected off the frozen lake, the wind stinging her cheeks as she trudged forward. She wasn't entirely sure how she made it this far; the last thing she remembered was Axel promising he would get her out of the snow-engulfed cabin. I guess he did."
Creating a story in which the hero(es) lose [closed],"Well, consider the term cookie cutter. Now imagine that you love cookies and you want to go into the cookie business. Which do you think would be the best strategy: Bring out a totally original line of rhubarb and pickle cookies. Bring out a line of exceptionally well made chocolate chip cookies. Like you, there are millions or readers who grew up reading these stories and want to read more. At the same time, of course, there are thousands of people trying to write these stories. So, there is a definite demand for these types of stories. And there are a lot of, frankly, pretty lousy attempts to write them. So if you want to be in this market, learn to write this sort of story really well so you stand out above the crowd. Either way, you need to learn to be really good. Because frankly, if you want to sell rhubarb and pickle cookies, you are going to have to make them really really good rhubarb and pickle cookies, because no one want a mediocre rhubarb and pickle cookie. But lots of people want a really good chocolate chip cookie. "
"When writing science fiction, how important is it to provide scientific details for the (fictitious) things you are presenting in the story?","You only need to present as much information as is necessary for the plot. Let's use the classic SF technology, Faster Than Light travel. If all it's doing in terms of the plot is moving the characters from A to B, no further elaboration is necessary. On the other hand, if the method is important, you need to get into it more. To use an example I've read recently, Glynn Stewart's Starship Mage series. There FTL is literally magic; a specially trained mage can cast a spell that teleports a ship no more than a light-year in a single jump. Because it's important to the plot, you quickly learn more about it and the limits; how often a mage can make a jump without their head (literally again) exploding; how the ship has to be prepared for the spell to be cast, details about the special place on the ship where the mage operates, and so on.  Because the series features space battles and pursuits and piracy and boarding actions and all the classic space opera fun, all of that is relevant. You need to know a bit about how the (magic) tech works and its limits to justify why, for instance, the main characters can't simply jump somewhere else when the bad guys show up, or why seizing the ship's sanctum means they can't run, and so on. Now compare that to, say, Star Wars. You need to make calculations to jump to hyperspace, you can only fight in normal space, and in some places you can't go to hyperspace. That's about it. But in terms of the story, that's all you need to know."
Need advice about changing character's gender,"Each writer is of one gender, and one sexual orientation, and in order for their stories to reflect real life, they have to learn to write from the POV of other genders and other sexual orientations.  Don't be sexist on yourself, male heterosexual writers have written about homosexual males and homosexual females. Heck, people write convincingly about prostitutes, hit men, rape victims and serial killers and master thieves that they have never actually been. And medieval wizards, extra-terrestrials, kings and warriors. Don't be afraid of writing what you want and what you think makes your story the strongest. Changing one of your characters might make your story feel unrealistic, because other characters in your book would not react the same to a female, and the character in question might react differently as a female, and these disparities can make the plot feel forced or unnatural.  My advice is leave it alone, and don't worry about selling to an audience that judges you on anything other than the quality of your writing and the quality of the story. You might lose some sales to the judgy, but you would likely lose MORE sales by straining to fit a woman into the role of a bisexual male, and forcing the partner as a heterosexual male instead of a bisexual male. I believe the necessary changes in mindset and attitude (and presumably the loss of social tensions) would make this ""not their story"" anymore. The story was written for and belongs to two bisexual men in love, not a heterosexual couple in love. EDIT: I see many suggestions about getting bisexual men to read your book and tell you what they think. That can be difficult, if you don't already know any! For most of us it is hard enough to get family to read our books and provide feedback, much less strangers we also want to qualify by gender and sexual orientation. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe Facebook has a group. As an alternative, I would suggest reading bisexual authors that perhaps have written about bisexual relationships; that is much easier to search for on the web. Here is a list of about 200 Bisexual Writers, not all of them recent. But you could check out their pages and see what they've written, and perhaps learn from it. If they have any bisexual characters, their first-hand experience would help you understand what they felt was important to portray and write about. Not to copy them, but to get an idea of how a bisexual character thinks."
How much swearing is TOO much? (And how much is not enough?),"I think that technically the only reason not to use profanity in your writing when you want it is if censorship will prevent you from reaching your target audience. For example, you want tweens to read your book but their fucking parents won't let them because of the fucking swearing. Swearing is like salt on food though, too much or on the wrong dishes can just make you seem like you don't know what you're doing.  If there's too much salt then you can get tired of the taste. There's a book called Watch Your F*cking Language:  How To Swear Effectively.  I haven't read it myself but I've been wanting to pick it up. Don't try to pander to people's tastes. Your writing will appeal as a whole to your audience.  If you cut out the swearing for the sake of the few who don't like swearing, then you may degrade the quality of expression of your work.  At the same time, removing the swearing does not necessarily please the people who would already dislike your work anyway."
What can I do with a part that I feel is necessary to a story but it's an absolute drudgery?,"The crux is not adding the action, but the decision, the choice. It’s those that define a character!"
"When writing an error prompt, should we end the sentence with a exclamation mark or a dot?","In a technical manual or documentation or anything similar, you wouldn't put emotion into the text.  The only reasons to use an exclamation point are to convey strong emotion or a serious warning. ""Your password doesn't meet the criteria"" isn't a dangerous situation.  There's no need to use anything but a straightforward and calm voice.  Just like you would if you were sitting next to someone in person trying to help them set up their app. I would only use a exclamation point in an error message if there was something very important going on.  Either an outright safety issue or the user was about to delete all their data.  Unless you're writing an app that's supposed to sound like a person and be all folksy (and please just don't), you wouldn't speak like a person does, with emotion. The primary purpose of punctuation in messages from an app is readability.  Use a period.  A period tells the user that your message is now over.  Ellipses imply there is more to come, which isn't the case here."
Can someone publish a story that happened to you?,"The events that happened to your father don't belong to anyone.  They just are.  Different people will have different knowledge (or beliefs) about various portions of the events, but they are just different versions of something that happened. Yes, the author who published the story can copyright the book.  But she is copyrighting her rendition of the story, not the events.  Your father has the right to tell the same story in his own words.  As do you.  As does anyone. Copyright is not important here.  Nor is it really a problem that this author took a real life story and turned it into a book.  But using your father's name without his permission is a concern.  Since it's a children's book (and you didn't mention this as an issue), I presume that she did not say anything negative about him or violate his privacy or anything like that.  At the very least, it's obnoxious to write a story about someone without his knowledge.  Let alone his permission.  Or that of his estate, if he is no longer living.  Is it illegal?  Probably not.  After all, newspapers don't need permission to write about someone, why should children's books authors? Ethically, she should have spoken to your family before moving ahead.  And the publisher should have contacted you as well.  It's strange that they didn't (unless she self-published).  But, again, probably not illegal, as long as she didn't say anything untrue. To find out your rights, you need to contact a lawyer who works in your jurisdiction.  This means in the country this happened in, or in the US state if it happened in the US.  Even if I were a lawyer myself (I'm not) who knows publishing law backwards and forward, the law where I live could be completely different from the law where you live.  So get a local expert.  In the US, it should cost no more than a couple hundred dollars for a serious consultation (a quick consultation may even be free)."
...and then she held the gun,"I'm going to try and take the answer from ""a CVn"": Have you considered doing something like skipping, then describing? ... and take it a bit further. Jane was calm, arms up, as John held her at gunpoint. Steadying herself, she assessed him. Everything about his posture, his demeanour, his very air, spoke volumes to her: He was going to pull the trigger. Her time for playing the mouse was up. By the time John realised he wasn't holding the gun any more, his arm had been knocked to the side and his wrist felt like it was broken. Looking back at Jane, she was a step away from him, gun already levelled at his chest. It was John's turn to put his arms up. I'm not a good writer, so I'm aware this needs quite a bit of revising (e.g before looking back at Jane, a quick exclamation of pain from John may help the scene, up to you to decide. Or perhaps the final sentence could be changed to something more along the lines of, ""Confused, surprised, and with a right arm that felt like it was on fire, it was John's turn to put his hands up""), but I hope the point is clear. Showing is always better than telling - even if showing in this instance is not showing all the details because it happened so fast. You'll note though, that even with not explaining everything explicitly, this section still gives a pretty good idea of what happened - she'd simultaneously wrenched the gun from his hand by hitting (or otherwise hurting) his wrist and knocking his arm away. Just as quickly, she'd stepped away, so he couldn't just do it back to her. Even without spelling out exactly what had happened, it's clear she is very skilled. If your aim is to show that this happened skilfully and extremely quickly, perhaps consider a variant of this."
"Is there a ""right"" way to interpret a novel? If so, how do we make sure our novel is interpreted correctly?","This notion that a novel has a meaning that we can ferret out and interpret has been a staple of English teachers for decades. Essentially it is an attempt to turn a novel (or any other work of art) into a simple proposition. As far as I can tell, they do this because otherwise they can't figure out what they are supposed to teach about a novel.  The problem with this way of looking at a novel, though, is that if the novelist's concern was to make a simple propositional statement, why didn't they just make it? Why spend months or years working out complex plots and developing well rounded characters if all they really wanted to say was, ""Be nicer to each other,"" or ""Young men are false."" Tolkien, in his essay On Fairie Stories offers a different way of looking at things. The novelist is engaging in an act of sub-creation (sub-creation because God is the principal creator). The author is making a world that the reader experiences in a way akin to how they experience the ordinary world.  A work of art, then, is not a veiled proposition, but an experience. You don't interpret a work of art, you experience it. (A critic may interpret a work of art, particularly one from the past, by explaining the references that would enable a reader in the know to receive the experience whole, but which a modern or less well informed reader might not recognize, and which would therefore prevent them from fully experiencing the work.)  This does not mean that an author wants to leave the reader unchanged in their view of the real world. Every experience we have changes how we see, which changes how we experience everything that happens to us afterward. Thus the experience of art has the potential to change how we experience everything that happens to us afterwards in life, and in every subsequent piece of art we experience.  So, when John Steinbeck gave his readers the experience of knowing the Joad family and experiencing their struggles on the road to California, and in the migrant camps once they got there, he certainly intended that this should change the way they saw the plight of the actual migrants, and hopefully this would lead to them being treated better.  But he did not do this by asserting propositions. He did not do it by making arguments. He did it by giving readers an experience that affected how they saw every experience they had after they had read the book.  Modern neurology seems to confirm this, for we now know that the brain is highly plastic, rewiring itself as a result of every experience, and thus affecting how every subsequent experience is recieved.  So, as a novelist, you should not be attempting to have your readers decode a proposition or an argument from your novel. Still less should you be trying to make sure they all decode the same proposition. You should be attempting to give them an experience which will play some part in shaping how they see the world after they have read it.  But by the same token, you can't guarantee that they will all experience your novel the same way, since how they receive any experience is shaped by all the experiences they have had in the past. Thus your novel will be, at least subtly, and perhaps profoundly, a different experience for each of your readers.  Your responsibility, though, is to try to make it an experience that is as complete as possible, as convincing as possible, and as true as possible to the aspect of human experience you are attempting to reflect."
How to handle a massive info dump post-ending?,"The Harry Potter books have all involved various amounts of post-climax exposition, with 1, 2, 4, and 5 being the heaviest (3 and 7 mostly rely on pre-climax exposition).  Of them, Order of the Phoenix is probably the most interesting. Why? Because Harry is screaming and throwing things at the walls. Your twist, and the revelation thereof is going to have a major impact on your characters. Find the ones who care the most - those with the most to gain or the most to lose - and involve them in the explanation.  The climax of the story should resolve the overarcing conflict of the story, but that doesn't mean you can't still have conflicts. Part of why Order of the Phoenix's exposition scene is effective is that it adds a conflict. Will Dumbledore regain Harry's trust before Harry destroys all of Dumbledore's possessions?  It's a very small, very personal conflict that adds a great deal to the scene. "
Using font to highlight a god's speech in dialogue,"I have seen capitalised or text used for this purpose, but again, almost exclusively in light-hearted works. It comes across as fourth wall breaking, saying ""Even the font thinks this character is powerful"". If that's your purpose, then bold text is probably fine.  On the other hand, you certainly shouldn't feel like you have to do it. I've seen lots of books which include extended dialogue with disembodied voices. The most common approach I've seen is to make the disembodied voice into a minor character, with its own characterisation. The first time the voice speaks, give a couple of sentences describing how the characters hear the voice (e.g. it echoes throughout the cavern, or they hear a voice with no discernible source, or they become aware of the words without really hearing them, or the words are burned into their souls). You could also describe how the voice sounds (gentle, booming, deep, crystal clear, etc.). Then when context doesn't make clear who's speaking, you can say ""The booming voice interrupted"" or ""the disembodied voice paused a moment before speaking"" or ""the with a laughing tone, the gentle voice said"". You can add a lot of character to the speaker with these kinds of descriptors. A separate font is fine, but not necessary. "
Referring to different instances of the same character in time travel,"I think it may be solved using the same term consistently. From what you wrote: ""the man"", ""his older counterpart"", ""his future self"", ""his older self"", ""Older Adrien"", and ""his other self"". Those are a lot of synonyms. While they are correct and they do convey the idea, a reader is going to be pulled out if you change ""the name"" of a character every third sentence.  Establish a single nick to distinguish between the two; if you can keep it short, the better (Older Adrien or Adult Adrien could be good and straightforward). You could also use ""old adrien"", maybe playing on the fact that from a teenager‘s point of view, being 20 years old seems like ""a big deal"". Once you choose a ""name"" for your character, readers will become accostumed to it, even if it gets repeated a lot. Those repetitions tend to become invisible to the readers, since our brains ""filter"" them out."
"How do I improve ""beige"" text?","Don't focus on vocabulary. It is very hard to change your vocabulary and the only real and natural way to do it is by extensive reading. Any attempt to artificially liven up your prose with exotic vocabulary is only going to sound forced.  Rather, focus on what you write about. The real texture of writing comes from what is written about, not from how it is written. Great fiction is, above all else, finely observed. It opens your eyes because the author had their eyes open. Observation, not diction, is the key to lively writing. "
"Are ""non-readers"" useful beta readers?","Assuming that by ""non-readers"" you mean ""people who are not fans of the genre you write"", they can be useful beta-readers. Here are some points for you to consider, in no particular order. However, when offering your work to be beta-read by a person who doesn't usually enjoy this type of literature, be aware that they might not enjoy your work either, and provide you no useful feedback at all. Don't get discouraged by this. And don't force your beta to go on with something they don't enjoy. The last point is important: if a beta reader isn't enjoying your story from the outset, all their feedback is going to be coloured by this. @Amadeus is right about people who'd rather be doing something else. A particular beta reader's feedback might prove useful, or not useful. Hear out what they have to say, consider it, but use also your own common sense - if a piece of advice strikes you as not useful, ignore it. But then, that's true of all beta readers."
Can I use the name Valerian in my sci-fi novel?,"Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. This is my understanding of the law. (a) You can't copyright a name. By definition, using the same name as someone else's character is not a copyright violation. (b) You can TRADEMARK a name. But in this case I think the authors of this French comic you refer to -- sorry, I never heard of it before just now -- would have a hard time claiming that they own trademark rights to the name ""Valerian"" as it's a name that existed hundreds of years before they wrote their stories. J K Rowling owns the copyright to the Harry Potter novels, but she doesn't own the name ""Harry"", and she can't sue you for writing a book with a character named ""Harry"". As someone else on here noted, trademark law is supposed to protect customers from being fooled and companies from losing business because of trickery. Like, ""apple"" is an ordinary English word. Apple Computers cannot sue the grocery store for calling the fruit that they sell ""apples"". Not only was the fruit around first, but no sane person is going to buy a fruit thinking that it's a computer or vice versa. But if you started your own computer company and called it Apple, the courts would likely conclude that you were trying to trick people and would rule against you in a minute. I created a (very) small business a few years ago, and when I did I got a pamphlet from the state with advice on trademarks that they encouraged me to read before making up a business name. Among the things they said was that there are different level of trademark protection depending on the nature of the name. If you give a business a very generic name, like ""Quality Auto Repair"", you have the minimum of trademark protection. If someone in another town 100 miles away opens a business with the same name, you probably won't win a trademark suit against him. If someone else uses your name as a general phrase, like if some other auto shop prints an ad where they say ""we perform quality auto repair ..."", the burden would be on you to prove that they were trying to trick people, and not that they were simply using the words coincidentally. At the other extreme is if you make up a new word. Like if you call your business ""Autreparex"", you have very strong protections. If someone else uses that word in his advertising, he would have a hard time claiming he was just using it as an ordinary English word. So you have the reverse here. If they're using the name ""Valerian"" as the title of their stories or as the name of a series, they'd have a case against you if you wrote stories in the same genre and also named them ""Valerian"". But if you simply have a character named ""Valerian"", I think they'd have a hard time suing you.  That said: As I said, I never heard of this comic book before. Maybe it's very popular in some places or among some groups of people. If it's popular among people to whom you hope to sell your books, it might be wise to avoid the name just so it doesn't look like you're trying to steal someone else's character. Like even if I absolutely knew that I could get away with it legally, I would not write an adventure story with an archaeologist name ""Indiana"", because whatever my reason for using that name, it would sound like I was trying to copy Indiana Jones. "
Dead children in pre-modern setting,"I would go with characters have dead siblings; but that happens off-screen. Showing it on-screen, and in-period-realistic, might be off-putting itself. Everything you are talking about is a statistical distribution; averages, a bell-curve of sorts. Nothing says your character have to reside in the center of it. So child-deaths can happen primarily to others, not the MC king or his relatives. Much of those deaths were due to the poor nutrition and the extreme labor of day-to-day living for the majority of people, that many royals need not experience directly. They have servants, they can rest all day, they don't have to struggle to feed themselves or other children. So I would portray the societal milieu somewhat accurately, but my characters are lucky enough to not experience the child deaths directly (unless that serves some plot purpose). They still recognize it, they still fear it, but hey, they're special, God takes pity on them and they're grateful for it. You can still have their relatives suffer that if you want, they just don't experience it themselves. A courier arrives with news of their sister Jane, she has lost her third child in a row. Thank God she has produced at least one heir. We must have her up for a visit, so we can comfort her."
How do I create uniquely male characters?,"I think what's tripping you up is the idea that your male characters need to be characters that could not possibly be female.  This probably comes from traditions of valuing what men do and devaluing what women do.  So many women aspire to do ""male"" things.  Showing them succeed at that can be a way of showing their uniqueness.  But very few men aspire to do ""female"" things, and those that do are either part of a queer subculture and/or are ridiculed for it. You can't easily have male characters who can just be male because plenty of women have stepped up and done what the men do.  But even those women can still also do things that only women do, because men don't step up and do them. My advice is to forget about someone existing to represent his or her gender and just write unique characters.  The way to do that is to fully flesh the character out.  Every human on this planet is unique once you get to know them well enough. Gender is part of someone's character for sure, and all the cultural norms and baggage and qualities will be part of someone's makeup.  What s/he does with them is part of what makes him/her unique. So your male character may or may not do things that are traditionally male.  But every breath he takes is infused with his culture, the society he lives in, the expectations of the company he keeps.  You don't have to spell this all out (it would get deathly dull), but know that he is aware of it (at least on some level) and it will influence how he acts, what he says, and the choices he makes. Little things can make all the difference.  For example, a man I know well is a feminist, does not fit into American standards of what a man should look like, and couldn't care less about how his sexual orientation is perceived.  But give him a task that involves carrying things and he will overload himself to just below the point where he topples over.  Especially if the other person(s) who can carry things has an injury (no matter how mild).  No extra trips either, if at all possible.  And honestly, at least in America, this is such a stereotypical male trait.  There are jokes and memes about it.  For some reason, this is the masculine hill he dies on. Your character will never forget he's a man.  Even if he chooses not to fit in as one.  So ask yourself, does he feel comfortable in his own skin?  How does he feel he compares to an ideal man?  He may laugh at that, but he still knows.  Or he may cringe.  Either way, he knows everyone else judges him that way. Don't look at uniqueness as what a character does, but, rather, who s/he is.  A female battalion commander may have an unusual position, but it doesn't make her interesting."
Showing mass murder in a kid's book,"You have two problems here: The first is dealt with very well in The Hobbit, for example. Already behind [Thorin] among the goblin dead lay many men and many dwarves, and many a fair elf that should have lived yet long ages merrily in the wood. And as the valley widened his onset grew ever slower. His numbers were too few. His flanks were unguarded. Soon the attackers were attacked, and they were forced into a great ring, facing every way, hemmed all about with goblins and wolves returning to the assault. The bodyguard of Bolg came howling against them, and drove in upon their ranks like waves upon cliffs of sand. Their friends could not help them, for the assault from the Mountain was renewed with redoubled force, and upon either side men and elves were being slowly beaten down.
  [...]
  “It will not be long now,” thought Bilbo, “before the goblins win the Gate, and we are all slaughtered or driven down and captured. Really it is enough to make one weep, after all one has gone through. I would rather old Smaug had been left with all the wretched treasure, than that these vile creatures should get it, and poor old Bombur, and Balin and Fili and Kili and all the rest come to a bad end; and Bard too, and the Lake-men and the merry elves. Misery me! I have heard songs of many battles, and I have always understood that defeat may be glorious. It seems very uncomfortable, not to say distressing. I wish I was well out of it.” There is both a general picture of the battle, with many dead, and the personal connection - multiple beloved characters are in danger. Fili, Kili and Thorin are killed, bringing heart-wrenching grief. All the relevant emotions are presented to the reader, evoked, explored: the horror of the battle, the MC's fear for his own life, his fear for those he (and the reader) care for, a moment of despair when the battle turns against them, hope unlooked for when the eagles come, grief when, although they've won, a great many are dead. There are no graphic details - no blood and gore. The scene is filtered through the narration. Bilbo is focused not on the visceral - not on cries of pain and spilt guts, but on other emotions. Almost, Tolkien paints not a picture of a battlefield, but a picture of a picture - the unsavoury bits have been cleaned up. The ""cleaned up"" part is very noticeable in a slightly later scene: There indeed lay Thorin Oakenshield, wounded with many wounds, and his rent armour and notched axe were cast upon the floor. He looked up as Bilbo came beside him. A very emotional farewell follows. The focus is all on the grief of Thorin dying, there's no descriptions of bloodstained bandages and whatnot. I think that's the right way to go in a book for children. Gory descriptions would be ""too much"", overwhelming the reader and distracting from what you want to tell. tl;dr: focus on hope/despair, grief, concern for friends. Avoid vivid descriptions of gore. Tell that people are dead, but don't show their death throes. The second depends on how you want the people who do the killing to deal with the situation, emotionally. The children might be too young to participate in the killing, but when Moses calls ""Whoever is for the Lord, to me!"" they are for the Lord, aren't they? So they would be part of the party doing the killing, even if they don't actively participate, and by extension, your readers are party to that too. In stories for children, good guys kill bad guys. Many goblins are killed in The Hobbit, and nobody bats an eyelash. But those people who made the golden calf - they were misguided and afraid. Can you truly paint them as monsters, whose death is nothing to be sad about? You've got to decide for yourself how you want to present this situation, why those people deserve to be killed (or maybe need to be killed although they don't deserve it). You've got to figure out how those men who do the killing rationalise it to themselves. Only once you've got that, can you think of how you present it all to your child-protagonists, and through them - to your readers."
Is it uncompelling to continue the story with lower stakes?,"In Game of Thrones there were two sets of stakes: the magical Night King, and the mundane power struggle for the Iron Throne. The characters reasonably decided they had to deal with the magical, more immediately existential threat before handling the mundane one.  Honestly I agree with you, and I also think that visual stories in general are escalating the stakes too high too fast. TV and movies are becoming too invested in the idea of ""kill 'em or go home."" Everything has to end in a death or it's not sufficiently interesting. I think there is a lot of value in smaller stakes: something emotionally important but not life-threatening.  The best way to handle this, I think, is to focus on how important the last-act stakes are to the characters. That will help the last-act stakes be more important to the readers. If your protagonist is desperate to get the MacGuffin to the Place for Plot Reasons, then getting out of the burning building is just one more (albeit hair-raising) obstacle to overcome. If we've invested enough in her journey to get to the place, then the simpler tasks of navigating the streets after escaping the building will be just as compelling as ""getting out of a building which is on fire."" It depends on how much urgency you as the writer give it.  A sequel is a new story. The stakes are whatever you make them. As an audience member, I frankly often enjoy a breather in story rhythm. I don't want every single story to risk the end of the world. I've walked away from TV shows because they can't stop escalating the stakes, and I'm tired of watching characters I love repeatedly tortured with no end or reward ever in sight. "
Submitting a novel for publication: do editors still expect Courier font?,"A significant proportion of agents and editors still want submissions in Standard Manuscript Format, which includes using a serif monospace font such as Courier. Many of them have become less fussy about the particular font and will also accept a proportional font such as Times Roman. However, in no case should you use a non-serif font, or anything that you wouldn't use in business correspondence. Double-spacing is still pretty much a universal requirement. In general, you'll always be safe by sticking to the most conservative standard, as no one will be bothered by it, and some people still require it."
Tools for science-based world building?,"SimEarth might work well for you. As I remember, in addition to the Earth simulation, there was Martian terraforming as well. It is an old DOS game; I wish Maxis had updated it for modern computers. Something that might also be interesting is EdGCM, the only global climate model I know of that will run on a PC. Changing the forcings in model can provide some interesting effects - global cooling, global warming and so on. For science fiction scenarios set in the distant past, (try the Iceball Earth scenario) an alternate present, or set in the future, it should provide some climate related ideas. Although they are not software, older RPGs like Traveller and Space Opera included systems for generating solar systems and planets. For terrain, try VistaPro. Also an older program, it works quickly and can use real-world DEM data (sections of the Earth and Mars are included) or randomly generate landscapes. Try using something like part of the southern US and raise the sea level a hundred feet or so for an interesting effect."
When should one *not* present events in chronological order?,"What's the most important thing that your readers need to know right way? What's the scene that will drag them into your story? The answers to those questions will tell you what should come first.  It's certainly possible to write a convoluted, insanely complex story, jumping back and forth in time. Kurt Vonnegut wrote: ""Start as close to the end as possible"", and he was amazingly skilled at writing such a book. Neil Gaiman writes stories nested within other stories, and then you find out you've been in another story all along. There's an entire genre of fiction based on the non-linear narrative, and its called detective fiction.  Can you making it easy for your reader to follow along? If so, there's no reason not to make your story more interesting by using non-linear narrative tools. If you're using them just to add spice to your story, then its going to be obvious that you're trying to pull one over on the reader.  To sum up, it all depends on the story you're telling. What is the absolute core of the story? Use whatever techniques will drive the story forward, including this. "
How should I quote American English speakers in a British English essay?,"Usually no. When quoting, it is assumed that you are using the original writer's dialect and spelling, since that is a part of what they wrote. The style guides I consulted agree on that point. APA has a blog post confirming that spelling standards pertain only to your own manuscript, not quoted material: The Publication Manual’s spelling guidelines apply only to the original writing in your paper. For references, keep the spelling in titles and other elements exactly as they appeared in the original. That is, cite what you see. ... Likewise, if you quote from the text, keep the original spellings. There’s no need to use [sic], as these are not errors. MLA suggests that quotes should not be changed unless absolutely necessary, which I would extend to differences in dialect. This is from 1.3.1: Use and Accuracy of Quotations in MLA 8: The accuracy of quotations is crucial. They must reproduce the original source exactly. Unless indicated in square brackets or parentheses, changes must not be made in the spelling, capitalization, or interior punctuation of the source. A few pages later, in 1.3.7, an example of keeping punctuation is annotated with ""Preserving original spelling see sec. 1.3.1,"" with an example of keeping a British English spelling: ""How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?"" wonders Victor Frankenstein in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (42)."" (First italics highlight what was annotated.) MLA is written for American writers, but the general principle should be true for you: keep the spelling as quoted unless your style guide tells you differently."
I feel suddenly disconnected from my writing. Time for a break?,"I would say, do not stop writing, do not break your habit of writing every day. Just stop writing THAT. Do some other writerly stuff, on this project or a different one. When I find I am stalling in a story, I also find that this is often because my subconscious mind knows there is something wrong with it, and perhaps some vague feeling that something is out of kilter is sapping your energy to write because it would be a waste of time. Check that out: Take your writing time to go back to the beginning, read and/or edit what you have done, looking for a plot hole. A character doing something out of character. Try to find out what is wrong with your story. A common problem for outliners is cardboard characters that begin to feel unnatural, as they are given the unplanned part of the story (dialogue, emotional reactions, individual actions, dress, thoughts, feelings) they become fleshed out in the author's mind, but increasingly (as the book progresses) they don't really fit the role prescribed for them in the outline. They have veered away, and if they DO the things they are required to do, it feels forced. Outliners can often see this in the span of half a book: The character on page 200 seems and feels like a different person than when they were introduced on page 1, not in the sense of having learned lessons or suffered heartbreaks, but the character on page 1 is inconsistent with the character on page 200. Maybe where the page-200 version would crack a joke or be irritated the page-1 version does nothing (or vice versa). Go back. read, revise, look for problems, see if you could improve anything, now that you have more experience writing and with the characters. Even if you do nothing, it will reload the story in your head and perhaps invigorate you. Another issue for outliners is gratification too long delayed. Fortunately, you have an outline: Instead of writing the scene you need now, skip it. Write the one after it, and come back to it. Find a fight later and plan the choreography. Write notes on later scenes. The biggest thing for me is to seriously consider that this may not be simple fatigue demanding a break, this may be your subconscious telling you there is something amiss in your story, and it doesn't want to write another word until you fix it. Actively look for it. Because taking a break doesn't fix the problem, and you may end up abandoning the work."
Keeping track of multiple plot lines,"I'm a visual person.  I have a large whiteboard which I used to draw graphs, flowcharts, etc...  If you're limited on room, like I am, take a picture of your drawing before you erase it and keep it as a digital file. You could also try the technique displayed in a lot of police investigation shows:  note cards and/or pictures taped to a wall with colored thread to show the connections between the characters/events."
Do I need to register my work to retain copyright?,"I am not a lawyer.  The observations below apply in the US, I don't know much about international copyright law outside the specific area of software copyrights. Here in the US, if you wrote something, you own the copyright on it, period.  All you need in order to assert that copyright is proof that you wrote something, and when.  There are many ways to do this.  I tend toward digital signatures but that's the geek in me.  Some people mail themselves a copy of their manuscript in a tamper-evident envelope so that they have the dated postmark on it and can prove it existed on the day it was mailed (note: keep it unopened until you get to court, so the judge sees you open it).  Some people give a copy to their lawyer to hold.  Some people simply share the work with enough friends/family that they figure enough witnesses will crop up if someone claims to have created the work.   If you aren't already familiar with cryptographic signatures, and a group of people or trusted neutral party who will sign your manuscript, the tamper-proof envelope is probably your most reliable, cheapest bet. That said... If you live outside the US, US copyright law will work differently for you, depending on what treaties we have with your country. If you don't trust a publisher not to steal your work, why do you trust them enough to do business with them in the first place?"
Warning signs that a publisher may be shady?,On evaluating a good publisher: Extras that make for an amazing publisher:
What's with all the hate on adjectives and adverbs?,"Abuse of adjectives and adverbs is the hallmark sign of pulp writing, showing the author has a poor grasp of the language. You usually use adjectives and adverbs when you try to make given noun or verb, respectively, more precise, more descriptive. This is fine when there is no better way to achieve this goal, but in a lot of cases, there is a better way. First off, think if your noun-adjective or verb-adverb pair can be replaced with a different noun or verb that achieves the same goal alone. Instead of finding precisely, pinpoint. Instead of moving quickly, dash. Instead of deep red, use crimson. Instead of hunting dog, pick hound. Next, think if the adjective or adverb adds anything, or if it's just redundant. Visit a wise sage to beg humbly for helpful advice in a quest to search for an ancient artifact to prevent catastrophic genocide? No, just no. And then think if your adverb is any good. Don't make them up. Don't replace whole clauses and sentences with them. They are cheap. Using them copiously makes your prose cheap. When to use them? When your alternative would be pretentious. There are strong nouns and verbs, that pinpoint given meaning, and there are pretentious ones, that replace common expressions adding very little to the meaning but sounding smart.
Really, ""She's incredibly beautiful"" is better than ""She's pulchritudinous"". "
"Finding before/after examples where writing has been improved, to learn from",Two books for you to read: On Writing by Stephen King.

Which Lie Did I Tell? by William Goldman.  Contains a full screenplay and coverage on that screenplay by industry people.  Great look at how others will see your work.   And a website: John August maintains a robust library of his work.  You can find original spec scripts and compare them to their final shooting counterparts. http://johnaugust.com/library
How to research sex for writing?,"You might find that research isn't quite so important. If you're describing a banquet, you don't need to picture how the guests chew and swallow their food.  For the scene with the two guys, you can focus on the foreplay - kissing, caressing, nibbling, petting, arousal, i.e all the things a person of either gender can imagine as pleasurable - and pay less attention to the genital stuff.  If you feel compelled to describe the physical positions during coitus, it's also going to depend on how (a) experienced and (b) adventurous each character is. The mechanics are pretty simple: a guy comes by having his penis stimulated, usually involving friction - mouth, hand, anus, groin-to-groin, etc. The two guys can take turns, or they can stimulate each other simultaneously. But honestly, how they come is less interesting to the reader than how they each feel and behave - are they nervous? confident? over-eager? submissive? playful? dominating? clumsy? tender? overwhelmed? shouting ""ride me cowboy""? For the guy in a wheelchair, sex may be more complicated. What's the nature of their disability? If it's a spinal injury, you'll need to address whether they can feel anything ""down there"". If they can't, there are special techniques to stimulate the penis to erection/ejaculation, but you'd have to research this - maybe the rehabilitation wing of a local hospital might be willing to help you. If the guy in the wheelchair can achieve an erection through the usual means, then it comes down to how restricted they are in adopting a desired position. Beyond that, see my comments in my second paragraph. I applaud you for the diversity of your characters, and not denying them the pleasure of physical contact. Most adult readers have experience of giving love and being loved; in the scenarios you've described, your task is to connect the reader with that experience. The mechanics are only relevant if they're important in the story."
Are complex sentences uncommon or unwanted in English?,"Short, forceful, sentences are clear and pleasant to read.  Long sentences (full of description and unnecessary circumlocution), while capable of containing more information than a much shorter sentence, have a tendency to indulge in bad habits like the passive voice, and oftimes the reader, upon reaching the end of a monstrously long and verbose sentence, doesn't remember what the sentence was supposed to be about."
"How do you add LGBT characters in your story in an organic fashion without coming off as ""pandering""?","Let's see here. (Looks at his extensive collection of comic books, novels, DVDs, etc.) For the most part, when a character is introduced to the typical story line, their sexuality is not an early thing to be discussed. For the most part, in comics and movies that are not ""about"" the sex the characters are having, it does not even come up during the story. Even in the typical novel it's not something that gets mentioned until it actually affects the story. Question: How do you know that somebody is a vegetarian? Answer: Don't worry, he will tell you. Example: How many episodes of Harry Potter were we treated to before JKR told us that Dumbledore was gay? So, unless the story is specifically about sexual activities, don't even bother mentioning it. If it does not affect the plot, you should carefully consider whether you should talk about it. Not just your character's sexuality, but any detail. When it does affect the story, you should introduce it like any other bit of information. Show don't tell. Don't make more of a deal of it than any other similarly important detail. Consider how you might explain that this character was a baker by trade, or that character could speak French, or the other liked to garden.  The fact that it's a detail about sexuality does not make it special. For example, if the character is in a couple you could just have the significant other (SO) come in and be described. Your audience will go ""Oh, Bill is married to John. OK."" And you have introduced them as gay. Doing anything else turns them into a ""dancing bear."" It's not so important how well a dancing bear dances, only that it does. So don't turn your characters into a circus performance. Keep them human."
How should a big universe be introduced without being boring?,"Explain what needs to be explained as it becomes relevant rather than trying to present all the information in one go. This has certain advantages: it avoids dumping all the information on the audience in one indigestible lump. it actually makes the world feel bigger. Info-dumps tend to bore readers to tears so avoid them: instead tell your readers the rules of magic that have bearing on a casting in progress, or describe a particular world only when the protagonist reviews the data files on it. Explaining your world one piece at a time tells the audience without actually saying it that the universe is too big and too complex for any one person to know all about it, or indeed all about any part of it. The example that came to mind when I saw this question was the Night's Dawn Trilogy, in almost every section of the story we're presented with information about the universe, but very few if any sections of the narrative are pure exposition. "
How soon is too soon for a redemption arc?,"Monica's excellent answer provides you with the how, but I'd like to touch on when, since you asked ""how soon is too soon?"" The rough answer is ""It's too soon if the villain hasn't earned it.""  Your villain has to walk all the way back through the brainwashing/teaching/propaganda etc. which got the person to the dark place s/he began the story. The villain has to unwind all the lies, and the longer s/he swallowed and believed lies, the longer (or the more violently dramatic) the unwinding and walkback have to be.  Additionally, there are two important facets to redemption you can't skip: 1) acknowledging that s/he was wrong, and 2) making amends for the villainy s/he did, to the extent that it's possible.  If the villain just sees the Mutant do something selfless, s/he is not just going to go ""Oh, gosh, I see now that Daddy God-King has been wrong all these years. Let me dash off to help the mutuants overthrow him!"" and expect that to be sufficient.  The villain has to un-think or re-learn all the negative things s/he was taught, which takes time and effort (as Monica eloquently showed). Then the villain has to realize ""I did evil things. Those things were wrong."" That sense of ""I was wrong"" has to stick. No villain can be redeemed without acknowledging this. Rationalizing or villainsplaining won't cut it.  Finally the villain has to do something to try to rebalance the scales. Whether that's working to overthrow Evil Daddy God-King, helping mutants escape, lobbying legislators to change laws, or a suicide bombing, if the villain does not do some good to balance out the bad, the villain isn't redeemed. It may be that the villain murdered children. That's something you can't ever really make amends for, but you can carry the weight of it on your soul, and try to save as many future children as you can, or give your life to protect one.  The villain has to try to be as good as s/he was bad to earn redemption, or your readers may feel cheated. "
Pronouns when writing from the point of view of a robot,"Either Tom and Mil are characters, or they are inanimate mechanical constructs. Examining the latter case: Machine B removed the connector from Machine A's port and inserted it into one on the door. This looks fine. Notice ""arm"" was replaced with ""port,"" to get rid of any hint of anthropomorphism (also, the original phrasing suggests that the door has arms). Machine A now was again alone with its thoughts. Something feels wrong here. Inanimate objects typically don't have thoughts. Before meeting Machine B, it hadn't cared about that, but now it felt like something was missing from it. Again, something is wrong. Inanimate objects don't have cares or feelings, and the thought of things ""meeting"" one another in this manner seems off. That was illogical, Machine A knew, as it was still a complete robot with nothing missing. And yet, something in its circuits told it that it was incomplete. Machine A couldn't make sense of it. Whether machines can know things or reason about them (in the same sense as sentient beings) seems like a topic for debate, but this sounds like the inner thoughts of a character, not some routine being dispassionately executed by a computer program. You might conclude that Tom and Mil are better written as characters, and not simple mechanical constructs. Do you think of Tom as male? Call him he. Do you think of Mil as female? Call her she. Calling them ""it"" feels stilted to me; assigning them genders does not.  There's precedent for this in writing and in real life: read about Marvin the Paranoid Android, or strike up a conversation with a friend about Amazon's Alexa and see how long it takes them to refer to the device as ""she."" Or, you might decide that it's more interesting to write about them like you'd write about any other inanimate object. But doing that convincingly seems like it would require extensive changes to the story.  Either way, in my opinion what you have now in the ""it"" example amounts to sitting on the fence, while the ""he"" example feels natural."
"How to describe skin colour, if ""white"" is not the point of reference?","I like to equate skin tones with food or natural objects.  Caramel, chocolate, cream, sand, etc.  Eye and hair color work well this way too. There are so many beautiful shades of skin it is a shame to leave it out of descriptions.  White people tend to focus on hair and eyes and ignore skin aside from the very large divisions of black and brown and white (not that anyone's skin is truly black or white).  Or they mention ""tanned"" which implies a change from the natural color due to leisure or work in the sun.   The Black community in particular has a rich history of naming different skins, and then depicting them in written or visual art.  Many other ethnic groups have gorgeous descriptions.  Reading how they do it should help fuel your ideas. People notice if you leave it out.  Maybe not white people (they'd notice if you never described hair color), but certainly people from the cultures you're writing about. In addition to comparing people's colors to natural objects, you can compare them to each other.  ""Her lover's skin was translucent against hers.  Cream marked with the
  slightest tint of beet.  Her own ebony seemed almost blue in the
  morning light."""
Act 3 totally broken...keep writing?,"Fix it now. If you realize you made a mistake, go back and fix it now. Not, I stress, because the last 20K would be ""wasted,"" because no writing is wasted, but because it's clearly blocking you and you don't want to write it. Carve off whatever pieces aren't going to fit and put them in a slush file. I like this method because it feels less painful than outright deleting, and because sometimes I can reuse or repurpose character beats or even specific sentences or phrases somewhere else in the book. "
What makes a character irredeemable?,"The trait that makes Dolores Umbridge, and other characters, repulsive, is sadism. Enjoying the suffering of others, enjoying causing pain - we find that unforgivable. A villain who hurts others due to some twisted perception of it being right and necessary - they can (theoretically) come to understand that their motivation was wrong. But for Umbridge, who simply enjoys making people suffer, to have a redemption arc - the very core of her personality, her defining trait, would have to be altered for her to even start on the path. Sadism is her defining trait, and to be ""redeemed"" she'd have to stop enjoying causing pain and start perceiving it as wrong. But because that's the character's defining trait, if she did that she's no longer be Dolores Umbridge. Another element at play is ""a million is a statistic"". It's very hard for us to grasp large numbers of victims. We perceive tragedy much stronger when the victim is a character we knew and came to love. We are far less inclined to forgive then. Voldemort might have killed hundreds or thousands, but it all happens off-screen, to people we've never known. Umbridge, on the other hand, tortures characters right before our eyes. (Read more about this phenomenon on tvtropes). Note that Voldemort, while not particularly reviled by readers, is never presented as ""redeemable"". The trope is at play in much stronger form in Star Wars, which @FrancineDeGroodTaylor mentions: Darth Vader kills an entire planet of unnamed people, then saves one Luke Skywalker, and he's redeemed."
How can I make a character who isn't a jerk seem like one?,"Such characters are often found, from the works of Jane Austen to those of Tolstoy. People are perceived as what they appear to others either through actions or words. In Pride and Prejudice, Elizabeth Bennet comes to believe that Mr Darcy is arrogant and not worth her time, but she later realizes her error. Quiet people who do not seek to please the opinion of others might be seen as proud (or a jerk) while they are simply aware of their own worth.  Others, reticent by upbringing, can appear cold and distant. Certain cultures inculcate the notion that strength of character means being a man of very few words. Choose what kind of person your MC truly is, then select a somewhat skewed view for your other character to have, always seeing him silent might make them wonder, but maybe he believes it is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than speak and remove all doubt. "
How to get readers to care about a dead character?,"You don't necessarily want or need flashbacks and you don't necessarily need the reader to like the character who died in an intimate way where they actually know who that character was. What you want is for the reader to understand what the lack of this character has done to the world and to see other people who for good reason miss that character. An example: your main character used to make coffee for his girlfriend every morning. He wakes up and is tired, not quite there; makes two cups and leaves hers on the counter, takes a sip of his own and then remembers there's no one to drink the second cup. Here you see the main character cared enough to do something for this person, and you get to see his sadness when something simple and mundane falls apart. He can get choked up for a moment, doesn't have to melodramatic and just pour out the coffee and walk out the door. Little things like that. Show where the connections used to be and are now severed. If there's a group, make sure there's an obvious empty spot in the room. Just add a bit of stress. Showing how the living liked and cared for the person who his gone and how they're diminished just a bit without that person in their lives is enough. Flashbacks are often crutches. They're usable, but not necessary to simply impart a sense of grief, loss, and even likability for the dead. It really depends on what you're trying to say as to which way you go. A character who was overly dependent on his gf might have relied on her a lot and been quite thankless while he had her around. You can make him really look like a jerk depending what examples of severed ties you use. But, a guy who did a lot for the gf is going to come across as more sympathetic, unless he literally did everything in which case you can get into overly codependent or sycophant territory again. My recommendations for avoiding common mistakes are these: It's likely going to be bad if your character cries at the end of multiple scenes/chapters because it likely won't feel earned. Not everyone is a cryer, for one, and for two crying is used regularly as a shortcut for more of a tell and less of a show. (Show Don't Tell; This one's non-obvious to some people because if novice authors show a character crying, but don't do the show of the emotional baggage behind it that really earns the moment) Avoid the mary-sue. No one is perfect. Make sure the relationship and the people in them had flaws, even if they're endearing flaws. Don't make it totally flawed either. You're not looking for perfect balance, but you don't want to tip the scales into unbelievabality. Less is more. Remind enough that the reader gets it, but if its not important to the active story a lighter touch is better. Every time you break for a moment like this it will throw a speed bump in your pacing. The longer the break, the more off track you'll get (you're right to worry about this); but you still need something. People don't always agree about who other people were. They're rarely really far off, but it does happen. Keep in mind that not everyone will think the same thing about a person or have the same insights, but they'll all be shades of the same color. Based in the same events/facts, but different in how they were experienced. You don't need to go so far as outright hatred or outright love for everyone, in fact you shouldn't, but every person should have their own unique-but-similar reaction to the loss of the character. Intimacy-distance,  Experience-Unfamiliarity & support-antagonism are all vectors you can play with and they can be different (and were) at different points in the past. Finally, your characters all want things. It helps if the gf who is gone factored into what those characters wanted and whether they get to have them now. Its best when some of those things end up conflicting and other issues that seemed insurmountable suddenly become easier to do as the politics of life changes. Not everyone and everything should be affected, but a few goals here and there should. With regards to your edit: you can still do the above, everyone always has a past, but it it's tangential to your primary story line, then you don't want to dedicate a lot of time to it. If this is what your story is about, then flashbacks are an option, but not the only one. You can do any of the above and go deeper with character interaction, implying enough. Consider a character who is unsettled by the replicant because he knew the gf. Or another who sees in her what he can't have, or one who was always in love with the original. There are lots of variants, but the death doesn't make it very special. Mystery is good for a story, so as long as people don't get confused by your story stay on target."
Occupational Hazards to being a Full-Time Writer,"To elaborate: To eat, you need a steady inflow of cash. To have a steady inflow of cash, you would need at least one book, more likely - several books, already out there. Or you need to have enough cash already, that you don't need to care about having an inflow. There are in-between possibilities: you might find employment as a journalist or a translator - jobs that would improve your writing skills, and thus get you closer to eventually striking out on your own (once you have something published). But those jobs wouldn't pay half as well as being a software developer. So you've got to be prepared for that. You've got to remember that stories like J.K. Rowling's are extremely rare. Most starting novelists would be fitting the Starving Artist trope if they didn't have some other means of supporting themselves, and many never get their ""breakthrough"" at all."
Can You Mix Readers of Fantasy and Sci-Fi?,"The novel I'm writing is actually along this vein, and I had the same thought as you: it appears to be a portion of the market that is yet to be fully recognized and tapped into. Whilst it definitely exists, not a lot of mainstream fiction seems to explore the vast possibilities of combining these two distinct yet similar genres. Media are generally categorized as ""Sci-Fi/Fantasy"" because there tends to be a lot of overlap between the people who like the two different types of fiction. Although this isn't always true, it's usually enough of a generalization to assume that if someone is a fan of one, they would also be a fan of the other. However, a high majority of fans of both Sci-Fi and Fantasy will have an opinion on which they prefer; they will rarely like both types of fiction equally. This means that few people will looking for pieces of work that combine the two 50/50. So writing books that split the two down the middle will be a niche audience, who are looking to read something that caters to multiple of their interests, whilst readers who prefer one over the other may choose to read it, but are unlikely to be drawn to it naturally. That's not to say that you shouldn't write it, but you would need to understand that it is a niche market that you are writing for. What you may be looking for, and what I believe is the best solution to the issue, is to not do both entirely equally, but rather have either a Fantasy piece with Sci-Fi elements or a Sci-Fi novel containing aspects of Fantasy. This way, let's say you choose to write your first example of Fantasy creatures in a post-apocalyptic age on earth, you could write it as a Fantasy novel with swords & sorcery, but also contains things such as radiation, ancient technologies from humans before the apocalypse, and even maybe popular themes of Sci-Fi such as attempting to rebuild civilization. However, it would need to be made clear to the readers early on what it is they are reading. Within the first 2 or 3 chapters you would need to establish which genre your piece is, but also establish that it will also contain portions of another genre. That last thing you want to do is write an entirely Fantasy novel, then in the final couple of chapters include a big twist that they were on a spaceship all along, unless you drop clues about it throughout the story."
"I'm getting tired of ""he said"" ""she said"" in dialogue; how do I get around it?","I like to describe the how (explain intonation, body language) and the purpose of the dialogue, not just the fact of the speech being made.

What breaks suspension of disbelief?,"Basically, anything that the reader considers implausible when he's already suspending disbelief, can spoil the illusion and break that suspension. The key issue to understand is that up to a certain point, your story is exposing the world of the story, and explaining what's allowed and what isn't. Anything you establish clearly, the reader will be willing to accept, and suspend disbelief over. Anything implausible that you don't explain, or suggest can be explained (perhaps later), is not ""protected"", and can prompt readers to feel that the story is nonsensical or contrived - not in the agreed-upon, ""protected"" premise, but in the reasonable flow of events and consequences from that premise. What, precisely, seems implausible may be highly individual. Here are major issues in my experience. Excessive and/or unacknowledged inconsistency with the real world: In the real world, time travel is almost certainly objectively impossible; that doesn't mean you can't write time travel stories. But if you do something that's impossible in the real world without explaining it, or making it clear that this is an interesting difference from real-life, and you-the-author are aware of this, then you come across as ignorant. The reader has difficulty trusting in your story. This could be scientific knowledge (""you couldn't really do that""), local knowledge (""that city doesn't really look like that""), social knowledge (""people don't _really act that way""), etc., etc. Coincidence as a plot development: If anything immensely unlikely happens, it's best for it to happen at the beginning - as part of the premise. Using coincidence as a plot development can feel contrived - since it's not really a coincidence, but fiat on the author's side, the reader can sense that the author is deliberately manipulating the story in implausible, artificial directions, and he loses faith in the plot as being plausible, natural, and thus significant. Unjustified references to real-world elements: In fantasy and science fiction, direct references to the real world can be very distracting. They have no more reason to dwell on, say, 21st century politics than we have to dwell on 13th century politics. It's unlikely that 2000 years from now, all spaceships will be named for current SF writers (and no future ones...). Even things that are similar can provoke this reaction - e.g. you don't want to name your fantasy princess ""Diana"" even if ""Diana"" is a perfectly fine name and it makes perfect sense for there to be a ""Princess Diana"" in your world. References to the real world, our world, throw the reader out of the story world. Most of these issues can be solved by sufficient set-up - if you establish the unbelievable premise in a clear and plausible manner, it ceases to be unbelievable. But if you don't need something that's tough to justify, then avoiding it to begin with is often wise. "
How to tell readers your story is a re-imagination of a popular story?,"Romeo and Juliet is in the public domain. And it's not even the source material - Shakespeare borrowed the story from somewhere else, (Pyramus and Thysbe is one very similar story, and Ovid didn't invent it either) and retold it in the form of the famous play. That means you're free to rework the source material. The same is true of common fairy tales, and for works that are in fact original, but already in the public domain. For example, Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book recently got retold by Neil Gaiman as The Graveyard Book. No mentions of the original - it's for the reader to figure it out. (Technically, he mentioned it in the Acknowledgements section, but that's not a legal requirement). Retellings of older stories are common enough, and fall within the realm of intertextuality. That's when there is a strong relationship between two texts, and the latter is better understood in light of the former. If you feel strongly that you should acknowledge the influence of another work on yours, you can always mention it in the Acknowledgement section in the end. But I do not recall James Joyce, for example, formally acknowledging that Ulysses is strongly connected to the Iliad. He expected readers to be smart enough to figure that out by themselves (from the title, for one thing). Note that all this is only true for works that are in the public domain. If a work is not yet in the public domain, you can expect to beet accusations of plagiarism."
How to not confuse readers with simultaneous events?,"If your goal is hectic momentum, then two-sentence paragraphs with a visual indicator of ""scene change"" might work.  Colonel Mustard frantically wiped up the table. No one would believe he hadn't done it.

Is head-hopping always bad?,"It's fine if the switch is clearly intentional and well sectioned-off. It's fine to jump between POVs for say, chapters or whole scenes. What isn't all right is a book that mostly is one POV, but occasionally will be privy to the thoughts and feelings of another character for a single line/paragraph of a scene, then hops right back to the main character's POV. If you want the freedom to show any character's thoughts at any time, don't bother with a POV style at all, just write with an omniscient narrator. Having mostly a POV style and breaking consistency for a random moment, that is what's referred to as head-hopping. What you refer to is just multiple POVs or omniscient narration, which happens... pretty much everywhere. I myself wrote in dual POVs; a protagonist and deuteragonist, alternating with each chapter. That, I believe, is perfectly acceptable."
How to be mindful of the reader when handling disturbing/distressing subjects?,"You should always be mindful of why a reader is reading your book. People are reading for a reason. In the case of fiction, they are reading for pleasure. People may take pleasure in reading about serious and difficult subjects. One of the functions of fiction is to provide vicarious experiences that we can use to prepare ourselves for the things that we may face in life.  But when it comes to scenes of violence, there are two very different way in which the reader may enjoy what they are reading. Their enjoyment may come through sympathy or it may come through sadism. Their pleasure may come from vicariously resisting the pains that are inflicted, of from vicariously inflicting them. Any great dwelling on the detail of the abuse itself seem more likely to excite the reader who is taking pleasure in vicariously inflicting those pains, rather than in vicariously resisting them.  Remember that armchair travel, even for serious purposes, is travel with most of the discomfort, tedium, danger, and pains removed. The armchair traveller wants to come near the most enjoyable parts of the journey without suffering all of its trials and tribulations. How much do you really think the reader of your story wants to have their nose rubbed in the abuse itself. It is more likely that the reader you seem to want will want to spend most of their time on the effects of the trauma rather than the trauma itself.  Remember too that effects in fiction are achieved largely through correct setup, not through lurid description of the event itself. Establish the innocence of the innocent and the vileness of the vile first, and then let the innocent wander into the lair of the vile and let the reader's imagination do most of the work. This way the reader is in control over how long and in how much depth they dwell on the details of the event itself. "
How advisable is it to end a love story on a downer?,"In line with what Fred Bob said, I think it can feel upsetting as a reader if the romance is the main plot-line and it just ends with one of them dying or whatever.  I am not against unhappy endings, but they have to be done right. I feel like the best way to have the relationship end unhappily is if there is a greater message you are trying to portray. For example: In his literary classic 1984, (spoilers, if you haven't read it) George Orwell has an ending that is very much so an unhappy one. In part one, you learn, through Winston, what the regime is like. Through Julia and their romance, Winston believes in rebelling against the regime. When they are both captured, you hope that their love for each other is enough to keep them strong, but it isn't. They both break, and turn on each other, demonstrating that Big Brother always wins. It wouldn't be true to Orwell's dystopian future if their love prevailed enough to upset the entire regime. By the end of the novel, you feel defeated, but that is the point. You don't feel robbed of a good ending by the author--you feel upset that Big Brother is how it is, and the general dismay was the entire point of the book and its ending.  You could also use the relationship to prove a point. Maybe X and Y, who love each other, aren't good for each other. And the story demonstrates how unhealthy their relationship is, until the characters finally realize it themselves. And they end up, not together, but still better off.  I think the main thing to keep in mind is that the ending doesn't have to be ""happy"" but it should still convey the overall message of your story, and it should be meaningful, even if it isn't happy.

"How can I make a ""meeting in VR"" less dumb?","In Contact the 'mysterious stranger' is Jodie Foster's father, and the setting is a beach she knows from her childhood, and the VR is transparently VR, she touches the 'screen' and disturbs the image at some point.  in Dark Matter the setting changes with the will and emotions of the virtual character. What they have in common is too much reliance on BEING virtual [i.e. artificial] reality, just as almost nobody does a good job of portraying ""artificial intelligence"".  If your characters can distinguish the difference between the artificial and real, then the artificial isn't doing a good enough job. If Data in Star Trek was a good AI, we would not have known it from his behavior or speech until it was revealed explicitly by another character (or mishap that exposed his innards). They make another common mistake too, with both AI and supposed 'geniuses'. Namely, if they are so smart and able to absorb lessons, it seems odd they can't figure out at least analytically the most basic human speech, manners, and interactions so they don't stand out like socially incompetent clowns constantly ridiculed for their social awkwardness as if they were incapable of learning anything. Anyway, you can mention your VR meeting place is virtual but inviolate; you cannot change it with a thought, you can stub your toe or cut your finger and it will hurt like hell: The VR is invasive and smart and has access to your sensory neurons, that is the only way it works, and VR feels like the real thing, including for sex or fighting or anything else. The action of your motor neurons are suppressed (so you remain motionless), but the feedback sensory neurons work; when you run in VR it feels like running, if you get shot in VR it feels like being shot. The only difference is you were not really shot, or running, or cut by the paring knife. You may lose consciousness in VR due to such virtual injuries, but that is the safety valve: Before you enter shock the smart VR does an orderly shutdown of the experience and wakes you up, so you don't have a heart attack or something. The advantage of this approach is that, other than the safety valve prohibiting shock or death, this is no different than a meeting in reality. If no serious injury or pain occurs, it is indistinguishable, and for the purpose of this meeting the setting can be forced to be a real place, the patient's home or someplace they know well.  So if you are capable of writing your scene in a real place, skip all the dumb tropes of what VR is, and make it a perfect deception. This creates one problem, easily solved.  You should make this particular level of VR a new and experimental thing. If it were common, it would already be used to contact locked in patients. Or, make the ability to adapt it to a damaged brain something new and experimental; perhaps even devised by the MC for this purpose: In other words, it already exists and works for healthy brains, but has failed for those with severe brain trauma, so the MC figures out how to adapt it to make it work (or finds some shady character that can). In the latter case, the patient may realize they are in this kind of VR the moment it turns on, and be grateful for it. Because even a VR like this could let them live a life again; have contact with the outside world, etc. It is up to you (the author) if the VR is allowed to be permanent or not, it would add some drama if the patient knew it was only a temporary reprieve from her prison."
What is the difference between ISSN and ISBN?,"The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) identifies a single, nonrecurring publication, such as a novel. The International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) identifies a serial, recurring publication, such as a monthly journal. I tried to give the clear and concise answer asked for in the question. But given the other answers and comments, I'd like to clarify some misunderstandings: The word ""book"" does not have the same meaning for the publishing industry as for the general public. For a lay person, a book is defined by its appearance, e.g. the number of pages, the binding, and so on. For the book industry, on the other hand, a book is defined as a non-recurring publication. ISBNs can be assigned not only to what the lay person thinks of as a book, but also to audiobooks, ebooks, maps, software, looseleaf services, and so on. On the other hand, what looks like a book to the lay person may in fact be an issue from a recurring publication such as a journal or a series of monographs and will carry an ISSN."
How to write cleanly even if my character uses expletive language?,"Each usage has its place. #1 is most commonly used in such situations. Even if you're not writing for children, you don't necessarily want every bit of cursing. Sometimes telling that the character used a strong word is enough, or even more effective, than actually spelling out what exactly he said. #2 has place when you're writing for adults, who would know what you're hiding, but you still wish to keep a cleaner tongue. This solution only makes sense in speculative fiction - not in a story set in our here-and-now. #3 might be in character for the person doing the cursing. Some people automatically resort to the milder words - that's how they've been raised, that's their natural vocabulary. If that is the case for the particular character, feel free to use it. Make sure it matches the rest of the characterisation though. #4 if you use that, you are throwing the reader out of the immersion in your story. You are presenting the reader with a meta element - an in-story word has been visibly blacked-out outside. Terry Pratchett used this for comedic effect, with a hardened criminal who was literally saying '--ing' all the time. This is a tool you'd want to apply very carefully though, while being aware that you are throwing the reader out of the story - only do it if this is the deliberate effect you're seeking."
How to write painful torture scenes without being over-the-top,"If the torture scene is happening to your MC or your current narrator, instead of focusing on all the blood and gore which can make a lot of readers queasy or uncomfortable, focus on the narrator's agony.  If your goal is to both portray the goriness of torture to send a message AND show your narrator's pain, and especially since you said yourself you haven't really witnessed anything gory or violent, you should watch a horror movie or at least read up on torture.   If the torture scene is happening to someone else and your narrator is watching, focus on the narrator's absolute horror and disgust at what they see.  You don't have to do a play by play of every single action, but to show the reader why your narrator is so terrified, you should give the reader a taste of what the narrator sees.   If you're totally uncomfortable with blood and gore and you just can't get it to work in your writing, try psychological torture.  This focuses almost completely on the mind, so you can take it wherever you want to."
Feedback: What to use and what to ignore?,"Feedback is an enormously complex topic, for everyone, everywhere, in every role in life. Some people understand that it's complex. Others do not. Avoid feedback from people who think feedback is simple. Here are some (perhaps too many) of my thoughts. Charlie Seashore offers this technique: When someone gives feedback, put it in a mental briefcase. Then thank the person, close the briefcase, and leave. Later, if you want to, open the briefcase and take a closer look at the feedback. If you want to, do something with the feedback. At all times, you get to decide what to do with feedback, or whether to do anything at all with it. Family therapist Virginia Satir said, ""Taste everything. Swallow only what nourishes."" I think this lovely guideline works well for receiving feedback about writing. If someone's feedback fits for you, apply it. If not, don't. Of course, this means you have to have some way of deciding whether a given bit of feedback nourishes. This is difficult to do when you are unsure of yourself. And if you're seeking feedback, you are to some extent unsure of something. So receiving feedback always poses that challenge. If you knew for sure how to evaluate the feedback, you wouldn't have needed the feedback. But here's the thing. The more your default reaction to feedback is to change your stories, the less of you there is in your stories. Only you can decide what nourishes you. My first rule: When in doubt, trust yourself. My second rule: Doubt. What responsibility do you have to respond to feedback? None. You are under no obligation to respond in any way to feedback, much less to apply it. Taste everything. Swallow only what nourishes. The Giver's Rule says: Ninety percent of feedback is about the giver. Feedback you get from online writing communities comes from other writers. Writers in those communities mostly know no more than you do about writing. Feedback from writers is heavily distorted toward ""rules"" that they have picked up from somewhere. One way to detect such rule-bound feedback is phrases like ""you can't"" and ""you must."" Another way: Any ""feedback"" about how to ""fix"" your story. Readers don't tell you how to fix your story. They tell you how they reacted to it. That isn't to say that feedback from readers is unbiased. Of course it is. Reader feedback is biased by each reader's tastes. No matter where you get feedback, you will have to sort out for yourself which parts of the feedback are about your story, and which parts are about the giver. For more about The Giver's Rule, see my favorite book about feedback: What Did You Say? The Art of Giving and Receiving Feedback, by Charlie and Edie Seashore and Jerry Weinberg. Look for feedback that focuses on how the reader reacted to the story, and less on feedback that purports to be the truth your story. Here are two statements, each feedback about the same movie: Both statements express judgments. The first statement is phrased as a judgment of the movie. The second is phrased as the viewer's reaction to the movie. Prefer feedback that is more clearly about the reader's reaction. Distrust feedback phrased as the truth about your story. If someone gives even the slightest indication that their feedback is brutally honest, run. Honesty is not brutal. Brutality is not honest. Never accept feedback about how to fix your story. Fixing the story (if you think it needs fixing) is your job, not theirs. Anyone who tells you how to fix a story is telling you their story, not yours. Writers tend to evaluate using writing myths, not reader sensibilities. Prefer feedback about how the reader reacted. Especially look feedback about clarity, significance, and believability. Prime yoursel to look for the answers to three questions: Huh? So what? Oh, really? And of course, look for (and ask for) feedback about what the reader loved. This helps to make sure you don't damage the good stuff while you fix the stuff that needs fixing. Feedback can sometimes be more useful if you focus on a specific aspect of your work, rather than general ""whatever feedback you can give me."" Pick a single, specific aspect of craft to work on. Maybe dialogue, or scene openings, or pacing, or viewpoint, or description. For your next story or two or five, focus on practicing that aspect of your writing. Then ask for feedback about that specific aspect. Never, ever seek or accept feedback about a story you are writing. See my answer elsewhere. Do not use feedback to fix this story, unless the feedback points out a clear error. Use feedback about this story to write better stories in the future."
How/When to create deliberately boring characters?,"The real question is: boring to the writer, boring to the reader, or boring to the other characters? If the character bores you as the writer, either change the character or excise him/her. That person has no place in your story. I just had to do this myself two weeks ago, and it made a massive, awesome improvement in the entire book. If the character is boring to the reader (you're getting notes from your betas reading, ""Man, Snodgrass again? This guy is made of cardboard! Why are you giving him so much screen time?"" when he's supposed to be a major villain), you have a problem. Even your NPCs and your cameos shouldn't make the reader feel the need to flip to the next page. Not every walk-on needs a full biography, but if your character talks to the same barista every morning, give her a nose-ring with a bell on it or something. Or the main character should notice her green eyes, which make her think of the green scarf her girlfriend gave her ten years ago, and she thinks of the scarf every morning for a split second whenever she sees the kid's green eyes. If the character is boring to the other characters, that's actually fine. That's drama. Your main character should roll her eyes when Snodgrass trudges into the room. And you don't have to redeem Snodgrass from being boring, either;  he can just be the comic relief by being boring. But that makes him interesting in his own way — what boring thing is he going to say next, and can your main character refrain from popping him one in the jaw? To focus on your question, yes, even the 95% of the elves who don't speak have ""personalities,"" even if they don't get names. They are beautiful, graceful, solemn; trackers, singers, archers; Galadriel's women who weave cloaks, etc. Don't over-focus on the barista with the bell in her nose if she's not the point of the scene, but if there's any interaction beyond ""she got coffee on her way to work,"" then bell the barista."
emacs for creative writing,"My personal setup uses Vim, but a large part of the stack would be applicable to any sufficiently advanced text editor. (Note: ""sufficiently advanced text editors"" are basically just emacs and Vim.) I don't know of any existing package that does all of this, but writing this for myself was actually pretty easy since it's just a matter of stitching together the existing tools. I compose all of my stories using Markdown markup (the same markup that StackExchange uses on all of its sites). This allows me to do basic formatting (italics, underlining, outlining) with simple text decorations. For ordinary writing purposes, more complicated formatting is almost never necessary and is almost always a distraction. There already exist packages for both Vim and Emacs to facilitate syntax highlighting and other shortcuts for composing text in Markdown. I write with Vim's spell-checker turned on. My .vimrc (.emacsrc for you) automatically looks for a file called .custom.add in the same folder as the file, and includes it as a custom dictionary. This allows me to add character names, place names, invented words, etc. to the custom dictionary for every story. When I'm done, the .custom.add file then serves as a convenient list of characters and other non-English words that appear in the story. I have mapped a keystroke to invoke dict, allowing me to look words up in a dictionary with a single button, either to search for synonyms or check on my spelling. I've mapped other keystrokes to exporting to any of the formats discussed below. I use pandoc for converting from Markdown into any of the myriad formats that pandoc supports. In my case, I'm interested in LaTeX (which I later convert into PDF), HTML, and RTF. Getting good LaTeX and RTF output requires that you write a custom output template, but this is actually pretty trivial, and the pandoc documentation covers this in plenty of detail. I use the sffms LaTeX package for typesetting the LaTeX/PDF output. Sffms makes it dead-simple to create manuscripts that fit standard manuscript format with no effort at all. I prefer to send PDFs to people unless they've specified otherwise. RTF can be read natively by every existing word-processing program, so I rarely find the need to convert it to something else. If I do, I open up the RTF file in Word and then save it in Word format, which is usually the only other thing that people ask for."
How can I improve my sentence construction or flow in general writing?,"1. READ A LOT I agree with @Cloudchaser that writing is a craft you have to practise. You should absolutely read these books that have been recommended to you. Read as many as you can on the craft of writing and if blogging is your thing, analyse the style of other successful blogs. 2. DON'T EXPECT TO GET IT RIGHT FIRST TIME But no amount of reading will make up for writing and re-writing, drafting and redrafting. Very few writers get it right first time, even the best. Read this, you'll feel better: https://writershq.co.uk/shitty-first-drafts-by-anne-lamott/ 3. LET YOUR READER BREATHE Writing in a style that is easy for a reader to understand is about balance. You can have long sentences, there's nothing wrong with that, but intersperse them with short sentences to give the reader a chance to breathe. 4. SEEK TO ENTERTAIN, NOT IMPRESS Friedrich Nietzsche said that: “Good writers have two things in common: they prefer to be understood
  rather than admired; and they do not write for knowing and over-acute
  readers.” And I agree with that wholeheartedly. Focus on keeping your writing interesting and entertaining rather than seeking to impress (and bore) with a wealth of knowledge. 5. CUT CUT CUT 'Kill your darlings', that is: analyse coldly whether what is interesting to you is going to be interesting to the reader. Cut extraneous information and self-indulgent ramblings (not that I'm suggesting you do that). 6. GET FEEDBACK Feedback from readers is gold dust because we often can't see the wood for the trees in our own work. Ask people you admire, who write well, to read your work for you. Ask them where they got bored, when they put the work down. Ask them if anything was difficult to read or understand. A professional writer who doesn't rely on feedback is a rare beast indeed. 7. Most important of all: READ IT OUT LOUD When we read, particularly something we've written ourselves, our brains fill in blanks, filter, and drift in and out of deep thought. Reading out loud forces you to hear and develop your own unique voice. It draws attention to sentences that are difficult to say, and therefore probably difficult to read. It highlights when you're waffling on and maybe even boring yourself (let alone your reader). And it helps you to hear the rhythm of speech and develop a musicality from blending long and short sentences with short pauses (commas) and long pauses (full stops) in the right places. Good luck!"
How to use today's moral compass in fantasy?,"As a rule, when people read fiction from another time period, they expect the culture / thinking style from that period. I can't remember how many books I've read based in medieval  Europe, where the hero talks about the rights of man, individuality, democracy etc. I usually throw such books away, as it shows the author hasn't done their research. Second thing is, you assume that all people in ancient times were cruel, and supported their respective social evils. So for example, all Romans loved to see people being eaten by lions. This is not true. Just like in modern times we have racism, religious wars, sectarian violence, but in actuality very few people actively support extremist groups. 300-500 years from now, today will look like the dark ages. To answer your specific question, people have their own moral compass, which they follow, no matter what the society believes. So you could have your hero supporting slavery, but showing a random act of kindness to a slave. Or he could hear the story of how a slave was captured, and change his views on slavery. Or he could accept slavery, but not have personal slaves, as it doesn't agree with his own moral compass. The characters don't need to be black or white. In short, don't force modern, western enlightenment views on your characters. But that doesn't mean they have to be barbaric ""Ooga Ooga, me steal woman"" type characters. Your characters can be nice people, trying to survive in a unjust society, and doing their small bit to help others."
"How do you make a character quintessential, but not cliched or cartoony?","There's two issues here. In no particular order: Some of the best advice I ever had about making quintessential characters came from James N. Frey author of ""How To Write Damn Good Fiction"". In that book he gave two essential pointers to making a good protagonist which is a great start. Again in no particular order: Going to the current market leader in quintessential but accessible characters Pixar if we look at Woody from Toy Story, Pixar nail that. He is shown to be a great leader with a balance of energy, humility and kindness. However he is also afraid of being abandoned, obsolete, finished with. Being made redundant, in all senses is a basic human fear and Pixar tap into that. This dichotomy between capability and sympathy is a useful one. Most characters could do with having one attractive quality and one sympathetic one, even those supposed to be antagonistic. To go deeper, however, many writers give characters ""flaws"" in the hope that this will add dimension. While it's true that perfect characters are grating in the extreme a flaw doesn't automatically avoid cliche. For example the self-destructive cop, the neurotic beauty and the anti-social genius all present some attractive qualities and some flaws. All are cliches. Not only that but it is possible to write characters like this who are not at all quintessential, in these instances they seem like cardboardy facsimiles of their quintessentially fun but cliched counterparts in other stories. This seems to leave us up a tree. We can make a character capable, sympathetic and flawed but still cliched and possibly not even very convincing (although the more they are sympathetic the less they may seem unconvincing). The final part of a really complex character is to go into the business of archetypes. There are many weighty articles available on the topic of archetypes but the one I found most revealing actually dealt with hero character archetypes in romantic fiction. There are two articles one about male archetypes and one about female archetypes.  Before you tune out. Yes, romance novels use cliche like a baker uses flour, but like many things complex constructs are made of simple ones and I found the hero archetypes discussed in these articles to be like a list of primary colours for character building. What occurred to me is that a proper multi-dimensional character uses these character archetypes like paint makes a beautiful picture, mixing, blending and shifting. Where as colour and tone are positional on a canvas a character's tone and shade are defined by the context in which they find themselves in the story. A deep character sees themselves as various archetypes in different contexts, one archetype for work, one for relationships, one for being a parent. To go even deeper maybe certain common situations cause them to use other archetypal behaviours in certain situations within those contexts e.g. mostly they are a ""chief"" type parent but when it comes to discipline they find themselves unable to be authoritarian and instead fold to become the ""best friend"" type giving their own children mixed messages about authority and morality. The key thing is that hero archetypes often relate to the way a person sees themselves as an actor in their own life. People are constantly trying to live up to their own expectations of what they ""should"" be doing. Most people don't see their lives as one story, people change their own archetypal make up within single relationships, within life situations and even within the stuff of life such as marriage, parenthood or education. As my wife put it after reading the list of archetypes: ""I can be all of those within a period of four hours"" In fact although the articles linked above talk about ""male"" and ""female"" archetypes I would tend to rather classify them as ""rational active"" and ""emotional passive"" archetypes allowing the sixteen of them to be unisex. So a very male character could find himself resorting to a ""female"" archetype in a certain situation or even in a single archetype about a particular emotional topic. The final factor to consider is that although in a hero's story a hero's behaviour is correct and proper the lines between ""good"", ""evil"", ""right"" and ""wrong"" are a lot blurrier in reality. So most people
behave as if they are some kind of hero, whether it is appropriate for the situation or not. On such rocky ground are the foundations of self-justification laid. So in our quest for quintessence without cliche we've gone from the simple business of vetting our characters for properties of capability and relatability to the need to make characters a melange of different archetypal flavours and colours. I think the ""attractive/sympathetic"" dynamic is the most important part to making characters people want to spend time with. Sympathetic is essential at all times. Giving people random flaws which can't be attributed to any realistic motivation is what tends to let characters fall flat."
Can a self publishing author use a pen name/pseudonym?,"Unlike the other answers, let me try to give you a practical, nuts and bolt answer. When you go to self-publish your book, either as an ebook (Amazon, Kobo, etc.) or print (Createspace, etc.) you are asked to give an author name. This field is not automatically filled based on your registered name, so you can fill in any name you want in the author field. This name will show up when someone searches for your book on Amazon, for example. When it's time to get paid, the distributor (Amazon, Kobo) will look at your registered name and address (on your account) and send the money to that name. So yeah, using the pen name when self publishing is extremely easy."
"How should a writer use version control to track drafts, rewrites, and revisions?","There are two concepts in git that can help: branches and tags. Tags.
Think of a tag as a name for a specific revision.  Any time you want to remember a version, create a tag for it.  For example, when you finish a draft, you can tag it like this: When to use tags.
Tags are good for marking any version that you might want to remember later.
I use them to mark the end of each draft. Branches. Think of a branch as a series of changes.  The default branch is called master.  That's a good branch to use for your initial research and first draft.  Unless you create a new branch, every change you make updates the master branch. When to use branches.
Whenever you want to start on a new series of edits, you have a choice.  You can either continue on the the current branch, or create a new branch. Some possible uses for branches: Drafts.  You might start each draft by creating a branch for it.  (I tend not to do this, but it may suit your needs.) Experiments.  Suppose you want to experiment with rewriting a few scenes to change from first person to third, or to change the POV character.  You can create a branch and do your experiments there.  Later, if you like the new POV, you can continue writing on your experimental branch.  If you don't like the POV changes after all, you can switch back to whatever branch you were on before. Submissions.  Before I make a submission, I'll often create a new branch, add my cover letter, make any minor manuscript changes specific to that recipient (e.g. quirks of mss formats), and add a text file with notes about the submission.  When I receive a reply, I can check out the branch and update my notes. I tend to use branches more for experiments and submissions than for drafts.  When I finish a draft, I'll tag it, then continue with the second draft on the master branch. Creating branches.
To create a new branch, use the git branch command like this: When you create a new branch, the new branch starts with the same content as the branch you were on.  If you're on the master branch and  you create a charles_pov branch, the charles_pov branch starts with the current content of the master branch. Note that creating a new branch doesn't switch to the new branch.  To switch to a branch, see below. Switching branches. You can change branches at any time by ""checking out"" a branch.  To switch to your new charles_pov branch: When you commit changes, git updates whatever branch you are on, and leaves the other branches unchanged.  So if you switch to the charles_pov branch, your changes will update the charles_pov branch, and the master branch will remain unchanged. Creating a branch and switching to it in one command.
You can create a new branch and switch to it in a single command, like this: Viewing tags and branches.
You can see a list of all tags and branches with these commands: Checking out a tag (AND A WARNING).
Remember that a tag is a name for a specific version.
If you've tagged each draft, you can check out an old draft like this: Yep, you check out a tag the same way you check out a branch. BUT NOTE that when you check out a tag, you are no longer on any branch.
Any changes you make end up in a floaty nebulous place that I don't know how to explain succinctly.
Git does warn you about this. The current branch.
To see what branch you are currently on, use this command: Git displays all of the branches, and marks the current branch (the one that will be updated when you make changes) with an asterisk."
What books should have a sequel?,"Simply put, books should have a sequel if they are not ""done"". Some narratives end with such a satisfying closure, that going on after it would destroy that experience. For example, while legend tells of many adventures that Oedipus undertook after blinding himself (and that could have been told in sequels) his central storyline ends after he understood that he had killed his father and married his mother, and a sequel to the famous play by Sophocles seems unwarranted. A satisfying end does not necessitate that all questions have been answered and all loose strings tied up. On the contrary, a certain kind of openness can feel inspiring to the reader, keeping the reader's connection to the book alive and active even after the (first) reading has been completed. Books that resolve all issues are often easily forgot. From a very strict point of view, a sequel is necessary only if the book has been conceived from the beginning to be continued in a second volume (that is, if the story spans several volumes) or if the protagonist has been conceived from the beginning as the hero of a sequence of adventures. If the books have been conceived as a series, the heroes are often not fighting against their inner demons or for their personal goals, as they are in standalone fiction, but they often rather serve as tools to explore the storylines of changing ""secondary protagonists"", as for example in detective fiction, where the murderers and their victims are as much or more in the center of attention than the detective. Finally, a sequel may be written, often after many years, simply out of the author's continued or renewed interest in their protagonist (as for example in Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea cycle) or world (as in L.E. Modesitt's Recluce series), where you will usually see some shift in focus between volumes, or (as in many franchises) in the copyright holder's desire to milk the cow, which often results in uncreative repetitions of a successful schema and a deterioration in quality. You only really have to avoid the last. That is, if you can keep up the quality and each book is fresh and exciting, then there is nothing that speaks against a sequel."
Best practices for maintaining documented code examples?,"Python has a useful module called doctest. It is commonly used to validate tutorial documentation and examples embedded as comments in the code. The doctest module searches for pieces of text that look like
  interactive Python sessions, and then executes those sessions to
  verify that they work exactly as shown. There are several common ways
  to use doctest: [...] To write tutorial documentation for a package, liberally illustrated
  with input-output examples. Depending on whether the examples or the
  expository text are emphasized, this has the flavor of “literate
  testing” or “executable documentation”. Since the code you're interested in is merely excerpts from the full source, you would extract the excerpts from the tested code based on some metadata. Tools like Doxygen are intended for this purpose. A language-agnostic approach would be to include the full source for each excerpt in the library source code or wherever the primary documentation resides. Then when you want to build your tutorial/developer guide, you run automated tests on the code using your xUnit-equivlent with doctest-like connector code if necessary, and then extract the excerpts with Doxygen. Regardless of what specific solution you implement, best practice for maintenance is to follow the DRY principle. Do what you can to keep all of the source code in one place. In your case, it sounds like this will require generating your excerpts from the original sample code each time you generate the documentation. There's some discussion on the topic of code sample testing and maintenance in The Pragmatic Programmer on pages 26-29 (DRY principle) and further on pages 100-101. The authors describe vaguely how they accomplished what you need: [...] using the DRY principle we didn't want to copy and paste lines
  of code from the tested programs in the book. That would have meant
  that the code was duplicated, virtually guaranteeing that we'd forget
  to update an example when the corresponding program was changed. For
  some examples, we also didn't want to bore you with the framework
  needed to make our example compile and run. We turned to Perl. A
  relatively simple script is invoked when we format the book -- it
  extracts a named segment from a source file, does syntax highlighting,
  and converts the result into the typesetting language we use."
What's the best version control system for a book writer?,"There are a large number of version control systems out there, but I think that Git might be the best choice for you for a number of reasons. The biggest reason is that everything is in a single folder, you don't have to check things out to work on them or rebuild anything. You can just keep a full live copy on a pendrive and it just works. You also don't need to set up servers or magic paths. In addition, you don't have to check anything out, you just commit it when you're done. You can also keep an offsite repository with very little work so you have that extra layer of protection. Another upshot of git is you can just backup the whole thing by just copying the root folder. Everything is copied over and will work just fine at it's new location. I can't speak of how to integrate it into Emacs, but I suspect that part of the question can easy be answered at one of the other SE sites."
My friend says that the story of my novel sounds too similar to Harry Potter,"Harry Potter wasn't a particularly original story. For people who read a lot of fantasy, many of its themes, settings and characters were deeply familiar. But Rowling did a very good job bringing her own vision to it. Your story doesn't sound --to me --at all like Harry Potter. But like most fantasy stories, including Harry Potter, it has some familiar archetypes in it. That is only to be expected. What matters isn't the idea, it's what you do with it. Writing is more about the execution than the concept. To be honest, I wouldn't ever ask this friend for his opinion on your writing again. If you want, give him a signed copy when the book gets published :D I've learned painfully over the years, even the best of friends and the most treasured of family members are rarely good people to test ideas out on. More to the point, the initial idea phase isn't a good time to get feedback. It's scary enough to embark on the journey that is writing without having people throwing stones at your little baby idea. Plus, you can't write and judge at the same time. You have to turn off your inner critic in order to write, and talking to critical people --even well-intentioned ones --doesn't help that. Wait until you have a first draft done, and then ask some strangers for their opinions."
What is the most fundamental advice when it comes to writing? [closed],"To me, Stephen King's advice (as seen in a live interview, and asked what advice he had for aspiring writers): Basically he said, if you want to write, write. Every day. Don't worry about plotting, or any other technical details. That will come, write a story, then write another. Write every day (he does, including his birthday, Christmas, 365 days a year, but he takes breaks between books). If you love writing, then you will learn those technicalities when you realize your story isn't working. (King is a discovery writer, btw.) He goes on to make a sharp observation, in my view: That most people that claim they want to be writer are fooling themselves, because what they want is To Have Written. ""They want this,"" he says, waving at the set and his interviewer. The interviews on TV, the book signings, the money from a best-seller, but they don't actually love writing for its own sake. So they will not succeed as a writer, because you cannot fail for years and book after book doing work you don't really love, and that is what it will take, before you are good enough to make any kind of living [in fiction]. And if you don't love writing you just aren't going to learn what you need to get better, even if you put in those years.  King says that before he sold Carrie he was not thinking that all his time would be wasted if he never sold anything. Writing fiction was his pastime, it was fun, and if he only entertained himself by getting his imagination on paper that would be fine. And that is the way to approach writing: Do it because you like it, you like crafting a story, and it entertains you. Stick with it and you will get better. But if you think the only reason to write is for the money you hope to get and would feel like you wasted your time if your story doesn't make a dime, then you should probably quit now, because if you cannot write for it's own sake you shouldn't be trying this profession."
"How do I write ""fantasy counterpart cultures"" without being accused of cultural appropriation?","The phrase ""cultural appropriation"" can make it seem that the sole issue is just who is using the culture. From my point of view, the deeper question how good a job they're doing at representing it. Have you captured anything authentic, or is your depiction just — as is so often the case — a shallow pastiche of preexisting images? Are you doing the work, putting in the research, and listening to authentic voices, or are you just echoing mainstream impressions? A great example is the recent Disney/Pixar hit, Coco. The original version of the movie was called ""Day of the Dead"" (a phrase that Disney tried to trademark, despite it being the name of a major holiday in a different country). By the filmmaker's own admission, the original script for the movie badly misrepresented the nature of the holiday and had no connections to genuine Mexican culture. Accordingly, Pixar recalibrated, scrapped the first version of the movie, and hired some respected Mexican cultural critics to help re-envision it. The result was a critically acclaimed global hit that was widely described as very respectful and authentic to Mexican culture. Working harder on authenticity resulted in a work that was both better and more profitable. In the case of your story, the descriptor ""Kangaroo Islander"" is an immediate red flag to me. Why? Because I have never been anywhere near Australia, barely even know how to spell it, and yet, one of the few things I know is that kangaroos are native to there. That suggests to me that this is a portrait of Australia created by someone who knows as little about it as I do."
Can basic grammar rules be skipped when writing text for machine safety labels?,"Of course you can't just ignore all basic grammar rules.  For example, writing: Not cover the opening machines power be while do. obviously makes no sense to anyone, even though it's got all the right words (plus or minus a few grammatical suffixes) in there.  It's just broken English. But you can totally write, say: Do not open cover while machine is powered. or, if space is really at a premium (or you just want to make the letters as big as possible to make them stand out), e.g.: DO NOT OPEN WHILE POWERED! So what's the difference, then?  The difference is that, in effect, English has a special linguistic register for terse messages like signs and headlines that modifies or relaxes some otherwise (nearly) universal grammar and style rules in the interests of brevity.  But not all rules; only those that do not introduce any significant ambiguity in the message (or for which an alternative method for conveying the same distinction is available).  In effect, it's a different language variety with (somewhat) different grammar rules from general literary English — but it does still have grammar, because a language with no grammar at all is not a language, but just a bunch of random words thrown together. So what are the differences between general English and this ""headlinese""?  I haven't personally read any scholarly studies on the grammar of this special language register (although it has been studied, and the Wikipedia page I linked to even references a couple of articles on the subject), but just off the top of my head, the most notable differences are: Omission of definite and indefinite articles.  When you really think about it, articles are rarely essential for conveying the meaning of a sentence.  Plenty of languages get by just fine without them — the map on the linked page shows pretty strikingly that the (near) compulsory use of articles in front of nouns is a distinctively Western European areal feature.  In many languages it's a relatively modern one, too; classical Latin didn't have articles, but most of the Romance languages that descended from it developed them (generally from demonstrative pronouns that became a compulsive part of the noun phrase) under the influence of neighboring Germanic languages. Omission of the copula.  Have you ever seen a sign that said ""Door is closed,"" or a headline that read ""Politician is caught lying""?  Again, plenty of languages get by just fine without a copula at all, anyway. Use of stand-alone noun phrases instead of full sentences.  Related to the above, it's very common to replace sentences that in standard English would use the copula ""is"" with just a plain noun phrase (with, effectively, an implied ""there/this is"").  This is very common in signs: ""NO SMOKING"", ""WET FLOOR"" or ""OUT OF USE"" communicate their ideas much more concisely than ""Smoking is not allowed here,"" ""The floor is wet"" or ""This machine is not currently usable."" Omission of implied referents.  The default assumption is that a sign refers to the object or the location it's attached to.  Thus, you don't need to write ""This store is closed"" or ""No trespassing on this property."" Of course, such omission also occurs in standard literary English (even if some grammarians frown upon it), but it's extremely common in signs. There are also some grammar and style features that, while not directly serving the interests of brevity, have nonetheless come to be commonly associated with this particular style of English.  A notable example is title case, which (as the name indicates) is very popular in titles and headlines, but also commonly found in other places that employ a similar terse style.  (Exercise: Open a drop-down menu on your computer and look at the entries; there's something like a 50-50 chance that they'll be In Title Case.) Anyway, my point is that, as long as you follow the established style and grammar conventions relevant to the context you're writing in, you certainly can (and, arguably, even should) break any ""rules"" of prescriptivist ""standard English grammar"" that conflict with actual established usage in your field.  That's not the same as throwing grammar, willy-nilly, out of the window — that's just understanding that grammar, like all things in human communication, is a context-dependent and flexible construction that can and does adapt to fit the needs of the medium."
Avoiding cliches when writing gods,"I think my answer may be a tad tinted by my atheism, as I believe every faith and pantheon operates as a function of how a culture interacts with nature, the difficult-to-predict, and the unknown, but I would say a good starting point would be the environment your fictional society inhabits. For example, Ancient Egyptian gods are numerous yet orderly, because of the extreme linkage between the Nile and Egypt's prosperity. When the Nile floods (which is a regular, predictable occurrence), there's an increase in fertility, plantable lands, fishable waters, et cetera, but this also brings dangers, like hippos. As such, everything has a cycle in the Egyptian pantheon, to the point where the sun's regularity is itself deified. Meanwhile, the semitic monotheistic beliefs arise from nomadic desert tribes that largely subsist by raiding and attacking other tribes. As such, their God prioritises loyalty to their own tribe, virulent hatred of the other tribes unless they adopt the culture unquestioningly, and due to the unreliable nature of successful raids and land quality in a wilderness, their God is capricious. The tribe get hit by a flux? The tribe obviously didn't sacrifice enough. The tribe wins a tough battle? That was because God smiled upon them! Also, the presence of a non-fighting, priestly class means that sacrifices are required in the form of tasty burnt animals that are totally being given to God, not the priests. Contrast with polynesian faiths, which is much more about animistic interpretations of natural forces, while religious figures (like Maui) are people that interact with and harness the animistic gods, as opposed to directly working for/speaking with them (it should also be noted that while most polynesian islands have Maui in their mythos, his deeds and abilities vary from island to island, emphasising the strong link to the environment again). This emphasises their society's need to accept if a calamity takes something significant; it's simply the ocean taking something back, et cetera, and unlike the semitic faiths, there's no impetus to make something happen by man's hand (as raiding is not a staple part of polynesian culture). As for fictional faiths, I've made a few, which are generally misinterpretations of actual Gods at work. A tropical nation devised a six-god pantheon that perpetually argue over the most important aspects of life (the weather, justice, the cycle of life and death, freedom versus holding secrets man must not know), which to them explains the capricious nature of tropical weather, the human drive to explore isles upon an archipelago contrasted with storms and tides that prevent certain exploration, et cetera. Other faiths founded by strongly class-stratified cultures focus on after-death justice, assuring peasants the meek shall be rewarded posthumously so you should let the rich do what they like, others still argue children cannot be fairly judged and so believe in reincarnation (in truth, the real Gods do both; the Underworld is a soul penitentiary, and if you do your time and repent, you get another chance at life, and similarly if you get bored of eternal bliss, you can choose to reincarnate). Essentially, think of faith as a direct result of how cultures talk to the environment and Gods should naturally spring forth."
Character is called by their first initial. How do I write it?,"I don't think you need to expand it, but you can. Anyone who goes by two initials is usually called ""P.J."" or ""PJ"" in writing. Anecdotally, I knew a guy who went by G (for Gerard), and written down it was always G. That said, we weren't in the habit of transcribing our conversations.  If you don't want it to be just the letter G, I'd recommend writing it out as Gee, which is the (pretty) standard formal spelling of the name of the letter G. For more information on the names of letters in English, see: Is there a formal spelling for the English letter names?"
Is it okay to majorly distort historical facts while writing a fiction story?,"Is it okay?  Well, it's likely legal (if the person is long dead anyway, and probably even if they're alive).  You can do it.  You might even get it published.   For a large number of readers, the answer is that, no, it's not okay.  Though what percentage of that really depends on the details.  Fictionalization of historic events is extremely common and things get really bungled. Take the excellent book Hidden Figures, about black women employed by NASA as mathematicians and engineers as the first space flights were planned then executed.  The author interviewed the actual women involved (those still alive) and many others who lived through that time period. The book is nonfiction and, as far as I know, pretty accurate.  Then it was made into a movie.  The movie is wonderful and worth watching but, for those of us who read the book, it involves a lot of handwaving.  They took characters that worked in different decades and made them all similarly aged friends in the same year.  They completely changed character arcs to aid in the drama.  For example, one movie character fought for years to become a supervisor (the white woman in charge refused to allow her) then finally got her promotion in the late 60's at the end of the movie.  The real person with that character's name had been a supervisor starting in the 40's. This sort of distortion is extremely common in movies, whether based on books or on historical research.  Sometimes involving huge changes like putting together events that actually were a couple hundred years apart.  It's not as common in books, but it happens. So is it ""okay"" for you to do this?  Well, yes and no.  The question is, what can you get away with and who are you pissing off?  If you add in scandal or things that might be libelous were the people still alive, you could be in trouble, even if legally you're in the clear.  I mean, don't write a novel about Princess Di's early life as a pole dancer. But a work about William Shakespeare in a relationship (that never really happened) with a woman who disguises herself as a man so she can take female roles in his plays only ever played by men (also never happened).  YAWN Been there, done that. I am one of those readers that hates inaccuracies like that but I still loved those two movies.  I'm stricter about the books but often read and enjoy them anyway.  It depends how—and why—it's done. Make your choices meaningful.  Don't change things because you're too lazy to research.  Change them because they work better that way for your story. "

"Help, I cannot decide when to start the story","Nearly all stories, including novels and movies and even comic book series, begin with the MC in their ""normal world."" There is no law demanding that, other than the laws of economics: We want the story to sell!  We authors do this because for centuries, this has proven successful, and stories that try to violate this rule flop. Readers expect the beginning of a story to illustrate how the MC has been living, up until the incident (aka ""inciting incident"") that disrupts their life and pushes them in a new direction. This introduction to the MC, the setting, and perhaps other characters is the foundation upon which the story is told. In your case, I believe the ""normal world"" for this MC is the post-apocalyptic world. True, that was not their normal world ten years ago or whatever, but whatever ended that world is a different story (and probably one that did not have a happy ending). This post-apocalyptic world is now their normal, and the time that went before is in the past, something to be remembered, longed for, perhaps hated, but that is told through thoughts, dialogue, and perhaps flashback. (I don't personally use flashbacks.) This introductory phase typically lasts 10% to 15% of the entire story length; it is rather long, and it is ALL before the story-driving inciting incident is outlined or discussed. You say the MC is looking for a McGuffin, typically the need to find this McGuffin would appear around halfway through the first Act, which is 12.5% of the way into the story. In other words, right at the end of the introductory phase. But we don't want it to be a laundry list of factoids about this unusual world, we want it to be interesting to the reader. The easy way to do this is to start with a minor daily-living-problem for the MC, not the inciting incident. Just like all of us, daily living can present little problems to be solved, and that can be interesting. The morning alarm fails to go off due to a power failure during the night, and you wake up already late for work. Your phone isn't charged. Your car won't start. The milk for your morning cereal has gone sour. In general, something disrupts the normal routine, but it isn't life-altering, just a problem you can't ignore. That is what we give our MC. They have some normal routine you need to imagine, and then something goes wrong. That tells us where to start the book: I start with the character's name, doing something in their normal world, and often introduce this ""inconsequential problem"" in the first paragraph or two. The reader has something interesting to follow, the MC dealing with their problem, and the author uses that to begin the introduction to both the MC and the setting. Your story starts with an MC already accustomed to navigating their post-apocalypse world. But the MC has memories and understanding of the pre-apocalypse world, that still informs their actions today. Those come into play as needed. But as the author, you can make some of those memories needed by devising the right kind of ""inconsequential problem"", e.g. maybe the MC is trying to find rechargeable batteries for a device, or looking for something somebody would trade food to get. perhaps he broke his blade, and is looking through rubble for material to make a new one. The backstory may be interesting, but I'd think of this like a person's childhood: We read an awful lot of stories about adults, that have a backstory we learn almost nothing about. For example, what do we know of Dumbledore's childhood? Or Captain Kirk's? Presumably they were six years old, and went through puberty, and had first romantic kisses and virginal sexual experiences, momentous turning points in their lives. But in literature and movies they come to us fully formed. Just like in real life, we meet new people, already adults, and judge them by their looks, words and actions now, and once in awhile, we learn a few elements of their backstory. Even in the first Harry Potter, Rowling introduces the magical setting while talking about his parents dying, then skips over ten years of childhood to get to the story. Your pre-apocalyptic world is metaphorically the ""childhood"" of your MC; and we meet them in metaphorical ""adulthood"", the ""childhood"" incidents that shaped their beliefs, morality, skills, intelligence and knowledge are done deals. To the extent those earlier times matter to how the MC behaves, tell us about them. Otherwise, like meeting a person in real life, let us judge them in-the-now, as we are wont to do: based on appearances, words and behavior. As readers, we will include in our judgment their thoughts, emotions, and memories."
What should be the ideal length of sentences in a blog post for ease of reading?,"The Inside GOV.UK blog cites research that finds that when average sentence length is 14 words, readers understand more than 90% of what they’re reading. At 43 words, comprehension drops to less than 10%. Studies also show that sentences of 11 words are considered easy to read, while those of 21 words are fairly difficult. At 25 words, sentences become difficult, and 29 words or longer, very difficult. As a consequence, the GOV.UK style guide limits sentence length to 25 words. The GOV.UK website needs to be accessible for everyone, so you might be tempted to think that when you write for a highly educated and intelligent audience you may allow yourself longer sentences, as @celtschk has recommended in their answer. But unless you publish academic research articles on your blog, that reasoning is wrong. As the cited blog post explains, [l]ong sentences aren't just difficult for people who struggle with reading or have a cognitive disability like dyslexia or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. They're also a problem for highly literate people with extensive vocabularies. This is partly because people tend to scan, not read. In fact, most people only read around 25% of what’s on a page. This means it’s important to get information across quickly. [...] Long, complicated sentences force users to slow down and work harder to understand what they’re reading. This isn’t something people want to do, even if they’re familiar with the subject or language you’re using. It’s easy to assume this isn’t the case for highly literate readers or people considered experts. Yet the more educated a person is, and the more specialist their knowledge, the more they want it in plain English. These people often have the least time and most to read. Which means they just want to understand your point and move on, quickly. So, whoever your audience is, if you want your blog posts to be read, stick to the upper limit of 25 words and make most of your sentences around 14 words long. In case you think that these lengths only apply online and that printed fiction generally has longer sentences, here are some average sentence lengths for you to consider: And while John Green's The Fault in Our Stars begins with the 52 word sentence cited by @DPT in their comment, it has an average sentence length of only 11.12091 words! The above are recommendations for English. So how about other languages? For German, the Deutsche Presse Agentur, the largest press agency in Germany, sets the upper limit for optimal comprehension at 9 words and the absolute allowed maximum length at 30 words. The Bild Zeitung, Germany's largest tabloid newspaper, has an average sentence length of 12 words. Ludwig Reiners in his book on style sets the maximum length of easy to understand sentences at 18 words; Wilfried Seibicke, a linguist and specialist in stylistics, recommends an average of 10 to 15 words. Given the similarity between the recommendations for English (an analytic language) and German (a fusional language), I would assume that other indoeuropean languages have similar ideal word lengths, while agglutinative (e.g. Turkic or Finnish) and polysynthetic languages, where sentences consist of very few very long words, will have other ideal lengths. This answer, by the way, has an average sentence length of 20.8125 words (not counting the citations). As requested, some statistics for John Green's The Fault in Our Stars (all values are sentence lengths in words): N = 5763, M = 11.42, SD = 11.93, Mdn = 8, range = 1-160 That is, the average sentence is 11 words long; half of all sentences are 8 words long or shorter; 88% or 5089 of all sentences are between 1 and 23 words long. The modus (most frequent sentence length) lies at 3 words with 574 sentences. Here is a histogram illustrating the distribution: "
Stories with multiple possible interpretations: do you plan for it?,"There is a joke that we always told each other in my school when we had to analyze texts or poetry that goes something like this: Teacher: What did the author mean when he said that the curtains are blue? Pupil 1: The curtains are a replacement for the endless skies that can't be seen from the inside. They are the narrators way to connect to the outside world by mimicking the world. Pupil 2: Blue was obviously a color that symbolized being calm in the time the author lived. By making the curtains blue he allowed the reader to get a glimpse of the narrators state of mind, which is calm in the face of the upcoming storm. Pupil 3: No, obviously it was just a barricade to shut himself out of the world and by making it blue he wanted to show to other people that he was normal and yearning for the outside, while deep inside his chest he knew that he would never want to leave his house again. Teacher: You are all completely wrong. Blue is obviously part of the greater color scheme. If you had a look at the first pages of the book you would notice the turquoise boots, later these blue curtains and in the end the green grass. The curtains are merely a symbol for the change that is happening throughout the book. Remember this kids: metamorphosis is an important topic in basically all books of this time! It is a concept that you need to understand in order to pass the test. ... Author: Blue is my favourite color. And the moral of this story: it doesn't matter what your true intentions are, someone will find a way to interpret your writing in a way that profits them - and depending on their current situation, the general spirit of the time and the amount of people you are asking you will get far more interpretations than you could ever hope to put into this book deliberately."
Is it appropriate for me to write about the pandemic?,"I see two separate issues here --your work, and who you are getting feedback from: I would also note that it's best to not seek feedback at all during the initial idea stage. The reason is that good writing is never about the concept, its about how you bring the concept to life. Only after you have put words on paper can people judge if you have done well or poorly. I have NEVER had a good experience from sharing an idea in its initial conceptual form."
What are some bad ways to subvert tropes?,"I think the problem with the blue-pink subversion is that there is no clear reason why; other than the intent to surprise the reader. And secondly, it is not clear this trope subversion has any actual story consequences. Normally, trope inversions have at least some rational reason for existing. e.g. Wonder Woman is one of the first female super-heroes (appearing 1941), but rationales are offered for subverting the 1941 tropes about women: She comes from an all-female society, so their military and defense are necessarily all female. Likewise she can be unafraid to fight, blunt and aggressive and take charge: In our society traits associated with males, but in an all-female society without gender-based roles, it would be necessary for some females to take on the roles of generals and soldiers, and there would be no stigma associated with it. Trope inversions are generally justified in fiction, in some way. The character acts against type out of necessity, or out of upbringing or life experiences that taught them some non-typical lesson. The nerd can fight because his father made him learn to fight. The woman knows sports because her father was a coach and fanatic, and loved her, and naturally she bonded with him over the sports he watched all the time, and grew up liking them and understanding them. One bad subversion of a trope is to declare an opposite and provide zero reasoning for it. That looks too obviously like a contrived surprise. A second bad subversion of a trope is when it has no actual story consequences of any kind. We need our female protagonist to have a lot of sports knowledge for a story reason; perhaps this lets her solve a puzzle or understand a reference other people would miss.  Now of course, the reasons we give for a trope inversion are themselves contrived, but that second-level contrivance doesn't matter much. Or you could bury it in a third-level contrivance: Wonder Woman comes from an all-female society. But why is it all-female? If we get into reasons for that, we have a third-level contrivance, and by burying it this makes it all more plausible (since the ""all-female society"" sounds a little implausible). But often just the 2nd level contrivance is sufficient, if it sounds plausible -- A father that is a sports fanatic is in keeping with a trope, with a daughter as his only child it is plausible she grows up loving sports herself, going to games, and understanding the games because in her world that is what fathers and daughters do. Added from comments: In fiction any extreme ability (for either gender) stands out and readers expect it to matter, somehow. Failing to meet this expectation disappoints them. Fiction is not real life! To readers extreme abilities mean something, that is the psychology of reading stories. If we read that a character has superpowers, but by the end of the book has never done anything with 'em, Then why did the author give them superpowers?  Trope inversions are very similar to this; if you subvert the trope you are creating an outlier, an abnormality, something the reader does not expect and does not regard as ""normal"". It generally needs to be justified, and then also needs to influence the story, and the more unusual the abnormality the more influence it should have in the story."
My cool character is doing nothing for the plot. How do I deal with him?,"Give him his own story so he's not stealing scenes in someone else's. If he's that awesome, he should be starring in his own book rather than sucking all the oxygen out of this one."
How to prevent turning off the reader at first with a protagonist with unlikeable traits but that becomes better later on?,"You can foreshadow the change by showing the kernel of goodness that lies in the bad person. Options are ""pet the dog"" (the protagonist shows kindness to an animal, a child, an old person, etc.) or ""save the cat"" (the protagonist actively helps an animal, child, etc., often at risk to his own life). You can tell the reader. Many books begin with a sentence (""It was the last day of my life."") or prologue (see this question) that shows how the story will climax or end. Explain it on the blurb (""The story of a barbarian turning good."") or through the title (""Turning Good""). Give him a likeable sidekick or co-protagonist. This doesn't have to be a humorous character but can be someone suffering under the protagonist who the readers sympathise with and root for. Make him ""heroically bad"", instead of simply unlikeable. The Ice Queen has fans, but the bad step-mother hasn't. That is give him great power and ability, and a great purpose. Let the reader know why he is cold and full of hate. Conan isn't a very likeable character, but we learn that witnessing the killing of his family as a child and his slavery made him into that brutal, cold killer. Narrate the story in a humorous tone. Humour provides relief from all kinds of otherwise aversive content (e.g. gruesome violence becomes funny in a cartoon). Aim his hate at aspects of the world or humanity that readers can sympathize with (e.g. he hates people because they are greedy, stupid, mindless etc.). Narrate him realistically. That is, he isn't really ""good"" or ""bad"", but a real person with the potential to behave in many different way, caught in circumstances that brings out his bad side. Later he learns how to better deal with the difficulties in his life and changes his environment so it allows him to show his good side."
Which techniques can I use to become a better editor when editing my own writing?,Here are a few editing tips that I use when going through manuscript for publishers: Using these four tips should really help tighten up your manuscript.
How to make side-characters look competent next to the chosen one?,"You need to think about your protagonists weaknesses – now! If your protagonist is simply above and beyond everything and everybody else it will get really, really boring. Your character needs some form of development, some things to strive for. Dave has to be better in something, and that something is not necessarily bashing monster's heads in.  Think about other aspects. Investigating a murder for example. Maybe your character is just bad at deducting stuff and needs to look up to Dave for being good at this stuff. Or talking to the locals. Maybe he is just not that good with people. Organizing people – a great leader can make an inspiring speech every day to send search parties so that he can help at multiple places at the same time. Not by himself, but by organizing everything. Dave has connections to the higher-ups. Dave has experience that tell him about monsters' weaknesses and strengths, when to fight and when to flee, when a dungeon will collapse and bury every character, no matter how strong ... Dave knows his way around town quickly in case you need to follow something. Or maybe he is good with medicine and can heal people?  Whatever it is, he didn't get to where is just by being good with a sword. Fighting is not all that there is to life. And brute strength is not everything that counts in the world, not even in a videogame world that is trying to make the player feel powerful. "

What constitutes misleading the reader,"""Don't confuse the reader"" is not a rule, but it is an action with consequences. You can decide to break a rule, but you cannot decide to exempt yourself from consequences. The consequence of confusing the reader is a confused reader. The probable consequence of a confused reader is an abandoned book.  However, there are circumstances in which the reader may enjoy being confused. In a certain type of whodunit mystery (most mysteries are not really whodunits these days) the reader is expecting to be mislead and misdirected and much of their pleasure comes in trying to see through the misdirection. If the writers does succeed in fooling them honestly, however, they will regard it as a game well played and be pleased with the experience. If the writer fools them dishonestly, however, by outright lying, for example, rather than misdirection, then they will not be pleased with the experience at all.  So, the question you have to ask yourself is, what pleasure are you preparing for the reader by being unclear about whether the protagonist's experience is waking or dream? At some point, presumably, you will have to make the reader aware that that experience was a dream. So why? What is the payoff for the reader in having that information revealed only then? How will it seem satisfactory to them, rather than a cheat, or simply outright confusion? Unless you have a very clear idea about these things, and are very confident in your ability to pull it off, confusing the reader about the protagonist's dream sequence is only likely to annoy them.  And remember, while you may have the entire arc of the story fully in your mind as you write, the reader is mostly enjoying the story they way you enjoy scenery from the window of a train. The experience is enjoyable in the moment but in not necessarily retained. Making any long back-reference in a story is likely to leave the reader scratching their head unless you have taken extraordinary measures to make that event memorable -- which is the very opposite of what you do when you obscure the dream/waking distinction. How can the reader remember the dream if they were not told it was a dream at the time? So, while not a rule, it is good practice to be as clear and transparent as you can at all times unless you have a very good reason -- a big payoff for the reader -- for doing otherwise, and are very confident in your ability to pull off the deception. "
Every character has a name - does this lead to too many named characters?,"I say don't censor your ""discovery"" -- include the names of everyone -- they may come back in later, or you may want to explore their story in a specific vignette. (I'm thinking of Neil Gaiman's Sandman story ""24 Hours"" -- takes place in a diner, and most characters in it we never see again.... but later there's a link between a diner-character and a new character.) BUT... editing is where you decide if the names are worth keeping. Sometimes it'll add to the atmosphere (a waitress named ""Hilda"" vs ""Ginger"" vs ""Mei"").  Many times, you'll find that for the core story, there's no need for that level. (She still IS Marabeth, off having her life, but that's off page, and for THIS page, she's just The Waitress, and that's ok.) I'm a big believe in icebergs -- 9/10s underwater.  So if you're a discovery writer, you're building up the entire iceberg by exploring the formation of it ALL, but then editor-you gets on a boat, and sees from a distance only the small portion that will be needed within the book."
How do you earn the reader's trust?,"What you should have done, and should do in rewrite, is make it clear to the reader a traitor exists, perhaps make it clear a poison that does exactly that exists, etc. You can do that early in your book, in a story or fable. The readers already believe the MC would never do this thing. So you need to hang a lantern on this behavior during the battle. Say the poison is called ""rage oil"", somebody in the battle can scream ""Bob's been roofied on rage oil! He killed Stanley! Stay clear!"" So the reader gets it; yes, Bob would never, but Bob's on rage oil, so yeah. Then their focus is indeed on ""Who roofied Bob?"" You can still leave that part a mystery. It messes a little with the rest of your plot; now there are people looking for a traitor they can't find. Bob doesn't suspect the real traitor. The real traitor may manage to frame somebody else, or one of the dead. Perhaps, out of caution, he even did that before the battle, getting the poison into Bob's food or drink that got served by someone else. The servant girl that mysteriously ended up with her throat cut once the battle was done. (Traitor killed her). But it can still be true that Bob is motivated to solve the problem without battle. In general you have to provide enough clues that the reader has SOME reason for a character to do something they would never do. Go back and plant the seeds earlier in your story, hang a lantern on the MC's behavior during the battle, and leave them with a question that makes sense (who is the traitor), not a contradiction of what they already knew. This in turn primes the reader for your later reveal; you can't just surprise them out of nowhere with a best friend that was a traitor all along; that feels like a deus ex machina. Now they KNOW there was a traitor, and you can make the dead servant girl seems too darn convenient so the reader knows the traitor is probably still out there. Then they aren't surprised BY the traitor being revealed, only by who it is. But it doesn't look like a deus ex machina, they are forewarned that some trusted person is the traitor, and the best friend was in a position to execute all the sabotages."
Something different: Help me find the unnecessary words.,"In contrast to others here, I don't think specific edit questions are appropriate for this site, so I will answer your question in a general (do-it-yourself) way: This is a method from Andreas Eschbach. If you know German, read the original text.
I will only summarise it here: First print out your text (yes, you need it on paper). Pick a small text passage you can easily overview and go through all of the following 10 points with this passage. Then pick the next one. Use different colours for marking your text and for editing it. The 10 marking steps by Andreas Eschbach: After you have done that, you have to edit your text according to these markings. Main goal: Deleting! Get rid of the crap! Then take your correction and read it aloud. Does it sound good? No? Change it! The last step is comparing the new with the old version. If you find out, that you edited this paragraph to death, use the old version ;) Translated by me by courtesy of Andreas Eschbach"
"As a discovery writer, how do I complete an unfinished novel (which has highly diverged from the original plot ) after a time-gap?","Especially for a discovery writer, the first draft of a novel is often as much an exercise in planning the final version as it is an attempt to actually produce that final version. It may be best to think of your current draft as serving two distinct purposes: firstly, as an outline for a novel, with lots of detailed information appended to it; secondly, as a collection of prose, the best parts of which can be re-used in new drafts or even in the final version, but only if they fit your evolving plans for the novel.  You could take the first of these purposes literally, and extract an outline from your draft. You have done your ""discovering"", great, but now create a summary for yourself that helps you see the structure of the story. You can then make improvements to the outline, thinking strategically about the entire story, and return to the draft to adjust accordingly. Generalising, it's great that you did a lot of discovery writing work, but now you can start analysing. Look at your characters and analyse arcs, motivation, relationships, etc. Look at your plot and your setting, your theme and your pacing, etc. You may find that too much analysis before writing stifles your creativity--so, instead, you are a discovery writer--but that does not mean you should never analyse. Analysing your current draft should also help you get going again, both by motivating you to work, and by giving you a creative push. It's work you can do without ""inspiration"", so as long as you are motivated to work on your novel in general, you can get going with the analysis. And, as you analyse, you'll start coming up with lots of ideas for new writing you want to do. If you don't like the concept of ""analysing"" when it comes to creativity, think of it instead as taking a 30000 ft view. You have this 1st draft but you are not a slave to it. Read it, think about what is best about it, where you want to go with it in general. Then dive back into the details of writing one word after another. Again, though, you may not be an outliner, but many of the tools that an outliner uses from the start of their novel will be useful to you now. You are at a point where you can start understanding the structure of your novel, even if you did not consciously design this structure to begin with. The second function of your first draft is the more obvious one. If you have large chunks of good prose, obviously you can re-use it, with any necessary adjustments. But this comes after taking the 30000 ft view and deciding where you want to go. By the way, a very simple, practical reason to push on and finish the novel is that it's easy to practice writing beginnings, and hard to practice writing endings (because, all to often, people quit before finishing a novel). So, new authors often get good at writing beginnings, while they are still not good at writing endings. Bear in mind the ending does not have to be perfect, especially if your goal is to finish your first draft. It especially does not need to resolve all mysteries, reach a satisfying end for all character arcs, etc. Focus on the main character and the core plot issues, and write the best ending you can. Now, you have a complete first draft to work with, which is much better starting material for the next phase of your work."
Can you have too many story arcs running at the same time?,"There is no general rule. I am currently reading a book that has half a dozen named characters, sometimes close to each other or even in the same location, sometimes far away from each other with the occasional point-of-view of someone mostly unrelated. The author is doing a great job of making sure that you know who is where at which point and how the other characters and their actions are influencing the current main character. There are also lots of other named characters that are playing minor roles, having maybe one or two chapters of their own before they are being reduced to a side-kick role in chapters of other characters.  But sometimes it feels as if the author is forgetting about one or the other character because it's been so long that you have read something about them. It's difficult to strike a good balance of making the story arcs relevant and playing them out in parallel while also making sure that every overall important character has something to do throughout the other smaller arcs. Or at least to make it not feel like you are forgetting some of those characters.  At the same time I have also read lots of books that are from the perspective of only one or maybe two characters. It's certainly more easy to make the reader not feel like you are forgetting a character.  But this reduces the interdependencies that you can explore in smaller story arcs.  If you feel like there are too many great story arcs you could think about making a series and exploring other characters and their stories in those stories instead of packing everything into one story. This obviously depends on the amount of stuff you have or are planning to have in the end and whether you like series or not. But there is no general easy way to say how many story arcs you can have. "
How much detail is too much?,"Most of the answers on here are adequate, however, I do not feel that they get straight to the point. I've read a few amateur stories online and sometimes the author will include so much detail that the reader gets a little bored or distracted and forgets what the actual story is talking about. You have answered your own question:
Q: How much detail is too much?
A: When the reader gets a little bored or distracted and forgets what the actual story is talking about. The details in a ""fully expressed medium of text"" (that is, a sentence, paragraph, article, book, or voluminous/episodic series) greatly influence attention. The center of attention is the focus. Superfluous details are details that divert attention away from the focus. Consider the following: I was dropped off at the usual bus stop that I attend every morning. It is a short stretch of concrete road with green signs, and four houses. There are two houses on each side. Each house is white. The lawns varied in shades of green and brown (it was early fall). When the bus finally arrived, I hopped on. Silence was in the cold air of the bus as students stared at their phones and closed their minds off from the real world to escape into the fantasy of the internet. The focus of this paragraph is getting on the bus, but yet, all the detail is focusing on the surrounding environment of the bus stop, before abruptly transitioning to hopping on the bus which appeared out of no where. Necessary details are consistent with the focus. Consider the following: I came to this large, two-story house with overarching balconies and elegant columns. It was old—very old. I burst open the dusty, wooden double-doors that entered into the house. The room was dark, and had a musty, century-old odor to it. The black and white checkered tile pattern on the floor was heavily worn and coarse. The chandelier dangled askew. This was, no doubt, a dance hall, which told the story of a time long forgotten, when people twirled and danced to a merry tune. The details in this paragraph dictate that the focus is an old house which had many ballroom-style dances. Every detail describes the age of this house, and the purpose is to give imagery of what the house looks like, and what the ambient atmosphere projects. Without these details, this would be a dull paragraph, and the actual lack of detail would bore and distract. Detail is of course only one element of influence for the audience's attention, but it is clearly displayed that it does have a great impact on attention. The detail determines the focus, When the details shift attention away from the center of attention."
Is it frustrating not to know the narrator's gender?,"Normally the purpose of fiction is to let the reader immerse into your story - to get him caught deeply into the world you have created. If the reader is wondering about the narrator's gender all the time, there will be no immersion. If he assumes a gender and it is wrong then he will be ejected out of your story when he discovers his error. If you want to avoid that, clarify the gender early on. Otherwise leave it. Maybe you want to play with the reader and fool him a little bit, that's your choice."
Detail vs. filler,"Setting is character. That is, setting functions in a story very much the way secondary characters function: it shapes and reflects the character of the protagonist, and it functions to propel the protagonist along their arc.  To a certain extent, we are shaped by the people around us, and by the environment we live in. You will grow up differently in a Pennsylvania mining town than you will in a Manhattan penthouse, regardless of your genetics. You will also grow up differently if you go to a poor school or a rich one, if your parents are scholars or farmers or drug addicts, if they are introverts, extroverts, or perverts.  But you can also choose both your environment and the people you associate with to a significant degree. You can move. You can choose different friends. You can cleve to your family or abandon them.  How your protagonist is shaped by the characters around them is fundamental to how you portray who they are, and to how you set them on their story arc towards their crisis and denouement. And, similarly, the choices they make about who to hang out with and how to treat those people tells us who they are, and thus how they will behave and react to the events of their story arc.  Setting does exactly the same thing. It shapes who the character is. The choices they make about where to live, or how to decorate their living quarters, tell us who they are, what they value, and how they will react to things. (Read Charles Ryders descriptions of his rooms at Oxford in Brideshead Revisited for a perfect example of this.) Does it matter that the couch is old and brown and stained? Yes, because it tells us either that the character is growing up in a poor household that cannot afford better furniture, or that the money is being spent on something else. Other details are needed to complete the picture. Is the couch next to an extensive liquor cabinet? Is there a battered miners lamp sitting on the arm rest, or a syringe and a piece of rubber tubing. Is there a Bob Marley poster on the wall and a battered paperback copy of The Lord of the Rings lying on the floor next to an empty pizza box? Together these details paint very different pictures of the protagonist's living arrangements, all of which suggest different circumstances or a different character.  This is the function of detail in fiction. It maps the influences which shape the character and the arc of their story. They help us understand, in small ways and in great, how and why the events of the story unfold as they should. Thus they are never arbitrary.  This is not to say that a different choice of details could not achieve substantially the same effect. Just as different characters could drive the story to the same climax, so different details of setting could do the same thing. But, nonetheless, the function of detail is precise and clinical, and it always matters.  "
Should I start writing my novel or first learn on short stories?,"There are different answers to this question. Mine may be off putting, but it's not meant to be. You're basically asking if you should start with the marathon. The short answer is that unless you are extremely unique and talented to the point of abnormalcy, your first book is going to be rough. It's probably going to be bad. But it's ultimately practice. You'll be good after four or five books. Which is to say, you're going to want to approach this with the right mindset. First, try something manageable. Try to stick to one POV. Finish your book no matter what. Figure out what the healthy habits for you look like. Make sure that you are writing something fun. If you pick a shorter arc that will give you a novella, you'll be perhaps in a better position. (Google is your friend for word counts here). You also are going to want to know the answers to these questions: The biggest recommendation I have is that you listen to season 10 of the podcast Writing Excuses. It's supposed to be a master class for writing your first book. Also when you inevitably hit your low point, listen to the episode about writing for fun. It's a huge pick-me-up. Think of it as your second wind. Yes, go write your first book. But pack your camping supplies first. You're in for a long haul. Aside, I'm a hypocrite. I'm doing a large, complicated, 3 POV novel right now. But I think I've packed my pack right. But, I'm constantly stressed about the what ifs. You could go down my road, but it's a hard one. Update: finished said book and an now with alpha readers. It's currently too long to publish and needs to be cut in half; but it was and will be good practice. While it's out with alpha I'm starting up a new project. It was the book I needed to write at the time, but I'm pretty sure it's going in the trunk. I would caution anyone starting a book with the intention of selling to heed the advice of staying a bit closer to the ideal word count for your genre."
How to add depth to writing - turn a story into a book [duplicate],"You definitely don't pad.  If you are starting with plot, it sounds as though you may not be getting into the characters as much as you might need to.  Here's an idea: Take your favorite Crichton book. Write a quick outline (one page) of what happens in the book: Ex: Jurassic Park : My quick outline off the top of my head:  Kids go to island, dinosaurs get loose, Kids in danger, High drama and T Rex saves the day against velociraptors.  That might be the basic plot. But there's a lot missing between that recollection and what he actually wrote. Those things might (or might not) be the things you're missing. Think about what's missing in my recollection of JP from the story: Crichton split the people up and had multiple lines going simultaneously. He had all that fun stuff at the beginning. He had science about genetic engineering. He had Mr. DNA give a little narrated film. These things aren't padding, they're deepening.  Here's an idea: Map out the parts you've written in a story  ... to one of Crichton's novels. Put the 'equivalent' things lined up to one another.  What does Crichton have, that you don't? Did you skip the character establishment stuff at the beginning? The subplots? Just ... Ask yourself what else he built into his story that you don't have.  Crichton follows a standard 3-act structure. If you aren't sure what that is, go ahead and learn about that, too. It might help you spot what's missing ..."
Is there a rule of thumb about the number of pages a work of fiction should have?,"I've seen a lot of discussion about this in a couple of different writer's forums I belong to, and I made a point of writing down a consensus that many of them seemed to reach.

How to Write Like a Little Kid,"They are still a character, and more importantly a protagonist who will compare directly in the same work to 2 other (adult) protagonists. They will each need to hold their own in the reader's mind, earning their screen time. For that reason I would not begin with her 'handicaps' as a little girl, but create a 'full' character with all the usual trimmings (wants and needs, something holding them back, an inciting incident). Assuming all 3 interact (the other 2 are her parents maybe) it might help to create a character chart how each protagonist effects the other 2 when they are present. You may discover some new dynamics by comparing the ensemble that would not be an obvious trait for a child. Again, character first because anything in this section is a huge generalization. At age 6, the genders have more in common than different, but they are already heavily gendered in society. Both roleplay with human avatars, but girls have 'dolls' and boys have 'action figures' – their construction strongly informs how a child is intended to interact (change their clothes or launch from an ejector seat). Girls get EasyBake™ ovens and boys get chemistry sets: similar tasks but different implied social roles. Both genders will experiment outside the box, and both are as likely to pretend to invent radio-active poisons that are fed to their stuffed animals in a macabre murder fantasy. The gender-isms in their environment are really just set-dressing; it's valid to write her as a boy if that is easier and then surround her with a mix of appropriate (and inappropriate) toys. Moving past gender, there will be a lot of cultural norms thrown at them, but they won't have bought into it. Every child will have 'wrong' toys, 'wrong' clothes, and a few 'wrong' tastes that are inconsequential to their personality, but basically a thing they are still young enough to get away with. At roughly 8-12, kids begin radical social development where they start to become 'aware' and can compare what they personally have to what others have – by 13 this is cemented and their social peers are far more important than family. But rewind to age 6, they are on the high-functioning end of blissful ignorance. Kids have weirdly lucid adult moments, but like AI there are huge gaps in logic that make you question if they understand anything or are just faking it. In real life their world is smaller, but to them it's still big and they understand it reasonably well. The Dunning-Kruger effect is strong. They don't assume there is any adult-stuff they don't yet understand, instead they will just patch-over the gaps with things they do know, and dismiss what they don't find interesting. In adults we talk about fight or flight as a pro-active defense mechanism, but in kids it's more common to freeze – likely an evolutionary behavior that works to keep them alive. When in danger, kids will hide. It's probably the most common game they play. Kids will have a different mental map of their environment to an adult. You will have the chance to re-invent your location through this protagonist. At 6 they are starting to outgrow this, but still small enough to fit in their best places. If a 6-year-old needed to hide, they would be uniquely expert at not being found. Try to find other ways to empower this protagonist by giving her different patterns to the adults. Give her an interior life, and her own agency and consequences that fit the genre. Find the British documentary called 7 Up. It interviews 7-year-olds (in 1964) asking them basic questions about their lives and opinions. (The documentary continued to interview them every 7 years as they grew up.) There is a section where they're asked about having a love interest. 2 boys recount a game of chasing and kissing (one enjoys when the girls scream, the other seems to prefer when the girls chase back), a group of girls are able to state which of them is the most attractive, and also which boys like which girls (apparently having already paired everyone off), a third boy dryly brags about his girlfriend in Africa and another 2 in Switzerland, a forth is worried his future wife might feed him vegetables, another boy looks shocked and refuses to answer 'those types of questions' – it is hilarious! And they are all different. Again the take-away is that they are characters first, but at a special age where they are maybe the purest version of themselves. They are guileless little adults with all the sophisticated emotions and fallibility, already strong opinion of how things 'are' (or 'ought to be'), but with big gaps in understanding how things become that way."
"When editing for a person, how much can be changed?","While I can't be sure of your exact context, the things you've listed seem entirely reasonable activities for the role of ""editor"" (in a general case). Whether or not it's appropriate for the role of ""reviewer"" depends on what powers a reviewer has in your organisation. (Keeping this in mind, I'll answer in terms of how I see the role of ""editor"", since it sounds like that's what your reviewers are actually doing). An editor may make anything from major structural and/or content changes down to fixing typos and grammar. Usually I would expect these to be in the form of suggestions, rather than outright changes that you (as the original author) have no control over. Is it the changes themselves that are the problem, or perhaps the way those changes are made that is annoying you? Ideally an editor is going to maintain both the style and intent of the original author, assuming these are appropriate for the target audience. In fiction you probably wouldn't want an editor changing your ""style"" (because the style is often part of the art), but in technical writing you want the style to be clear, concise and standardised (basically, to not get in the way of the reader's understanding). If changing from passive to active voice removes words and makes something clearer, that can only be a good thing. Changing word tense would be reasonable to ensure the consistency of tense throughout the document. If an editor changes a word's tense and it is then inconsistent with the rest of the document, I would feel entitled to ignore/revert that change altogether. If you think the editor's suggestions make things worse, you could either ignore the suggestion, go back to the editor to plead your case (negotiate), or accept it (if the editor is the ""boss"" and won't negoatiate anyway).  At the end of the day, if something is published with your name on it, you need to be happy with the finished product. If your editors aren't helping make things better, it may indicate problems beyond the technical changes they're making, but higher-level problems such as agreeing on who the target audience is, or whether they're competent editors in the first place. As a final note, this may be an opportunity for you to develop a style guide for technical documentation in your organisation (if you don't have one). As long as you get everyone to agree to it, you can point at it for any ""edits"" you don't like. ;)"
Is there a writing software that you can sort scenes like slides in PowerPoint?,"At the least, just the ones I know about are Scrivener and Organon.  More generally, these are called ""plot management"" or ""scene management"" software.  Either one will easily handle enough scene entries for a very, very long novel."
Best Way to Develop a Daily Writing Routine?,"Start a Seinfeld calendar. Basically, you have a calendar set up somewhere that you see everyday. Each day you write, fill the date with a big red X, or another distinguishing mark.
After a few days you'll have a chain. The chain just keeps getting longer and longer. Dont break that chain. 
Thats the way to keep pushing yourself to write as frequently as you can. You won't want to break that chain no matter what."
Attributing quotes to fictional characters,"The easy part: According to MLA Handbook, you cite a movie as: title underlined (we often use italics instead of underlining), director, distributor, and year released. You may mention writers, actors, and/or producer. Example: It's a Wonderful Life. Dir. Frank Capra. Perf. James Stewart, Donna Reed. RKO, 1946. For a TV series, they say title of the episode in quotes, title of the program underlined (or italics), title of the series  (by which they seem to mean a group of related episodes within a program) neither underlined nor in quotes, name of the network, call letters and city of the local station if applicable, and broadcast date. Example: ""Chrysalis"", Babylon 5, PTEN. Oct 26, 1994. The harder part is how to attribute words of a fictional character. If you just name the character, it gives the impression that that's a real person. But if you just give the author, that loses context for people who are familiar with the character, and it could be very misleading, implying that the author really believes those words, when it could be that he put them in the mouth of a fool or a villain. Also, when you're quoting characters from a TV show or movie, it's not always easy to find out exactly who wrote the line you're quoting: many such programs have multiple screen writers and the actors may ad lib. It's common when quoting TV and movie characters to put the character's name followed by the actor in parentheses. Like: ""Things are not always what they seem."" G'Kar (Andreas Katsulas) That's probably what I'd do for a TV show. For a novel, I'd want to mention the character and the author, but I don't know a consistent, recognized format for this and couldn't find one with a little web searching. I'd think something like: Sherlock Holmes, in Doyle, Arthur Conan. ""A Study in Scarlet"", The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes etc."
How should one refer to knights (& dames) in academic writing?,"Usage will vary based on the style guide. Some will ask writers to omit the title. Others will conform closely to standard English usage. In MLA 8, under 1.1.2 (Titles of Authors), it recommends that titles ""such as Dr., Saint, or Sir"" be omitted from works cited lists and ""usually"" omitted from text discussion. Among the examples is ""Philip Sidney (not Sir Philip Sidney)."" So Firstname Surname or (after a first usage) Surname would be acceptable, both without the title. Section 2.1.2 confirms the same guideline for works cited pages: write Surname, Firstname without the title. I have seen exceptions and inclusions of title for people well known by their title, where the title is a point of emphasis, like Lord Byron or (with first usage) Sir Thomas Malory. That would only pertain in-text; it is still ""Malory, Thomas"" in the Works Cited page. In the Chicago Manual of Style, 17th edition, under 8.31 (Titles of Nobility; may be paywalled), the following description recommends including the title: Unlike most of the titles mentioned in the previous paragraphs, titles of nobility do not denote offices (such as that of a president or an admiral). Whether inherited or conferred, they form an integral and, with rare exceptions, permanent part of a person’s name and are therefore usually capitalized. The generic element in a title, however (duke, earl, etc.), is lowercased when used alone as a short form of the name. (In British usage, the generic term used alone remains capitalized in the case of royal dukes but not in the case of nonroyal dukes; in North American usage such niceties may be disregarded.) For further advice consult The Times Style and Usage Guide (bibliog. 1.1), and for a comprehensive listing consult the latest edition of Burke’s Peerage, Baronetage, and Knightage (bibliog. 4.1). See also 8.22. As an example, these choices are listed, allowing Sir Forename, Sir Forename Surname, but not Sir Surname: the baronet; the knight; Sir Paul McCartney; Sir Paul (not Sir McCartney) For bibliographies, Sir and similar titles are usually omitted (16.38), though they leave the final decision up to the writer: Unless necessary for identification, the titles Lord and Lady are best omitted from an index, since their use with given names is far from simple. Sir and Dame, while easier to cope with, are also unnecessary in most indexes. Churchill, Winston [or Churchill, Sir Winston]"
"As a non-native English speaker, Is it better to get translated or get copyedited for long texts?","Translation really is an art. I recommend writing in the language where you have the largest vocabulary and where you feel most comfortable. In your case, that would be French. Then a translator can take your words, figure out how to say the same thing in English, and make readers feel exactly the way French readers react to the original. If you wrote in English, though, you might use a word that has a different meaning in that particular context, or use a word you think exists that doesn't, and so on. And then the editor would have to guess at what you actually wanted to say—which isn't playing to anyone's strengths. My advice: write in your strongest language, and then let translators do their magic."
Are there any places to have community story development?,"The largest communities I found  are Storymash and Protagonize.  The Wikipedia article on collaborative fiction mentions some other sites, too."
Are Names of Characters Copyrighted by Authors?,"IANAL disclaimer but generally character names themselves cannot be copyrighted.  They may be trademarked but only if the literary work/movie/or a related product were named after the character.  So, trademark would only come into play for secondary characters in widely merchandised works.   In theory you'd be completely safe as long as your characters aren't similar to characters of the same name, and they aren't widely known characters. There's an interesting essay here.  Here is one of the key points respecting copyright: Copyright: to warrant copyright protection, a
  fictional character must be
  specifically described and fully
  developed. At times overcoming this
  ""description hurdle"" may be difficult
  to achieve. This is because some
  courts are very skeptical of
  protecting ""word portraits"" since they
  are unable to ""see"" the differences
  between one fictional character and
  another."
How do I become a better writer when I hate reading?,"As a dyslexic, I understand the general aversion to reading. As someone who loves storytelling, I nevertheless want to be exposed to stories. There are some life-hacks for the reading adverse that want to write. Not only does an audiobook outsource the reading to someone else, but it is something you can listen to while travelling to work, sitting on the bus, or whatever. There is a second use of audiobooks that I do not see discussed much -
read-alongs. As a kid, I loved read-along storybooks. I must have listened to ""Autobots Lightning Strike"" so often it must have driven my mother spare. To this day, I can still replay the whole thing in my head. Reading along with the narrator takes the pressure off. If you want to just get used to the pleasure of holding a book and get a feel for the flow of words on a page, this is ideal. There are sites you can go on (I'll let you find them yourself) where you can get paid to read and record audiobooks. If you are the sort of person for whom money is a great motivator then this one is for you. For me as a kid, it was robots and adventure stories. My mum gave me the Enid Blyton book, ""The boy next door"" and I was soon reading every one of her books as fast as my mum could buy them for me. These days, I find those books boring and repetitive but that's just because my tastes have changed. I know of other dyslexics who never read at all. That is until Harry Potter hit the shops. Suddenly it did not matter how exhausting it was to read, they wanted to find out what happened next. When your passion for a series, genre, or author gets strong enough, nothing will stop you getting hold of more and just reading the heck out of them. Terry Pratchett's books are great for this. There is a reason us nerds and geeks tend to be experts - we consume everything there is to find on our favourite subjects. Don't like fiction? Try travel guides, technical manuals, science textbooks, biographies - whatever floats your boat. You are not likely to learn story writing so fast but you will pick up a thing or two about tone and pacing. No matter how much you generally avoid writing, the quid quo pro of reading a little of a person's work and offering feedback in return for a load of feedback on your work forces you to read but in a fun setting with people that you can get along with. As the reading is bite-sized and you take a break to discuss it afterwards it hardly feels like reading at all. There are some amazing videos on youtube that dig into the mechanics and theory of storytelling (film, TV, and books). Terms to search ""the hero's journey"", ""the three-act structure"" (also ""the five-act structure"" and ""seven-act structure"" too), and storytelling tropes. This will turn all your Netflix binges into storyteller training. Although, I have to warn you that learning the patterns of storytelling will spoil some of the more formulaic series. I spend a fair amount of time deconstructing the story pace in my favourite Netflix shows. I write humour and so tend to try and work out why a joke is funny. That is not for everyone but it works for me. Sooner or later, if you are serious about writing, you will have to make a sort of begrudging peace with reading. Some dyslexics I know invest in coloured overlays which help calm the text down and make it easier to read. Others read exclusively on their phones (don't ask me why - it sounds terrible to me). What helps is that the more you read, the more you enjoy reading and the easier it gets. Even if you are dyslexic or for some other reason a weak reader. Sure, you start off at a disadvantage but that only means you need a bit more effort to catch up. Read books you love and you will hardly notice you are doing it. Some of the better adaptations are so much more enjoyable to read after you have seen the series. Good Omens is a perfect example of that. Watch it, read it, and then watch it again. It is amazing."
How do I provide exposition on a magic system when no character has an objective or complete understanding of it?,"If you were to ask a highly educated person 2,000 years ago why things fall down, they'd have an answer.  (It just wouldn't be a correct answer.)  If you asked them what light is, they'd have an answer.  Their answer wouldn't have anything to do with particle/wave thingies which (probably) weigh nothing, and travel at a speed at which time stands still, and which nothing can travel faster than.  In fact, if you said that's really what light is, they'd think you were crazy. Alchemists had theories about why mixing different substances and heating them caused new substances to form, and while they were pretty sure there were details still to be worked out (like how gold was made), it was just a matter of time.  Alchemists were not entirely useless, either; they developed dyes and other useful chemicals, even with their imperfect system.  Later, chemists went through various models for atoms, the building blocks for matter, until they arrived at quantum theory, and probability fields for electrons.  Quantum theory is so complicated in practice that we don't even use it (most of the time) to calculate what will happen in a chemical reaction - we use older, technically incorrect theories, which (usually) work to describe what will happen, even if things like electron orbitals isn't really what the atomic system is like. Cynthia, who can make plants grow and blossom before your eyes, swears up and down it's because of the power of Mother Gaia, and that it's that same power that everyone is using (though ""Some people are using it wrong!""). The Thompson brothers, who can both make fire, disagree whether they're drawing heat from the sun, or from the center of the earth.  They have endless discussions, when together and not doing anything else, about whether their powers are stronger during the day, and whether that proves that the sun is the source of their powers. Angela started being able to resurrect dead bugs and small animals after her trip to see the Egyptian artifacts at the museum.  Okay, it was a year and a half or so after the visit, but she was really impressed, and is pretty sure it has something to do with it.  She's now obsessed with Egyptian mythology, and always wears some kind of snake totem.  But no Ankhs, because she's not some stupid sun-worshipping heretic, like Akhenaten was!  She's for Osiris, all the way. The Thompson brothers will talk your ear off about how powers work, if you let them.  (If you also have powers, so they're not keeping it a secret from you.)  Cynthia will speak in vague generalities about Mother Gaia, whether you have powers or not.  Other than talking down Akhenaten, if you bring up the subject in just the right way, Angela won't say a thing about how (she thinks) she got her powers.  It's a secret.  After all, if visiting a few artifacts in a museum can give someone powers...  Bad things could happen, if her knowledge got out.  She may even encourage people to believe in that bunk Cynthia is selling.  (Literally - Cynthia sells crystals and essential oils, even though they don't work.  And even though Cynthia has actual powers, she don't realize crystals and essential oils don't work.)"
Current events may have ruined a name I was going to use,"Names are easy.  A quick run of Find/Replace, and suddenly, every mention of Corona is replaced with Prominence, or Flare, or whatever you want.  Write your story using whatever name you are most comfortable with, and worry about the name once you get closer to publication.   You should make note of any instances of the name that won't be easily caught by find and replace (such as the name getting cut short, puns on the name, or symbols based on the name, etc) so that you remember to change them later. That said, you probably don't have much to worry about.  It sounds like you have clear sun related imagery in the book, so unless Corona is the first sun-related name mentioned in the book readers should have no problem making the proper associations.  This is particularly true if your story is set in a secondary world, which will further isolate the readers from associations with real current events. Give yourself some time to wait until the current crisis is past and the media frenzy has died down, then give your book to beta readers and see if they comment on the name.  If your beta readers report that the name Corona is pulling them out of the story, then worry about changing it.  Not before."
"How to make a repeating plot ""slice"" not annoying","If X gets hurt in a fight, recovers, gets hurt in a new fight, recovers again, etc. that is going to start to get boring. If you want to avoid boring your readers, fights need to have consequences. In your story, that's not death, but it could be a lasting injury, or a damaged plot relevant item.  X doesn't have to recover, or not completely. Especially if they're getting hurt badly. Even with sci-fi medicine, plenty of injuries probably can't be healed instantly. Not to mention the mental traumas such as PTSD that can happen. If there are lasting effects from the fight that affect X in later scenes, it gives the fight scene a better sense of purpose. Maybe the leg wound they got in chapter one prevents them from climbing to safety in chapter three. Or the concussion they got means they're unable to drive and can't follow the bad guy."
Should we add a character in a story for realistic effect?,"You have a realistic effect that follows from the situation that you've put your character in, but that effect isn't interesting, nor does it affect the story in any significant way. The solution is have it happen off screen.  You have the MC eat, realistically they'd have to use the toilet. But you don't necessarily write about them using the toilet, right? Same here. If you feel it is necessary for the character to go to a psychologist, and for the reader to be aware of the fact, you can mention it in passing - something might happen while she's on the way to/from a meeting with him. This ""something"" should be plot-relevant, of course. "
"How to explain the main plot with science based concepts, without the non-sci-fi fans getting bored?","I don't find anything wrong with your explanation per se.  You have a range of options as how to best present it, and what works depends on your aims: Don't explain it at all:  This is a legitimate choice, especially if you're sticking close to the POV of the humans, and they (we) never figure it out. Give it a brief, non technical explanation: (""Great Scott!  It's as though our computers were a beacon signalling them.  It was like blood in the water to a shark!"")  Less is often more.  Think how much more convincing the Force was in the the Star Wars original trilogy, where it was barely explained, than in the prequel trilogy, where it was over-explained. Include a scene from the alien POV: (""Commander!  There's a new light on the charts.  A previously unknown species must have achieved quantum computing!"") I don't think any of these approaches overly burdens even a non-technical audience.  And if it does, SF may not be their genre to begin with.  You can't please everyone."
"How to present an alien culture with different morals, without it coming across as savage?","I think the best tool in your toolbox towards this aim is probably language.  A lot of how we view something is in how it is described.  The culture you are describing sounds very formal, polite and ritualized, even if the acts they are committing are brutal --not unlike feudal Europe or Japan.  So, it's a ""duel for honor,"" not a ""revenge killing."" In this context, even death threats will be very, very polite. It's worth noting that this technique is in constant real-world use.  The actions of our own country are described with a very different vocabulary than those of hostile countries, and devalued cultures are painted as savages for the same actions that are glorified in favored cultures.  When we do it, it's a ""limited police action,"" when they do it, it's ""unprovoked hostility.""  Our ""glorious victory"" is their ""brutal massacre."" In general, I would expect this culture to be obsessed with ""honor"" --that is so often what we call ritualized savagery held in check by formalized structures,  and/or a ""civilized"" predilection to violence.  We may still find the values of a highly ""civilized"" violent culture alien, but we'll be much less likely to dismiss them as savages."
What pronoun should a hermaphrodite species use?,"Unlike the engineered hermaphroditic humans in Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan universe, who might be speaking a future version of English, your hermaphrodites are an alien species and do not speak English among themselves. They will therefore have a pronoun in their language that has no correspondence in contemporary English. If you want your narrator to convey this linguistic feature to your readers, you may invent (part of) that alien language and use that alien pronoun in your narration. This should not be a problem to your readers after some introductory explanation (in text or in a preface) and a few reminders every now and then during the narrative. If you want to write in English without using words from another language, you could look at what translators do when they translate text into English from one of the existing genderless languages. In my opinion, the best you can do, if you want to represent the absence of gender in a gendered language such as contemporary English, is: I have frequently seen the second option employed in published fiction, often with female pronouns, often by feminist authors, and mostly for human or humanoid species. Sometimes this was done without the explanation, as a conscious play on gender expectations in the reader. A recent close example is Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie, in which English ""she"" is used for both genders in a culture that ""doesn't much care about gender"" and does not have gendered pronouns in its language: She was probably male, to judge from the angular mazelike patterns quilting her shirt. I wasn't entirely certain. It wouldn't have mattered, if I had been in Radch space. Radchaai don't care much about gender, and the language they speak – my own first language [represented by English, in the book] –  doesn't mark gender in any way. The first option (using ""it"") would emphasize the fact that your beings aren't human, which might or might not be something you want. A clear advantage is that your readers wouldn't have to constantly remind themselves that ""she"" doesn't mean ""female"". Singular they isn't commonly accepted as correct, so I don't see it as an option for most writers. As the English language changes, singular they may eventually become Standard English or even replace gendered pronouns, but today too many readers see it as grammatically incorrect or ""policing speech"". I wouldn't use singular they in my writing before it has been accepted by the majority of my target audience. Other writers may want to take a stand for gender neutral language and use singular they in their writing as a political act. This is the option I prefer. It is free of prejudice, clearly singular, and its slight suggestion of Broken English fits the fact that it is spoken by aliens perfectly. Certain languages have no third person pronouns and their speakers use nouns (such as boku ""servant"" in Japanese) to refer to other persons. Small children use their names to refer to themselves. Something akin to this will give a decidedly alien touch to your aliens' speech. This is my second favourite option. It's not the first, because it will take quite an effort to worldbuild the aliens' culture to find a term that works well."
What makes an ending tragic?,"That is the real question, isn't it? What is it that makes an ending sad, tragic, happy, bittersweet? What does it take for a story to make us feel things if not for its relevance to our own experiences? The reason you don't find Romeo and Juliet's ending tragic is probably because our culture finds their love closer to 'cringe' than to 'romantic'. Our blunt emotion receptors are not tuned to tragedy... unless you are a highly empathetic person. That said, not all people find the same things tragic, or even remotely sad. Even if we are unaware of it, we are perfectly attuned to situations we find relatable. And the impact of a 'tragic' or 'sad' ending is also correlated to our personal experiences. So, what really makes an ending tragic? Our empathy. Our connection to what we perceive as universal values. Our sense of justice. Our need for community. Our humanity. Now, my own two cents on love plots, because you seem to be focused on romance: I also believe that 'They lived happily ever' endings are cheesy. I find them cheesy because they are not the end; just a milestone. Really tragic endings in love stories do not allow for sequels or 'what next' interpretations. They deal with the end, the finite, the absolute. The tragedy comes in the lack of redemption. The impossibility of a 'hidden' happy ending. And that is what makes it have a deep impression. It's not the 'what if' in the story; that's over. Done. It is the possibilities hidden in your own life and the lives of the people around you. I am sure there are endings out there that you would find tragic. You just need to find one that feels real."
How to derive a first sentence from a story?,"This is an odd question, but not for the reason you likely think I say that. Let me explain. If I were to write an epic tale about three friends who need to save the world, and I open with: The tortoise, how marvellous creature it truly is. Slow and lumbering, to be sure, but determined to walk a thousand miles all the same. What I am in fact doing here is foreshadowing the novel and the underlying theme (underdog story, perhaps). But more importantly, look at what else I am doing. It's a killer line, not because of rules or guidelines, but because it's the right line for this tale I'm telling. So my advice is to consider just what your tale is, what the author voice and character voice is, and fuse all that into an opening line that will say just what is going on (or purposely obfuscate that, as Stephen King does to give you a sense of normalcy to rip that away from you). How you go about fusing all that is what sets master storytellers apart from apprentices. (a nice way of saying I don't know how to put that into clear-cut rules... and I'm not a master)"
How do you mix dialogue with actions of a character?,"I've seen this done in a variety of ways, each complementary to the writer's writing style. For example, one series that I really enjoy that uses a first-person perspective, and very staccato action sequences. She released her physical frustrations on the bag, shouting at me with each strike.  ""I.""  Right hook.  ""Really.""  Left jab.  ""Don't."" Headbutt.  ""Care."" Haymaker. This creates a very visceral feel, giving the reader an incredibly clear image of what's going on, and accentuates the grunted pause of the speaker with periods, but the clinical analysis of the strikes only works for a certain kind of narrator. A writing style that holds a stronger emphasis on onomatopoeia, but delivered by narration, might look a bit different.  I personally prefer the clarity as delivered above. Her strikes on the bag didn't even slow as she spoke.  ""I.""  Thwack!  ""Really.""  Smash!  ""Don't.""  Thunk!  ""Care."" Crash! This strikes me as something a little less mature, with the narrator processing what's going on a little less, but focuses on the dialogue and retains the sharp tone very effectively. And I'm not a huge fan of this one, but I've seen that onomatopoeia inside the dialogue as well. Her words were divided by strikes to the bag.  ""I thunk really smash don't whack care.  Pow"" This one flows more like a sentence and less like someone barely grunting their words between strikes - but I for one find it a little more distracting."
I have 97 pages in my book draft. Is it too late to swap to third person from first?,"That's a substantial bit of revision. It can definitely be done, but the question is if that's what you want to prioritize right now. During a first draft, there will be a lot of things you'll want to go back and fix. The problem is, go back for enough of them, and you'll stop making any progress at all. So my first suggestion would be: don't go back yet. Save the revision for later, when you've got a first draft, and you can do all the revising at once. You might wind up needing to rewrite 10 or 20 pages or more, and then any time spent revising those will have been a total waste!  Instead, soldier on. In first person or in third? Well, my second suggestion is make a decision by trying it out. First, write the next 5-10 pages in third person; see how that works for this story, and if you're getting the effect you want. Second, revise 5-10 older pages from first person to third, to get a sense of how much effort that is. This will give you a good sampling of what you're choosing between. Once you've done that, make a decision (one way or another) and stick to that going forward. If you choose to make the switch, that's absolutely fine; keep writing in third person from here on, and after you're done go back and revise the earlier pages. Writing means revision. Lots and lots of revision. Accept it; embrace it; and manage it as wisely as you can :)"
Does my protagonist need to be the most important character?,"The protagonist is the person whose story you tell. The protagonist can be a witness to important events that he doesn't have a hand in, or she can be the sidekick to a hero, but The protagonist might not be the most important person from the perspective of a historian evaluating an event, but the protagonist must be the most important person in your book. Usually, when the protagonist is not the hero, the protagonist serves to show the reader how the population in general lives during historically important times. Examples are the lives of a woman during the Oregon Trail or Anne Frank, a jewish girl during the Nazi regime. The ""heros"" of those times are the politicians, military leaders, and others who shaped those events, while the protagonists – the woman on the treck and the jewish girl – are examples for the lives of the common people."
Can non-English-speaking characters use wordplay specific to English?,"People tend to think of translation as a word-to-word equivalency, but it isn't.  Different languages have different grammars, and each language words for concepts that can't be clearly defined in other languages.  Translation is about communicating meaning and intention, and wordplay can be a vital part of that. Part of the translation convention is to assume that an English language pun is replacing a roughly equivalent pun in the native language. You can see this in good translations of existing novels, where puns in one language will be transformed int similar, but different puns in the new language.  TvTropes calls these transformations Woolseyisms (Although Woolseyisms go beyond just puns).  You won't find them universally, because translating is hard, but there are some good examples there."
How to decide whether a story is worth writing?,"Most books I loved did not have any overt message. It was mostly by accident, and not the author's design, that I happened to find something that resonated with me. If you have a story that feels relevant enough to yourself that you want to invest the time and effort to write it, do so. If you write it well, others will enjoy it, too."
"For Fantasy Stories, Should You Include a Map At the Beginning of the Book?","It often helps because fantasy books often involve quite a bit of travel.  It is not strictly necessary for the novel to be coherent, but I have found the ones that I've read that lacked maps to be worse off because of it. Namely, ""The Blade Itself"" by Joe Abercrombie is a good example of a book that lacks a map that really needed one.  He talks about wars from the north and the south and cities far and wide, and the reader has no reference to where any of this is or how imminent of a threat it is.  It goes a long way towards making that book fall flat. If you have a world where the characters travel or where threats are coming from afar, I would say that you should also have a map.  If you're writing a fantasy story set in one city that only deals with the politics or something in that one city, then a map isn't strictly necessary."
Is the genre 'fantasy' still fantasy without magic?,"Lord of the Rings is as definitive an example of Fantasy as they come. It might even be the benchmark others are measured against. The ideas of elves, dwarves, etc. predate JRRT, but he was the one that most later writers based their races upon.  At the same time, Lord of the Rings includes very few uses of magic. They're very impactful, and magic is involved in the shaping of the world, but most of the characters' ordinary lives are quite magic-free. So it can be used as a litmus test: If one found a copy of Lord of the Rings where all the pages describing magic were missing, would it still be clearly identifiable as belonging to the fantasy genre? The answer is clearly ""yes"".  Fantasy is not a strongly-defined genre, there are simply a few patterns that mark a setting as a fantasy one. Multiple sentient species + pre-industrial world = fantasy. Species directly borrowed from Tolkien = fantasy. Placing Tolkien's races into an  industrial world and springing it with heavy cyberpunk (Shadowrun)? Now that's deliberately playing with the genre boundaries. Magic alone isn't enough to define fantasy either. Call it Supernatural and you can have almost as much magic in our world as Harry Potter. All in all, whether a book falls into fantasy or doesn't is based on the weight of ""yes-fantasy"" (magic, elves, medieval settings) and ""anti-fantasy"" (computers, spaceflight) elements within it, and most of all on the reader's perception."
How to know the reason for rejection?,Specific critique groups or websites such as Critique circle (what I'm using now) may help as a basis to find the reasons of the rejection or methods to improve upon. I think this website is able to provide feedback on specific issues but I am still new here and can't say much. You probably will need to find another similar type of website for Chinese based writing (I'm sure there is one out there) Hope this helps. 
How to introduce alien flora/fauna without turning the fiction into a biology book?,"It's just scene-setting. Your main character gets up in the morning and goes out onto her balcony to enjoy the morning while her caffeine is brewing, and she contemplates all the plants in her garden. As her eyes linger over each, describe them briefly, maybe with little stories about why she likes it or when she planted it or how hard it is to cultivate it.  Then she goes to work, and her buddy tells her about the crazy thing his pet TKTK did, and in doing so describes it. (""So Rex got into the kibble, and his head is stuck in the bag. I pull it off and there's kibble all under his scales, and of course the purple kibble looks awful against the green, and then he screeches because the kids startled him and the window shattered!"") When a character shapeshifts, it's perfectly fair to use that as a moment to describe the new animal shape your character has.  Drop in the description when the item comes up, show us through the eyes of one of your characters, and don't overdo it."
When is it ok to add filler to a story?,"There's a difference between filler and moments which aren't advancing the main plotline.
What one might consider filler at first glance often holds important information about setting, character, and character relationships.
I love using moments of 'downtime' from the plot to establish certain character traits, because it lets the reader focus on the character. If you want to tell your readers that Ron Weasley is brave enough to get knocked unconscious by a huge stone chess piece for his friends, you don't do this just as the chess piece is raising it's weapon. That would seem out of character and surprising to the readers, and they might not even pay it very much attention, since they're a little more preoccupied with the whole 'how will Harry get through these tests and stop Voldemort' plot.  But if you establish Ron's bravery several chapters earlier, when he fights a troll for some girl he barely knows... You're the author. You kind of get to decide if something is  important to the plot or not. Use these five dates to show the characters interactions with each other, to reveal important information about them. Even if the dates aren't important, writing them to space out your story IS important to your story. Passage of time is a hard thing to show, and if these dates are your tool of choice to illustrate the weeks/months/etc between points A and B then that's perfectly fine!"
What can I do if I hate my own protagonist?,"You may have story problems, too. As Mark says (I have to say that a lot) she needs to want something, bad. You say she is ""quite determined"" but mousy: She can be usually mousy, but when it comes to taking a direction that does not lead to what she wants, she needs to show some steel. Bravery. A willingness to go it alone. A willingness to defy others. A willingness to fight, to be injured, to risk her life, to intentionally choose horrific pain over safe failure.  Whatever her brass ring may be (and it should be uniquely hers, not something everybody wants), her pushover, shy, unsure exterior better have a lethal warrior underneath it, or (and this is a good story telling strategy) your story must gradually develop it. (e.g. Luke Skywalker is an unsure farm kid, but a series of harrowing and painful story events turn him into a consummate warrior.) The arc of a shy and mousy girl can end with a confident and battle tested adult ready to take on the world. After your setup, when you introduce what she wants more than her own life, you need her to take the first steps on that path and not by accident. She needs to make a hard choice and choose some sort of hardship over the wrong direction. It can be minor, and it doesn't even have to hurt. The reader needs to see she has her own mind, and when it is important she will risk danger over ""going along"", even if the danger does not materialize and harm her. The reader needs to see the glint of steel in her soul, and be looking forward to more of it later in the story."
First quarter friends,"Your issue is common to many novels and other long works.  Your characters aren't just dropping into and out of your MC's life (like you often see in, say, TV shows where the MCs have friends for one episode then suddenly they have a big event and no one shows up).  Your MC is changing settings.  With set changes it's normal and expected to change supporting characters. Making those secondary characters well-rounded without making the reader invest too much in them is indeed the hard part.  I'm handling this by giving secondary characters full lives and backgrounds and individual personalities.  But for myself.  Very little of my backstory is getting into the book (a lot of the characters don't even get page time, let alone names, though I know them all).  But what does make it through is personalized and not random.   My aim is to cut to the core of the character and bring that bit in.  But really, they're there for the purpose of supporting the main character in service to the story.  They have their own full lives and you will make that clear, but to the reader, they are there for a reason, not for themselves. Your reader will invest emotional energy around the same level that your MC (or narrator) does.  Something like bootcamp is an artificially close environment, so friendships get accelerated.  But it's still only a few months.  These are not lifelong friends, they're friends of the moment.  Convey that and your reader will act accordingly. Some of these friends might pop up later, or even become longer lasting regular characters.  Or your MC (or others) might mention them.  Doing this occasionally will help your reader feel that all that time spent getting to know people wasn't a total waste. As long as you don't delve into a supporting character's backstory too much within the novel before ghosting them, your reader will go along with it.  Changing casts is normal and expected."
How to include deliberate inconsistencies without it seeming like lazy or bad writing?,"I think that if you focus on your character's reactions to things not being where they thought they left them, then it will clue your readers in that you're not being sloppy but are being cagey. Especially, if sometimes your narrative has the character take a specific action -- puts the dog outside -- then finds it in the clothes dryer.  A silly and extreme example only offered for the sake of this discussion. But, with the narrative showing the dog let out into the backyard, then the reader and the character will experience the same ""what is going on here? And why is my dog so snuggly soft. Dryer sheets for dogs! Call the patent office."" By intermixing narrative showing some of the mysterious reality-warping events happening within the character's POV -- the coffee cup on the desk -- then later showing the character's reaction to the coffee cup somewhere else, I think you'll provide enough of a clue to your readers that this is a thing and not evidence of poor continuity on behalf of the reader."
"Is every story set in the future ""science fiction""?","Speculative fiction is an umbrella genre encompassing fiction with
  certain elements that do not exist in the real world, often in the
  context of supernatural, futuristic or other imaginative themes. This
  includes, but is not limited to, science fiction, fantasy, superhero
  fiction, horror, utopian and dystopian fiction, fairytale fantasy,
  supernatural fiction as well as combinations thereof (e.g. science
  fantasy). A large portion of speculative fiction works are science fiction.  But they can be other sub-genres instead.  All science fiction is speculative fiction. While speculative fiction can be set in any era, if the story is set in the future, that makes it speculative."
How to continually and organically let my readers know what time it is in my story?,"It is probably not going to be possible to keep your readers aware of the time and date all the time, at least not in an organical manner. However, with regards to telling the timeline, it doesn't matter until your plots converge. And then we know ""what day it is"" because your characters are in the same scene, or one character's actions cause effects for another character. I heard of an author who accidentally created an eight-day week in her very contemporary novel. She tried to edit it but finally gave up, just to realize very few of her readers noticed. So, the reader will likely not care about what day it is. You could always pick up ""Red Storm Rising"" by Tom Clancy. I noticed, for all his date and time references, the story was too complex to be read as anything but a chronological account of WW III. When plots converge, your characters will either be in the same scene, and we'll know the plots are converging. Or, since there has to be a logic between scenes. Call it cause and effect. Spreading these scenes on several POVs will automatically dictate the time-relation between the POVs. For instance; in a story with a king in one POV and a rebel leader in another. The king contracts some assassins to kill the rebel leader and the rebel leader defeats the assassins when they make their attempt on his life. We know what came first and what came after. We can even mix up the timeline and have the assassins attack before the king gives them the contract, and if done right, the reader still understands what came first and what came after. You can also use different clues to signal that the plots are ""touching"". For instance, in Ivanhoe, there's a church bell that can be heard in several POVs signaling that things are happening at the same time. Other things you could do to signal the ""time"" across plots and POVs is to have one POV hear rumors of the events in another POV or have common events such as wars, coronations, plagues, news reports, etc. But that's just something you need when you want to add extra spice to the story. Otherwise, you have one character's actions in one POV effect another character in another POV or you put the characters in the same scene and we know it's the day they meet, be that a Wednesday, Mittwoch or the Day of Odin... Robert Jordan, in ""The Dragon Reborn"" have his POVs converge at the climax of the story. They are all, for different good reasons, on their way to the same place, so we're expecting it to happen, but before it does, we have very few clues as to exactly when things happen... more than that they happen before the climax. Using dates and times, Stardates and ""Years of the Unholy Dragon"" is more there to give the story a specific feel, or following a specific genre (for instance, ""Red Storm Rising"" did gain atmosphere, if nothing else, with the dates and times). I don't think you should count on the reader to keep track of dates and times, at least not to the level that it is required to understand the story. It could be an extra spice for your really observant readers, but it should not be required. You should also be aware that the taste of different readers with regards to dates could differ (see discussion below) or that different stories have different requirements. I suggest checking what other authors in your genre has done with regards to dates or no dates and how, and/or use beta readers to see if your specific story gets a ""the dates made me confused"" or ""I'd love to have dates to keep track of the events"". Keeping a strict record of the date is obviously also going to require more work from you and might make you less willing to reorganize the story in ways it might need to be reorganized because suddenly you have to rewrite that timeline and change the dates in two dozen chapters because of it... Also, as per the below discussion, you should definitely keep track of when things happen, if you need it, but you could lessen your workload if you don't use it in your chapter headings if that information isn't needed there."
Not projecting myself onto my characters,"It's okay to have a Blue Period.  Picasso's lasted 4 years and was fueled by depression.  He produced amazing paintings during this time and it was something he felt compelled to do. It's making me bored with my writing and discouraged with myself,
  because I feel like I can no longer write a character that is unique
  or layered. So now it's time to transition to other things.  Having the insight to recognize that is a good thing (and more difficult than you might think). Take a class.  A creative writing class where you're forced to write in different styles, about people and places you normally would never choose, might be just the thing to gain practice writing in new ways. Co-write a project with someone different from you.  Collaboration means compromise.  Even if you wanted to make all the characters the same way you have been doing it, you can't.  A collaboration can be between two writers, an idea person and a writer, a writer and an artist, or any other combination of talents. Write some non-fiction for or about people without mental illness.  Everybody has emotional challenges and your extensive knowledge of mental illness will help you gain insights into people dealing with everyday life without disability.  If you write some stuff geared to a broader audience, it will be good practice in shaping your concepts away from one narrow focus. Meet people.  I give this advice to everyone who asks how they can write a character that's done stuff they've never done, or that fits into a category they'll never be part of.  That includes non-disabled people who want to write about mental illness.  You can get a lot out of books but it's not enough.  You need to encounter a wide variety of people. In your case, the people you might need to get to know better are in the mainstream.  I don't know what your life experiences are or who you hang out with, but my guess is that part of your trouble writing characters not like you is because you don't know (really know) people who aren't like you.  This is normal and standard: we all tend to group with people like us.   To be a writer though, we must go out of our comfort zone and hear other people's stories.  Not (just) read them.  Not (just) view them on a screen.  But meet the people and talk with them.  Even if your social circle includes amazing diversity in other ways, it may be lacking in the way you need to breakout of your own personal Blue Period."
"Brands to use, brands not to use","This is not legal advice and I am not a lawyer. Great question! I think the answer lies in this: But what about a big known brand, like Google? In a story set in our time, it would be rather weird for the characters to use a search engine that isn't google - we even use 'google' as a verb, as in ""why don't you google it?"". When you get to the point that it would sound odd to not use the brand name, that's where it makes sense to use it (if you can). ""Good question, let's Floogle that"" sounds weird. If you were in a situation where you can't use the brand name legally (I'll leave whether that's the case for other questions to answer) you can write around it. ""Good question, let's check the web"" is definitely less awkward that using another search engine. It's also worth looking into the concept of generic trademarks: A trademark is said to become genericized when it begins as a distinctive product identifier but changes in meaning to become generic. This typically happens when the products or services with which the trademark is associated have acquired substantial market dominance or mind share, such that the primary meaning of the genericized trademark becomes the product or service itself rather than an indication of source for the product or service. Thermos, Kleenex, ChapStick, Aspirin, Dumpster, Band-Aid, Velcro, Hoover, and Speedo are examples of trademarks that have become genericized in the US and elsewhere. Whether this means you can use these without fear of getting a cease and desist letter... I'd check with a lawyer about that."
What are some ways to get to know your characters?,"I used to exert a lot of time and effort to creating extensive character biographies and doing things like personality tests.  I think all of this is very useful, but in the end, the way one gets to know their character best (I think, anyway) is simply by writing the story.  The truth is, you'll never know or understand your character as well as when you see them in action, making their own decisions, even doing things that you didn't necessarily plan for them to do. Creating scenario-based character profiles that have nothing to do with the story can be helpful, too, and I wouldn't discourage it - but I would ask: Why put forth so much time and energy creating things that have nothing to do with the story? After all, if the story doesn't turn out exactly the way you wanted it, that's why the rewrite was invented. I believe that its really in the rough draft that we meet our characters for the first time - even if we have a 100 page biography prepared beforehand.  Which is part of the reason the phrase ""writing is rewriting"" is so true.  Because once you finish that rough draft, you know your characters so well, you can finally go back through and make them consistent and deep from beginning to end. One of the rough draft's most important roles is to help the writer get into the characters' heads.  I'm just not certain it really, truly happens before then."
Can I give a lecture about my book without disclosing my real name?,"Yes...but... Yes, of course you can use your pen name.  Your audiences need never hear anything different.  None of your marketing materials need give your real name. The issue comes when you need to do things officially.  Say, you get booked for a lecture and they set up transportation or a hotel for you.  You need ID for those, so they'll need to be in your real name.  If it's really a secret, then you'll want to do your own transportation and lodging. The other issue is how to get paid.  For that, get yourself a Fictitious Business Name.  As Amadeus points out, this is also called ""doing business as"" (DBA).  In the United States your city or county will have the paperwork.   You need to research that no one else is using the name, and, if they are, that it's not in a field where yours might interfere.  For example, if your pen name is used by an ice cream shop in another state, you're good.  But if it's used by another writer, that's potentially a problem (though not a dealbreaker). Then you do the paperwork and pay the fee.  In my county, it's $45 for the first business name and $9 for any additional one (register all variations).  After that, you are required to publish the notice in a local newspaper.  They'll help you with that and it's not expensive, just a classified ad.  Your Fictitious Business Name is good for 5 years. Your bank will need to know your real name in addition to the FBN.  Otherwise, you probably don't have to tell anyone."
What is a beat?,"Since ""break your scene into beats"" was from my comment, let me see if I can add anything to the discussion here: You originally wrote ""I divide my story into scenes, and put those scenes into chapters."" So you understand how to break a story into smaller pieces. Let's create an example: SCENE: James just found out that he's been promoted, and is sharing the news with his best friend Sam. James didn't know Sam was going for the same promotion. Sam is both pleased and jealous, and trying to hide his jealousy.  [My original suggestion here was ""forget about word count, and ask yourself 'Did I accomplish the task(s) in my outline in this scene?' "" Let's assume that the tasks you want to accomplish are:  So to create beats, you kind of micro-outline your story.  Those are beats. They are bubbles of action, of thought, of mood, which each contribute something to character or plot."
Will blogging my fiction limit its ability to be traditionally published later?,"The rules are changing, which makes it a bit hard to be sure what the hell the rules currently are. Posting on your blog counts as publication. The traditional rule was definitely that, for fiction at least, most publishers want first publication rights, and you'd be blowing those rights by posting on your blog. Is that still the rule?  I think it is, for most publishers.  But there are likely to be exceptions.  If your blog draws a huge audience, then it could actually be an asset in trying to sell the book, since you've demonstrated the material's appeal.  And even if you don't get a huge audience, you may find a smaller publisher that doesn't care as much about first rights.  It's possible. But I'd be really careful about counting on either approach.  I totally sympathize with the motivation issue, and do myself post my WIPs to a blog... but it's a locked blog with a circulation of about ten people.  Essentially, it's an on-line crit group, and I've never heard of a publisher having a problem with writers working with crit groups. Do you have people in mind who'd read your on-line stories?  If you do, you could make a locked blog (I use LiveJournal, but I'm sure there are other options) and only give access to those people. It might be a way to give you motivation without closing any doors for publication."
Identifying and managing weak scenes during planning,"I'm a discovery writer (no plan!) and I seldom have this problem. I would suggest actually writing less on the plan.  The issue, which discovery writing takes care of automatically, is that main characters tend to grow throughout the book. That is what happened to you, in your own ""discovery"" phase of writing (some scene) you embellished and created some personality traits. That is a good thing, a natural thing, and readers find it entertaining to gradually discover character traits. But it is very difficult to plan out in an outline. Many plotters have the problem of their characters growing and then straining against the leash later in the story, they don't want to say and do what you planned for them to say and do. It is no longer in their organically developed character, and feels awkward, or cardboard, or forced, when the time comes to write it. That is what happened to you. The way around it, if you feel like you must have a plot, is to skeletonize the plot. Do not put so much detail in it. Write only the turning points, things you can remember while actually writing the early parts. This will leave you the room you need to improvise new character points while writing, and to then improvise when you get to the scenes. Examples: 1) The team decides they have to go to Chicago. 2) In Chicago, Mike hooks up with Alice. Consensual, but she regrets it. He knows it. For (1) In your head, from the beginning, you know they have to decide to go to Chicago, but don't write in all the emotions or dialogue of WHY, leave the character arguments and motivations for when the time comes. For (2), From page 1 you know Mike and Alice have to hook up; consensually. So you won't give either of them a trait that would sabotage that hook up or make it implausible. But wait to write the emotions and motivations until the time comes. At that time, you may also go back and insert incidents that foreshadow the event, or make it more plausible.  That is how I work as a discovery writer, there are big things I do know about the relationships but I intentionally develop the characters as we go along, by letting them do and say whatever comes into their head. Or to be more exact, they do, think and say what I think that character-so-far would most likely do, think or say in the developing situation. So my recommendation is to write less in the outline, stick to the bare bones of plot turning points, and let your characters become people in your mind. There are many ways to decide you have to go to Chicago. Some characters may like the idea, others may hate it. Good, that creates conflict and tension.  There are many ways for Alice to have a disappointing sexual experience with Mike. That could be Mike's fault, or Alice's, or the environment or demands on their attention making it a rushed experience which did nothing for her. You know when you are writing that is how it has to be to serve the plot, let the characters figure it out when you get there."
Effective techniques for describing pain,"Take notes when you're suffering for later use. No really. Get into the habit of carrying something to jot down your thoughts on (phone, tablet, moleskine notebook, marbled notebook, whatever) and when you're feeling something intense, write it down. Describe it. In the moment, write down all the things you're feeling, no matter how repetitive or hallucinatory.  This will teach you (a) observational skills (b) the habit of putting nonverbal things into words. As you get better at noticing and then describing how it feels when the wind blows through your soul on a cold mountaintop, and your thighs are prickling as they turn numb and your sinuses ache dully at the bridge of your nose and your scarf is wet and slimy from the condensation of your breath and your lungs feel like they're stabbed every time you inhale, you won't have to struggle so much to come up with ways to make your reader feel the cold."
Writing a programming book: how to present directory structures,"I do something similar to your ASCII implementation, but instead of an ASCII block I use compact bulleted lists (with sub-lists).  File/directory names are still styled as they would be in running text.  In addition to conveying the structure, this also gives me a handy place to add explanations where needed, which is particularly important when (from the user's point of view) the information is new.  For example, my approach would let you explain what WEB-INF is for.  (In that bullet: ""WEB-INF: explanation.""  Typography distinguishes name from explanation.) Screenshots are usually a bad idea in my experience; they have to be edited/updated separately so they might rot (as @Piotr said), and if the document isn't WYSIWIG but, say, HTML, the author of the document might not see the screenshot ""inline"" while editing.  Not seeing the screen shots in your (say) text editor can lead to text-screenshot mismatches.  Further, screenshots aren't as visually accessible as text; they don't work with screen readers (unless you also type everything is alt text) and readers can't style the page for font sizes, colors, or contrast.  This doesn't mean never use screenshots or other graphics; they're an important part of many documents.  It does mean to not use them when they're not necessary.  In this case, you have a text alternative that provides the same information, so you should prefer that."
The psychology of finishing a piece of fiction,"I don't have the major swing you have, from brilliant to horrible; but I understand the sentiment from earlier writing. I suggest three things. 1) Treat yourself like a child, or at least like a student. A beginner. Write what you want, and when reviewing it, be critical but try to put your criticisms in phraseology you would use with a child learning to write. Figure out what the kid was trying to say, and why what they did say did not convey that accurately, or conveyed that embarrassingly, or whatever. If you think the writing is horrible; get past the emotion and into the analysis of exactly what is wrong with it. You can try to fix it then, or just make notes in brackets [CHRIS: this metaphor doesn't land / sounds awkward / out of character / cliché / lacks conflict, too much puppetry / etc ] Or:  2) Every day I read what I wrote the day before and do this, and edit it if I don't like it, until I like it again. If I can't get it right, I will scrap it and come up with a different scene. Fair warning: I am a discovery writer and probably throw out 25% of my writing for this reason.  3) On the longer scale, when I have finished a story, I will edit from the beginning, rewriting anything I dislike, and do that again. This is not an endless loop; I have finished books this way! I am about to begin my fourth pass at a finished story, and likely the last. It is important to be analytical doing this, and not change something (other than typos and grammar errors) just to make it different: Change it only if you know there is good reason to change it.  My most frequent reason, on the first and second pass, is murkiness in pronouns in scenes with several characters; the ""she"" that was clear to me when I was writing I realize was unclear with two females interacting in a scene; a habit I have been unable to break while writing the first draft. Other frequent reasons for changes are lack of visualization, poor description of feelings, lack of conflict in conversations, lack of movement of characters. (A style choice, I like to keep my characters physically moving; even if they are stuck in a chair taking a test or reading a letter. If  they are thinking, they do that while doing something else, the laundry or cooking dinner or mowing the lawn.) In general, now that you know you don't like your first draft, don't move very far away from something before you edit it. It is very important to sleep between hammerings on a given section. The point of that is to flush the context from your short term memory, but don't go too many days before your first edit: You don't want to do so much other writing that the general purpose and intent of the scene has been forgotten. For example, I remember I want to show that Alice is just beginning to fall in love with Bernie, I still want that, but my choices are not getting ""love"" across; it just seems like Alice is irritated with Bernie. I wanted the irritation to provide conflict in Alice, but I am clearly failing to portray her complete feeling, the scene needs something else, a saving grace for Bernie. Edit to add: It belatedly occurs to me another issue I found causing this is failing to do what I have come to call writing with a methodical imagination. Specifically, when I write scenes, I methodically step through the senses and personalities of the people involved. What do they see, smell, physically feel (heat, cold, soreness, etc); what is the weather, what is their mood? What should the weather be, or the view, to support the scene? What can I do to create a clash or conflict? Is there anything they can physically be DOING while they talk? I do this to avoid ""walls"" of either conversation or exposition (info dumps), to create a scene that shows what I can, and tells what I want the reader to know but not dwell on (because showing takes longer than telling). For me, before I did this, my initial scenes were often sketches that felt incomplete, they did not accomplish the kind of immersion I felt reading other authors. I don't say you need a laundry list of every sense they have, I only pick two or three things to highlight. But knowing Alice is exhausted can influence her dialogue, her humor, and her choices. It may influence my word choices, too. The reader may not get ""Alice is exhausted"", but to me the scene feels better, has a more ""unified"" mood, if I keep things like that consistent. "
How to deal with common Earth references in a non-Earth setting?,"Some of the choice of words depends on the desired feel of the story. The reader might be an invisible observer of this alien world with a fellow human guide explaining various details. This expert may be a tourist or have a more scientific bent (e.g., sociological, biological, or physical/chemical).  With such a feel, wording would be more human-oriented and descriptive of what a human would observe. In this case, using words specific to human, terrestrial experience is not problematic, though wording would be biased by the guide's bent. (E.g., a ""tourist"" guide might use more emotive phrasings while technical phrasing would be more typical of a ""scientific"" guide.)  However, interleaving native dialog with such narration could be tricky, especially for less formal dialog where native emotional traits are common. (Note: it is conceivable that the native culture considers phrasings that are not generic or technical to be extremely provocative—taboo in ordinary communication—or possibly even unknown.) Alternatively, the world might be presented as if by a native guide, who has some familiarity with humans but is still biased by native assumptions. Such a native guide might bias the presentation as if trying to interest a tourist or a scholar. This will have a less abstracted but still strange feeling, more like meeting a friend's family for the first time than visiting a foreign country. There may be strange events (comparable to in-family jokes) that are never explained but there is enough commonness and welcoming that one is still inside the story. Another alternative viewpoint would be closer to being telepathically linked to the natives. With this kind of perspective, when alien terms are used their basic meaning should be easily discerned from context or previous use and the reader is made to feel as if a native to that strange world. With respect to sensory descriptions, many can use common terms even if the use does not exactly correspond to what a human would sense. For the human-guide perspective, these terms would be used as a human would use them and analogies would be more clearly declared as analogies. An immersive story would generally use terms in their native sense.  The light spectrum is universal. Generic color names such as red, green, and blue can be used freely even if the perception of color does not exactly match ranges in the electromagnetic spectrum associated with such by human standards. E.g., if the planet orbits a red dwarf, the natives might shift color names so that red is actually in the human infrared portion of the spectrum. (Even human perception of color does not precisely map to the electromagnetic spectrum, but it is a close enough mapping for general use.)  Color names associated with specific chemicals, e.g., rust, could also be used freely, though this may present consistency issues if the color spectrum names are shifted or otherwise adjusted. A character calling something ""rusty green"" may seem very odd; without preceding context the reader might even guess that copper is the common metal on this planet for some reason or otherwise takes the place of iron in people's thinking. Scents and tastes are related to chemical qualities which are often generic even if only by biological analogue. Sweetness is a common nutritional cue, and the native analogue could be so named even if a human would not notice any distinctive taste. Bitterness is a common indicator of toxicity. Sourness is a common indicator of spoilage.  It is somewhat reasonable to expect that many biological aspects found on Earth will have analogues in other biological systems. E.g., analogs to molds and fungi are likely to exist, so saying that there is a musty smell is reasonable. (However, such organisms may thrive in a different environment than their Earth analogs, so a character might say something odd-sounding like ""the air was dry and musty"".)  There are likely to be mobile organisms, which are likely to be heterotrophs, which can be called animals. There are likely to be sessile organisms (likely autotrophs), some of which may attract animals to distribute genetic material, the sexual components of these plants could be called flowers. A common characteristic of such flowers is a distinctive scent which might be called floral.  (However, it is quite possible that the native flowers commonly use carrior eaters, as some Earth species do, so a floral scent might not be pleasantly sweet. The floral odor might not even be an ""organic smell"" if some other chemical had a particular nutritional importance. E.g., on an iron poor world where flowers organically mimic the scent of iron, a character might say something like ""metallic meteorites are often detectable by their floral odor"".) Furthermore one can use words like said or read even if the communication was not auditory or visual. If persistent information is stored magnetically and retrieved by something similar to a platypus' bill, one could still write that the information was read even if the storage has a more analogue component (weakly analogous to word connotations and font/layout choices in print). It may even be convenient to use analogy that is closest in perception rather than physics. E.g., if bioluminescence is used for common communication, one might write that a character heard what another was saying, particularly for a more immersive perspective. In English, the use of non-generic terms is more common when the communication is either technical where specificity can be important or emotive where connotations can be more important. If a native is describing a moving observation, it would be ordinary to use native similes and metaphors like ""his tendrils spread wide like iliar petals, calling to entwine with mine"". Even without translation it is clear that iliar is some type of flower (this is probably a reasonable biological analogy) and like a flower the spreading has a welcoming/calling aspect. Something like  ""And that is how people were given the world,"" she concluded, her hair smelling comfortingly like fresh garozias. would be less jarring by avoiding dense use of foreign terms and giving a sense of the connotation of garozias than ""And that is how Blardt was granted to Twibns"" she said, her hair smelling like fresh garozias. (though it might be that The Word for World Is Forest). Using proper names could be appropriate if a distinction is necessary (e.g., the people are aware of multiple habitable planets or multiple peoples), especially if the distinction is important. It should also be noted that a longer sample of text would typically not have such a high average density of alien terms. (Another part of using a foreign language is to have the feel of the language be consistent. Since the vocabulary is relatively small, it may well be desirable for the sound to be more similar than an ordinary language would be in order to seem realistic.) Using native vocabulary has the same issues—and benefits—as using a foreign language or even just unusual words. Such can distract and confuse the reader if there is not enough context to discern at least the general meaning, but such can also provide a distinctive sense of place or tone. Some readers enjoy fiction that frequently uses alien terms, sometimes even when a decent understanding requires using a glossary, but most readers are not amateur ethnologists or linguists and prefer to have the basic meaning be evident even if they also enjoy being able to look up such terms at their convenience."
How realistic should dialogue and character voices be?,"I think the problem is, too much of the latter style will be tiring on a reader's eye and ""ear"" (they ""hear"" the characters speaking as they read). It's sometime laborious too because they have to figure out how to pronounce weird things characters say. Gone with the Wind is a drastic example of this, because Margaret Mitchell did just that when writing the African-American characters in her book. (I've never read it to know.) Modern audiences seem less accepting or patient. But to give a flavor for the character, a few examples of how they speak and then lightening the effect over time might be viable. Sprinkling it throughout would be another approach. I know I struggle with this too. Sometimes the way the character speaks is as, or more, important than their physical appearance. As authors, though, we have to get out of our own way and let the readers create the fictive dream around what we give them. It can't be too much or too little, so we have to walk the tight rope and find the right balance. Minor characters with short appearances can be done that way without worry too much, but if its a major character with a lot of dialog, it might become tedious. Hope that offers some help."
How does one include sign language in a dialogue?,"Italics make sense when sign is not the language most of the dialogue is in (I think this is a common tactic for ""secondary"" languages).  But if sign is the main language in your piece, I would just put it in quotes like any other dialogue. I guess the only question I would have for you is what is the main language of the dialogue?  If it's sign language, I wouldn't give it second class treatment in italics."
Pros and Cons of different styles of publishing,"1) Traditional publishing with an agent Pros: You as a writer focus on only one thing: writing. You have an agent who is responsible for shopping around your manuscript. Once it sells, the publisher is responsible for all the overhead: editing, printing, selecting a cover, distribution, marketing, and sales. There is no denying that there is a certain level of recognition that goes along with being traditionally published. It is like having a badge that says ""I made it""! This is something that shouldn't be ignored. Cons: You must first find an agent, which will require sending out query letters and inquiries. Most agents will only represent established writers, so for a new writer, this in itself can be daunting. If you choose to skip an agent, then you still have to go through the process of shopping your manuscript. Your royalties on sales are very small, as low as 6-10% for a new author, perhaps as high as 20% for a truly established writer. The author has little or no input on the cover selection or layout of the book. The time to market is generally 12-18 months. If you receive an advance, you don't collect any royalties or further payment unless and until your book earns out the advance. Your book will usually remain in a book store for 6-8 weeks before it is returned to the publisher, so you have a very small window of opportunity. Regardless of how much money you actually earn in the end, your agent will collect a percentage based on your contract agreement. That could be anywhere from 10-25%, but is generally closer to 15%. Traditional publishers tend to price their e-books at or near the same price as their paperbacks, which makes it difficult to compete with self-published book pricing. Also, although traditional publishers receive a much higher profit on e-books, that rarely equates to a higher royalty percentage for the author. 2) Small publisher Pros: See above (with the exception of the agent shopping your manuscript) Cons: See above (minus the agent comments). Also, a small publisher will have less money to spend on promotion or marketing. They will also more than likely have less clout with book retailers, which means that your book will have a smaller distribution and will likely spend less time actually in the stores. 3) Self-publishing (e-books or ""Print on Demand"" - POD) Pros: The writer has full control over the selection of cover art and the layout design. The writer does not have to share any royalties with anyone. The royalty rates for e-books is 70% (based on the Amazon KDP program, with books priced between 2.99 and 9.99). The royalty rates for POD trade paperbacks is dependent on whatever price you choose to set for your book. (The author essentially controls their royalty rate.) The time to market is less than 30 days, regardless of whether you choose e-books (which is closer to one week) or POD. If you find errors in your book or decide to change any part of it, you can do so virtually overnight, whereas this is virtually impossible with a traditional publisher. You have the potential to generate interest in yourself as a writer, and if you are successful in selling at least one of your books, then you have an advantage of other writers if you should decide to go ahead and pursue a traditional publishing deal. Cons: The writer is responsible for all the legwork to get the book ready and to get it to sell. This means you have to either do the editing yourself or hire it out (which could cost a couple hundred dollars, depending on the size of the book). You have to either create your own cover art or hire that out (generally costs about $100). You have to do the layout and design to create the final format for your book, and it usually requires at least three different formats, or you can hire this out (usually for about $50 or less). The writer has to take responsibility for sales and promotion, which means figuring out a way to draw attention to the book and persuading people to buy it. The time involved with having to promote your own work and do the networking to try to draw attention to your work can be very debilitating to your writing. One of the biggest challenges for most new writers is finding the time to write, but if you have to spend the same or more time promoting your work, it becomes even more difficult to get anything new written. There is still a stigma attached to self-publishing that causes people to frown upon authors who opt for this choice. There is the possibility that your work will be perceived by some as inferior or inadequate, and until and unless you can generate the sales to prove otherwise, it may be difficult to rise above that perception. 4) Vanity publishing Pros: Similar to a traditional publisher in that they provide the editing (minimally), and they do the design, layout, and printing.  Cons: Could easily cost as much as $3000, depending on the number of books ordered and the size of the book. They do not do any distribution or promotion of your book. The writer has to find a way to get people to buy the book. Most book stores, and also most online retailers, will NOT accept books directly from authors if they go through a vanity press. Royalties tend to be low because you have to price the books higher to recover the sunk costs. 5) Creative new approaches I can't really give any pros and cons on these because they are, after all, new! However, I know a number of authors who have done serialization of their novels on their web sites. They basically post a new chapter each week, while also providing readers with a link to purchase the entire book in case they don't want to wait.  I also know a couple of successful authors who originally started out by providing their entire novels as a collection of podcasts. Once they reach a certain level of subscribers, they then sent the subscribers a link to purchase the complete novel.  I am currently working with a group of writers to create a new novel in which each writer takes a separate chapter and builds the book from scratch. It's challenging, but so far the book is turning out better than I had imagined.  I also know of a group of writers who went together and created a short story collection where each writer provided their own story as well as sample chapters of other books they have written. I believe there were eight authors involved, and three of them have now been signed to traditional publishing deals! Disclaimer: While I will be the first to admit that I strongly believe that the potential for success for a new writer is much greater through self-publishing, I also believe that the recognition of having been published by a traditional publishing house will garner a writer much more attention. However, I am seeing more and more examples of writers who strongly believe in their work who have managed to land traditional publishing contracts after they have proven that they can sell their own books. It is my opinion that this may be a faster avenue for obtaining the more lucrative advances and esteem that come with a traditional contract."
Resources about different people types?,Archetypes may be a good place to start.  They won't really help with details about dialect but as archetypes they (supposedly) transcend culture and are a foundation on which all personalities are based.  They could certainly be useful in understanding the psychology of your characters if not their mannerisms.
Do publishers really need to translate between UK and US English?,"I think few would be put off by differences in spelling. But there are also words and phrases that many Americans would not recognize. Words that I know of that are different from American English include ""lift"", ""underground"", and ""torch"". There are likely many others I'm not familiar with as I've never been to the UK. Many of these are well-known in America; others might not be. In some cases it might cause confusion. Maybe this one is out of date, but I recall an American a number of years back who had just returned from the UK said that a friend he made there was going on a business trip and asked him, ""While I'm out of town, could you knock up my girlfriend for me?"" To an American this means to have sexual relations, which seemed a rather odd request. A reader might just stumble a moment before figuring out what an odd word must mean from context, or he might push on with some loss of meaning. (Unless it really leaves the reader baffled as to what is happening, I think few would stop to look it up.) If it's a book set in Britain and that setting is important -- as I think you're saying is true for your book -- some ""localisms"" might add flavor and color (or colour), as long as they don't get to the point of making the book confusing. In other cases they would just be distracting.  I was watching a UK-made science fiction movie recently and I found it jarring that the aliens all spoke with British accents. It occurred to me that Britons watching American sci-fi movies must find it odd that aliens all speak with American accents."
"How does one go about publishing erotica, and how far is too far?","Since your question has two parts, I'll address each separately. As far as how you can go about it, I would recommend that you self-publish as an e-book! You can use the web site below to get a free pdf version on how to get started. Someone made the following comment on a previous answer which has since been deleted: A self-published erotic novel will most likely fail unless the author has the experience needed. I would beg to differ on this opinion. I didn't have any previous experience, but I decided to self-publish a series of erotica e-books under a pen name, and I have done quite well with them. So far this month I have recorded over 7000 sales on Kindle alone. (Yes, that's one month!) There are a LOT of people who are buying erotica, and there is no time like the present to jump on the bandwagon. (One of the points I have seen concerning this is that the big advantages for readers is that nobody can see the cover of the e-book they are reading, so nobody can judge their selection of reading material.) As far as the question of how far is too far, that would appear to be certain forms of incest and anything that mentions or includes under aged participants. Amazon in particular has been very strict about these two particular topics and has gone so far as to remove books by some authors for featuring either topic. Some forms of incest seem to be getting through (uncles are currently popular), but underaged participants is absolutely taboo.  You can try the options suggested in the other answers, but you'll spend a lot of time trying to promote yourself and trying to get someone to publish your book. I strongly recommend doing it yourself. I have done absolutely NO promotion on any of my erotica over the last three months, but it has taken off at an amazing clip. The real difference changer for me was to offer a single short story for free. People who downloaded that have gone on to buy my other titles, and I suspect many of them have bought more than one title. Over the past month I have had four different titles that have made it into the top 20 for erotica at Amazon, and the free short story made it into the top 150 of ALL free books on Amazon! http://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/lets-get-digital/ (Disclaimer: The author of this book is in a writer's group that I am part of, but I do not know him personally. I have traded messages with him from time to time, but I have no vested interest in promoting his book. Besides, it's free!)"
How can I contact JK Rowling for permission to publish my sequel for the Harry Potter series?,"I'm sorry, but the chances of JK Rowling letting an amateur, unpublished writer use her ideas is zero. She and her partners have billions of dollars riding on the HP franchise. If she is tired of writing it, she might be interested in some collaboration with a best-selling novel author or screenplay writer she personally enjoys and admires and has worked with before, but not one of us. Period. She won't even read your letter or know about it, her agents and lawyers will respond with a form letter rejecting you out of hand. That's how the world works with billion dollar franchises. Get over it. It doesn't matter one iota how much you love it or how well educated you are about the HP universe. Apply your great sequel idea to something else entirely and don't use a drop of anything JKR invented. I'm not being mean, I'm just trying to save you time, and money, and heartache from being sued or rejected hundreds of times. JK Rowling is not going to collaborate or use ideas from a rando with zero track record. Period. Read this article, about somebody she did collaborate with for 10 years, Steve Kloves, the screenwriter for nearly all the HP movies: A Screenwriter's Hogwarts Decade. (Summary below) JKR is a micromanager when it comes to her franchise; I am 99.999999% certain she will not let anyone ever write a sequel in her universe. And she's a billionaire with billionaire film industry partners that will sue your pants off if you even try to publish such a thing using any trademark of theirs. Summary of Steve Kloves' article: Steve began on the first movie, and relates that Rowling told him she understands the movie cannot be the book, but she wanted to stick to her vision of the HP world and its characters as closely as possible. And that the script was something of a collaboration, she corrected him several times on the script, and she had a very deep knowledge of her world that wasn't in the book. When he asked her for the 12 uses of Dragon Breath she reeled them off from memory, even though they were not in the book. And many other such things, in a meeting brainstorming about a scene, he wanted Dumbledore to reminisce about a girl he once knew, Rowling waved him off, because she knew from the first book that Dumbledore was gay. When he wanted a minor character to die and suggested Dobby, she told him no, Dobby plays a critical role in the last book. Stuff like that. He did write the script, she trusted him to get that and the abbreviated story right; but Rowling is a micro-manager when it comes to details about the HP world and every single character in it, and she won't release her grip on the steering wheel. That makes it difficult for any other writer to tell original stories in the HP world; because the character arcs are already set in stone, in Rowling's mind."
How do you explain that the people talking English in a comic book are talking in a language other than English?,"Put the text in angle brackets and add a footnote at the bottom of the first panel (or page) where you do it, to say which language it's in. <Like this>* * spoken in German The footnote might not be necessary if it's obvious what the other language is that's being spoken. (e.g. Megatokyo takes place in Japan, so in https://megatokyo.com/strip/1599 you can assume the foreign language being spoken is Japanese.) There's also instances where you might want to repeat the footnote. Because if there is a lot of time between instances of characters speaking the other language, readers may have forgotten in the meanwhile. With webcomics that risk is even bigger, because of the time between updates. So I've seen some that just add a footnote on each update (where it's relevant)."
Is it considered lazy writing to have a dry prelude at the start of a book?,"Not too lazy. Your work habits really have nothing to do with it. The question is, can you make it interesting?  Providing context is difficult because it is a chicken and egg problem. No one cares about the context until they know what is a stake, and no one can tell what is really at stake until they know what the context is.  Ways of handling this go in and out of fashion, and the idea that you can avoid an infodump at the beginning by having two characters fill in the background with dialog later is a popular approach at the moment (though more so with aspiring than published authors). But when it comes down to it, this is still an info dump, and an infodump with dialogue tags is not really an improvement.  The real answer, as you can see in the works of successful authors, is not any form of info dump, but compelling immersive writing. Thus LOTR starts off by immersing us in the Shire. HP starts off in Privet Drive. Cannery Row starts off with a stunning description of Monterey. These are not info dumps. These are vivid immersive portraits of a world, a place, a time, a people.  This stuff is compelling by itself, if it is done well. It does not have to start with a plot. (How far into LOTR do we get before the plot is properly initiated?) At most they require a kind of tension that suggests that the material for a plot lies ahead, that this is the sort of place where something interesting could happen.  That is what you need to do. Not an infodump, in any form or in any place, but an immersion in a compelling situation. "
Is it ok to reference something modern to give the reader a better idea of what something looks like if the book is set in the Middle Ages?,"Attempting To Keep Readers' Minds Inside Our Story As authors we attempt to do everything we can to keep our readers' minds in our story.   In most stories, as authors, we also want to disappear so the reader can forget she is even reading.  In order to do that we create a setting such as 1400s England or whenever/wherever.  We do our best to describe the setting so the reader isn't confused.  All of that work we do would be broken in the moment that the reader reads the sentence comparing the shiny sword to a shiny car.    But there is another explanation too. Writing In The Perspective of A Character The story should be written in the perspective of some viewpoint character. For example an author may use first-person viewpoint.  And, obviously, in that case the first-person character (who lives in the 1400s) cannot make this analogy of shiny car to shiny sword. But even if we used 3rd person close type of viewpoint we wouldn't want to make that kind of comparison because again the viewpoint character is living in the 1400s.   The main reason we don't do this is because it will tend to jar the reader from the story and make her question if the setting really is the 1400s since the author or character has mentioned an automobile. As much as possible we do not want to jar the reader from the story because those are the moments when the reader may feel confused and may decide to stop reading."
The seven story archetypes. Are they truly all of them?,"No, they are not all of them. This is a common game, there are many books claiming there are 3 plots, 7 plots, 12 plots, 21 plots, 23 plots, whatever. You could say there is only one plot: Character Has A Problem. Overcoming the Monster. The monster is the problem. Rags to Riches. Poverty, disrespect, deprivation is the problem. The Quest. Finding the McGuffin is the problem. Voyage and Return. The reason for the voyage is a problem; perhaps a craving for adventure, perhaps a mission. Comedy. Still always a problem, just this time its funny. Tragedy. A problem that doesn't get solved. Rebirth. The problem is the Character, or the solution to the problem demands a major change in the Character. Romance: The problem is winning the desired partner, or if already won, finding a way to be permanently together. Non-romantic love: The problem is with forming, pursuing or repairing a non-romantic relationship (parent, child, friend, etc). Each of these problems can be presented in various ways, with various twists, and the different supposed ""archetypes"" can meld into each other: From your original list, Overcoming the Monster could easily lead to a Quest, or Rebirth; as could Rags to Riches. Or Rags to Riches could lead to Tragedy; succeeding in the Rags to Riches may leave the MC isolated, vilified, and lonely. Don't believe it! It may be useful to know how various archetypes or plots unfold, but my advice (after reading about a dozen books on plotting) is to stick to ONE archetype: Your character (or crew) has a problem. Then something like the Three Act structure. The story starts in Act I, their normal world. The problem appears in Act I. In Act II they try various ways to solve it with varying levels of success. In Act III they try their last hope and either succeed or mostly succeed or they fail."
Pretty flowers with clunky Latin names,"The average western reader would not know the difference if you told them that your heroes rested in the shade of a rhubarb tree or tied their horse to a gigantic parsley. Even western works that talk about people walking through a grove of ash or poplar only evoke a vague sense of woodsiness in the average city dweller. I think some have a vague sense that certain tree names belong to certain locales so if you say cottonwood they see the West and if you say mangrove they see the jungle, but they would not actually recognize these trees if they fell out of them.  If you want the reader to actually have some idea of what your trees look like, therefore, you need to describe them. If you just want them to have some vague sense of locale-specific woodsiness (which is probably the best you can hope for with most readers) then use whatever name seems to have the most romantic associations with the area you are writing about. "
How do I subvert the tropes of a train heist?,"I think the tropes are galloping horse, convenient boarding point, leaping from horse to train (and horse then veering off), a harrowing dangerous trip across the top of the train to get to the engine (perhaps almost falling off, perhaps with a gunfight or fistfight), holding the conductor at gunpoint to stop the train, or while the MC stops it himself. In the city or with a modern train, throw in a tunnel so the MC has to duck or lose his head. Also a convenient way to dispatch an opponent with his back to the tunnel. The second part of the trope is the heist works; I've seen that subverted at least once (the train was decoy, the actual treasure went by another route). Subvert the trope by making something the opposite of the trope. No galloping horse: I've seen helicoptering onto a train. You could use something besides a horse (or the modern equivalent, a motorcycle or car).  No convenient boarding point: The hero can't figure out how to get ON the damn train. This might lead to a comic series of figuring that out (fail fail succeed), but probably doesn't fit your plot of boarding a specific train. I've seen the harrowing trip to the engine subverted: MC boards on the caboose in disguise as a train employee, then just walks through cars to the front. I've seen stopping the train subverted: MC pulls a pin to disconnect all the cars from the train, they coast to a stop while the engine races ahead. (I wonder if this is physically possible on a moving train, but ... liberties of fiction.) You could subvert the trope with a plot twist: The train is an hour late, the conductor tells the hero he got stopped and robbed four hours out of the station. The gentleman that took it said if a woman tries to rob me, he will see her in San Francisco. You could subvert the trope by blocking the track with something highly visible, so the conductor stops the train voluntarily out of caution. Maybe she tricks the conductor into stopping the train. She could actually derail the train (dynamite the track)."
Is it time to start closing up my novel?,"Remember your goal: you have set out to tell a story. So tell the story. Forget the wordcount. You feel the story needs more meat, give it more meat. You feel you need to explore more themes, go ahead and explore them. (If you don't know what to write, that's a separate problem - a separate question.) A story should be exactly as long as it needs to be. Fahrenheit 451 and All Quiet on the Western Front are short. The Lord of the Rings and Les Misérables are long. Neither would benefit from trying to fit it to some Procrustean bed wordcount. When do you close the story? When you've told it. When you've explored what you wished to explore. I see sometimes books, and films too, that start out setting up a story, they start exploring it, and then suddenly they decide they must rush towards the end, plummeting towards it like the Niagara Falls. Those stories aren't satisfying. After plotlines have been carefully and meticulously laid down, we expect an equally meticulous resolution. You can't rush it, chopping off what doesn't fit. An example: Farscape. After carefully laying in the groundwork for season 5, the series got cancelled at the end of season 4. They had to wrap up the stories of a season in the space of a 3-hour miniseries. They did what they could, but many lose ends got resolved off-screen, and the whole thing felt a bit rushed. You are under no such constraints. Give the story the development and resolution it needs."
How to avoid writing irritating fan fictions?,"Depending on the forum you post your fanfiction you will get those comments no matter what you do. It's a sad fact, but there are many people out there who just want to make others feel miserable and growing a thick skin when posting on the internet is a skill that you might need.  Other than that it depends on the specifics of your fanfiction. For example quite often fanfiction involves different love stories than the original story had. Many people will not like that and this kind of comments are basically standard phrases for ""This is not my style. I prefer to read something different."" Maybe they didn't like that you changed the typical boy-meets-girl story to a boy-meets-boy story or a girl-meets-girl story or something like that. But this is just one topic that is often chosen, it really comes up with every topic though. Maybe you changed the villain to the hero for your perspective or made the favourite character of some reader to a supporting character with a minor role and now they don't like the story. Maybe you changed the scenery in a way they don't like or you added a story-arc that they find to be too cliché. Or they didn't like your wording. There are lots and lots of different topics that could invite such comments.  The closer you are to the original the less likely such posts are. The more original you are in your writing the more such comments you will receive.  The best advice I can give you is to ignore them. It's hard and it probably hurts quite a lot but these poor folks have nothing better to do than trying to make your life miserable. They are the ones that need to be consoled and you should mentally filter their ""feedback"" out as it doesn't involve anything useful and is only trying to hurt you.  Ideally you would find a place where you can for example flag something with such vulgar language, but humans are not perfect and the internet tends to bring out the worst in some people, so be prepared for something like this - and be prepared to completely ignore it. Though, I guess, not going to a place where something like this occurs would probably be a better idea if you can find such a place.  Fanfictions are often a starting point for people who want to start writing, meaning that there will be quite a few mistakes, making it thereby quite easy to pick on the weak people, which is why trolls love such places. But there will always be people who think similar things about your fanfiction and sometimes they will voice their opinions in such a drastic manner.  You can't please everyone. "
Why do writers use pseudonyms?,"Two reasons I know of: There may be legal reasons, too - but IANAL."
Is it a good idea to leave minor world details to the reader's imagination?,"When in The Lord of the Rings Tolkien writes ‘But it is a heavy burden. So heavy that none could lay it on another. I do not lay it on you. But if you take it freely, I will say that your choice is right; and though all the mighty Elf-friends of old, Hador, and Húrin, and Túrin, and Beren himself were assembled together, your seat should be among them.’ (Elrond addressing Frodo, J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, book II, chapter 2 - The Council of Elrond) We have no idea who Hador, Húrin and Túrin are. We only know of Beren as a legendary figure mentioned previously by Aragorn. The others - we can conclude from Elrond's words and from their mention in conjunction with Beren that they were heroes of old. We have no idea what their deeds were. Tolkien's usage here was neither a mistake nor an accident, but a nod towards the experience of reading an antique text, and experience he was deliberately trying to recreate. Reading an old text, you would sometimes come upon a reference the referent of which has been lost. Other times, the referent is unknown to you yet, and you have to go search and study until you find it. While for the original audience of the piece the referent would have been as well known as The Lord of the Rings is to us today. One might also experience something similar if one reads a text belonging to a foreign culture, when one isn't very well familiar with the culture in question (yet). Which might be similar to the effect you wish to create with your fantasy/sci-fi story. Or it might not be. Up to you. Which is to say, using a dead-end reference is a tool you want to use deliberately rather than haphazardly. It creates a particular effect that you might or might not want to use in any given point in your story. That said, you can vary the measure to which the reference is a dead end. This is discussed well by @ChrisSunami. Consider, we are told at the very least that Hador, Húrin and Túrin are heroes of old. Which is really all we need to know for the passage to work. We get the right image, we don't need the particulars of these men's heroic deeds. This is similar to @Chris's first two examples. When reading a real ancient text, dead-end referenced similar to @Chris's third example also occur, but they offer nothing but frustration. Frustration is not an emotion you'd want to deliberately evoke in your readers. You want to provide some description. The most crucial characteristic for the scene, at the very least. Something I do not see mentioned here: you want to limit the number of your Thajvas, Gaijamus, Lillahis and whatnot - the more terms your reader has to remember, the less likely they are not to remember them but instead get everything mixed up. And you don't want to rely on reference notes. They can be a nice supplement for the hardcore fans of your work, but they require extra work from the reader, which means fewer readers would be willing to make the effort."
Do readers not like a book if it's too dark and the characters almost never win?,"Hmm. When I'm not sure about something, I like to look at some examples. All Quiet on the Western Front has the characters never win. In fact, they all die, and their side loses the war (something we know from the outset, since that's Germany in WWI we're talking about). Nonetheless, All Quiet on the Western Front has its moments of warmth: there's camaraderie aplenty, there's gallows humour, there are the lighter moments with the French prostitutes and with the food. It's those warm moments that help the reader connect to the characters, and feel a loss when they die. Dr Zhivago is not happy reading either. With Russian Revolution as the backdrop, and an intelligent, warm, honourable MC, it's set for tragedy. Every time it appears things are starting to go right, something happens that makes everything go terribly wrong. But there are those times when things start to go right. There's love, and there's the breathtaking beauty of rural Russia. Those draw you in, and keep you hoping, even as the MC hopes, for a better future, not just for him, but for Russia. Finally, Hamlet, as an example of a tragedy. It starts bad, and it gets worse. At the same time, it offers plenty of wit. (""- What do you read, my lord? / - Words, words, words."") There's comedy (the gravedigger in the 5th act, for example), and there's Horatio's warm, unwavering friendship, offering some release from Hamlet's lonely lot. So, it would appear that a novel can be quite dark, but light is still needed in it. It is the light that sets off the dark. It is the warm moments that make loss meaningful. There needs to be hope, for it to be dashed. And in real life too, there is light to be found even in deepest dark. In greatest hardships, people still find a way to love, to be friends, to give each other hope, to laugh at their executioners. I guess it's human nature to keep striving, and we expect stories to do the same - to keep finding a bit of light in unlikely places (until, if you so wish it, there is no more light to be found)."
"Why are one-word titles so dominant in books, film, and games?","I am going to agree with Surtsey here. I do not think single word titles are the prevalent. I still think I can answer the question of what are the benefits of using a single word title. I am also going to focus on ""Climb"" and not ""Superhot"", as I think the second is just 2 words.  Titles of things are there for the first time impact. You want to hear the title, get an emotional response from it, and remember it. Or at least they want you to do that. We have emotional associations to words. Let's just pick some, ""hate"", ""punch"", ""murder""
Each one of those words has you feeling in a way. Those are your feelings, because you have seen those words, and have experienced them in so many contexts that there is nothing specific left about them. They are just a simple emotion and meaning distilled down as much as possible. Now let's compare that to sentence fragments. ""The hate You Bring"", ""Sucker Punch"", ""Anatomy of a Murder"". Feel how the emotion has been lost. Your mind now spends more time parsing meaning out of the words, instead of feeling them. If there is a feeling it comes externally, as the writer is telling you how to feel, instead of drawing out your own emotion from the word itself.  Now neither of these approaches of naming things is wrong, but you can clearly see the difference. These are tools in your naming belt to pass the ides that you want to the reader or viewer."
Death as person - A funny part of the story? Or serious stuff?,"Short answer: You can do and write whatever you want. You can make almost anything work. Long answer: Death is an idea, the belief that there is more to a human than flesh and blood, and that when we die, something mythical happens. Casting this idea into a character allows others to interact with this character, and also allows the writer to make comments on the image people have about death. The same thing can be done with any idea, and it used to be common practice to think about ideas as persons. The roman and greek gods are probably the most prominant example, but most polytheistic religions follow this idea to some extent. This also leads to some prime examples about good stories with interactions between characters like this, Homers Ilias are probably the best known example of mortal characters interacting with idea-based characters, although these incorporate a lot of additional lore that progresses the characters. Incorporating an idea into a character allows interactions that are otherwise not possible, it allows the sea to be explicitly angry at a character, it allows a character to chase the magic fairy that grants eternal youth or be hunted by the demon that will stop you from being reborn in the reincarnation-cycle. So yeah, characters like death can be good and interesting. However you might have problems expanding the character from the original traits that define it, thus making your characters slightly stale. So if you do, make sure to expand their backstory."
Protagonist constantly has to have long words explained to her. Will this get tedious?,"It sounds very gimmicky, to be honest. I think you should think of more different ways in which her lower education would show, and switch it up a bit. Etiquette comes to mind, not being able to read, not being able to swim, being able to practical things of a commoner... As a joke, it can work quite well if done right. For example having her ask ""Who's Clandestine and why is she building tunnels?"" or having her partner reply with ""Clandestine means he's being an arse who wants to show off his fancy words in front of us"" instead of actually answering the question. If you first build up the thing that she has to ask for words sometimes, then such a surprising joke would be a cool payoff to that buildup. But even that joke has a short half-life and should be used very sporadically, maybe even only once. And it sounds to me like you're not trying to be humorous anyway. Generally, your phrasing ""to pad things out just that little bit more"" is obviously alarming, because that's a bad reason to do anything. If it adds nothing to the story anymore, then leave it out. But do respect the character trait you've built up and don't ignore it! What you could do is that when someone says something complicated, have the narrator mention that your protagonist had the word explained to her before she answered. It might also be interesting what she does about this handicap that she has. Maybe she starts a mental list of new words, similar to Arya Stark's list of people she wants to kill? Maybe she starts using the words herself very often, and in slightly inappropriate contexts? But yeah, all in all I think it's a bit gimmicky, and in thinking about it I always come to the conclusion that it should be played for laughs or not done at all. I don't think you can have a dramatic and serious story with that kind of gimmick in it. Mention it at the beginning, and mention that she's frustrated by it. Maybe mention that she starts ignoring words she doesn't know, but reminds herself to look them up later. Then you can skip having to explain every complicated word and keep moving forward with the actual story. Side note, this setup would be quite nice for a children's story, though."
Realistically incorporating trans/nonbinary characters,"It's extremely important for media to depict people out of the gender/sexuality mainstream as normal. So your best bet is to do exactly that: have a diversity of characters and show it all as perfectly normal. Most people don't talk about other people's trans/cis status unless there's a specific reason for it. Sexual orientation is a bit different because it is totally normal to talk about dating or relationships or family and, given that our language is gendered, this will come out, so to speak. With non-binary, the issue again is pronouns.  You can't tell by looking at someone if they're non-binary since many such folks choose to present as male or female (or just do naturally) and many androgynous-appearing folks identify as male or female. Overall though, once people get over the ""shock"" and get used to the pronouns, names, etc, it's all just part of everyday life.  If you find your characters having long philosophical discussions about gender and sexuality, something's not very realistic (or they're college students ). Talk about their days matter of fact.  A transwoman early in the transition process might be shaving both legs and chin.  A transman might get his period.  Trans and non-binary folks are likely to be misgendered multiple times over the course of a week (maybe even a day) and this and other micro-aggressions (even times when it's completely accidental) will wear your characters down. There will be a few outright cases of bigotry, maybe even violence.  They aren't likely to come often, but they are profound enough that occasional is enough to leave scars. If your world doesn't have these sorts of bigotries, awesome.  Focus on the matter of fact stuff.  Talk about same-sex marriage with the same detached description as you would talking about opposite-race marriage.  It just is. There are some stereotypes to watch out for and your best way to do that is to get sensitivity readers once you've finished the book (or at least a few scenes with those characters).  Also talk to your friends who identify in those categories and go out of your way to meet more.  The more people you know who are any given example of X, the more you'll be able to suss out what's more or less common in that group of people and what's a stereotype. A book I read recently that handles 4 different genders really well is Temper."
How can my story take place on Earth without referring to our existing cities and countries?,"This is not uncommon. When writers want to refer to real people, places or events, but they don't want to stick to the facts, they just rename them. Most readers adjust pretty easily. This is particularly true if the genre is Science Fiction, where it's easy enough to assume an Earthlike planet, or an alternate reality, even when that isn't spelled out. In effect, the genre is doing a lot of the heavy lifting for you --anyone who is widely read in SF will have encountered this technique before. However, you're headed for trouble if you think this is the easy way out. If you're not putting the prep time in doing research on the real locations, you had better be doing some equivalent world-building work to fill in those same kinds of details.  Otherwise your settings will seem thin and unconvincing."
Can I have a non-living thing with its own perspective?,"This is a scattershot answer because I'm a washed up literature student. I just finished reading Ann Leckie's The Raven Tower, which is entirely narrated by a rock. The fact that a rock is narrating the story is gradually revealed, and its unusual perspective builds some anticipation. I also recall a chapter of Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow is narrated from the perspective of Byron the Bulb, a sentient lightbulb. Actually, the novel includes many unusual perspectives such as an octopus and an escaped dog subjected to Pavlovian experiments."
How to overcome the fact that I can't write long stories?,"I've been there myself, stuck trying to work out how to make things flow in a larger context, but just feeling like I can't pull it off. It's frustrating all around, but I can at least tell you what I did to get over it. It be of some help. That being said, all or none of this advice can work for you... well except for the first one. Keep trying to write long stories, it will help above everything else."
avoiding making all your characters sound the same,"On top of what others gave as excellent advices on getting ""in the mind of a character"" let me add a few crutchy ""dialects"" you can give your characters. You should develop more original and closer to ""generic"" styles for the main cast, but these are very nice to give some secondary characters some depth and character at low cost."
Should I write my story if I haven't established a plot?,"Should I write my story if I haven't established a plot? Discovery writers, like myself, ""discover"" their characters and their plot as they go along; it is not uncommon for them to be more than half way through the book, or even two-thirds of the way, before they actually realize what the plot is going to be. The way you approach this is closely related to the Three Act Structure [3AS] (or four acts, as the 3AS often morphs into).  The 3AS divides the story with FIVE distinct turning points; seen here (from the link to TV Tropes) occurring at more or less regular intervals within the story: Incitement, Plot Point #1, Setback, Plot Point #2, Climax. These produce six story segments. However, all of these are actually plot points, but you don't have to know them up front. This is just how your story is going to turn out. Because these phases are not some rules that all authors and publishers and readers and TV and movie viewers have just somehow agreed upon without your knowledge: These are derived from the analysis of thousands of successful stories, and finding out that most (not all) follow roughly this pattern and timing (relative to the entire story length). The way you use this as a discovery writer is simple: What you need is not a plot, but a character (or a few) and a big problem. Act I is the first 25% of the book. (all these percentages can vary by 5% or so and still be considered the 3AS). This is the ""Normal World"" of the MC. In the first half of this, (1/8 of the story) we have the ""Completely Normal World"", up to what is called the ""Incitement"" in the picture. That ""Incitement"" point is when, for the MC, the big problem begins (whether they realize it or not). Note the big problem can be anything that is going to upset the MC's normal world; in a love story this may be meeting her future spouse; in another it can be witnessing a crime, learning of a loved one's illness, the car breaking down in the middle of nowhere with no cell service, etc. If you already have a rough plot that's fine, you can work with it. It too must have an incitement; so figure out what that is. But, for a discovery writer, the idea is imagine a character, and her normal world, and what her big problem is going to be. Then you can write the first 1/8 of your story; because this is 100% introduction to your character and world, as we follow her through her completely normal life. Now, to be NOT BORING, typically what we do is give the MC some conflicts to settle in this time, mini-problems we have to solve that may or may not be connected to the inciting incident. Anything from waking up late due to a power failure, or she risked taking her morning run under cloudy skies and got caught in a downpour. Completely Normal World problems. All designed to show us who the MC is, her personality, her strengths (she should be expert on at least one front that will matter), her weaknesses (she should be terrible on at least one front that will matter), her friends, possibly her enemies (stories can be told without enemies), and so on. You don't have to be short, in a 100,000 word novel (at 250 words per page) this is 12,500 words, this first eighth is 50 pages, and you have another 50 pages before we leave the Normal World. Plot Point #1 (at 25%) is when the inciting incident has escalated to the point the MC can no longer continue her normal life and worrying about mundane day-to-day problems at home, with her love life, or children, or job, or friends: She must leave that behind (physically or metaphorically) and start actively working on her big problem. As a Discovery writer, you can get this far without really knowing how the story will end; what you should have learned for this first 25% is your MC, and what you have designed is a character with a mind of her own, values and talents and some moral setting. Now true, you have that Big Problem and it is getting worse, so at the 25% mark she decides she has to do something about it. This is the entry to Act IIa, and the second 25% (which will bring us to the middle point, SetBack). I call it Act IIa, because it feels different than Act IIb! Often we can see this 25% of the story as a Reactive phase, the MC's initial attempts to deal with her Big Problem by addressing symptoms, or pretending the problem doesn't exist (like a disease perhaps) and hoping it goes away, or she tries to find an easy way around it, or her naive attempt to negotiate her way out or appease her enemy backfires. Somehow she is trying, and failing. Often she tries several things in this second 25%, and they all fail or make the problem worse. Act IIa is also something you can write without exactly knowing the plot, just let go of the reins on your character and let her do what she (with her personality, talents and weaknesses) will most likely do. That gets you halfway through your book. Now, at the beginning of Act IIb when everything has failed, you are at 50% and it is the time to start thinking about the Climax, at around 87.5%. How is this going to end? How will she eventually prevail over her Big Problem? You need to come up with this in some detail (just notes, don't actually write it because it may change a lot), it must be consistent with who she is, and consistent with what has happened in Act IIa, to get her to her setback. This takes some problem solving imagination, but often the big problem is not what it SEEMS to be, or people are not who she assumed they were: They have secrets, and secret motivations. That is often the reason her attempts in Act IIa failed, because from the Incitement to the Setback, she thought the problem was one thing, and it turns out to be the other. If you can't do that on the fly, then before you start writing, imagine how the real big problem could manifest itself as a different kind of problem, so her initial attempts fail, for trying to solve the wrong problem. In Act IIb, instead of being reactive, she enters a more proactive state. The turning point at 50%, the setback, leads to a reassessment of what she is doing. She becomes more intentional about probing and understanding the big problem, and taking steps based on that understanding. e.g. Running away from the villain won't work, she must find a weakness, figure out how the villain keeps finding her, etc. in Act IIb, this intentional confrontation (with the problem, not necessarily the villain, must have its own conflicts and may have a setback or two of its own, experiments she tries that go wrong, but it leads to an understanding of HOW to defeat the problem: That is Plot Point #2, at the 75% mark. Now at 75%, she has in hand the tools, attitudes, knowledge and allies she needs, to bet it all and succeed or fail. Implementing this final plan leads to the fifth turning point, Climax, where she wins (or wins enough) to end the villain, or at least thwart them or send them running, or have them arrested, or whatever. Usually the bet pays off (unless you write a tragedy). The last section (eighth) is steadily reducing action, explanation and cleaning up, and basically a return to her normal world (or her new normal; as we'd see in a romance). As a Discovery Writer, you don't have to know all these things up front to start, you don't need a plot outline. You just need a sense of how much you are writing (look at your page count or word count) and where you should BE in the story, vis a vis the six basic sections. Somewhere between the 25% mark and the 50% mark, you should be thinking of formulating a plausible ending for the story. I do that, and as I am writing along, if I write a scene that would make that plausible ending impossible (or stupid, or trite, or cliché) then I have to delete it, or come up with a different ending that is at least as good, and hopefully better. I often hit 3 or 4 endings while writing a book; each better (in my mind) than the last. A plot is planning your exact route from A to B. Knowing the ending is like knowing where the end point is, and like a compass direction it keeps your story on course, but you don't have to know every step of the way exactly how you are going to get there. I am a discovery writer because early on (decades ago), I tried to be a plotter, and although I liked my plots, I was bored writing the stories. It felt like a job, all the creative work (to me) was over, and my characters ""wanted"" to do things off-plot. Not letting them made them feel forced and cardboard-y. If you feel like your characters take on a life of their own, then you are suited to discovery writing. All you need to start is a character with personality, a setting you want her in, and you can start writing. That can help you find her big problem (or maybe you already knew that), and get you through each of these six sections; inventing the ""plot"" as you see / feel you are getting close to one of these five turning points."
"Is it so bad to end up with a ""done before"" plot?","Everything has been done before. Seriously. I've taken two Ancient Literature courses and it's amazing how many plots are basically recycled versions of older plots. Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Twilight, Harry Potter - their plots all model older books and plays from hundreds of years ago. Even parts of the Bible are found in manuscripts that predate Christianity by many many years. As long as the plot isn't a carbon copy of another book, you're pretty much good to go."
Characters that take on a life of their own,"Taking a life of their own is exactly what your characters should be doing. They should have enough of a ""character"" that a reader can predict how they would act in a given situation. That's what makes the characters ""come alive"" for the reader. Consequently, a reader can easily spot when a character is acting ""out of character"". And it is extremely jarring. When I read such passages, I feel the author forced the character to do something they never would. From this moment on, as far as I'm concerned, the story lacks integrity, I have lost my trust in the writer, I no longer enjoy the story. So how do you proceed? You've got two choices. Most likely you'd be using some mix of the two, that would eventually satisfy you. Most importantly, however, Don't bludgeon your character into acting ""out of character"". Don't make them fall in love with a person they'd never fall for, don't make them say things they never would - keep the truth of who the character is."
How to write realistic female dialogue,"First of all, thinking of some conversations as solely the domain of women and some as solely the domain of men is not going to get you anywhere.  For example I know of many female computer programmers, women in a male-dominated career field, who can talk circles around most guys when it comes to discussing computer hardware.  I know men who enjoy sharing favorite recipes and guys who look at the Ralph Lauren lookbook for women in order to find nice fashions for their wives and can talk circles around some fashion-averse women when it comes to cuts of shirts. Women who are in the middle of a war will talk about war.  Women who can practice magic or are affected by it will most definitely talk about magic - if you've been reading fantasy and haven't come across women talking about magic you've been reading a very, very narrow selection.  If there's a monster prowling around town you can bet your bottom dollar women will talk about it as much as men.  Some women may even talk about the best way to kill it just as some men will try to avoid the subject out of sheer fear. If your characters talk just like you, the problem isn't the gender.  I bet the men all talk just like you as well.  The issue is fully realizing your characters as other than you.  For that read the answers on Getting inside someone else's head.  Sure, women can provide a perspective that men don't, but their perspective is informed by their background, experiences, friendships, and interests.  These may be influenced by their sex, but their sex is not the sum total of these things! For more on specifically thinking in terms of a different gender than yours, see pitfalls of writing  a main character of different gender to the author and the opposite sex in first person.    But my best piece of advice is to focus less on the fact that your characters are female and focus on fleshing out the personhood of all your characters."
Should I describe a person or a room first?,"Setting is character. Where you meet someone tells you something about them. It may tell you a lot or it may tell you a little. It may tell you the most significant thing you need to know about them or it may tell you trivial things about them.  It is either the space they designed or the space they chose (unless they are a prisoner) and so it tells you something about who they are (especially if they are a prisoner). Unless particular features matter for the physical action of the scene, therefore, the place is about who the people are and when it comes to describing people you choose the most telling details, the details, whether of location or appearance that will call them to life most readily.  I walked through the swinging half doors of the saloon, pausing to let my eyes adjust from the harsh desert glare to the gloom within. The piano player stopped playing mid phrase. The man stood at the bar, one foot on the brass rail, a half bottle of whiskey on the bar beside him.  At this point you have already seen the spurs, the six shooters, and the ten gallon hats. (At least, I hope you have.) A man in this place, our cultural conditioning tells us, can only be one sort of man.  So, give the most telling details first. If the most telling details are setting, give those first. If the most telling details are character, give those first.  If the physical details of a scene matter for an action sequence, try to establish them earlier in the novel. If you are leading up to an action scene your story should be in a state of tension and you probably don't want to pause at that point to set up trapdoors and chandeliers to swing on. Bernard Cornwell calls this putting doors in walls. If your hero is going to escape from a dire situation on page 96 by going through a door in an ally, he must already have gone through that door for some other reason on page 35, or the reader is going to feel cheated. So when you come to page 96 and need that door, go back to page 35 and introduce it there.  So, if you are doing scene setting for an action scene, describe the setting first, but long before, not immediately before. "
"Worth writing, if end is obvious","Just because The Crunch happens doesn't mean that your protagonists all lose. Yes, the obvious antagonist is The Crunch. But is that all your heroes are fighting? Is that all they're striving for?  All your heroes are facing imminent doom. That does things to people. They may lose faith, or gain it (the religious folks — and they can have diverse reactions). People cling to routines (the boss) or descend into hysterical nihilism (the maniac).  You don't have A Plot as much as A Series of Character Arcs. Those individual conflicts are interesting and worth exploring. The Series of Arcs is the point of your story, not the Inevitable Crunch. Also, who says The Crunch has to kill everyone? Maybe you have a side thread of a ship rushing to save everyone, or somehow divert The Crunch, or The Crunch is actually a way to pass into another universe. et cetera.

"Should one use the legal ""shall"" in requirements documents and specification documents?","Option 1: use RFC 2119 According to RFC 2119: This is also the most current use of the word ""shall"" from what I've seen in the requirements. Option 2: use present tense If the requirements are mostly mandatory, you may also want to formulate the requirements in present tense, without ""must"", ""shall"" or other keywords. Example: The undo history is preserved when the application is closed. The requirement clearly states, by its present tense, that the requirement is mandatory. The history should be preserved, and if it's not, the software fails to pass this requirement. Such way of writing the requirements allows them to be slightly more readable, without losing their mandatory property. Option 3: use your own conventions Note that you may define your own terminology in the documents you write. That's why most documentation starts by defining the terms, including ""must"", ""can"", etc. For example, HTTP specification contains such section: 1.2 Requirements. The key words ""MUST"", ""MUST NOT"", ""REQUIRED"", ""SHALL"", ""SHALL NOT"", ""SHOULD"", ""SHOULD NOT"", ""RECOMMENDED"", ""MAY"", and ""OPTIONAL"" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [34]. An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements for the protocols it implements. An implementation that satisfies all the MUST or REQUIRED level and all the SHOULD level requirements for its protocols is said to be ""unconditionally compliant""; one that satisfies all the MUST level requirements but not all the SHOULD level requirements for its protocols is said to be ""conditionally compliant."" Using a convention which differs a lot from the generally accepted practice is still a bad idea, and must be done only if you have serious reasons to do it."
