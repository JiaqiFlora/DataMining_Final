"If a company agrees to pay travel cost for a job interview, is the promise binding and enforceable?","This aspect (and many others) of contract law is applicable in the US and various countries of the EU. can they renege after the candidate has begun their journey, thus
saddling the candidate with the travel cost? No. The company would incur breach of contract. There is no need for a formal contract. The candidate only needs to prove that the company agreed (in writing, orally or clearly through its conduct) to cover or reimburse those expenses and that this elicited a meeting of the minds. The agreement would be void if the candidate incurred the expenses despite knowing (via timely notice) that the company changed its mind. Likewise, if the candidate lied on his CV, the contract (here, the company's agreement to cover the expenses) would be voidable by the company, since the candidate's intentional misrepresentations preclude the aforementioned condition of meeting of the minds. --Edited on 1/18/2019 to add ...-- Per suggestion by @KRyan, the aspect of void or voidable contract is expanded. But first, two disclaimers are pertinent: The_Sympathizer commented: can the contract be voided on the spot like that without first
proving in court? As it seems like it grants a rather ""vigilante""
justice power that is open to abuse, since effectively the
""punishment"" (cancellation of the flight and thus inducing a rather
serious physical situation) is administered before any due process has
been afforded the one accused. Yes, it can be voided on the spot (aka sua sponte). ""Vigilante"" justice denotes a self-attribution of punitive powers that exclusively belong to the state/government/court, whereas a party's voiding of a contract is the act of foreclosing his losses/exposures with respect to a contract that de facto never existed (such as when that contract was induced by fraud). I agree that unfortunately that is open to abuse: As a pretext to actually incur breach of contract, a company might allege that the contract was void. That is why (if taken to court) it will be the company's burden to prove that (1) it reasonably relied upon a candidate's representations (2) which were significant and blatantly false (3) given the candidate's knowledge that his lies contravened the job's core requirements. That can be quite burdensome. For instance, is the company handing out airfares without first conducting some competent corroborations about the candidate's credentials/skills? If so, one can hardly concede the company's allegation of reasonable reliance. The resulting finding would be that the contract was not voidable by the company, and thus that it is liable for breach of contract. Also, belatedly ""informing"" the stranded candidate that the company ""is going in a different direction"" falls short of evidencing that the contract was voidable. That applies even if the candidate performed very poorly in the interview or screening process. Given the hardship imposed on a stranded candidate, a company has to be morally and legally very judicious about its method and timing for ""going in a different direction"". But absent any representations or [company's] bylaws to the contrary, a company generally does not have the obligation to afford due process to a candidate. The court is the entity with an obligation to enforce due process as provided by law (although many of us in the U.S. have repeatedly experienced the courts' disavowal of due process). --End of edit on 1/19/2019-- a binding agreement requires both sides to give something Here, the candidate's consideration is his time and effort to accommodate the company's interest in assessing the candidate's profile at a location that is convenient to the company."
A student slipped a drug into my coffee — what are the legal ramifications of this situation?,"If the pill contained a harmful or noxious substance, this is battery, which is a crime in Lousiana (""the intentional administration of a poison or other noxious liquid or substance to another""). There is a specific crime in LA, battery of a teacher, which is dealt with somewhat more severely than non-teacher battery. It is not a crime to observe a crime being committed and not warn the victim, but it is a crime to aid the commission of the crime (for example to help the perp remove the lid, to supply the drug). Under section Title 17, a teacher battered by a student can file a school-system internal complaint which may lead to the student being expelled (this is ultimately covered by district-specific procedure). This is independent of criminal charges."
Can a public school in the USA force a 14yr old to create a Twitter account for a passing grade?,"You say: the school expects him to create a public Twitter account, with his real information, in order to promote the program & the results of the program.  This is a cut-and-dried case of compelled speech. Your son is being required to say certain things in public in order to pass this course. The Supreme Court has decided that students do not ""shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate"". This is subject to the legitimate interests of the school, but it is hard to see how compelled speech on Twitter can be defended as a legitimate interest. You also say this is to ""promote the program and the results of the program"". It sounds like the students are being required to say certain things about the course. If your son were to create the account and then post only material critical of the school, such as complaints about compelled speech, would that result in a passing grade? It sounds like it might be an issue. Compelled speech at school was considered by the Supreme Court in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943), which is the case about students being required to salute the flag. They found that requiring students to salute the flag was unconstitutional. Public education, according to the Court, should “not strangle the free mind at its source [or] teach youth to discount important principles of our government as mere platitudes.” Instead, education should enable students to make informed choices about what to believe.  From the judgement itself: the refusal of these persons to participate in the ceremony does not interfere with or deny rights of others to do so. Nor is there any question in this case that their behavior is peaceable and orderly. The sole conflict is between authority and rights of the individual. That is very much the case here. Your son's refusal to make the required public speech is not causing any difficulty for the school authorities. In conclusion, your son has made a decision not to create a Twitter account under his own name and say certain things within that account. This is entirely his constitutional right. You might consider contacting the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who have a history of engaging in cases like this. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) might also be interested. Edit: Zack Lipton in comments below makes the point that much student work can be considered a kind of compelled speech (e.g. ""Write an essay on Hamlet"" or ""Submit an entry to this poetry competition"") and asks how this is different. Its a good question, and I have to say it does suggest that there is a difference of degree rather than kind. However I would argue that posting to an international forum widely used by adults is a different matter to a school assembly, or even a national essay competition. It would also depend a great deal on what has to be posted to get a passing grade."
Who is supposed to teach the law to the citizens?,"The answer from @user6726 is a good one. But, I'd like to add to it by pointing out that the body of law applicable to an individual is usually much, much smaller than the entire body of law. I'm a lawyer who has been in private practice for almost 25 years with an extremely diverse practice compared to the average lawyer, and I've never even looked at perhaps 80% of the laws on the books in the states where I practice, and even less elsewhere. By statutory and regulatory volume, the vast majority of statutory and regulatory law is applicable to either the internal operations of government, or to the way in which regulated industries and business transactions are conducted. And, it is customary for people in situations in all of those situations to have professional intermediaries such as lawyers, realtors, brokers, architects, general contractors, accountants, tax preparers, and consultants to assist them in complying. Some of the more technical areas encountered by average people (e.g. traffic laws) are areas in which training is mandated before you can get a driver's license. Many other areas of occupational and industry regulations are similarly distinguished by having a licensing requirement to make sure that everyone involved knows that a new body of law applies to them. You only need to know about nuclear power plant regulations, for example, if you build a nuclear power plant and will soon learn if you try to do so that you need a license to do that. Even within areas of law that have broad applicability like tax law and criminal law, a lot of the law has only narrow application. For example, most people don't need to know the rules for determining the taxable income of a life insurance company, or the criminal laws pertaining to people who have security clearances to review top secret national security information. The body of ""private law"" governing the rights of individuals vis-a-vis other private individuals, and of criminal law that an ordinary person is in a position to violate, is very modest. And much of the law in this area is devoted to determining how serious an offense is and what the penalty should be, and what law enforcement is allowed to do in order to investigate these violations, and not to what is legal and illegal in some regard. For example, intentionally, recklessly or negligently offensively touching or causing injury to someone else's property or person, is almost always either a crime and/or a civil wrong called a tort for which you can be sued. Some versions of this conduct are more serious (e.g. rape or murder), some are less serious (e.g. pinching someone on Saint Patrick's Day for not wearing green). But the overriding concept, once you strip away the details, is pretty simple. Likewise, damaging or taking property that isn't yours, intentionally, recklessly or negligently, is almost always either a crime and/or a civil wrong called a tort for which you can be sued. Add the notion that you have to honor your promises in most circumstances and shouldn't lie or deceive in most circumstances, you have to follow authoritative signs and directions from legal authorities, and you have to figure out if you owe income taxes or not each year with professional help, if necessary, and you are well on your way to knowing what you need to know to obey the law. Even within ""private law"" there are lots of areas like patent law, product liability law, and oil and gas property rights, that the average person doesn't need to know. Knowing that if you are injured by someone else you should think about talking to a lawyer is usually good enough. These bare bones may prevent you from doing things that are legal close to the boundaries of what is allowed sometimes, but having standards higher than the bare legal minimum is rarely a deep impediment to living a decent life. It should also be enough to let you have some intuition that you are in a gray area and need to confer if you aren't sure if something is illegal or not. There are more complicated areas that many average individuals do have to deal with to some extent. The law governing privacy, copyright and speech comes to mind, for example. But, you can go a very long way on some very basic principles. Most law that applies to ordinary people flows from simple moral intuition."
"I want to leave Islam, but they would execute and kill me. What do I do?","Legally speaking, very many nations grant asylum, and religious persecution is one of the most basic grounds for granting asylum, following the 1951 Refugee Convention. This newspaper article compares asylum statistics in Ireland versus other parts of Europe. The Irish immigration authorities spell out the details for an asylum application. Note that you must already be in Ireland, to apply for asylum in Ireland (you should apply when you enter the country). One could also apply to Norway (almost an English-speaking country), but again you have to be in Norway to do so. There is a generic solution to the ""what if I'm not in country"" problem via the UNHCR, which can propose resettlement into various countries.  I need to add that getting a visitor's visa from certain countries can be extremely difficult. To take an example, Norway (which is fairly open to refugees) is pretty up-front on the chances of getting a visa, based on country. To take a random example, they are not very optimistic about visitor's visas from Iran, and they say ""we consider how probable it is that you will return to your home country or the country you live in when the visit is over. We consider the situation in your country and your own situation"", ""If we believe that it is unlikely that you will return, your application will normally be rejected"" and ""If you plan to visit Norway as a tourist, you will normally not be granted a visa"". This is the fundamental problem that refugees face, the problem of getting there. One country that allows visa-free admission from Iran is Turkey. This guide (which is in Farsi so I can't comment on) provides practical information on the UNHCR asylum process ""the political asylum process for Iranians in Turkey"": that may indicate that apostasy is a different matter. Other evidence suggests that this option is worse than staying put. Only for the sake of discussion, Svalbard is a theoretical possibility. Svalbard (next to the North Pole) is part of Norway, but Norway treats it as being somewhat outside of Norway. It is outside the Schengen visa area, and it is a visa-free zone, meaning that nobody requires a visa to visit or live there. This is due to the Svalbard Treaty whereby Norwegians and treaty nationals have equal rights to the islands, and while most nations are not treaty signatories, it has been policy to extend those rights to everybody. The Governor does have the power to expel anyone who is a burden on local society (e.g. unemployable). Normally one would have to get a Schengen area visa to get there, which would be an obstacle, but it is apparently possible to get a same-day visa-free transit at Oslo Airport, if travelling non-stop to Svalbard (I cannot find a definitive policy statement on this matter, but I also am not sure where exactly to look). There are some air routes from outside Schengen where the first Schengen stop is Oslo. The Governor's office gives appropriate warnings about local problems (ridiculous prices, housing shortage, work shortage, more polar bears than people, really cold)."
Stealing my own property back?,"No. This would not be illegal.  You are not trespassing or breaking and entering since you have permission to be on the premises, and you are the rightful owner of the guitar so you are not depriving him of property that belongs to him. If you did this with the assistance of a law enforcement officer, rather than Bob's family, without a court order describing the property to be retrieved, this would be called a ""civil assist"". If the guitar were collateral for a loan, it would be a self-help ""repossession"" (a.k.a. ""repo"") authorized by the Uniform Commercial Code if it could be accomplished without a breach of the peace, and it would not require a court order. If you did this pursuant to a court order the case you brought to retrieve the guitar would be called a ""replevin action"" and you would also need to obtain a ""writ of assistance"" to authorize a trespass in the presence of law enforcement to retrieve the guitar. Also, Bob would still be be guilty of the crime of theft of the guitar, even though you got it back, because he took it with an intent to permanently deprive you, its owner, of the property that belongs to you. You could also probably sue him for conversion or ""civil theft"" in some jurisdictions, but your damages would be nominal except for punitive or statutory damages under a civil theft statute, because you ultimately got the guitar back, and so you suffered only minimal economic harm."
"If I don't want to patent something, what can I do to ensure the patent office doesn't unintentionally grant the patent to someone else?","There is a history of ""giving away patents"", which allows the original grantor to foster innovation instead of stifle it. Here are some examples: The grant of a patent provides the ability for the grantor to pursue infringement lawsuits against companies or individuals, but it does not obligate them to do so. You can give away your patent, open it up to broad licensing, or just openly state that you will not enforce any action related to the lawsuit similar to how Tesla did it. "
"ASKED: Why do many ""No Trespassing"" signs say ""POSTED""?","""Posted"" is a term of art in trespass law, specifically meaning that signs forbidding entry have been placed at the borders of a parcel. The page ""Properly posted definition"" from Law Insider reads: Properly posted means that signs prohibiting trespass—or bright yellow, bright orange or fluorescent paint—are clearly displayed at all corners, on fishing streams crossing property lines, and on roads, gates and rights-of-way entering the land. Or, they are displayed in a manner that is visible to a person in the area. The entry ""Posting"" in the ""Legal"" section of The Free Dictionary reads: Posting
In connection with Trespass statutes, the act of placing or affixing signs on private property in a manner to give notice of the trespass. The page ""The Importance of Posting Property Signs"" reads in relevant part: Why should you use posted signs on property?  Posting property is a great way to let someone know they have entered private land and they might not be welcome.  Using posted signs  not only  indicates trespassing but also can specify restricted activities.  Signs are good for both rural and urban settings as a way to protect owners and their property. ... Most states have specific rules for property signs that must be followed. Some rules may include: Some states allow the use of spray paint to mark trees and fences in lieu of a sign. Purple paint is frequently used because it stands out against common natural colors. However, if a trespasser is unaware of this marking method, it would be more effective to use a sign. Check local and state laws to confirm what is needed to properly post legally in your area. Several US states use the term ""Posted"" in their laws on trespass, and provide that the presence of the word ""posted"" on a sign has special significance. maryland Maryland Criminal Law Code § 6-402 (2017) provides that: (a) Prohibited. -- A person may not enter or trespass on property that is posted conspicuously against trespass by: (a) (1) signs placed where they reasonably may be seen; or (a) (2) paint marks that:
(a) (2) (i) conform with regulations that the Department of Natural Resources adopts under § 5-209 of the Natural Resources Article; and
(a) (2) (ii) are made on trees or posts that are located: (a) (2) (ii) 1. at each road entrance to the property; and
(a) (2) (ii) 2. adjacent to public roadways, public waterways, and other land adjoining the property. The law firm page  ""Trespassing Laws in Maryland"" reads in relevant part: Posted Property Trespass
A person is not allowed to enter onto property that is posted conspicuously against trespassing. That posting can come in the form of signs that are placed where they can be reasonably seen or by paint marks on trees or posts at the entrances and land adjacent to the property. new-york-state The page ""Posting Your Land"" from the NY Dept of Environmental Conservation reads in relevant part: Trespassing Trespassing is illegal even on unposted property. Instead of posting, a landowner or other authorized person may issue written notice to another individual informing them that they are prohibited from entering the property. The notice must contain a description of the property, what restrictions apply (hunting, fishing, trapping) and the person or persons prohibited from entry. It should be delivered by certified mail or other processes (ex: legal notice in newspaper) to prove that the person was served. At any time, anyone by the landowner, occupant, or other authorized person to leave the premises (posted or not), must do so immediately. Trespassing on areas posted against trespass pursuant to the Environmental Conservation Law is punishable by a fine up to $250 and/or up to 15 days in jail. It is a defense to this type of trespass that there are not signs posted instructing people to stay off the property. It may also be a defense that any signs posted in the area are not in the proper place to be easily seen by visitors to the property. Signage Details Hardware and farm supply stores frequently carry signs for posting. Customized signs may also be obtained from local printers. DEC doesn't provide signs to private landowners unless the landowner is a cooperator under the Fish and Wildlife Management Act. In this case, they will be provided with ""Safety Zone"" signs. Cooperators provide free public access to most of their property in a large cooperative hunting/fishing area. Signs must be a minimum of 11 inches by 11 inches. They also must bear the name and address of the owner, lawful occupant or other person or organization authorized to post the area. The sign must bear a conspicuous statement which shall either consist of the word ""POSTED"" or warn against entry for specified purposes or all purposes without the consent of the person whose name appears on the sign. These words must cover a minimum space of 80 square inches (about 9 by 9 inches) of the sign. (There is a very similar image included in the Wikipedia article ""Trespass"".) california In California ""Posted property"" is the legal term for property where suitable signs have been placed along the boundary or near it, to informa people tht trespassing is forbidden. But it appears that in CA the word ""Posted"" need not appear on such signs, the words ""No Trespassing"" being sufficient. California also makes it a misdemeanor (Under section 602) to enter into or remain on property of another, without any legal right to be there, if one is instructed not to enter, or to leave, but such proeprty is not considered ""posted"". California Penal Code section 553 provides that: he following definitions apply to this article only: (a) “Sign” means a sign not less than one (1) square foot in area and upon which in letters not less than two inches in height appear the words “trespassing-loitering forbidden by law,” or words describing the use of the property followed by the words “no trespassing.” (b) “Posted property” means any property specified in Section 554 which is posted in a manner provided in Section 554.1 . (c) “Posted boundary” means a line running from sign to sign and such line need not conform to the legal boundary or legal description of any lot, parcel, or acreage of land, but only the area within the posted boundary shall constitute posted property, except as otherwise provided in subdivision (e) of Section 554.1 . California Penal Code section 554 provides in relevant part that: Any property, except that portion of such property to which the general public is accorded access, may be posted against trespassing and loitering in the manner provided in Section 554.1 , and thereby become posted property subject to the provisions of this article applicable to posted property, if such property consists of, or is used, or is designed to be used, for any one or more of the following: ... California Penal Code section 554.1 provides that: Any property described in Section 554 may be posted against trespassing and loitering in the following manner: (a) If it is not enclosed within a fence and if it is of an area not exceeding one (1) acre and has no lineal dimension exceeding one (1) mile, by posting signs at each corner of the area and at each entrance. (b) If it is not enclosed within a fence, and if it is of an area exceeding one (1) acre, or contains any lineal dimension exceeding one (1) mile, by posting signs along or near the exterior boundaries of the area at intervals of not more than 600 feet, and also at each corner, and, if such property has a definite entrance or entrances, at each such entrance. (c) If it is enclosed within a fence and if it is of an area not exceeding one (1) acre, and has no lineal dimension exceeding one (1) mile, by posting signs at each corner of such fence and at each entrance. (d) If it is enclosed within a fence and if it is of an area exceeding one (1) acre, or has any lineal dimension exceeding one (1) mile, by posting signs on, or along the line of, such fence at intervals of not more than 600 feet, and also at each corner and at each entrance. (e) If it consists of poles or towers or appurtenant structures for the suspension of wires or other conductors for conveying electricity or telegraphic or telephonic messages or of towers or derricks for the production of oil or gas, by affixing a sign upon one or more sides of such poles, towers, or derricks, but such posting shall render only the pole, tower, derrick, or appurtenant structure posted property. California Penal Code section 555 provides that: It is unlawful to enter or remain upon any posted property without the written permission of the owner, tenant, or occupant in legal possession or control thereof.  Every person who enters or remains upon posted property without such written permission is guilty of a separate offense for each day during any portion of which he enters or remains upon such posted property."
Why shouldn't a bank robbery without threats be legal?,"As a concrete example, consider Missouri v. Coleman, where Coleman handed a teller a plastic bag and said ""I need you to do me a favor. Put the money in this bag"", and later as the manager approached, said ""Ma'am, stop where you are and don't move any farther"". Coleman was convicted of second degree robbery: but the appeals court found that he had not acted forcibly, so his conviction was overturned. Instead, the court entered a conviction for the lesser offense of stealing which is when one Appropriates property or services of another with the purpose to
  deprive him or her thereof, either without his or her consent or by
  means of deceit or coercion The act may also be termed ""theft"", as in Washington state. The thief is acting deceptively and thereby gaining control over property."
On what basis might Trump's executive order on immigration be illegal?,"A few possible reasons it could be illegal (on an issue spotting basis, not a careful analysis of each possible reason): The EO is intended to discriminate on the basis of religion and in fact does so in violation of the 1st Amendment to the United States Constitution. The EO is intended to unlawfully discriminate based upon race or ethnicity in violation of U.S. statutes or the 14th Amendment. The EO was adopted without observing the notice and hearing requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. The EO took effect prematurely because it was not duly published in the Federal Register for the time period required by law, or was otherwise insufficiently promulgated. The EO repeals other regulations currently in force in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act. The EO improperly disturbs the vested, albeit limited, rights of existing visa holders (or visa applicants) without due process of law, and/or in violation of unenumerated 10th Amendment rights. Refugee visa applicants under an already adopted regulation are entitled to an individualized consideration of their application as a matter of due process and the EO amounts to an ex post facto law as applied to people already in the application process under that regulation. The EO improperly deprives people who purchased non-refundable plane tickets in reasonable reliance of their visa rights which were not revocable under any law in place at the time those tickets were purchased of a property right in those plane tickets without compensation or due process of law under the 5th Amendment. The EO is void for vagueness as the ambiguities in its drafting makes it impossible to determine who is and is not affected by the EO and in what manner. There is a conflict in the immigration statutes between statutory provisions and treaty obligations related to refugees, and the regulation implementing a particular section of the immigration law's grant of regulatory authority, and the refugee protections must prevail. A person claiming to be a refugee has a due process right to individualized consideration of their circumstances, either by statute, by treaty, or under the constitution, which the EO does not respect. The treatment of dual citizens under the EO either is contrary to statutory immigration law or to a treaty or to the U.S. Constitution and customary international law. The EO violates one or more treaties between affected countries and the United States regarding immigration. The scope and terms of the EO exceed the authority granted to the President by the section of the immigration statutes relied upon for authority to pass the EO. The administration failed to articulate a rational basis for distinguishing between nations included in the ban and nations not included in support of the EO as required by the Administrative Procedures Act. There is no rational basis for distinguishing between nations included in the ban and nations not included as required by the U.S. Constitution (a much weaker test since it allows for post hoc rationalizations). Authority to implement the relevant section of the immigration law is vested in one or more officials at the United States Department of State, rather than the President directly, and none of those officials approved the EO. The military interpreters and their families may have a contract with the U.S. government as part of their employment that gives them a right to a visa, in which case the EO would be a law impairing contracts in violation of the U.S. Constitution, as applied to them. Some of the immigrants may need to accompany U.S. citizen children in order for the children to exercise the childrens' rights to enter the country and as applied the EO may violate the U.S. citizen childrens' rights. The CBP may be incorrectly interpreting the EO (which even the administration is not clear about) and therefore violating the law as applied because the EO does not actually authorize their action or because the way that they interpreted the EO was an abuse of their discretion. The manner in which the EO was implemented (e.g. long periods of time in handcuffs for civilians not accused of any crime and with no ability to foresee that they would be denied entry, separating young children from parents, etc.) may have been an unreasonable seizure as applied, even if detention per se was authorized. The 4th Amendment requires that searches and seizures be reasonable in the manner that they are carried out even if the search or seizure is itself authorized by law. UPDATE February 2, 2017: A federal judge in California has found that at least some of these reasons have merit and has stayed the EO and set an expedited hearing and briefing schedule on whether the injunction against the EO should remain in force. UPDATE AND EPILOGUE June 28, 2018: The final version of the ban was ultimately upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Trump v. Hawaii on June 26, 2018 in a 5-4 decision. Litigation of the version of the ban in the OP was dismissed as moot when it was withdrawn and replaced with a similar but newer version of the EO. The four justices in the dissent rely on the first reason given, as did lower courts in the case and in parallel litigation. A core distinction between the majority and the dissent is the weight given by statements made by President Trump about the policy, and how much deference to give to the government's reasons for the policy offered up in court. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who cast a deciding vote in the case, took office April 10, 2017, after this answer and the first update to this answer were written."
How would the actions of Hänsel and Gretel in the Grimm tale be interpreted in modern law?,"Assuming U.S. Jurisdiction: In the case of The People vs. Hansel and Gretel Holzfaller: Ms. Gretel Holzfaller is charged with the following: 1 Count of Murder in the First Degree (Murder of Ms. Witch Hazel) 1 Count of Grand Larceny (Theft of precious metals and jewels from Ms. Hazel) 1 Count Petty Theft (Theft of Candy) 1 Count of Vandalism  (Bite marks left in Gingerbread Masonry) 1 Count Trespassing Mr. Hansel Holzfaller is charged with the following: 1 Count of Accessory to Murder 1 Count of Grand Larceny 1 Count Petty Theft 1 Count of Vandalism 1 Count Trespassing Ms. Holzfaller has raised the Affirmative Defense of Self-Defense.   The defense is problematic on the onset as the court must consider the nature of the case.  As a Duty to Flee state, Ms. Holzfaller must show that there was no reasonable way to flee the Witch.   The court finds sufficient evidence exists, given that both defendants were detained against their will by Ms. Hazel. Next, we must consider if Ms. Hazel's actions were within her legal rights.  Common law allows citizens to make a ""Citizen's Arrest"" if they are witnesses to criminal activity and when no law officer is appointed.  Should the court find in favor of the state on this ground, then Self-Defense is not applicable as Ms. Hazel was acting within her right to hold the children for crimes committed against her. This court, however, will not find in favor of the State.  Ms. Hazel had kept the children confined to her home for sufficient time for Mr. Holzfaller to put on the substantial weight given his family's inability to provide sufficient meals for a child of his age.  Mr. Holzfaller was described as starving and lean upon his disappearance and, upon recovery of Mr. Holzfaller, contemporary media reports took note of his ""fat and plump"" appearance.  Ms. Holzfaller had similarly put on sufficient weight in this time, though not to the degree of her brother.   This amount of weight gain in a child is rather unhealthy and disturbing to consider, but more shocking to this court is that any reasonable person could consider such a duration of time a justifiable ""Citizen's Arrest"".   This is in addition to the fact that Ms. Hazel was intending to engage in the murder of the children and the consumption of them.   This court cannot find Ms. Hazel's actions reasonable or just and thus will not consider her to be affecting Citizen's arrest. While Ms. Holzfaller was not herself likely in immediate danger, she was asked to prepare a stove for her brother's imminent murder and consumption.  Self-Defense need not apply to one's own self, but can be a legitimate defense when one is defending others from becoming victims of a crime.  Furthermore, as the witch was clearly stronger than either Holzfaller's child, Ms. Holzfaller was using only the most reasonable amount of force necessary to incapacitate Ms. Hazel.   As such, this court renders the verdict of Not Guilty by means of Self-Defense to Ms. Holzfaller's charge of Murder in the First degree. With a not guilty verdict rendered, this court will dismiss the charge of Accessory to Murder against Mr. Holzfaller. We now turn to the lesser sentences of trespassing, vandalism, and petty theft.   This court must recall that at the time of the abduction, the children were both younger.  In addition, while Ms. Hazel is not able to stand trial for her alleged crimes, given the nature of the previously dismissed murders, this court must consider that the children were enticed by the house and its unusual choice of confectionery as a construction material and that this was exactly the incident Ms. Hazel intended to induce the children into committing.   This is not sufficient in and of itself to excuse the Children from their behavior and this court will not allow an excuse based solely on the fact that Ms. Hazel wanted to trap children to satisfy her unusual palate. As the children were significantly younger when they were engaged in these activities, however, we can reasonably assume that these children were below the Age of Criminal Responsibility and thus did not have the adequate mental development to know that these actions were of a criminal nature.  Thus, this court will dismiss these three charges against both defendants. Finally, on the charge of Grand Larceny, this court finds sufficient merit to go to trial.   There is no excuse for theft of property from someone, even if they were trying to eat you.  Given the nature of the case, however, this court would be satisfied with dismissing the charges if Mr. and Ms. Holzfaller returned the stolen property to the Estate of Ms. Hazel, and the estates' current custodian, Mr. William Wonka.  The Holzfaller family has stated that they believe Ms. Hazel's actions warrant punitive actions against Ms. Hazel's estate, but as this is a criminal court, we find that the property in dispute is rightfully Mr. Wonka's pending the outcome of a civil suit on the matter. Next on the Docket:  The People v. Rumpelstiltskin on 3 charges of Counterfeiting Currency. "
How can you tell if you have to follow a police officer's instructions?,"You don't know. You can't know. And you can't force the officer to tell you. As a practical matter, you have no way of knowing if you are compelled to follow an officer's order because you are being detained unless the officer volunteers that information (your detention status) which they are not compelled to disclose and have every incentive not to disclose. Consider the situation when the officer does not have reasonable suspicion do detain you. If the officer instantly informs you that you are ""free to go"" then you are likely to leave and end the encounter immediately. However, if the officer says nothing, then you might stay and inadvertently say or do something that would give the officer reasonable suspicion to detain you from that point forward. Your behavior during that detention could lead to probable cause, arrest, etc. Every officer knows they have nothing to gain by being quick to tell you you are free to go. To compound the issue, police encounters are particularly problematic because police officers have a lawful right to engage in deceptive conduct during an investigation including but not limited to lying. You, on the other hand, can be prosecuted for lying to the police conducting an investigation. (See this article for more information.) Therefore, all things considered, police encounters present a Hobson's Choice. Either comply with every order in an effort to end the encounter quickly. Or try to press the officer to determine whether you are ""being detained"" or ""free to go."" The former course of action voluntarily cedes some of your rights. The latter risks ""provoking"" the officer into making your encounter more difficult, painful or costly than it otherwise might be. That said, you are never under any obligation to consent to a warrantless search of your home or vehicle. Typically, saying, ""I do not consent to searches."" is usually sufficient if asked. Evidence obtained from warrantless searches is barred from being used at trial unless you waive this right by consenting to the search. See this question (and answers) if you are concerned about the officer falsely claiming you gave consent if you didn't. As a legal matter, talking to the police can never help your case in court. Anything you say to the police that might help your case (i.e., exculpatory) is not admissible as evidence because it's hearsay. On the other hand, anything you say to the police can and will be used against you. In fact, even if you are completely innocent of all crimes AND you are completely 100% truthful to the police, you can still give the police all they legally need to convict you of a crime simply by talking to them. Whereas, without your statement, they would not have had sufficient evidence to convict. See this Youtube video for more details and examples of how this can and does happen every day. The above analysis presents the reader with some practical concerns. You don’t want to risk being harmed by an officer in fear for his safety. You don’t want to be handcuffed and taken to the police station if you can avoid it. You must obey all unconditional commands of a peace officer. It does no harm to inform the officer that you are willing to comply with all unconditional legal commands and ask him or her if a given command is, in fact, unconditional. Some attorneys go in the opposite direction from the ""never talk to the police"" rule and advise that, say in the case of a domestic violence dispute, the best course of action is to answer police questions matter-of-factly, never lie and never admit guilt. That course of behavior can avoid a potential trip to the police station in handcuffs in the back of a police car even if you are never ultimately arrested. TL;DR: Police encounters are tricky. It's difficult to know what to do. The best course of action is to educate yourself about your rights and the law and apply judgment and common sense to guide your behavior to achieve the best outcome. I am not an attorney. I am not your attorney. This answer is not legal advice. Please consult an attorney to obtain proper legal advice."
Daughter dies at party,"We're missing a lot of facts that would help drive the analysis. The first question I'd ask was whether this was part of an actual or attempted sex offense. If that's the case, the suspect could be facing particularly serious charges. Other information is also missing, such as the drug involved, whether it's on the list of controlled substances, her knowledge of the drug, her relationship to the suspect, and so on.  Still, based on the information we've got and the inferences we can make from them, I could reasonably see the following charges being filed: Sec. 12-3. Battery.  (a) A person commits battery if he or she knowingly without legal justification by any means (1) causes bodily harm to an individual Sec. 12-3.05. Aggravated battery.

Sec. 12-5. Reckless conduct.  (a) A person commits reckless conduct when he or she, by any means lawful or unlawful, recklessly performs an act or acts that:
   (1) cause bodily harm to or endanger the safety of another person; or
   (2) cause great bodily harm or permanent disability or disfigurement to another person. Sec. 21-1. Criminal damage to property.  (a) A person commits criminal damage to property when he or she: 
   (1) knowingly damages any property of another Sec. 11-1.20. Criminal sexual assault.  (a) A person commits criminal sexual assault if that person commits an act of sexual penetration and:

Why is stealing from an employer a criminal act when stealing from an employee is a civil act?,"What do you mean by ""stealing""; this matters, because ""stealing"" often doesn't have a formal/legal definition (and when it does, it falls under your #2 point above, where the employer's action doesn't meet the definition of the forbidden act) and can describe conduct by both parties that could fall under both criminal and non-criminal remedies (i.e. civil and/or administrative action). Some examples: Employer criminal stealing: Taking an employee's property from their possession (e.g. taking cash from their wallet). Employer non-criminal stealing: Failing to pay an employee properly* (either not paying, or not paying completely, or not paying on time), unless fraud is involved, which usually involves not intending to pay the employee from the start, but that is still not necessarily theft/stealing as such, depending on how that is defined. Employee criminal stealing: Taking an employer's property from their possession (e.g. taking cash from a till) Employee non-criminal stealing: Failing to work properly (e.g. taking an unscheduled break while on the clock, essentially charging for work not done) '* Note that despite what you might think, an employee isn't exchanging labor for money; instead, they are exchanging their labor for a debt by the company, to accrue until and be paid by understood dates, i.e. payday (for example, I'm paid biweekly, so my pay accrues for a window of two weeks, and then is paid on the following Friday, so I may work the 1st through the 14th, and then be paid for those days on the 21st); By way of analogy, imagine I went to a store and pick something up, and leave the store with it. If I don't pay, its criminal theft/""stealing"". If I unknowingly pay with a bad check, I owe the store a debt, but no crime has occurred (i.e. its a civil matter). If I knowingly pay with a bad check, that is criminal fraud/""stealing"". If I pay with a credit card, then a three-way transaction occurs, I get the store's merchandise, the store gets the CC company's money, and the CC company gets my debt (and it is debt, because I don't have to pay all of it immediately). If I fail then to pay my CC debt, that is a civil matter."
At what point can you walk out of a restaurant if they make you wait to pay the bill?,"at what point can you just leave? Is it always technically illegal in the UK to leave without paying the bill?  Probably depends on what you mean with just leaving. If just leaving translates I haven't paid and I won't pay (because of the hassle with the card) then that's probably Making Off Without Payment, section 3 Theft Act 1978 (Thanks @bdsl).  Could the restaurant just force you to wait until close of business if necessary?
  What if they still hadn't fixed the payment system by then? I don't think a restaurant can physically detain you. Not even the 45 min you have been waiting. But if you leave without paying and without an agreement with them how & when to pay they can of course call the police because again that looks very much like making off without payment. According to your post, they did provide a payment system (cash) which was working all the time and that moreover has the special status of being legal tender. if you don't physically have the cash on you, you can be sued? You can be sued if you don't pay your bill (assuming the bill itself is correct) when it's due. In order to avoid endless hassle of the ""I tried to pay via x, but they wouldn't accept this."" type, legal tender defines ways of payment of a debt that the creditor/seller must accept.
In many legislations, cash in the local currency provides such a fallback if other payment methods fail. Note that cash payment is very robust against internet failure, broken devices and power  The UK (+ US) meaning of legal tender is that the restaurant must accept this means of settling the debt (at this time, the food is already eaten but not payed) - but they don't have to accept any other means of payment. (Note that e.g. for the EUR-countries there is at least a recommendation to make acceptance of legal tender mandatory also in retail, which includes simultaneous exchange food vs. payment).
The 2nd important implication of this is that any argumentation along the lines that no reasonable means of payment were available would be very weak. You are not required to have sufficient cash with you to pay your bill if you can reasonably assume that some other way of payment will be acceptable to the restaurant.
I see that like a spare wheel for a car: if you have a flat tire (card doesn't work) having a spare wheel (cash) allows you to deal with the issue with less hassle than if you don't: change your wheel vs. having to get your car brought to a workshop and wait until they put on a new tire (pay cash instead of waiting for the card to work again or a tedious hunt for another payment method).   I'd like to point out that card doesn't work and not sufficient cash at hand (or forgotten purse) is something that happens quite often in general (rarely for any given transaction, but we have lots of transactions). I'd expect a restaurant or a gas station to be experienced in dealing with that.  In any case, there are several possibilities to resolve the issue short of ""just leaving"": The key to all this is communication: talk to the restaurant to find a way to resolve the issue. Reassure them that you're not trying to use the opportunity to defraud them - that's what they are afraid of in this situation. ""Where can I find an ATM?""  Credit cards can be charged in a total offline way (MOTO = mail order/telephone order) where the credit card data is entered manually by the seller: the restaurant may be able to charge your credit card if fill in a paper credit card payment form.   They may accept settlement via other payment systems: Restaurants like any other business can write invoices. They usually don't like this because their risk of having costly trouble to get the money is high.
While your printout bill is technically an invoice already, it can be turned into an invoice (+ copy for them) giving your name + address and specifying how and when you'll pay. Which would keep track of how you (pl. = you + restaurant) decided to settle the bill under the peculiar circumstances. This works even in case of e.g. a power outage that prevents you from getting cash from an ATM in the neighborhood."
Why are lawyers typically excluded from juries?,"Technically anyone can sit on a jury. Lawyers are not automatically excluded from juries anymore, as being called for jury duty is a right and a duty that the law abhors automatically excluding people from. That is the official line on this. However, in reality, lawyers will always be stricken from serving by one of the lawyers trying the case.  Each lawyer has a certain number of preemptory strikes (the ability to get rid of a juror for any reason, aside from those protected by law, such as race, religion, etc). They also have unlimited 
""for cause strikes,"" which are when a juror is biased in some way.  Lawyers trying the case almost always try to use a cause strike to get a lawyer off, saying that they are biased toward either Defense or Plaintiffs based on the type of law they practice. The judge will usually not let them use a cause strike, saying that an attorney is ethical enough to apply the facts to the law and not sway the jury based on their personal biases that everyone has; plus, we're officers of the court so we have a duty to be ethical. Hence, they are typically forced to use a preemptory strike to get a lawyer off, but they will, every time. (If the lawyer just tried a similar case, then they'd get to use for cause.) The real reason that the lawyer from one side or the other definitely wants a lawyer off is that the jury instructions presented by each side to the judge are crafted in a way that each word carries specific meaning and, with that, is designed to lead to a certain way of thinking. Once the lawyers have fought over the instructions and the judge decides what will be presented, the jury only gets them in writing...in some states not even in writing, they only get them read to them without a copy to take back to the room. If a lawyer is in the jury, that person will undoubtedly be able to explain exactly what the law requires for a finding, or exactly why a certain finding should be had. They will advocate one way or another; this is undeniable. The instructions are purposefully confusing. The reason is this: when we fight over jury instruction, inherently, one of us will want an instruction that is hard to understand, for a lay person.  This is because we want them to apply the law as it is commonly (mis)understood, not as it truly is, because that's not good for our case.  To have a lawyer on the jury would defeat the finely crafted instruction and its potential to confuse. They would undoubtedly explain the instruction to the jury. One may think this would be helpful, however, juries are told that any special knowledge they have about anything pertaining to the case shall not be shared as it could sway the jury. This is most true when it comes to a lawyer sitting. When a jury doesn't understand a jury instruction, their only recourse is to send a question to the judge.  In states where they have the instruction in writing, all he can say is ""read carefully;"" he cannot give his interpretation of what the instruction means.  If a judge did give his own interpretation that is grounds for a mistrial or an appeal at least.  A lawyer on the jury would be able to explain, ""Oh, what this really means is X,"" and this is bad from one side's perspective, almost always. We all have biases, and even finely determined rules of law can be subtly pushed toward one direction or another with the use of a certain word over another, or the placement of one element before another.  Generally, unless the side who would most want the attorney off had exhausted their preemptory strikes, and lost the argument to remove for cause, there is very little chance a lawyer will serve. The fact of the matter is that  both sides are very likely to want a lawyer stricken from the jury pool, (even from the side who may believe the lawyer to have leanings in their favor). It is essential to control as many factors as possible in a jury trial, and an attorney on the panel is just a wild card. The potential always exists that if a lawyer ends up on the jury, they could explain the elements of the case to their fellow jurors, who may then not rely as fully upon the carefully crafted language in the instruction(s). This could backfire on either side when certain portions of the language used may be intentionally vague or difficult to parse though for someone who doesn't practice law. Anyone interested in the process of choosing and striking jurors (in the U.S.), through the process of voir dire, this is a fairly comprehensive article on the topic."
Is it legal for a company to offer free coding courses to women only?,"There are some added complexities here that Matthew's answer hasn't addressed, especially in the meanings of words like group and disadvantage. Let’s focus on the latter of the two and proceed by way of example. Suppose the evidence suggests that the members of a particular group are under-represented in a particular discipline. But suppose the evidence also suggests that they are being actively discriminated in favour of in that same discipline. The question arises: are the members of this group at an advantage (because they're discriminated in favour of), or at a disadvantage (because they're under-performing)? This seems to be the case for women in science, for example. Ergo, since the language is vague, it's thus an unfortunate fact of life that the legality of such things mostly depends on the politics and broader zeitgeist within which the case is heard. Left-leaning judges will tend to decide that the members of the group under question are at an overall disadvantage, despite discrimination working in their favour, and will thus tend to hold that such discrimination is lawful, while anti-left judges will tend to decide that the members of the group under question are at an overall advantage and thus that further discrimination in their favour is unlawful. Based on the above comments, discrimination in favour of such groups will tend to be regarded as lawful in the current intellectual climate. But in my opinion, common sense dictates that the left-leaning definition of disadvantage upon which such decisions are based doesn't really stand up to scrutiny, and as time goes on and society cycles through different worldviews, I think that a consensus will eventually emerge that the anti-left conception of disadvantage makes by far the most sense. Therefore, I consider it likely that the judicial system will ultimately begin to rule that such affirmative action policies are illegal. Indeed, I think judges will eventually declare that these kinds of policies were always illegal, but that this simply wasn't recognised at the time for political reasons. ... your link discusses hiring preferences in favor of women while not
addressing the question of performance, yet your comment implies that
it demonstrates both. Yes, that was poorly worded. I've fixed the issue. Further, the study only looks at preferences of hiring faculty, while acknowledging that a bigger problem is a lack of applicants, despite a large pool of eligible applicants. The broader question here is whether 'lack of applicants' is a form of disadvantage that can be used to justify the lawfulness of discriminatory practices. My point is really that we can't answer this from the legislation alone and are thereby forced to rely on the kinds of precedents discussed in Matthew's answer. But realistically, these precedents don't make much sense with respect to common sense notions of disadvantage, and thus are likely to change in the future. I don't necessarily mean that right-leaning judges will swoop in and totally override the precedents. Another possibility, for example, is that a general sense of disenchantment with partisan thinking will infiltrate top-tier courts; if this happens, common sense points of view will stand a better chance of becoming precedents. You’re side-stepping the point of women being discriminated against by
saying there is a hiring bias in favor of them (and that only for
academic jobs). This bias doesn’t mean they are at an advantage in
life generally and therefore doesn’t mean these coding classes are
unjustified. I agree to an extent, but I also think these comments are of limited relevance, and they even support my contention to some extent. If the words 'advantage' and 'disadvantage' are used without explanation of whether general life-advantage is being meant, as distinct from hiring bias, then this really politicizes the issue, because the meaning of the legislation isn't clear. Beyond this, there's really no scientific consensus on whether women in the UK are at an overall life-disadvantage or not, so your argument doesn't (currently) hold much water. Going further, I'd make the claim that given (a) explicit bias in favor of women due to affirmative action programs that try to lower the bar somewhat for women, and (b) implicit bias in favor of women due to a desire to correct perceived or actual discrepancies, and (c) the fact that women have overall greater bargaining power in the domains of romance, marriage and sexuality, and (d) the still-widespread expectation that (straight) men ought to financially support their significant others, it seems quite likely that an overall male disadvantage will eventually be settled upon by the scientific community. Let's call this Outcome 1. A contrary possibility is that by factoring in e.g. partner-violence, etc., the establishment will arrive at the opposite conclusion. Let's call this Outcome 2. Yet another possibility is that the scientific establishment will eventually decide that there's no apolitical way to weigh up the costs and benefits of belonging to the genders under question. Let's call this Outcome 3. Notice that if either Outcomes 1 or 3 transpire, courts higher up in the judicial hierarchy will eventually start deciding that many of these broader life-advantage arguments don't carry much weight anymore, especially if the broader spirit-of-the-times changes. Also, I should clarify my position a bit more. My opinion is specifically that it will eventually be recognized that most of these policies were illegal all long. But I'm not saying that such policies should be illegal. Indeed, ethically, I'd say that investing in your employees should probably be OK, even if you're investing in them in very discriminatory patterns! But that's a different conversation altogether. You say the policies are illegal, yet you provided no evidence to
support this. I respectfully disagree. As I've said, antidiscrimination law depends very heavily on the concept of disadvantage. This means scientific evidence can carry legal weight, and I've provided some. I can provide a lot more science if people request it. However, I'd much prefer people go off and research the topic themselves, since this is the best way to get a balanced picture of the literature. The definition of ""illegal"" you're using is perhaps closer to
""unethical"". If the law supports something, it's by definition
impossible for that to be illegal (legal nuance aside). Laws changing
wouldn't retrospectively make things illegal. I'm definitely talking about legality, and by the way, a change in precedent could definitely retrospectively make things illegal. However, I'd like to concede that you make at least one strong point here, at least implicitly. Namely, notice that there's a broader question of jurisprudence lurking beneath the surface here, namely: can so-called judge-made-law really be considered law per se, as opposed to ""mere"" precedent? I'm pretty sure the philosophers have yet to agree on this issue, so I concede that the way my answer is written, which proceeds 'as if' the mere-precedent side had won the debate, weakens the writing somewhat. But I also think the thrust of what I'm saying is spot on. So at some level, your point here is a good one. The last paragraph is pure speculation about the future. This has no
place on Stack Exchange. The second to last paragraph is based on
wishful thinking, not actual case law. This answer has no objective
merit. So I believe the people who upvote this answer do so to react
to a political stance they agree with. I'll do my best to respond respectfully to this. As you may have noticed, my answer adds nuance to Matthew's by explaining how questions pertaining to the legality of discrimination often hinge sensitively on the meaning of the word 'disadvantage', as well as on the details of the relevant science. This gives context to the current state of affairs, and unambiguously constitutes an important contribution to the broader project of answer the OP's question. This alone makes the claim of 'no-merit' come off as... well, without merit! Beyond this, you're right that there's a degree of speculation in the latter parts of my answer. However, that's because the law is not clear-cut in this area, and therefore we cannot know whether such policies are ultimately going to be regarded as having been legal (at the time they existed) without speculating somewhat on what the future holds. That's just the situation we're in right now! I'd hardly call that pure speculation, and I think the tone you've chosen to use (characterized by e.g. strong words and phrase and choppy sentences) probably overstates the strength of your points. I've run out of steam at this point, so I'll probably just leave it there. Apologies to the people whose comments didn't receive proper responses."

Why is murder considered a more serious crime than attempted murder?,"Your question is the subject of longstanding and ongoing debate that has generated countless articles and books and dissertations, so you're probably not going to get a fully satisfactory answer here. But here's the short version: Different systems operate on different assumptions. Your question suggests you are not a retributivist, i.e., someone who views sentencing as a means for taking retribution for the criminal's offenses. Some systems (most, I imagine) are built around that idea, but some view criminal sentencing primarily as a means of preventing recidivism, or as a means for achieving rehabilitation, the interests you indicated you see as more important. And even within those systems, there are still different ideas about what you're actually trying to do. Again, you've indicated that you subscribe to an intent-based system (a punishment keyed to what the criminal intended to do), but that approach competes with harm-based sentencing (punishment for the harm the criminal actually caused). While equal punishments make sense from an intent-based approach, they are less justifiable from a harm-based approach. Few would say that attempted murder inflicts the same amount of harm as completed murder, and so that system does not call for the same amount of punishment. Because there are different approaches, sentencing guidelines vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which I would classify as adopting a harm-based retributivism, treat attempts less severely than completed offenses, but other systems treat them equally."
What happens if I negatively answer the court oath regarding the truth?,"That will amount to refusal to testify. The judge will warn you that, for a summoned witness, a refusal to testify means contempt of court and you will be asked that question again. After a second ""No"" you go to jail for contempt of court, and the trial will most likely be adjourned until you make up your mind to answer ""Yes""."
Can a law protect itself?,"Parliament is sovereign: Parliamentary sovereignty is a principle of the UK constitution. It makes Parliament the supreme legal authority in the UK, which can create or end any law. Generally, the courts cannot overrule its legislation and no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change. Parliamentary sovereignty is the most important part of the UK constitution."
Can you refuse to swear on the Bible?,"In order to accommodate various objections that have arisen in recent generations, in general: These variances are often allowed by statute.

Is it truly illegal for the US Armed Forces to hire someone whose IQ is less than 83?,"Applicants are required by military regulation to have a percentile score on a standardized test called the ASVAB that is 31 or more, which is roughly comparable to an IQ score on the Stanford-Binet scale of a little bit less than 92, for high school graduates seeking to enter the Army or Navy (other services have more strict requirements and applicants with only a GED or to the national guard must have an ASVAB score in the 50th percentile which is equivalent to an IQ of 100). But, U.S. law allows the Department of Defense to allow people with a percentile score on the ASVAB that is as low as 10 if it chooses to do so. An IQ score of 83 on the Stanford-Binet scale is the 14th percentile of the general population and is fairly close to a 10th percentile score on the ASVAB, although the conversion is not very exact, because ASVAB test takers have fewer people in the top and the bottom of the IQ range than the general population. So, the assertion that the law prohibits people with an IQ score of 83 or less from serving in the U.S. military is close to the truth, although the reality is somewhat more complicated. The U.S. military sets, as a matter of policy in a government regulation at the Department of Defense level, certain minimum requirements for people who seek to enter military services. Some of the main requirements are found here. There are also requirements not described there such as a requirement that people enlisting may not have juvenile or criminal records of a certain severity. Additional requirements apply to certain military occupational specialties within the military. For example, someone may qualify to be an Army cook, but not to be a military intelligence specialist in the Air Force. If a person does not meet those requirements, that person is not allowed to serve unless a waiver is obtained from a person with the authority to do so, and even the kind of exceptions that can be made and the factors that must be considered when making an exception on a case by case basis, are specified by a regulation or official pronouncement of the Department of Defense. Among the requirements specified by regulation are educational requirements (a high school diploma or GED subject to some exceptions). Applicants are also required to take the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) from which the applicant receives an AFQT score is equal to the applicant's percentile ranking of the applicant's raw score on the test. An applicant's AFQT score is strongly correlated with a applicant's IQ score on a traditional IQ test. Applicants with a GED rather than a high school diploma, and all national guard applicants, must score at least 50. Applicants with high school diplomas must score at least 31 to enter the Army or the Navy, 32 to enter the Marines, and 36 to enter the Air Force or the Coast Guard, as a matter of federal regulation. ASVAB scores from one year are not necessarily full comparable to ASVAB scores from another year because the test is rescaled from time to time based, among other things, on the scores earned by people who take the test. For all practical purposes, a Department of Defense regulation has the force of law with respect to an individual applicant seeking to enlist in the military, or an individual recruiter evaluating military applicants. But, Congress has vested the task of setting exact cutoffs and deciding which tests to use to evaluate applicants in the U.S. military and it changes its regulations from time to time based upon the recruiting targets that it needs to meet to satisfy Congressionally set force sizes, and the quality of the applicant pool, subject to the requirement that no one with an AFQT score of below 31 may enlist without a high school diploma, that everyone that enlists must have an AFQT score of at least 10, pursuant to 10 USC 520, AND that no more than 20% of enlisted soldiers may have an AFQT score below 31. AFQT score percentiles on the AVSAB and IQ percentiles aren't completely comparable to each other, however, because IQ percentiles are based on the general population and AFQT scores are based upon people who take the test. People with very high IQs (who tend to go to college rather than the military in the U.S.) and people with very low IQs (who tend to not even try to enlist in the military, knowing that it is futile) are underrepresented among AVSAB test takers, so very low AFQT scores correspond to somewhat higher IQ percentiles, while very high AFQT scores correspond to somewhat lower IQ percentiles. IQ scores are scaled with a Standard Deviation of either 15 (Weschler) or 16 (Stanford-Binet), and a mean of 100 for the general population. In a 16 point standard deviation IQ test, the 30th percentile is an IQ score of 92 and an IQ score of 83 is the 14th percentile. It isn't unreasonable to estimate that an AFQT score of 10 corresponds to an IQ score of 83, although I haven't seen any source making that exact conversion. My best guess is that the minimum AFQT score of 10 corresponds to an IQ score of more than 83 but less than 92 on a Stanford-Binet scale. For comparison's sake, an IQ score of 70 is normally considered developmentally disabled (a.k.a. mentally retarded). The minimum IQ score for entry into the military according to Congress would be considered a bit ""dull"", but within the range of ordinary self-sufficient people in the general population. The minimum IQ score for entry into the military by current regulations of about 92 would be within the ""normal"" range of 90-110 that includes about half of the general population. UPDATE (September 26, 2019): While this is a law that the U.S. military is duty bound to honor, it isn't at all obvious that anyone, with the possible exception of Congress or at least a majority of one house of Congress, would have standing to bring a civil action in court to enforce this requirement. To have standing one would have to show an actual injury from the violation to you personally, and that in turn, would be extremely hard to show in a casual manner. Generally speaking, however, mere statistical evidence of some actual injury to you on average is insufficient. One could imagine a case where a low IQ person's mistake harmed a fellow soldier, but it would be almost impossible in practice to segregate the IQ contribution to the mistake happening to myriad other facts that could also have led to the mistake (e.g. insufficient training)."
"Is it illegal to run away from a police officer in a way that provokes them, in the US?","Bobstro gave the practical answer, that it's a stupid idea for many reason. This is for the US in general, states may have laws that say otherwise. It is not illegal to provoke someone or a government official (police), it's done all the time in protest (not riots).  It is not illegal to run from a cop who has not detained you in any way, or has not issued an order to you. The U.S. Supreme Court  has made clear that people not suspected of criminal activity can ignore a police officer who approaches them.  Wisconsin has even said, that even after a police officer knocked on your window, you can still leave. However, it may give probable cause, especially with the statement of ""Oh shit! The police!"" It IS illegal to run from a cop who has detained you or issued a lawful order. The order ""STOP"" is a lawful order, and from that point on, you are committing a crime if you do not stop. For your case, check out the NYTimes article ""Supreme Court Roundup; Flight Can Justify Search By Police, High Court Rules""."

How does SE's arbitration clause hold up under the GDPR?,"Not going to hold up. Dutch Supreme Court confirmed 2012-09-21 in LJN BW6135 that arbitration is still covered by the the right to an independent judge, as established in Golder v UK, ECHR 1975-02-21, nr. 4451/70. Stack Exchange can't decide the rules themselves. (The Dutch case confirms that sector-wide arbitration is in fact legal, with regard to a standard arbitration clause commonly used in the Dutch building sector. The arbiter was found to be independent in that case precisely because they weren't picked by the builder involved.) The GDPR is only indirectly relevant, but the fact that it's mentioned does mean that there is an indisputable intent to provide services to EU consumers. (See section 23 of the GDPR, or its national equivalents). As such, you can't hide behind a US business address. If you intend to do business in the EU, it's under EU laws - all of them. You can't say that only the GDPR applies, and not other rules.  I'm having a bit of a problem finding a source, but I'm fairly confident that consumers have the right to sue at their own, local court, overruling the default of suing in the court where the counterparty is located. Finally, I have the right under national law (Dutch: BW 6:236 start and sub-n) to strike the arbitration clause up to 30 days after the conflict arises, and demand a court decision. That's not 30 days after I accept the ""Public Network Terms"", that's 30 days after the arbitration is invoked. Dutch law explicitly allows arbitration abroad, and arbiters may apply foreign law, but as written the arbitration clause has no legal basis in the Netherlands, and any arbitration resolution would therefore not be considered valid.  You may wonder if it matters to Stack Exchange that the arbitration decision would not hold in the EU. Well, consider a clause like Indemnification, which demands the user indemnifies Stack Exchange. That's a pretty empty demand if it's not enforceable."
What power do I have as a driver if my interstate route is blocked by a protest?,"What power do I have as a driver if my interstate route is blocked by a protest? As an ordinary citizen, no powers in most jurisdictions. You have the right to report obstruction of the highway to the local police. You likely have the right to sue those people if you have evidence of significant harm they have caused you. I feel like ethically no one has the right to obstruct my travel You are wrong to put this in absolute terms. For example, a roadworker holding a ""stop"" sign has the right to temporarily obstruct your travel. A school bus unloading children has the right to obstruct your travel. Someone lying injured on a pedestrian crossing may have rights which rank higher than yours. Also, since you ask in the context of this specific website, rights are limited to those granted to individuals by laws enacted by government. Your personal sense of ethics does not directly determine what legal rights you have. But that's why we have laws, right? So we can retaliate against people we feel are impeding our freedom in a peaceful manner. Merriam Webster full definition of retaliate: transitive verb: to repay (as an injury) in kind intransitive verb: to return like for like; especially: to get revenge Retaliate is the wrong word to use for what you mean. The law does not provide for you to repay in kind or return like for like. The law is not about enabling revenge. Retaliation generally is the act of seeking revenge upon another. Various federal and state laws, which vary by state, protect certain persons who seek to assert their legal rights from retaliation. - uslegal.com Note: The question was later amended to remove the following: driving forward slowly, giving the protesters an opportunity to move, but not stopping my vehicle if they refuse, would be an ethically fair option. Not, for example, according to Minneapolis City Attorney Susan Segal on March 24 2015. The law requires drivers to use due care to avoid pedestrians. The context was a driver using a car to push through protesters on the highway. It may be worth considering that the people you hit (no matter how slowly) with your car may have their own (perhaps equally incorrect) assessment of the ethics of the situation: Using force to escalate a conflict doesn't always lead to the outcome you desire. Here's an example from the
Star Tribune: The motorist who rolled through a busy Minneapolis intersection packed Ferguson street protesters last November, slightly injuring one demonstrator, was charged Tuesday afternoon with three misdemeanor traffic violations. Jeffrey P. Rice, 40, of St. Paul, was charged in Hennepin County District Court with reckless or careless driving, careless driving and failure to avoid colliding with a pedestrian. Rice was charged by summons and has an April 14 court date. Last month, the county attorney’s office decided not to charge Rice with a felony in connection with when he drove through the protesters late in the afternoon on Nov. 25 at E. Lake Street and Minnehaha Avenue, where he knocked over one of the participants. The case was then presented by police to the city attorney’s office for potential prosecution on misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor counts. Rice admitted to police that he saw the people in the street before he went ahead and “drove through them,” the criminal complaint read. In a statement explaining the charges, City Attorney Susan Segal said, “The law requires drivers to use due care to avoid pedestrians. We don’t believe that standard was met in this case.” followup Jeffrey P. Rice, 41, of St. Paul, was fined $575 and ordered to attend a driver's education course within six months for failure to yield to a pedestrian. ... several hundred protesters were blocking the intersection."
Is Elon Musk's child name valid in California?,"We could start with what the statutes say (HSC 102425) (a) The certificate of live birth for a live birth occurring on or
after January 1, 2016, shall contain those items necessary to
establish the fact of the birth and shall contain only the following
information; (1) Full name and sex of the child. It says nothing about the form of that name. Therefore, any prohibition of the letter Æ (or æ) etc. would have to come from the administrative interpretation of California Department of Public Health, Vital Records. There is a long handbook, which on p. 112 states the rule regarding child names. The rules note that The form must be completed using the 26 alphabetical characters of the
English language with appropriate punctuation, if necessary. No pictographs (☺), ideograms (⇑), diacritical marks (è, ñ, ē, ç), or
extraneous entries are allowed. So the short answer is, unless you feel like making a court case out of the matter and you have a lot of money, this name will not be allowed. The rule might be challenged in court as exceeding statutory authority, and might well be deemed to discriminate w.r.t. race and national origin. The rule could be defended on grounds of necessity, if we presume that the department is incapable of recording information other than the 26 letters and ""appropriate punctuation"" (undefined, presumably only apostrophe). It's not that in principle Unicode doesn't exist, it's that their system may not be capable of dealing with it (numerous problems would arise from the non-unique mapping from visual representation to Unicode number). There does not seem to be a court ruling on the matter."
Can I legally include a line break in my child's name?,"In the US, any legal restrictions on names are implemented at the state level——although broad administrative restrictions exist on the federal level. Some states may restrict use of diacritics (ubiquitous in Vietnamese) or Arabic numerals (but not Roman numerals). At the other extreme, in Washington state, there is no requirement to include a name at all in the case of live birth of known parentage. In the case of delayed report of live birth, and ""An individual requesting the delayed report of live birth of an individual under twelve years of age must establish the facts concerning full name, date, and place of live birth"". But no restrictions are imposed on names that can be so reported. Theoretically, one could attempt to register a child with the name 𑠓𑠳𑠢 (in the Dogra script), which would cause technical problems for the registrar's office. It is likely that the clerk taking in the form would respond something along the lines of ""Huh?"" and ""How do you spell that"". Similarly, one might try to register a birth name Hoàng Phủ Ngọc Tường, which would not be particularly difficult to deal with but might still stress the system (it depends on the county). In the latter case the name might be quietly converted to Hoang Phu Ngoc Tuong. In the former case, it is virtually guaranteed that the clerk would have no recourse but to insist on a romanization. Then the person registering would be insistent, they would file a lawsuit, and the courts would make some decision. It is most likely that the courts would be sympathetic to the practical concerns of the registrar and would not demand a huge overhaul of computer systems to allow any arbitrary graphic representation as a legal name. The State Department has regulations regarding names at 8 FAM 403:
Personally Identifying Information. 8 FAM 403.1-3(C) addresses punctuation, special characters and symbols, diacritical marks, and non-Latin alphabets. They do not prohibit anything in names, instead they acknowledge that not everything is supported, and there is a long discussion of ""discrepancies"" which would explain the passport name ""Nyema"" for 𑠓𑠳𑠢. Passport names comply with the
International Civil Aviation Organization standard. Social Security has a different set of rules where spaces, numbers, hyphens, slashes or any other special characters are not allowed for names, even including length limits where first, middle and last names can be maximally 10, 7 and 13 characters long (enter the first 10, 7 and 13 characters)."
Why can't advertisers say 'Super Bowl'?,"There is a general belief that a term being trademarked means that it's illegal to use the term without permission from the trademark holder, but that is false. It is illegal only if it is done in a manner that suggests endorsement by the trademark holder. For instance, selling a football as a ""Super Bowl football"" would be trademark infringement, as it implies NFL involvement in the production of the football. Simply talking about the Super Bowl, such as saying ""Our construction company built the stadium the Super Bowl is being played in"" is not trademark infringement. Simply using a trademarked term to discuss the thing it refers to, without implying endorsement, is known as ""nominative use"". However, even if one would be on solid legal footings and could win a lawsuit on the basis of nominative use, one might avoid using a trademark to avoid the hassle of being sued."
Can I get a DUI in my wheelchair?,"new-york-state No. New York's DUI law forbids the operation of a motor vehicle when your ""ability to operate such motor vehicle is impaired by the consumption of alcohol"", but it defines ""motor vehicle"" to exclude ""electrically-driven mobility assistance devices operated or driven by a person with a disability."" If you are using a wheelchair because of a disability, you are therefore not subject to the DUI statute."
Can I legally make a website about boycotting a certain company?,"Yes you can, and you can even include ""editorials or subjective content"". However, if you include factual statements, or words that imply factual statements, the company could claim that they are false, and therefore defamatory. Indeed they might claim that in any case. If you make no false statements of fact, they should not be able to win a defamation suit, but you might need to spend time and money defending yourself if they choose to sue. The detailed rules on defamation vary by jurisdiction, in the US by state. But in no US state can defamation be found against a person who neither made nor implied a false statement of fact. Use of the name of the company, along with ""boycott"" as in ""BoycottXYXCorp.com"" would not infringe any trademark XYZ might have. It is clearly Nominative use, as no one could reasonably believe that such a site was run by, sponsored, or endorsed by XYZ. Again, XYZ could always sue, even if they are highly likely to lose quickly."

Can a university legally enforce a policy preventing students from creating their own wireless networks?,"FCC Public Notice DA 04-1844 on ""Rules Governing Customer Antennas And Other Unlicensed Equipment"" addresses colleges and universities, and sounds to me like it is specifically about this issue. The  FCC’s  Office  of  Engineering  and  Technology  (OET)  releases  this  Public  Notice  in  response  to  questions  from  the  public  regarding  the  use  of  unlicensed  devices,  including  customer  antennas,  especially  in  the  context  of  a  variety  of  multi-tenant  environments  (MTEs). MT environments encompass venues such as hotels, conference and convention centers, airports, and  colleges  and  universities. In  particular,  questions  have  arisen  about  the  role  of  the  Commission  in  addressing  and  resolving  radio  interference  (“RFI”)  issues  in  these  settings.  In  addition,  questions  have  arisen  about  the  ability  of  homeowners  associations,  landlords,  and  other third parties to prohibit customer use of small antennas when consumers install and operate them as unlicensed devices. In  response,  we  reaffirm  that,  under  the  Communications  Act,  the  FCC  has  exclusive  authority  to  resolve  matters  involving  radio  frequency  interference  [RFI]  when  unlicensed  devices are being used, regardless of venue.  We also affirm that the rights that consumers have under  our  rules  to  install  and  operate  customer  antennas  one  meter  or  less  in  size  apply  to  the  operation  of  unlicensed  equipment,  such  as  Wi-Fi  access  points  -  just  as  they  do  to  the  use  of  equipment in connection with fixed wireless services licensed by the FCC. To address Dale's point, further down it forbids the use of property law to regulate these issues: We  also  affirm  that  the  consumer  protections  for  the  installation  and  use  of  consumer  antennas  under  the  FCC’s  Over-the-Air  Reception Devices (OTARD) rules apply to unlicensed devices. By  their  terms,  these  rules  apply,  among  other  things,  to  customer  antennas  -  one-meter  or  less  in  size  -  used  for  transmitting  and/or  receiving  any  fixed  wireless  signal  of  any  commercial  nonbroadcast  communications  signal  that  is  transmitted  via  wireless  technology  to  or  from  a  customer  location. The  rules  prohibit  homeowner  associations,  landlords,  state  and  local  governments,  or  any  other  third  parties  from  placing  restrictions  that  impair  a  customer  antenna  user's  ability  to  install,  maintain,  or  use  such  customer  antennas  transmitting  and/or  receiving  commercial  nonbroadcast  communications  signals  when  the  antenna  is  located  ""on  property within the exclusive use or control"" of the user where the user has a direct or indirect ownership  or  leasehold  interest  in  the  property,  except  under  certain  exceptions  for  safety  and  historic preservation."
How do people publicly admit to criminal activity and not typically get arrested?,"Unless the Youtube Video shows them committing a crime, then no, they couldn't be arrested and tried for a crime. Them saying it, not under oath, is just hearsay that has no evidentiary value unless there is already other evidence they have committed a crime. In that case, its an admission.  But there must be other, either circumstantial, or actual physical evidence of a crime. 
Past intoxication is not a crime, either. Possession of drugs, if caught with them is. But saying you got high is not. People have walked into police stations and confessed to murders. But with no evidence, no body, no name of a missing person, they can't even be held after the holding period for investigatory purposes expires.  If the video shows them committing assault, or breaking and entering (there actually are idiots who post this stuff), the video is actual evidence of a crime and it is often used against them. The statements can be used to begin an investigation, but people don't usually confess to anything worth pursuing even an investigation. The fact that someone says they used to do something criminal is not enough. For all you ( meaning anyone ) knows, the statute of limitations has expired because they ""pirated games"" 10 years ago. Your comment is right on."
"HOA Prohibits ""Large Families""","As stated, this is not a reasonable restriction and runs afoul of the Fair Housing Act. You cannot discriminate based on family status, with an exemption for ""housing for older persons"", and the act ""does not limit the applicability of reasonable local, state, or federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling"" (let's leave aside HOA restrictions for a moment). The number of occupants can legally be restricted in terms of a reasonable relation to a legitimate interest such as parking availability, safety, noise or securing the property. A restriction based on square footage or number of bedrooms might be reasonable: a blanket rule ""no more than 4 people"" is not reasonable. This article notes some of the state complication in interpreting ""marital status"", in terms of ""not being married to each other""."
"Landlord wants to switch my lease to a ""Land contract"" to ""get back at the city""","A ""land contract"" is not a way of renting property, it is a way of purchasing property on an installment basis without bank financing. It is Ohio's version of what in some other places is known as ""contract for deed"". See ""What is a Land Contract in Ohio"" and ""How Land Contracts Work"" The actual law is Section 5313. In a land contract, the buyer has equitable but not legal title. The buyer normally pays all taxes and fees, and is responsible for maintaining the property, just as if s/he has bought the property. But if the buyer defaults, all payments and equity would be forfeit to the seller. Until the buyer has paid 20% of the purchase price, or made 5 years of payments (whichever comes first) a single missed payment constitutes default and can lead to the buyer being evicted with all payments to date going to the seller, the buyer coming out of the deal with nothing.  Also, if the seller still has a mortgage and defaults, the buyer may lose everything paid to date. The buyer does not have the protections that a lease gives a tenant, nor the protections that legal title gives a purchaser via a traditional mortgage.  Land contracts are often used when the buyer cannot qualify for a mortgage.  The buyer pays interest, and it is often at a higher rate than the current rate on a mortgage. Land contracts are often a form of predatory lending, but for some buyers they make sense. A buyer needs to carefully review the contract with a lawyer knowledgeable about land contracts, and consider the risks and benefits of this form of financing. As I understand it, there cannot be a valid land contract for one apartment in an apartment building. A land contract must be for title to the land and all fixtures, including all buildings, on it. (There was at one point some unclarity if the question referred to an apartment. It is now clear that it refers to a house, so this statement is not relevant to the OP, but may be to others.) It is not clear just what the OP's landlord (LL) has in mind. It may be that LL plans to offer a ""land contract"" in which the purchase would be completed only after a very long time, with the idea that the OP would simply default when s/he wanted to move. Such a default could harm the OP's credit. There seems no benefit to the OP in such a scheme compared to a lease, unless LL will lower the price significantly, taking into account maintenance costs and taxes, which OP may well be expected to pay under a land contract.  Note that a landlord can't legally force a tenant to sign a document cancelling a lease, or to sign whatever s/he will call a ""land contract"". Nor can s/he cancel the lease without the tenant's consent except for good cause as specified in the law (such as not paying rent). S/He could become uncooperative on other matters if a tenant doesn't do as s/he wants.  If a tenant does cancel his or her lease, s/he will lose some rights. Others are guaranteed by law as long as the tenant is paying rent. If one signs a ""land contract"", what happens depends on its provisions. OP needs to very carefully consider just what is being offered, and its risks and any possible benefits. Details of the contract will matter. No matter exactly what LL has in mind, this is not at all a usual procedure for a landlord. OP or anyone in a similar circumstance should be very careful."
Can I sign legal documents with a smiley face?,"Can I sign legal documents with a smiley face? Yes, that is lawful. A person's signature does not necessarily have to include the person's name or initials. What matters is that the signature reliably and unequivocally identifies the person who produces it, which apparently you have been able to prove by showing your driver's license. The Black's Law Dictionary (4th Edition) states in its entry for signature that ""whatever mark, symbol, or device one may choose to employ as representative of himself is sufficient"". It directs to the entry for sign, which likewise speaks in terms of ""any mark, as upon a document, in token of knowledge, approval, acceptance or obligation"". Accordingly, your signature qualifies as mark or symbol that fits these purposes. Your history of signing other legally binding documents that way further reinforces the authenticity of your signature. If it is legal, is it a bad idea? It is a bad idea to the extent (if any) that (1) others can easily forge your signature (notwithstanding that forgery or identity theft might be proved circumstantially); and (2) verifying your identity may cause hassle or annoyance to you and/or third parties. But this paragraph obviously is applicable to any and all signatures, not just those which at first glance may seem to be a joke."
What laws would Jesus be breaking if he were to turn water into wine today?,"North Carolina, united-states The problem is Jesus didn't make wine, he made liquor, which is more heavily regulated. NCGS § 18B-306 (a) Authority. - An individual may make, possess, and transport wines and malt beverages for the individual's own use, the use of the individual's family and guests... That would appear to make the transformation ok. However, the issue is if you look at the definition for wine, NCGS § 18B-101 (9) ""Unfortified wine"" means any wine or alcohol consumable containing sixteen percent (16%) or less alcohol by volume made by fermentation from grapes, fruits, berries, rice, or honey; or by the addition of pure cane, beet, or dextrose sugar; or by the addition of pure brandy from the same type of grape, fruit, berry, rice, or honey that is contained in the base wine and produced in accordance with the regulations of the United States. Miracle wine isn't wine because the alcohol didn't arise from fermentation, it came from a miracle. Similarly, NCGS § 18B-101 (15) says ""Malt beverage"" means beer, lager, malt liquor, ale, porter, and any other brewed or fermented beverage or alcohol consumable except unfortified or fortified wine as defined by this Chapter, containing at least one-half of one percent (0.5%), and not more than fifteen percent (15%), alcohol by volume. and since it wasn't brewed or fermented, it's not a malt beverage either. Therefore, it would be a liquor, as it's an alcohol consumable containing ethyl alcohol. NCGS § 18B-101 (14) ""Spirituous liquor"" or ""liquor"" means distilled spirits or ethyl alcohol, and any alcohol consumable containing distilled spirits or ethyl alcohol, including spirits of wine, whiskey, rum, brandy, gin and all other distilled spirits and mixtures of cordials, liqueur, and premixed cocktails, in closed containers regardless of their dilution. Thus, Jesus would violate § 18B-307(b) Unlawful Manufacturing. - Except as provided in G.S. 18B-306, it shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture any alcoholic beverage, except at an establishment with a Brew on Premises permit or a Winemaking on Premises permit, without first obtaining the applicable ABC permit and revenue licenses."
Landlord penalty for law enforcement calls,"This law sounds likely to be unconstitutional and/or invalid because it is pre-empted by state or federal laws. Among other things it probably violates the First Amendment right to petition the government, and the Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the laws (by depriving people who have had previous police calls of the right to call the police without penalty) and due process (by imposing a penalty based upon a call, without a presumption of innocence, rather than a finding of wrongdoing that overcomes a presumption of innocence). It could also implicate a tenant's right as a Fourth Amendment seizure without probable cause, or a Fifth Amendment taking of property without just compensation. It is probably also pre-empted by state law which establishes the grounds for which someone may be lawfully evicted, which almost certainly do not include this condition. Likewise, the conditions under which liability for police injuries is imposed are also probably pre-empted by state law. California has an express statutory prohibition on this kind of rule at Cal.Civ.Code § 1946.8(c) which provides that: A landlord cannot punish, or threaten to punish, you or another
resident for exercising your right to request law enforcement or
emergency assistance on behalf of a: Your landlord also cannot put any penalties in place if a person who
is not a resident or tenant calls law enforcement or emergency
assistance to your residence. To be protected under this law, the person who calls the police must
believe that law enforcement or emergency assistance is needed to
prevent or deal with an act of abuse, or the heightening or worsening
of an act of abuse, a crime, or an emergency. The American Civil Liberties Union is currently actively attempting to identify cases where these laws (often called nuisance laws) are being used in this manner for the purposes of bringing litigation to invalidate the laws or restrain their use. Litigation is in process in Seattle, Washington and East Rochester, New York. The ACLU also notes that: In situations where an alleged ""nuisance"" offense is related to an
incident of domestic violence, landlords may choose to evict all the
residents to avoid future incidents or police calls that could result
in a fine. Yet, these evictions violate federal law. The U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has made it clear
that tenants who are denied or evicted from housing because they have
suffered domestic violence can file sex discrimination complaints with
HUD under the federal Fair Housing Act. Thus, there would often be pre-emption of the local law by federal law as well. An op-ed piece in the New York Times reviews similar issues in Lakewood, Ohio and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, pointing out that the U.S. Constitution and federal housing laws are likely to be violated by these statutes. In at least two instances, one included in an edited question in Norristown, Pennsylvania, and one mentioned in another answer, the case of Somai v. City of Bedford in Bedford, Ohio, the ACLU has concluded favorable settlements after litigation to have these ordinances repealed and to win compensation for aggrieved parties, although, because they are settlements, neither case establishes a binding appellate precedent. We don't intend to challenge the laws at this time - they make it
easier for us to evict problem tenants whose visitors damage our
property - but were wondering if there are examples of similar laws
that have either gone unchallenged for a long period of time or that
have been challenged and judged to be legal. As landlords, you are in a difficult position. These laws have not gone unchallenged for a long period of time nor have they been challenged and judged to be legal. Instead, in all likelihood, a legal challenge to these newly enacted laws is likely to be imminent. And, while you face violations of local laws in these cases by not taking action, you may face federal housing law liability if you do utilize these laws and these laws are found to be invalid."
Can an employer withhold pay for a fire drill?,"This seems to fall under the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, and is defined as ""waiting time."" From Employment Law Handbook: On-duty waiting time should be counted as hours worked. It is time spent by an employee, typically during normal work hours, waiting for direction from their team lead, supervisor, or manager. These on-duty waiting time periods usually last only for a short time and can be unpredictable as to when they occur and how long they will last. The employee is generally not allowed to leave the workplace during a period of on-duty waiting time. Essentially, because the employer benefits from having the employee available for immediate engagement in work and the employee is not otherwise able to use the time effectively for their own personal purposes, on-duty waiting time must be counted as hours worked. Examples of on-duty waiting time that should be counted as hours worked include a messenger waiting for his or her next assignment, a warehouse worker waiting for a truck to arrive, factory workers waiting for machinery to be fixed, and a firemen waiting for an emergency call. Each of these examples represents a situation where the hallmarks of on-duty waiting time are present: the employee Employees who work away from their employer’s place of business can also be on-duty while waiting for work. Repairmen for utility companies represent a good example of when workers may experience on-duty waiting time while away from the employer’s workplace. If a repairman must wait for a home or business owner to allow them into their premises or wait for a new service call to come in, that time should be counted as hours worked for purposes of minimum wage and overtime calculations."
How does the mandate to report income from illegal activities in the US jibe with the Fifth Amendment?,"The original 1913 Revenue Act only required the reporting of income from ""lawful"" sources. In the 1921 Revenue Act the word, ""lawful"" was removed requiring all income to be reported. [IRS Publication 17] states:  Illegal activities. Income from illegal activities, such as money from dealing illegal drugs, must be included in your income on Form 1040, line 21, or on Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040) if from your self-employment activity. In United States v. Sullivan in 1927, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it was constitutional to require that a tax return be filed to report income. If the filer believed information required to be filed would incriminate him then the filer could raise the issue on the form. The filer could not simply refuse to file. Justice Holmes further wrote: It is urged that, if a return were made, the defendant would be entitled to deduct illegal expenses, such as bribery. This by no means follows, but it will be time enough to consider the question when a taxpayer has the temerity to raise it. In Garner v. United States in 1976, the Supreme Court ruled that a filer's income tax return that revealed himself to be a gambler could be used as evidence that the filer violated gambling laws. An article in Forbes describes a taxpayer who filed their returns but refused to answer some questions related to their income, asserting a Fifth Amendment privilege. The IRS attempted to impose a ""frivolous return"" penalty on the taxpayer for refusing to provide all information. The Tax Court ruled that the taxpayer had a legitimate fear regarding disclosure of information related to failing to file a report of foreign bank and financial accounts. The tax court found the taxpayer had filed the standard return, the return contained sufficient information and that a return doesn't need to be ""completely correct"" but, rather, ""substantially correct."" The IRS had claimed that omitting some information because of fear of self-incrimination is frivolous. The Tax Court found that the standard, Notice 2010-33, doesn't require that ""all"" information must be provided, simply that substantial information must be provided. As a result, the penalty was removed and the taxpayer's assertion of Fifth Amendment privilege was found not to be ""frivolous."" As the Tax Court ruling explains, the Fifth Amendment privilege applies to tax returns, provided the taxpayer affirmatively claims the privilege on the return and does so before he files it. In summary, it is still necessary to file a return; a blanket Fifth Amendment claim applying to the entire return is considered frivolous. However, the taxpayer must claim the privilege. Any incriminating information included on the return can be used against the taxpayer."
"Would open source programs that use encryption be illegal under this draft of the ""Compliance with Court Orders Act of 2016""","Section 4, Definition 4 Covered Entity, emphasis added: The term ""covered entity"" means a device manufacturer, a software manufacturer, an electronic communication service, a remote computing service, a provider of wire or electronic communication service, a provider of a remote computing service, or any person who provides a product or method to facilitate a communication or the processing or storage of data.  This definition seems extremely broad, and could be stretched to cover an answerer on Stack Overflow whose answer provided a method facilitating data processing, storage, or communication (which covers most software methods).  So let's then look at what can be required of a covered entity: Section 3(a)(1), Requirement: ... a covered entity that receives a court order from a government for information or data shall provide such information or data to such government in an intelligible format or provide technical assistance as is necessary to obtain such information or data in an intelligible format or to achieve the purpose of the court order.   Subsection 2 limits the scope so that a covered entity only has to provide data if the data was ""made unintelligible by a feature, product, or service owned, controlled, created, or provided by the covered entity or by a third party on behalf of the covered entity.""   However, courts cannot effectively require people to do the impossible; if a programmer wrote a method that was used in an encrypted communication service that does not mean the programmer, lacking the encryption key, will be forced to break what they believe to be unbreakable encryption.   The key here is in section 3(c), emphasis added: A provider of remote computing service or electronic communication service to the public that distributes licenses for products, services, applications, or software of or by a covered entity shall ensure that any such products, services, applications, or software distributed by such person be capable of complying with subsection (a).  So if this bill were to become law, it would be the service provider who's responsible for making sure the government can get the intelligible information.  The government could require e.g. the author of the encryption function, even if that person's not part of the service provider, to help break the encryption, but the responsibility for ensuring data accessibility lies with the service provider. The definition of service provider seems absent from at least what I can see of this bill, but it seems that a company selling a communications service to customers would very likely qualify, and a person/company who posted an answer on SO that was then picked up and integrated into something someone else distributed as part of a service, very likely would not.

Suing a Police Officer Instead of the Police Department,"No, you can not sue him for this. A police officer has to have done something wrong for you to sue, not just his job. I know you are saying the ticket was not warranted, but even if you are right, he can say he made a mistake and thought you were too far over and he is in the clear unless you can show he intentionally gave you a ticket when it wasn't deserved. This article explains how and why an officer is normally immune from lawsuits."
Why isn't a draft (conscription) slavery?,"The only real answer is that the US Supreme Court, in interpreting the constitution, and specifically the argument  that the 13th Amendment prohibits a draft for compelled military services has totally rejected that argument. For many years now the US has not used a draft, and it is obviously possible for the US to have an enduring and powerful military without any draft, which was perhaps not apparent to the Justices in 1918. A draft had been common in this country from the colonial period, through the Revolution, the Civil War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. In reaction to the problems during the Vietnam War, and the great opposition to any draft at that time, the US has not used a draft since, although it retains a legal requirement to register for a possible draft, and the legal authority to impose one should it be thought wise. Note that this was not because of the 13th Amendment. Note also that compelled service by the  citizens (or residents) in a locality, particularly to fight fires and floods, when the usual forces are inadequate to that end, has been commonly used. Such compulsory service has never been thought to be prohibited by the 13th Amendment. Also, as mentioned in comments, citizens can be compelled to do jury duty, which could in theory be considered ""involuntary servitude"" but has never been thought to be prohibited by the 13th amendment. The answer by Trish (now deleted) thoroughly described the many differences between a slave and a drafted soldier. Still, drafted military service might be thought to be a form of involuntary servitude. But the Court (and the laws and other courts as well) have not treated it as such. In the Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366 (1918) the Court thought the idea that compulsory military service constituted involuntary servitude was so wrongheaded that it thought a very brief mention sufficient to refute this contention. It wrote (at 245 U. S. 390): Finally, as we are unable to conceive upon what theory the exaction by government from the citizen of the performance of his supreme and noble duty of contributing to the defense of the rights and honor of the nation, as the result of a war declared by the great representative body of the people, can be said to be the imposition of involuntary servitude in violation of the prohibitions of the Thirteenth Amendment, we are constrained to the conclusion that the contention to that effect is refuted by its mere statement. It is clear from the text of that opinion that the justices thought that the existence of a power to draft soldiers was essential to the implementation of the constitutional power (article I section 8): The opinion discusses the history of compelled military service in the United States, in the colonies before there was a United States, and in Great Britain before that. The opinion says that: Compelled military service is neither repugnant to a free government nor in conflict with the constitutional guaranties of individual liberty. Indeed, it may not be doubted that the very conception of a just government and its duty to the citizen includes the duty of the citizen to render military service in case of need, and the right of the government to compel it. and Further, it is said, the right to provide is not denied by calling for volunteer enlistments, but it does not and cannot include the power to exact enforced military duty by the citizen. This however but challenges the existence of all power, for a governmental power which has no sanction to it and which therefore can only be exercised provided the citizen consents to its exertion is in no substantial sense a power. One may disagree, but that is the law of the land as interpreted by the final body authorized to make such interpretations, the Supreme Court, and it remains good law today."
A man killed my son and married one of the witnesses. Can the witness's statements still be used in court against him?,"Short Answer SIMPLIFIED AND UPDATED BASED ON ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN THE QUESTION: The marriage is valid, but their marriage will not allow the girlfriend to refuse to testify as a witness in the case.  She can be compelled to testify against him under oath, but does not have to testify about the confidential communications that they have with each other after they get married (e.g. if he confesses to her while there are having a private conversation after they are married, while he is outside the jail, while he is meeting with his lawyer). All of her recorded statements made at any time, and everything that happens before they are married are available to be used as evidence at trial (assuming no other rule of evidence excludes it).  Only confidential statements made between the wife and the criminal defendant while they are married can be excluded based upon their spousal status. END UPDATE Long Answer This question is about the marital privilege, which is created by statute or case law. There are actually two separate marital privileges that are analyzed separately.  Also, I'm simplifying this answer to limit it to the ""criminal case with a jury trial"" situation. The rules are more complicated when it is not a criminal case, and in a bench trial as opposed to a jury trial, all references to the jury would instead be to the judge. But, almost everyone facing murder charges chooses a trial by jury instead of a bench trial, as is their right. The Husband-Wife Confidential Communications Privilege The stronger marital privilege applies to confidential communications made to a defendant's spouse during the marriage, which the defendant can insist not be presented to the jury. It doesn't matter if the spouse is still married to the defendant at the time of trial. The main exception to this privilege is for crimes committed against the spouse who is testifying, or to a crime committed against a child of either spouse.  This privilege does not apply to anything that the defendant says to the girlfriend prior to getting married and does not apply to statements made by the defendant to the spouse when other people were present, and is similar to the attorney-client privilege or the parishioner-clergy privilege. In Florida this privilege, created by statute, reads as follows: Florida Evidence Code Section 90.504 Husband-wife privilege.— (1) A spouse has a privilege during and after the marital relationship
  to refuse to disclose, and to prevent another from disclosing,
  communications which were intended to be made in confidence between
  the spouses while they were husband and wife. (2) The privilege may be claimed by either spouse or by the guardian
  or conservator of a spouse. The authority of a spouse, or guardian or
  conservator of a spouse, to claim the privilege is presumed in the
  absence of contrary evidence. (3) There is no privilege under this section: (a) In a proceeding brought by or on behalf of one spouse against the
  other spouse. (b) In a criminal proceeding in which one spouse is charged with a
  crime committed at any time against the person or property of the
  other spouse, or the person or property of a child of either. (c) In a criminal proceeding in which the communication is offered in
  evidence by a defendant-spouse who is one of the spouses between whom
  the communication was made. In many states (and in federal court), this Husband-Wife privilege for confidential communications has an exception for cases where the husband and wife jointly carry out a crime or fraud. But, Florida does not have this exception to the Husband-Wife privilege for confidential communications in state court criminal cases. In federal criminal cases, the case law under Federal Rule of Evidence 501 creates a substantially similar privilege for the purposes of this question. Federal Rule of Evidence 501 is as follows: The common law — as interpreted by United States courts in the light
  of reason and experience — governs a claim of privilege unless any of
  the following provides otherwise: the United States Constitution; a federal statute; or rules prescribed by the Supreme Court. But in a civil case, state law governs privilege regarding a claim or
  defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision. Since this is a criminal case, the last sentence of Federal Rule of Evidence 501 does not apply. There are also not any rules regarding this topic that have actually been prescribed by the U.S. Supreme Court. And, neither the U.S. Constitution nor any federal statute creates a husband-wife or spousal testimonial privilege.  So, this issue is governed in federal court by ""The common law — as interpreted by United States courts in the light of reason and experience."" The relevant common law rules apply nationwide, although different federal court of appeals circuits may apply them slightly differently when the U.S. Supreme Court hasn't supplied a clear rule. The Spousal Testimonial Privilege The weaker marital privilege (sometimes called the spousal testimonial privilege) in many states, which is similar to the 5th Amendment right of a criminal defendant not to testify at trial, is a criminal defendant's right to prevent his current wife (but not a former spouse) from testifying against him at trial on any matter whatsoever, regardless of whether it relates to something that happened during the marriage or not. This marital privilege often has many exceptions for serious crimes and domestic violence in jurisdictions where it applies.  In the federal courts, however (pursuant to case law developed under Federal Rule of Evidence 501), this weaker privilege belongs to the spouse called as a witness rather than to the criminal defendant. The spouse of a criminal defendant isn't required to testify against a current spouse in federal criminal prosecutions, but the spouse and not the criminal defendant gets to decide if the spouse will refuse to testify. There may be exceptions to the federal spousal testimonial privilege in cases where one spouse is accuses of a crime against the spouse or a child of one of the spouses, where they are joint participants in a crime, or where the competency of the criminal defendant is at issue (see Wikipedia). The only exceptions which might plausibly apply in a federal criminal trial are if the criminal defendant is the father of your son, or if the criminal defendant and his girlfriend whom he marries were joint participants in the crime, neither of which seems likely to be the case here. In Florida, the weaker marital privilege also known as the spousal testimonial privilege cannot be asserted in state court criminal prosecutions but may be asserted in federal court criminal prosecutions.

"Can I terminate an employee for qualifying for a job through a ""degree mill?""","You don't have enough information. What you have is a feeling.  And feelings are a lousy reason to engage in a legal action.   Now, you have a very strong feeling, and that makes it seem to you like the strength of the feeling alters the above advice.  Yes, it does.  Very strong feelings are an exceptionally terrible reason to engage in a legal action!  I never lose. My superpower is to set aside feelings, gather all the facts, including the ones I don't like, and so doing, know what the judge will say.   What you need is more info. For instance, out of your prejudice, you have decided for yourself that ""unaccredited"" is the same thing as ""degree mill"".  It isn't.  There's a huge gulf between: It's likely the person actually did all the real work of college, the accreditation issue is news to them, and if anyone was hoodwinked, it was them. All this misses the point: accreditation is not the important issue.  What matters is whether the student applied themselves, organized themselves well, did their best, and willfully extracted a good education.  A person can ""do the minimum"" all the way through Harvard, and be not half the employee as a go-getter at Boston Community College who exceeded the course material and snuck over to Harvard's library for more.  Damn the credentials, you want the successful student.  Oh wait, this is the Law SE. Why do you want the successful student? Because you have a fiduciary duty to do what is in the best interest of the company and place good employees.  To follow your own Don Quixote crusade against people whose colleges had faulty accreditation, is a conflict of interest. You aren't even interested in ascertaining whether this person is a good employee.  And that, really, is the bottom line.  You (or rather, anyone but you) should be looking at that person's PRs and 360's, and looking at their overall performance for the company.  The company's criteria for keeping or replacing should be the probability of finding someone significantly better at about the same pay rate.  If this person is an earnest performer, you may have trouble doing that. It's that simple.  Employees must do what is in the company's best interest.  There's an old joke.  Kevin asks the sales manager, ""Why do you keep Morty? I've seen his written memos and  reports, the guy is a terrible speller.""  ""Yeah, but he outsells all the other salesmen 3:1,"" said the manager. And I pay him to sell, not to spell."""
How come the nude protesters were not arrested?,"Public nudity is illegal in New York as it is in almost every U.S. jurisdiction. And, if the police had arrested the nude protesters, the arrests probably would have been upheld in court, because a ban on nudity in public would probably be viewed as a time, place and manner restriction on the freedom of speech which is constitutionally valid.  For example, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently upheld San Francisco’s public nudity ordinance in Taub v. City and County of San Francisco (2017). As the court in that case explains in a factually very similar case: Public nudity is not inherently expressive, but it may in some
  circumstances constitute expressive conduct protected under the First
  Amendment. City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 289 (2000)
  (O’Connor, J.) (plurality opinion). Even if Plaintiffs’ public nudity
  at political rallies was entitled to First Amendment protection,
  however, we hold that the challenged ordinance is a valid, content
  neutral regulation as applied to Plaintiffs’ expressive conduct under
  United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968). O’Brien is the applicable test here because the ordinance is aimed at “the conduct
  itself, rather than at the message conveyed by that conduct.” United
  States v. Swisher, 811 F.3d 299, 312 (9th Cir. 2016) (en banc). But, while a court would have made that distinction, the public, which is used to the idea that protesters shouldn't be arrested for protesting, might not. However, under U.S. law, the police are never required to enforce any law. See Castle Rock v. Gonzales.  In this case, the NYPD probably just decided that the benefit that the city could have secured by enforcing this law wasn't worth it, in terms of costs 
to the city, making the city safer, and the public image of the NYPD. For example, the city would have had to pay to book and incarcerate the protestors in crowded and expensive jails, and then fight expensive legal battles in petty misdemeanor court prosecutions to defend the anti-nudity law, an issue that isn't a priority for the city's scarce resources at the moment. There is always a risk that any mass arrest could turn a peaceful gathering into a dangerous riot. And, those anti-nudity laws are on the books primarily do deal with drunks and flashers, not anti-censorship protestors. A loss in court in one of these cases (as unlikely as it might be) would undermine the ability of the NYPD to enforce the anti-nudity law in the kind of cases it was actually intended to address, in which a first amendment challenge would almost surely not succeed. Arresting a bunch of naked people wouldn't be fun and would look bad in on the nightly news, and getting naked protestors off the street wouldn't make NYC a safer place. So, they chose not to enforce a law that they could have enforced if they had decided to do so. Warning the protestors that they were violating the law would also not have served the NYPD's purpose. If they gave a warning and then didn't follow up when the warning was ignored, that would undermine the NYPD's credibility in future protests. And, even a warning could cause fear to spread throughout the crowd increasing the risk of a peaceful protest turning into a dangerous riot. Training materials for law enforcement officers reflect these concerns (see internal pages 55-56 in the linked materials): Mass arrests during demonstrations in Washington, D.C., New York City
  and other major locales have been criticized. In some cases, the
  protest activity, while unlawful, was not necessarily violent.
  Complaints included that law-abiding protestors and passersby were
  rounded up and detained along with violators in overly broad sweeps.
  The negative impact of these media images damages the public
  perception of the police operation, as it draws into question the
  reasonableness and proportionality of the police response. Subsequent
  litigation has proven to be particularly costly. In most instances
  only a tiny number of those arrested actually appear in court and most
  of those are charged with offenses that would not normally attract an
  arrest or detention (Temple 2003). Law enforcement agencies need to
  ensure that operational commanders have a clear and uniform
  understanding of the mass-arrest policy to be followed. Litigation has included criticism of understaffed prisoner processing
  operations that, when overwhelmed, led to inordinate detention without
  charge. This occurred at the Republican National Convention in 2004
  and led to court instructions and fines for inordinate delay in
  processing detained persons (New York Times 2004).  Research into recent mass-arrest operations shows that arrests are
  easily accomplished. The areas where problems arise with sudden, but
  now predictable, regularity are The quality of evidence available to pursue prosecution against each individual; The logistics of transporting and handling large numbers of prisoners; Allowing legal and medical access; An inordinate delay in arranging for release or bringing persons to court; Not enough police on duty to cope with the above—process centers are frequently overwhelmed at an early stage due to lack of resources; and In some cases, the courts have ruled that top police officials can be held personally liable for damages or actions. Mass arrests are generally advisable only when all alternative tactics
  have either been tried unsuccessfully or are unlikely to be effective
  under specific circumstances. When mass-arrest tactics are used,
  evidence against each individual prisoner must be available to support
  the charges.  Arrest tactics training is a critical component of mission success.
  The training must address the spectrum of event types: non-violent
  protest, non-violent civil disobedience, passive resistance (including
  the use of chains, sleeves and other devices to impede arrest) and
  violent confrontation. Training must recognize the difference between
  two arrest scenarios: Arrest tactics where police are in control of the environment and have time to plan and implement the arrests or dispersal in a
  controlled manner, (e.g., at a sit-down protest); and Arrest tactics where police do not control the environment (e.g., when police are trying to re-establish control of the environment by
  arresting violent demonstrators). Pressure point techniques, in conjunction with empty hand control,
  efficient handcuffing, and arrestee escort methods should be included
  to remove protesters humanely while minimizing risk of injury to
  protestors and police. Such tactics should be part of ongoing and
  regular refresher training to ensure officers maintain efficiency. Tactical commanders present at many of the demonstration events
  reviewed by PERF agreed that unless the actions of certain protestors
  necessitate their removal, the better course of action is not to
  expend resources on arrests. For example, in instances where sleeping
  dragons are situated so as to disrupt traffic, it may be less of a
  drain on already-thin operational resources to simply monitor them and
  reroute traffic. Moreover, protest organizers have on occasion
  scheduled “officer intensive” diversions just before they undertake
  more violent or destructive actions elsewhere, calculating that the
  police would be too busy handling the mass arrest to respond to
  further actions. Pretty much anyone with common sense knows that it isn't smart to disturb a sleeping dragon in the middle of an intersection in New York City. Trying to try to arrest a dragon is very hard and dragons can afford to pay good lawyers with their treasure hordes. But, police also have to consider more difficult choices like the choices presented by this nude protest."
Why is the structure of the US Code so poor? (And would it even be legal to reorganize it?),"Are there any underlying reasons behind the nonsensical structure of
  U.S.C. titles? Is it simply a case of ""This is how it's been for
  awhile, don't fix what isn't broken."" or is there more to it than
  that? First of all, the United States Code is generally not designed to be used by non-lawyers. Second, one of the main ways to research case law interpreting a statute is by doing a boolean search on the code section of that statute. Every time you change a title or section number, you impair the ability of people doing legal research (both judges and lawyers) to find previous case law interpreting the meaning of the statute.  Third, you make it much harder to determine when the substance of the provision was originally enacted (e.g. if you want legislative history or to determine which of two conflicting statutory provisions was enacted first) since an annotated statute will often show when the current section was enacted but will not explain what it was derived from. Fourth, the location of a statute within the context of other statutory sections often informs its meaning. Machine gun may have one definition in two or three laws, and a different one in two or three other laws, and there may be yet other laws where machine gun is an undefined term. Moving a statutory section from one part of the code to another could influence the default definition that one uses for an undefined term changing substantive law. Fifth, usually a new codification will also involve some drafting standards, for example, to add gender neutrality or to avoid notoriously ambiguous constructions (like 250 word sentences). But, it isn't at all uncommon for very slight changes like the position of a comma or the formatting of a section with multiple indents, to result in a change of the likely meaning of a somewhat ambiguous statute and it is pretty much impossible to know a priori when a statutory section is ambiguous until you are confronted with a fact pattern that makes the ambiguity in that context clear. This isn't confined to obscure laws of little importance. For example, the question of whether Obamacare applied in states that hadn't set up their own exchanges hinged on these kinds of issues. None of this is to say that you should never recodify the statutes. But, a basically aesthetic motivation that mostly matters to people who make up a tiny portion of the main users of the product (non-lawyers) that poses multiple threats to how statutes will be located using legal research tools, and how it will be interpreted once located, means that reorganizing statutes is not something to be done lightly. In short, there are a lot of serious, substantive costs that can accompany a recodification of a law. As a result, re-codification is most often done only as part of an overall omnibus reform of an area of law on the merits where the interest in being able to track prior interpretive caselaw and determine the original meaning of a statute enacted long ago is at its lowest. Barring the even more ridiculous case of Congress repealing everything
  and passing the exact same laws again, just under different
  Titles/Chapters/etc,  This is not so ridiculous.  Most states have done exactly that one or two times in their history (sometimes more for older states). Also, many newly admitted to the union states also do something similar. For example, the basic template for the statutes in Colorado was the statutes of the state of Illinois. Basically, the first time around, somebody started with an Illinois statute book, eliminated Illinois specific laws and laws that they didn't like, rearranged them and adopted them as the original statutes of the State of Colorado (it may have actually been version 2.0 after a stopgap set of statutes, I don't recall which). Also, most states completely repeal and readopt all of their statutes in codified form on the recommendation of the codifier to a legislative committee, to reflect the acts passed in the previous session, every year. This doesn't involve overhauls really, but in principle is a complete repeal and reenactment. While the federal government has never overhauled the entire U.S. Code in this manner, it has been done at the level of individual titles of the U.S. Code.  For example, the most recent major reorganization and overhaul of the structure of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26) was in 1986. The copyright laws were overhauled in the late 1970s. Both of those accompanied major substantive changes in those areas of law. Another major recodification of many parts of the U.S. Code took place following 9-11 in connection with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, which reorganized both the bureaucracy and the associated U.S. Code language associated with dozens of federal agencies. would it be possible for Congress to arbitrarily
  merge, combine, and delete Titles, and to rearrange the location of
  laws, definitions, etc? Are there laws/regulations governing this? Yes. Congress can do so any time it wants by passing a bill (it would be the longest bill ever - dozens of volumes long) doing so, and getting the President to sign it. The legislative process would be exactly the same as any other bill."
What is the meaning of “and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” in the 14th amendment?,"In the case of United States vs Wong Kim Ark 169 U.S. 649 (1898) (a 6-2 decision), the Supreme Court wrote: [T]he real object of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, in qualifying the words, ""All persons born in the United States"" by the addition ""and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,"" would appear to have been to exclude, by the fewest and fittest words (besides children of members of the Indian tribes, standing in a peculiar relation to the National Government, unknown to the common law), the two classes of cases -- children born of alien enemies in hostile occupation and children of diplomatic representatives of a foreign State -- both of which, as has already been shown, by the law of England and by our own law from the time of the first settlement of the English colonies in America, had been recognized exceptions to the fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the country. ... [T]he Fourteenth Amendment affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory, in the allegiance and under the protection of the country, including all children here born of resident aliens, with the exceptions or qualifications (as old as the rule itself) of children of foreign sovereigns or their ministers, or born on foreign public ships, or of enemies within and during a hostile occupation of part of our territory, and with the single additional exception of children of members of the Indian tribes owing direct allegiance to their several tribes. The Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United States, of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States. ... To hold that the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution excludes from citizenship the children, born in the United States, of citizens or subjects of other countries would be to deny citizenship to thousands of persons of English, Scotch, Irish, German, or other European parentage who have always been considered and treated as citizens of the United States. In short the phrase  “and subject to the jurisdiction thereof”  excludes three and only three groups of people: Children born to foreign diplomats here on diplomatic business, who have diplomatic immunity to US Law; Children of members of an invading army that has occupied and controlled some part of US territory, born on that occupied area, who are obviously not subject to US Law (which has rarely happened in the US, although Guam was occupied during WWII, and parts of Alaska, and small parts of Maine during the War of 1812); and Members of Native American tribes, subject to the jurisdiction of their tribal governments, who do not pay US taxes. (This was true when the 14th amendment was passed, but it no longer is. See section below on the act that changed it in 1924.) Any other person born in the proper US or in incorporated US territory is a citizen, no matter who his or her parents are or were.  (The case is less clear for unincorporated US territory.) See also the Wikipedia article on the case This view was confirmed in 1995 in an opinion from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel written by then-Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger, taking the position that this rule could not be changed by legislation, only by Constitutional Amendment, writing: My  office  grapples  with  many  difficult  and  close  issues  of constitutional  law. The  lawfulness  of this  bill  is  not  among  them. This  legislation  is unquestionably unconstitutional.  The  Fourteenth  Amendment declares that  “[a]ll persons bom or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the  United  States  and  of the  State  wherein  they  reside.”  U.S.  Const,  amend. XIV,  § 1. The unmistakable purpose of this  provision was  to constitutionalize  the
existing  Anglo-American  common  law  rule  of jus  soli  or citizenship  by place  of birth  and especially  to extend  it to persons of African descent and their descendants. In Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982)  the Supreme Court of the United States struck down both a state statute denying funding for education to children in the United States illegally and a municipal school district's attempt to charge an annual $1,000 tuition fee for each student. The case upheld the same principle that the constitutional phrase ""within the jurisdiction"" applies to the children of people who had entered the US illegally. According to the Wikipedia article on the case: Texas officials had argued that illegal aliens were not ""within the jurisdiction"" of the state and thus could not claim protections under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court majority rejected this claim, finding instead that ""no plausible distinction with respect to Fourteenth Amendment 'jurisdiction' can be drawn between resident immigrants whose entry into the United States was lawful, and resident immigrants whose entry was unlawful."" The dissenting opinion also rejected this claim, agreeing with the Court that ""the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to immigrants who, after their illegal entry into this country, are indeed physically 'within the jurisdiction' of a state."" Thus the question of whether such aliens were  ""within the jurisdiction"" of the US was very much at issue in Plyler v. Doe EDIT:
Since the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 was passed, all Native Americans born within the US have been citizens by birth, and the third class of exceptions noted in the earlier cases non longer exists.  Prior to this act Native Americans were in many ways treated as foreigners by the US. They were not citizens by birth, and their tribes had some but not all of the attributes of independent nations. The text of the law is: Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That all non citizen Indians born within the territorial limits of the United States be, and they are hereby, declared to be citizens of the United States: Provided That the granting of such citizenship shall not in any manner impair or otherwise affect the right of any Indian to tribal or other property. (End edit on Indian Citizenship Act of 1924) Edit: On reading through the decision of the case of Wong Kim Ark I find one more small exclusion: persons born on board a foreign naval ship, even though present in US waters in time of peace, are not citizens of the US because of their birth location. This is apparently not a usual case, but is premised on the ground that a military vessel remains the territory of the nation it belongs to. Such persons might of course be citizens by inheritance if one or both parents are US citizens, and the statutory conditions are complied with.  (The term ""public ship"" in the 1800s was used to mean a national ship, that is a military ship.)
(End edit on naval ships) I just learned that some parts of the State of Maine were occupied by the British during the war of 1812. I do not know if anyone was born during that occupation whose citizenship might have been affected."
Why are people sentenced to prison for terms longer than life?,"Summary It tends to happen when someone is found guilty of multiple crimes.  Sentences involving multiple convictions can be either concurrent or cumulative.  Often, the law the defendant broke will specify whether the sentence should be concurrent or cumulative.  Background  As an example of the latter, if a defendant is convicted of four cumulative crimes that have 15, 20, 10, and 5 year sentences, which often (though not necessarily) happens at the same trial, you'd expect to see a 50 year sentence. In reality, it can be a complicated math problem, and many---though not all---jurisdictions have sentencing guidelines.  For example, the united-states federal system uses the following guidelines. That said, the judge's discretion plays an important role, and where they don't have to follow a mandatory formula, judges often consider criminal history, crime severity, need to protect the public, and so forth. As a side note, some really long sentences are just a way to express public outrage.  The three Madrid train bombers (2004, multiple murder counts) each received at least a 30,000 year sentence, although Spanish law caps imprisonment at 40 years."
Course of action in a criminal case when there is no conceivable defense,"This question underestimates how much of a criminal defense lawyer's work involves sentencing rather than a determination of guilt or innocence. Suppose as the OP does that the prosecution can easily prove beyond a reasonable doubt that your client is guilty, you client has no plausible defenses, and the prosecutor won't budge on a plea. As a criminal defense lawyer, you may well advise your client that there is no percentage in fighting guilt on the charges, and have your client plea guilty. This prevents the prosecutor from spelling out for many hours in excruciating detail exactly why your client is guilty and the harm the resulted from the crime, which could harden the judge in the sentencing phase. It also frees up a client's often scarce resources for legal work that is likely to be more fruitful and for things like paying fees associated with alternative sentencing programs and paying restitution. It is an empirical fact that judges sentence criminal defendants who plea guilty, even in the absence of a plea bargain, less harshly on average, than criminal defendants who insist on going to trial. (When there is a plea bargain ""sentences following convictions at trial are five times larger than sentences received by those who plead guilty"".) Often the sentencing premium for going to trial is stunningly large to the point where it has been argued that it amounts to an unconstitutional burden imposed upon the right to a jury trial. Then, you focus entirely on the sentencing phase of the case. Short of first degree murder and a handful of other crimes, there is almost always some discretion on the part of the judge regarding the sentence to be imposed, no matter how clearly guilt is established. Often a judge has the power to sentence someone guilty of a minor felony to probation or a ""boot camp"" or ""community corrections"" or even a fine without incarceration, rather than a prison term. Often a judge has a wide range of possible lengths of incarceration (especially in misdemeanor cases and for very serious felonies). Often the corrections department has considerable discretion over which facility to commit a client to and some are better than others. So paying attention to the facility assignment process also matters. Where a defendant is facing both state and federal criminal charges, it sometimes makes sense when conviction on all charges is likely, to plea guilty immediately to the federal charges so that the defendant is already in federal prison before pleading guilty to or going to trial on the state charges, so that if the defendant is sentenced to serve time for the state and federal charges concurrently because they arose from the same incident, the time is spent in the more pleasant federal prison rather than the less pleasant state prison. (This is the case because violent crimes are overwhelmingly prosecuted under state law, while a large share of federal crimes are white collar or are for immigration and non-violent drug offenses. So, your fellow inmates tend to be less vicious in federal prison.) Not infrequently, state prosecutors will even drop state charges to conserve their scarce resources, if they know that the defendant is already facing a significant term of incarceration following a conviction on federal charges. A criminal defense lawyer thus almost has something to argue at sentencing because there is almost never only one possible result of a sentencing hearing even if all of the facts are not in any dispute whatsoever. The judge's interpretation of what those facts should imply in terms of a sentence is always up for debate and argument. As a criminal defense attorney in a case like this, your job is: to present your client in the best light possible, to locate witnesses who will testify that he has support in the community and that he is basically a good guy despite this particular lapse, to marshal testimony that extended incarceration will be a hardship to someone dependent on him, to have him sincerely apologize to the victim and try to do something immediately to make it up to the victim and to show regret and contrition, to support him in not violating terms of pre-sentencing release if any, and perhaps even to see if charges that might otherwise bring him into a recidivist sentencing regime can be sealed or vacated for any reason. You present mitigating evidence regarding IQ or mental health conditions or prior military service or poverty or provocation that explain your client's conduct even if it doesn't excuse it. You try to get the prosecutor to agree that a harsh sentence isn't necessary here, or even to support an alternative sentencing option. Prosecutors are frequently more sensitive to their win-loss record of securing convictions than to precisely how the people they convict are punished. You scrutinize the pre-sentencing report for any inaccuracies and prepare to prove that they are inaccurate. You litigate which category your client belongs in under the sentencing guidelines that apply, if any, which are often the subject of much less case law and hence for more room for interpretation. For example, in a recent case handled by another lawyer in my office (I don't do criminal work myself, but have colleagues who do), the client's sentence was reduced by more than 95% from what the prosecution requested because they had meant to charge 300 counts of a municipal ordinance violation for which each day counted as a violation, but actually charged our client with only 2 counts of the municipal ordinance violation and the judge held the prosecution at sentencing to only a sentence based upon the offense actually charged in the relevant documents. You prepare to explain to the appropriate people how maintaining community ties through visitation will reduce his odds of recidivism if he is located at a more favored correctional facility rather than a less favorable one. You prepare to explain to the appropriate people that your client's survival would be a risk based upon the gangs present at a less favored correctional facility, or that he would be more likely to join a gang and thus commit more crimes upon release at a less favored correctional facility. You get your client to be cooperative in paying any restitution he can afford to pay even before the court orders him to do so. You find decent clothes for him to wear to his sentencing so he doesn't look like a thug and teach him what not to say at sentencing that would piss of the judge. Do his hair in a way that makes him look as vulnerable and inoffensive as possible. Cover his tattoos and remove his piercings as much as possible. If your client is black, find a white or Asian-American relative or mentor or girlfriend or supporter to stand at his side and support him in court. This shouldn't matter but it almost always does. If your client doesn't speak English well, find a relative or mentor or girlfriend or supporter to testify in fluent English in support of leniency and make sure that there is an interpreter lined up for his sentencing hearing. You remind the judge of other more serious cases involving the same offense to which your client's can be compared, or of the sentences imposed on more culpable co-defendants to suggest that your client's sentence should be less severe. You downplay the harm caused and emphasize your client's future prospects. You help the judge relate to your client anyway that you can. You may need to research the judge's background and history of sentencing decisions to find out what this particular judge does or does not find persuasive in sentencing hearings. A criminal defense attorney who presents a solid sentencing case may leave the client who receives a near minimal sentence on that charge with a lighter sentence than one who plea bargains to a lesser charge but then botches the sentencing phase resulting in the client getting  near maximal sentence on the lesser charge. Consider, for example, the attorney who represented Brock Turner, a Stanford student convicted of raping an unconscious woman in public in the face of overwhelming evidence against him who none the less, was sentenced to just six months of incarceration (reduced further for good behavior in jail). Another attorney could have plea bargained down to simple assault and still left his client with a more harsh sentence. Turner's attorney was so effective in securing a lenient sentence that the sentencing judge was recalled for the first time in 87 years in California for his leniency. So, the notion that a good criminal defense attorney's job is over when the client has no chance of establishing his innocence is just fundamentally wrong. Roughly 90% of criminal defendants will plead guilty and half of the rest will be convicted. The vast majority of these criminal defendants are guilty of something, even if not the exact offense of conviction. The criminal defense attorneys' job isn't mostly about getting acquittals for clients who are the vast majority of the time guilty of something, it is about securing a non-excessive sentence for the conduct committed. Even in the majority of cases that don't conclude with a plea bargain, most of the job is about the sentencing phase, where there is almost always more judicial discretion, and not about the guilt-innocence phase of the case."
Is it kidnapping if I steal a car that happens to have a baby in it?,"In colorado, it appears that the kidnapping statutes do not apply if the act is not ""knowing"" or if the perpetrator lacks intent. Any person who does any of the following acts with the intent thereby to force the victim or any other person to make any concession or give up anything of value in order to secure a release of a person under the offender's actual or apparent control commits first degree kidnapping: (a) Forcibly seizes and carries any person from one place to another;  or (b) Entices or persuades any person to go from one place to another;  or (c) Imprisons or forcibly secretes any person. 2.  Any person who takes, entices, or decoys away any child not his own under the age of eighteen years with intent to keep or conceal the child from his parent or guardian or with intent to sell, trade, or barter such child for consideration commits second degree kidnapping. As @ohwilleke pointed out in this answer, this means that as soon as the hypothetical car thief becomes aware that the child is in the car and doesn't then act to return the child to their parents, it becomes second-degree kidnapping.  (It's also possible that CO case law has interpreted the statutes differently than I'm interpreting them here, but the plain language seems to require the actual intent to take and/or confine a person illicitly.)"
Is requesting waiving the right to deletion of contributions against GDPR?,"Yes, their waiver has no legal basis and is invalid under the GDPR.  They should have hired a better lawyer. GDPR rights cannot be waived (mrllp.com). The last bit should have been: Therefore, in consideration of my participation in any project, I understand that retaining my name and email address, as described above, does not require my consent and that the right of erasure, as spelled out in the GDRP Article 17 (1) b does not apply. The legal basis for our lawful processing of this personal data is Article 6 (1) f (""processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller""). I.e. there is nothing in the GDPR that compels GitLab to erase this information, but their waiver is bogus. Keeping track of individual contributions in a software projects is necessary for a number of reasons, including security (if somebody contributes code that jeopardizes security, you want to audit everything that person has contributed)."
"Can I ask a cop, ""What happened?""","You are allowed to ask the police whatever questions you like. There is an upper limit that you can't refuse to obey a lawful order on the premise that you want to ask a bunch of questions, but they don't seem to have ordered you to do anything, so you can ask away. They have no obligation to tell you anything or to be truthful, except for certain questions like ""am I free to go"" when you want to leave and are testing whether you are under arrest. Even then they don't have to answer your questions right away. The police can therefore ignore you, especially if you are asking curiosity questions. It might be that they are restricted from giving information in certain circumstances (pertaining to the privacy of others). If there is an issue of legitimate concern (e.g. Little Billy has been beating up on cats again) and you feel that you need to know this, then you can request the police record on the matter. Certain information will probably be redacted under state law, but you could get a report that states that some [redacted] juvenile was beating up on animals. The Florida records law is one of the first in he nation, dating back to 1909. You can read this, to see if you think the circumstances match one of the exemptions, though all you have to do is make the request and be told that the record is exempt, then you will have some idea what was going on."
How is it possible for millions to use pirated software at home and never get arrested?,"Not all things that we commonly refer to as ""illegal"" are actually crimes - many of them refer to violations of contracts or other obligations where the harmed party may (or may not) use the civil system to obtain some satisfaction, but the government and prosecutors will not do it for them. In general (with some exceptions, depends on jurisdiction and circumstances), most low scale copyright violations are treated as a civil matter - it allows the harmed party (i.e. the copyright owner) to sue you for damages in a civil court, if they wish and are able to do so. However, it generally is not a crime (again, with some exceptions - e.g. large scale distribution often is) so the government and police on their own cannot, should not and does not investigate and prosecute violations of software licence terms. "
Why are Russian combatants in Ukraine considered soldiers rather than terrorists?,"The third Geneva convention says in its second article (emphasis added): the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance. The violence in Ukraine qualifies for at least two reasons: it is an armed conflict between two high contracting parties, and it is a case of partial occupation of the territory of a high contracting party.  ""Members of the armed forces"" of Russia who have ""fallen into the power of [Ukraine]"" are therefore protected by the provisions of the convention as prisoners of war as defined in the convention's fourth article. It follows from this that the parenthetical commentary in the question's third bullet point is incorrect: refusing to call this ""military action"" a ""war"" does not in fact ""unilaterally waive the protection of law of war for Russian forces."" As to the allegation in the second point, even a prisoner of war who is suspected of committing a war crime is entitled to the convention's protections.  Any punishment for the war crime is to be imposed by due process of law.  The fact that war crimes may have been committed by other elements of Russia's armed forces is even less of a justification to deny the convention's protections to prisoners who are not individually suspected of war crimes."
Can a Resident Assistant be told to ignore a lawful order?',"There is a state law that requires you to obey the police: ORC 2917.13, which says you may not Fail to obey the lawful order of any law enforcement officer engaged
  in the law enforcement officer's duties at the scene of or in
  connection with a fire, accident, disaster, riot, or emergency of any
  kind. If you do,  misconduct at an emergency is a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If a
  violation of this section creates a risk of physical harm to persons
  or property, misconduct at an emergency is a misdemeanor of the first
  degree. You also cannot Hamper the lawful operations of any law enforcement officer,
  firefighter, rescuer, medical person, emergency medical services
  person, or other authorized person, engaged in the person's duties at
  the scene of a fire, accident, disaster, riot, or emergency of any
  kind ""Hamper"" is not defined statutorily, but the plain meaning of ""hamper"" is not the same as ""fail to assist"". We have not established that the order is lawful, however, which is crucial. The police cannot just freely search a residence without permission. If they have permission from the occupant, they can search and seize. If they have probable cause to believe that a crime exists and the circumstances make a warrant impractical, they can search and seize. I don't know what you mean by ""wellness check"", but that seems plainly to be unlawful entry. However, if the resident calls 911 and reports that he is having an issue, that is sufficient consent for entry.  In the case of a fire alarm, the fire code authorizes a fire department official in charge of an actual emergency response incident to order the evacuation of a building, and occupants are required to comply. If we suppose that the smoke detector in a room has gone off, the fire department is authorized to inspect for fire, and there is a provision under the law about failure to obey a lawful command (to open the door so that they can look for fire). Problem: you cannot know whether the order is lawful. The officer doesn't decide what is lawful, the courts do (after the fact), and typically a command is found to be lawful unless it is clearly unlawful. The order from your supervisor is not ""enforceable"" in the sense that you cannot be arrested, imprisoned, or fined for disobeying your boss. However, there is a potential club they can use against you, namely firing you for disobeying the order. Normally, you can be fired for wearing the wrong shirt. But there are laws about employers doing illegal things, such as ORC 4113.52, which provides recourse when the employee reasonably believes that the violation is a criminal
  offense that is likely to cause an imminent risk of physical harm to
  persons or a hazard to public health or safety etc. In which case you report this to the supervisor, they have 24 hours after getting the report to correct the situation, and after that you would report the situation to the county prosecutor. (Read all of the details in the linked law, don't just skip steps: this is an executive summary). Having done this, you are protected from being fired, demoted. reassigned etc. The employer will be strongly motivated to not incur the penalties for violating the whistle blower statute. Additionally, you can sue the employer if they fire you for refusing to violate the law (termination in violation of public policy)."
What if a law is literally impossible to follow?,"There may be a purpose to have laws which are impossible to follow. (I'm neither a lawyer nor a politician, following points are what I like to call qualified hearsay - they come from qualified people I know personally but were given as a remark or during a chat over a cup of coffee and therefore are not easily substantiable with rigorous sources. You can treat them as a hypothetical ideas for your thought experiments.) Everybody is implicitly guilty Confident citizens and transparent law is the worst enemy of totalitarian regime. You learn to live with ingrained feeling that there surely is something you are guilty of. Merely being addressed by police makes you nervous and malleable; should you stand up against oppression, it is easy for the state apparat to detain or convict you of one or more default offenses.  A good example would be the law present in many, if not all, socialist bloc countries saying that knowing of a comrade having commited an offense or merely planing to and not reporting it to authorities is an offense in itself. Whether you did or did not know would be determined by the authorities. Make your laws very strict with a hope thay they will be followed at least to a degree Not laws in themselves, but standards (technical norms) regarding nuclear power stations in the former Soviet Union were strict to the point where they were technically impossible to follow given the state of the art. For example the standards for manufacture of high pressure pipes would state very low level of material impurities that when the actual manufactured material contained twice the level of impurities the pipe will still be very safe to operate. In a centrally planned economy with ever more ambitious production projections and declared zero need for contingency this was one of several ways how to create a bit of a wiggle room. (Source: I once worked for a nuclear power research institute supporting Soviet technology and was told this by an expert on stainless steel.) So there you have a bit of an illustration what may happen if a law is intentionally impossible to follow. Since you labelled your question 'United States', I believe the follow-up question is why would anyone want to propose such a law."
"If a signal person in California tells me to kill someone, do I have to do so?","You are not reading a law book here and you should not interpret a driving test so literally. It's quite clear that the question implies you should follow all of their instructions regarding how to proceed through traffic. Sometimes those instructions do involve ""breaking laws"" such as driving on the wrong side of the road or proceeding through a traffic signal that was not turned off. The B option clearly does not mean they have the power to disobey all laws in existence, only those concerning traffic as evidenced by the examples given. You are not Sheldon Cooper and you should know how to interpret a vague question correctly. You are also not a gopher, and you can correctly deduce that crashing into another car or driving off the cliff into the water is not in your best interests, and that calling the police to report someone abusing their position is probably a good idea. If you're concerned by the wording, try contacting the California DMV to have them clarify the wording."
Can I forbid the government from using my patented invention?,"You cannot deny the federal government the right to use your patent, but you can sue them for ""recovery of [your] reasonable and entire compensation for such use and manufacture"", see 28 USC 1498. Note that the statute refers to such use as being ""without license of the owner thereof or lawful right to use or manufacture the same"", that is, there is no lawful right to infringe on a patent, but recourse for infringement is highly limited. A suit against the government under §1498 is (see the summary in Airborne Data v. US, 702 F.2d 1350) on an eminent domain theory. It has been long established that the right under eminent domain is only constitutionally limited by the requirement for compensation, so there is no need to say ""and you may not seek an injunction"". Para (b) which was added later may have explicitly limited jurisdiction to the Court of Federal Claims. There has been inconsistency in the court's interpretation of the jurisdiction requirement (Leeson v. US, vs.
Manville  Sales  v.  Paramount,  917  F.2d  544), though precedent has been that the Court of Claims has jurisdiction. Para (b) makes that explicit."
Is it illegal to infringe copyright if your boss or your client ordered you to do it?,"There are two parts to copyright liability: civil and criminal. TL;DR: both cases are criminal offences, and it is illegal to break the law even when you are paid to do it.  In the USA criminal copyright infringement requires a deliberate act to infringe copyright for commercial gain. Both of the scenarios meet these requirements. In the UK (and probably the rest of Europe) criminal copyright infringement includes possess in the course of a business an article which is, and which you know or have reason to believe is an infringing copy of a copyright work with a view to committing any act infringing the copyright. Again, both these scenarios meet this requirement. In the first scenario you are acting as an employee, so you don't have any personal civil liability for damages; that goes to your employer. However you still have, at least in theory, criminal liability.  In the second scenario you are your own employer and so have both civil and criminal liability. Your client will share some liability as they have provided inducement to break the law. The best way of dealing with the first scenario is to point out to the boss that he is ordering you to commit a crime. Cite the law in your jurisdiction and the penalties for breaking it. Do this by email so that you have evidence of having told him, and take a printed copy of the email home with you just in case (if your boss isn't above criminal copyright infringement he may also not be above tampering with evidence). If you are in a big company then a CC to HR might also be indicated. If the boss is the company owner then you are in a stickier situation; your best option is probably to perpetuate the evidence as above and start looking for an employer who doesn't break the law. The second scenario is simpler: just refuse to do it."
Would Trump's defence work in other courts?,"The meaning of any utterance can only be understood through implicit or explicit interpretation. A prosecutor trying to prove that Trump incited an insurrection must, as hszmv layed out, show I'll focus on the first requirement because you ask specifically about whether ambiguous language can prevent the prosecution from proving that he meant that. The question concerns the core of all communication: How do we know the meaning of something? The most basic theory, a mere description in fact, lists three steps of information transmission: We can assume that the transmission and the physical level of encoding and decoding was near-perfect; there was a sound system and there are recordings, so there is not much ambiguity on actual signal. The prosecution must then show that Trumps ambiguous wording was an encoded incitement of insurrection. They must ""reverse-engineer"" the encoding Trump did, that is, decode it from Trump's perspective. As an example, take the sentence ""Give him the special treatment."" Obviously a waiter in a bar whose boss just pointed out a celebrity would not go and shoot the patron. On the other hand, a gang of Mafia henchmen would not go and give their victim the best table in the house after hearing this from their boss. The respective recipients properly decode it because they consider the context. Natural language is imbued with meaning by context. (As an aside, that's why it is hard to understand for artificial intelligence1.) Examples for context are A court needs to — implicitly or explicitly — reproduce this encoding considering the relevant context. Whether you like it or not, to answer the question we necessarily must investigate the intended meaning of this particular use of ""fight""; since you are not interested in the details I have moved it to the footnotes.2  But it is for first reasons unavoidable that prosecution, defense and court each must perform an interpretation — namely the attempt to reproduce the speakers ""encoding process"" — of the spoken words. 1 As a famous urban myth example: ""The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak"" was translated by an AI as ""the liqueur went down nicely but the steak was bad."" 2 Yes, fight can have different meanings in different circumstances. If you make an appeal to ""join ChildFund in the fight against child mortality"" no one will reach for their baseball bat. But Trump's use of ""fight"" was in a decidedly different context from which we can infer its meaning. The passage started with ""we will never give up, we will never concede"" (emphasis mine). ""Concede"" has a specific meaning in an election context: It means that one accepts the result of the election and adjusts one's behavior accordingly (prepares to move out of the office, starts the transition of command etc.). At this point the election result had been confirmed by the relevant administrations and courts. The statement ""we will never concede"" under these circumstances is the refusal to acknowledge the outcome of a legal procedure. It is a resolution to be lawless. This is the stage that was set for his infamous ""If you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore"". The context is a commitment and appeal to lawlessness; the audience is not a convention of lawyers who would fight in court; it is not an assembly of campaign workers who go out and fight for every vote; this is a partially armed crowd of vigilantes. ""Fight"" in this context must be understood as a physical, violent conflict. This appeal passes legal muster which renders it unprotected by the first amendment: - The action is imminent: The speech is held in the vicinity of the Capitol, with a crowd ready to take action.
- The action called for is unlawful: As we established, he calls for a violent intervention.
- Trump has mens rea: He openly refuses to lawfully concede. The call for violent intervention is a call to help him resist his removal from office. His speech is a conscious appeal for an imminent, unlawful, potentially armed intervention against the final outcome of an election. It is an incitement of insurrection."
Can illegal aliens claim sanctuary in a church?,"The case you identify is not unique. For example, the Unitarian church in Denver has done much the same thing. There is not a legal right to sanctuary in a church. But, as a manner of law enforcement discretion and public relations and customary traditions of law enforcement respect for churches that long predate the formation of the USA, law enforcement routinely acts as if there was a right to sanctuary in churches (in the absence, for example, of an active shooter situation or a hostage crisis or a kidnapping with a missing victim). I am not aware of any case in which immigration officials have taken push to shove and breached a claim of sanctuary by a church protecting an illegal immigrant in a church.  In England, where there was an established church, the established Anglican Church historically did have a right to intervene in certain ways in the criminal justice process (e.g. the ""privilege of clergy""). UPDATE (February 21, 2017): My original answer was not entirely correct so I am updating this post. It turns out that in 2011 that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement made what was previously a mere custom into an official policy, something I was not previously aware of. The answer, it turns out, is policy and tradition. A 2011 Immigration
  and Customs Enforcement policy defines churches, schools and hospitals
  as ""sensitive places"" where enforcement actions should be limited. And
  the tradition of sheltering those who need it goes back to the Middle
  Ages, said David Poundstone with the Mountain View Friends Meeting. The official policy is set forth here. The policy is in the public domain and given the interest this post has generated I post it in full below: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and
  Border Protection (CBP) have made available Frequently Asked Questions
  (FAQs) to supplement existing guidance concerning enforcement actions
  at or focused on sensitive locations and clarify what types of
  locations are covered by these policies.  The ICE and CBP sensitive locations policies, which remain in effect,
  provide that enforcement actions at sensitive locations should
  generally be avoided, and require either prior approval from an
  appropriate supervisory official or exigent circumstances
  necessitating immediate action.  DHS is committed to ensuring that
  people seeking to participate in activities or utilize services
  provided at any sensitive location are free to do so without fear or
  hesitation. Do the Department of Homeland Security's policies concerning
  enforcement actions at or focused on sensitive locations remain in
  effect? U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and
  Border Protection (CBP) have each issued and implemented policies
  concerning enforcement actions at or focused on sensitive locations.
  The ICE Sensitive Locations Policy and the CBP Sensitive Locations
  Policy remain in effect, and these FAQs are intended to clarify what
  types of locations are covered by those policies. What do the Department of Homeland Security policies require for
  enforcement actions to be carried out at sensitive locations? The policies provide that enforcement actions at or focused on
  sensitive locations such as schools, places of worship, and hospitals
  should generally be avoided, and that such actions may only take place
  when (a) prior approval is obtained from an appropriate supervisory
  official, or (b) there are exigent circumstances necessitating
  immediate action without supervisor approval.  The policies are meant
  to ensure that ICE and CBP officers and agents exercise sound judgment
  when enforcing federal law at or focused on sensitive locations, to
  enhance the public understanding and trust, and to ensure that people
  seeking to participate in activities or utilize services provided at
  any sensitive location are free to do so, without fear or hesitation. What does the Department of Homeland Security mean by the term
  “sensitive location”? Locations covered by these policies would include, but not be limited
  to: Schools, such as known and licensed daycares, pre-schools and other
  early learning programs; primary schools; secondary schools;
  post-secondary schools up to and including colleges and universities;
  as well as scholastic or education-related activities or events, and
  school bus stops that are marked and/or known to the officer, during
  periods when school children are present at the stop; Medical
  treatment and health care facilities, such as hospitals, doctors’
  offices, accredited health clinics, and emergent or urgent care
  facilities; Places of worship, such as churches, synagogues, mosques,
and temples; Religious or civil ceremonies or observances, such as
funerals and weddings; and During public demonstration, such as a
  march, rally, or parade.  What is an enforcement action? An enforcement action covered by this policy is any action taken by
  ICE or CBP to apprehend, arrest, interview, or search an individual,
  or to surveil an individual for enforcement purposes.   Actions not covered by this policy include activities such as
  obtaining records, documents, and similar materials from officials or
  employees, providing notice to officials or employees, serving
  subpoenas, engaging in Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)
  compliance and certification visits, guarding or securing detainees,
  or participating in official functions or community meetings. Will enforcement actions ever occur at sensitive locations? Enforcement actions may occur at sensitive locations in limited
circumstances, but will generally be avoided.  ICE or CBP officers 
  and agents may conduct an enforcement action at a sensitive location with
  prior approval from an appropriate supervisory official, or if the
  enforcement action involves exigent circumstances. When may an enforcement action be carried out at a sensitive location
  without prior approval? ICE and CBP officers may carry out an enforcement action at a
  sensitive location without prior approval from a supervisor in exigent
  circumstances related to national security, terrorism, or public
  safety, or where there is an imminent risk of destruction of evidence
  material to an ongoing criminal case.  When proceeding with an enforcement action under exigent
  circumstances, officers and agents must conduct themselves as
  discreetly as possible, consistent with officer and public safety, and
  make every effort to limit the time at or focused on the sensitive
  location. Are sensitive locations located along the international border also
  protected? The sensitive locations policy does not apply to operations that are
  conducted within the immediate vicinity of the international border,
  including the functional equivalent of the border.  However, when
  situations arise that call for enforcement actions at or near a
  sensitive location within the immediate vicinity of the international
  border, including its functional equivalent, agents and officers are
  expected to exercise sound judgment and common sense while taking
  appropriate action, consistent with the goals of this policy. Examples of operations within the immediate vicinity of the border
  are, but are not limited to, searches at ports of entry, activities
  undertaken where there is reasonable certainty that an individual just
  crossed the border, circumstances where DHS has maintained
  surveillance of a subject since crossing the border, and circumstances
  where DHS is operating in a location that is geographically further
  from the border but separated from the border by rugged and remote
  terrain. Are courthouses sensitive locations? Courthouses do not fall under ICE or CBP’s policies concerning
  enforcement actions at or focused on sensitive locations.   Where should I report a DHS enforcement action that I believe may be
  inconsistent with these policies? There are a number of locations where an individual may lodge a
  complaint about a particular DHS enforcement action that may have
  taken place in violation of the sensitive locations policy.  You may
  find information about these locations, and information about how to
  file a complaint, on the DHS, CBP, or ICE websites.  You may contact ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) through
  the Detention Reporting and Information Line at (888)351-4024 or
  through the ERO information email address at [email protected],
  also available at https://www.ice.gov/webform/ero-contact-form. The
  Civil Liberties Division of the ICE Office of Diversity and Civil
  Rights may be contacted at (202) 732-0092 or
  [email protected]. You may contact the CBP Information Center to file a complaint or
  compliment via phone at 1 (877) 227-5511, or submit an email through
  the website at https://help.cbp.gov. The policy is drafted in a manner that it doesn't actually prohibit enforcement in a sanctuary, even in the absence of exigent circumstances, but it does call for a process to be followed if this is done, and discourages doing so without prohibiting this action."
Why do lawyers write contracts with language that is more difficult to understand than other works?,"One piece of the puzzle is tradition and habitual writing style. A customary writing style for legal documents evolved over time, some of those conventions have evolved overtime (e.g. ""Party of the first part, party of the second part""), others have not. Archaic vocabulary is slowly being weeded out, but again, it is almost never the goal of someone drafting a contract to reduce the reading level of the document. As long as the judge, or other lawyers, know what it means, it is an aesthetic stylistic issue more than it is a substantive issue of importance. Contract drafting is highly decentralized and change happens only when there is a powerful impetus for change. Does this mean that legal writing can't be improved? No. Some lawyers are excellent writers in both contract drafting and in court documents. A well drafted contact can reduce litigation costs when there are disputes. It can also increase compliance with the intent of the parties by preventing disputes over what the contract means from arising in the first place. But most lawyers are mediocre contract drafters, and there is little selective pressure in transactional legal work to weed out their sub-optimal writing styles. Bryan A. Garner, who among other things is the editor of Black's Law Dictionary, is pretty much the leading figure in the United States pushing for a more modern, more readable, less flabby legal writing style. This is exemplified, for example, in his book ""Legal Writing in Plain English"" (2d ed. 2013). But even then, a lot of the impetus for his stylistic decisions was primarily driven by the need to get across ideas clearly, in a minimum of words, when writing appellate briefs with word limits. This is also the main context in which legal writing is taught in law school and continuing education classes. In contracts, in contrast, in our current era of the word processor, long documents are easy to deliver, and long passages of writing can be cut and pasted. So, the same outside pressures to limit word counts and persuade judges who will read legal briefs cover to cover in order, are not present when drafting contracts. So, the pressure to have a succinct plain language writing style in contracts is less strong. This said, when there has been regulatory pressure to write consumer contracts in a way that an average consumer can understand, it can be done. For example, most credit card agreements are written in very clear plain English with a very low reading level compared to other contracts. But those easy to read credit card agreements are drafted by committees of many lawyers and senior executives, each charging hundreds of dollars an hour, over many meetings over a period of weeks of debate and refinement, and a cost of many tens of thousands of dollars each to draft. The flabby and clunky character of legal writing also reflects client imposed budgetary constraints. It takes much more time and effort, with multiple rounds of rewriting and editing, to write a clean, easy to read contract than it does to write a kludgy one. Lawyers bill by the hour and clients want the job done at a price that they can afford. There is little incentive in contracts that will not be used many times as forms, to take the effort to produce a clean, easy to read final product. This kind of beautifully drafted contract costs much more to draft for the client, but provides little additional legal benefit to the client. Few contracts are ever litigated at all, and when they are, the legal drafting tends to focus on only a handful of key provisions that are carefully drafted. Boilerplate language, which is often less carefully drafted, is very rarely litigated, so the quality of that writing doesn't matter much. As far as capitalization goes, I agree with @user6726 that all-caps writing is often required by law. These requirements were based upon the previous legislative assumption that it was more prominent and more likely to be read, which has since been proved to be false empirically. But new empirical discoveries about readability haven't changed the relevant laws requiring certain language in contracts to be ""prominent"" and in all caps. I would also add that there is a legal writing convention that defined terms have capital letters (although not necessarily all caps), which is a pointer to when one needs to look for a definition, that relaxes the need to put the definitions of capitalized words in the actual sentence where those terms are used. Weird capitalization can facilitate shorter sentences. I'd also agree that the primary audience for contract language is often not an unsophisticated non-lawyer consumer. While it's true that the average American reads at about the 5th grade level and can't do algebra, that person isn't the target audience. In the same vein, you don't write scientific journal articles for an audience of the average American. When push comes to shove, written contracts are interpreted as a matter of law by judges who are legally trained, and not a matter left to a jury of non-lawyers to decide. Most business to business contracts are negotiated by lawyers. Most business to business contracts have as additional audiences sophisticated senior managers of business with some limited formal business law training in college, who also have great familiarity with the class of contracts involved. Even in consumer contracts, when consumer protection regulations and statutes do not compel another approach, the intent is frequently a MEGO effect (My Eyes Glaze Over) in the hope that the consumer, who often isn't at liberty to negotiate the terms anyway, won't decide to read the fine print. The only language in a contract that needs to be clear to the consumer is the actionable part like the price that needs to be understood by the consumer to perform it. And, often those parts of a contract are provided in a separate short summary document with the full contract available for future reference but not intended to be routinely read in full. Furthermore, characteristic legal writing styles can convey a sense of importance and official authority. It sounds like it is and is intended to have legal effect. It's the same reason that fictional magical spells are far more often in Latin or Greek or Sumerian than they are in plain English. Language too ordinary conveys the false impression to a client that anyone could write the contract even if legal skill is implicated in drafting it, and can even cast doubt over whether a document was intended to be a legally binding contract in the eyes of a non-lawyer encountering it. One of the key factors that is identified as making legal writing hard to read is the use of internal definitional clauses within sentences and the use of very long sentences. It is possible to draft without those. But, often including it in the same sentence reflects the drafting lawyer's thought process. It can also reflect a negotiated contract drafting process. Even if an initial draft of a contract has simple sentences clearly laid out, it may be easiest to clarify a bargaining point in contracting negotiations by complicating the sentence in question to make it reflect the other side's preferred interpretation, even if it is stylistically ugly. And, changing that language in a final draft to make the contract look pretty is viewed with the suspicion that a subtle substantive change in the meaning of the contract from the haggled term was intended. As an aside, some contract provisions in hotly negotiated contracts are also sometimes intentionally ambiguous. This is because resolving the ambiguity could result in a fight over a side issue that could bust the deal if each side insisted on their own interpretation. Leaving the term ambiguous allows a judge evaluating a dispute that actually arises, if a dispute even arises over that term (which it often doesn't), in order to do what makes sense under the circumstances instead. Also, lawyers are wretchedly afraid of an adverse party quoting a sentence in a contract without including the related context that clarifies its meaning (e.g. by omitting definitions that are not obvious from the plain language of the contract). Unlike most prose, contracts are rarely read front to back the way you would a court opinion or a newspaper report or a short story. Normally, someone using a contract quotes only the relevant portion of the contract in isolation from the larger entire document. When ideas are broken into separate sentences, lawyers are very worried, rightly or wrongly, that different sentences in a paragraph or section modify each other, rather than being isolated islands of legal propositions. So lawyers are more comfortable when as many connected ideas as possible are all contained in the same sentence in which everything must be related somehow. Lawyers feel more comfortable and secure arguing about the meaning of a single sentence, than they do arguing that a simple short sentence should have a particular meaning based upon the larger context in which it is found. Similarly, lawyers are quite wary about using pronouns that aren't defined terms in the contract, for fear that the person that the pronoun refers to will be incorrectly assigned, even though this is an unnatural way of writing. Also, as an aside, contract drafting is an area where common law legal drafting styles differ materially from civil law country legal drafting styles (e.g. in continental Europe). This is because in civil law countries there is a great effort made to provide for what would usually be boilerplate language in U.S. contracts as default statutory rules that match the default choices that are usually made in contracts negotiated between third-parties. Far less can be taken for granted in common law countries. A lot of the operative language in a common law jurisdiction contract, including much of it the most difficult to read legalese in contracts, is simply implied in law unless specifically disavowed, in many civil law countries. As a result, civil law country contracts are usually much shorter and more focused on the deal specific terms than a common law jurisdiction contract. A civil law business agreement that runs to five pages might typically take 30-40 pages to write saying exactly the same thing in a common law jurisdiction."
Do we have to take down the material for 14 days even if the DMCA notice is erroneous?,"There is a slight confusion here: The large company sent the DMCA notice to your host, not to you. You are not taking down anything. The host does that.  If the DMCA takedown notice is following all the rules, then your host has two choices: Take down your content, or be willing to be part of a copyright court case. Assuming that the host doesn't want to go to court and potentially lose tons of money, they will take down your content. Until you send a counter notice.  Now you can only legally create a DMCA notice as the copyright holder or their agent. Whoever sends the takedown notice must under threat of perjury declare that they are the copyright holder of material that they believe you are infringing upon. It seems that company is not the copyright holder, therefore perjury. (If they make a mistake, and your material is not their copyrighted material, that's legally Ok. But if they are not copyright holder, that is perjury). If you are sure that happened, a good lawyer will love to take them apart. "
Is it illegal to backup your hard drive if you have copyrighted software on it?,"You're allowed to make backups of copyrighted software, as long as you are authorized to use the software, the backups are not distributed, and they are destroyed when/if you are no longer authorized to use the software.  17 USC §117(a): (a) Making of Additional Copy or Adaptation by Owner of Copy. --
  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not an infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer program to make or authorize the making of another copy or adaptation of that computer program provided: (1) ...(not very helpful)...or
    (2) that such new copy or adaptation is for archival purposes only and that all archival copies are destroyed in the event that continued possession of the computer program should cease to be rightful. The law is usually used to justify copies of the installation media, but it would be unconscionable to cut your rights off there and make backups illegal for machines containing copyrighted software. After all, with such an interpretation, no Windows machine could be backed up since Windows is copyrighted."
"Is ""legalese"" a thing in languages other than English?",Germany definitely has a legal jargon that is sufficiently distinct from standard German that a foreigner with decent skill in standard German will have trouble understanding what a legal text actually means. It frequently uses uncommon grammatical structures and vocabulary. It also can go so far that some common expressions like 'usually' or 'most of the time' have a legal meaning that is somewhat different than what these expression would mean in standard written German.
Is it legal for a supermarket to refuse to sell an adult beer if an adult with them doesn’t have their ID?,"It is legal, at least in the US, for a store (or other entity) to refuse to sell any item to any individual for any non-prohibited reason (prohibited reasons are typically things like race or religion). More over, in various US jurisdictions, it is prohibited to ""furnish"" alcohol to a ""minor"" (for example, under California's ABC law), which can be interpreted as prohibiting to an adult if they reasonably suspect that adult will pass the alcohol onto the ""minor"". This is to prevent ""straw"" sales. Additionally, larger chains generally prefer to have harmonized policies across branches, and where practical, across state lines, so will have policies that can accomodate multiple alcohol control regimes."
Can I sue a restaurant for serving me meat in vegetarian dish?,"An essential component of your contract with them is that they will provide you with food free of animal stuff (the exact nature of ""vegan approved"" may be up for debate, but actual meat should not be included). So they breached their contract with you, and you might sue them for breach of contract. The case of Gupta v. Asha (orders were mixed up) could be useful in this matter. In this case, Hindus were served samosas containing beef, despite repeated assertions that they were vegetarian. Plaintiffs sued, the case was dismissed, and the appeals court deemed that the lower court was part right and part wrong. The important thing to understand is that you have to claim a specific legal wrong (and your attorney would advise you about that). Those plaintiffs made a claim under NJ product liability law, and that was dismissed because the product wasn't defective, it was simply the wrong product. They also made a claim regarding fraud, and there was at least a legal question behind that claim, but because there was no ascertainable loss (e.g. the plaintiffs were not hospitalized because of the omission), so that claim too was dismissed. Likewise a negligence claim was dismissed. Plaintiffs did get to first base w.r.t. the claim of emotional distress arising from breach of contract. I have no evidence regarding the final disposition of the case: the point is that there might be a legal basis for a lawsuit in your state, but you would need to secure the paid assistance of an attorney."
Virginia employer terminated employee and wants signing bonus returned,"Virginia employer terminated employee and wants signing bonus returned Can the employer legally keep his last check and send the employee a bill for the remainder ? No, unless (1) the employee resigned and (2) his resignation does not amount to constructive termination. The employer may withhold the remaining $7,000 only if the employee did not meet the condition of ""30 days of employment with xxxxx"". Absent any language to the contrary, the requirement of ""1-year commitment"" is to be construed as the consideration expected from the employee (namely, ""not to quit"") in exchange for the bonus. Termination by the employer is self-defeating in the sense the employer himself made it impossible for the employee to fulfill the consideration that was expected from the employee. Therefore, the employer forfeits his entitlement to reimbursement. In the event that the employee met the condition of ""30 days of employment with xxxxx"", he would be entitled to the remaining $7,000 as well. Virginia labor law has no provision for treble damages (this is in response to one of the comments, per the OP's suggestion). The statutory provisions are only a civil penalty no greater than $1,000 for each violation, a portion of attorney's fees, and ""all wages due, plus interest at an annual rate of eight percent"". See Code of Virginia at § 40.1-29 A.2, F, and G. Item E of that statute determines which violations are misdemeanors and which are felonies. This statute would be applicable only if (1) the employer disavows the employee's entitlement to the remaining $7,000, and/or (2) the employer withholds a portion of the employee's earned compensation in an attempt to recover the initial payment of $3,000."
Can I enter a rental property without giving notice if I'm afraid a tenant may be hurt?,"Most leases have a provision allowing a landlord to make entry without notice in an emergency, but the better course of action, as noted in a comment by @BlueDogRanch, is to call the police and ask them to make a ""welfare check."" You would ordinarily be permitted to cooperate with police by unlocking doors in furtherance of their welfare check. The police are trained to do this properly in a way that properly balances the need to aid someone who is sick or ill, the need to preserve evidence if there was a death or crime that needs to be understood legally, and to protect the legitimate privacy interests of the tenant. You are not. You could incur liability for failing to prevent death or aggravating injury,  could be wrongfully implicated if physical evidence from you contaminates the scene or you destroy evidence showing the true cause, and could be sued for invading the tenant's privacy if it was found that you entry was unreasonable and that it wasn't really an emergency, which is always easier to conclude with 20/20 hindsight. As it is, your biggest potential source of liability is delaying in calling the police seeking a welfare check. They often respond quite quickly to these by the way, although it is not the very highest priority for law enforcement."
Can UPS really trademark the color brown?,"Inks for reproduction can be mixed to create very custom colors. It is entirely possible to trademark a special ""recipe"" of ink which results in the same color each time.  So yes. In terms of branding -- colors, or specific color combinations, can be trademarked. Don't confuse ""trademark"" with ""ownership"" or ""copyright"". Trademark merely means in that particular industry the company has staked a claim on a specific color or color combination. Trademarks are more about preventing brand confusion within the same industry. You're free to use the same colors in a completely separate industry and even in some cases in a completely separate manner within the same industry.  Freakonomics has an article about trademarking colors. It mostly alludes to fashion, but it's still a valid article. If you want to delve more into branding and color, Color Matters has some additional information."
In Los Angeles can I defend my own property against looters?,"If you are arrested for assault, you have available to you the defense of the right to defend real or personal property: you ""may use reasonable force to protect that property from imminent harm. Reasonable force means the amount of force that a reasonable person in
the same situation would believe is necessary to protect the property from imminent harm"". The level of force proposed is clearly within the boundaries of the reasonable."
At what point is uploading a movie with heavy compression not copyright infringement?,"A few years ago, there was a trial in the USA about some short sound on some music CD: One party claimed that one piece of music on the CD contained a sound of less than one second length which is copied from another CD without the permission of the copyright owner of the other CD. It could never be found out if this claim was really true. The court's decision was: If it is not possible to distinguish between a copy and a work that does not depend on the other work at all, it is not a copyright infringement - even if the sound has been copied from the other CD. For this reason, I'd guess that a 4x3 image would not be a copyright infringement, yet, while 60x45 would definitely be one. Just for reference: The same image as 3x4 and as 45x60: "
US jus soli edge case,"The Supreme Court rules in US v. Wong Kim Ark ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment, which states All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to
the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the
state wherein they reside It is not disputed that said areas are ""in the United States"". The court found that ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" is intended to exclude, by the fewest and fittest words (besides children of
members of the Indian tribes, standing in a peculiar relation to the
national government, unknown to the common law), the two classes of
cases,—children born of alien enemies in hostile occupation, and
children of diplomatic representatives of a foreign state neither of which are the case in your scenario. Technically, the child is not ""eligible"" for citizenship, the child has US citizenship, it is just a matter of getting a government official to recognize it (e.g. in issuing a passport)."
"What 'specific legal meaning' does the word ""strike"" have?","united-states Under US law, unions and employees enjoy a set of protections codified under the National Labor Relations Act. Some of those rights specifically pertain to strikes, and in particular, employees engaged in ""lawful"" strikes cannot be fired merely for striking (but they can be replaced). Stack Exchange, Inc. takes the position that moderators are not employees and are not subject to the NLRA. Their reluctance to use the word ""strike"" likely stems from this position. If the moderation strike were a ""strike"" within the meaning of the NLRA, that would imply a large and complex set of restrictions on how Stack Exchange may respond to the strike. It would also suggest that moderators, as employees, have a right to discuss their ""workplace conditions"" with each other or the public - which might be construed to include some or all of the moderation policies that Stack Exchange has distributed in private (but I'm somewhat doubtful of that). Of course, it would also raise serious problems under the Fair Labor Standards Act (moderators are unpaid and the FLSA sets a minimum wage), but that is a different law, and it is theoretically possible that a court would rule that moderators are employees for NLRA purposes but not for FLSA purposes. I have never heard of such a ruling actually happening, and it is far more likely that moderators are not employees for either purpose. Still, it might be unwise to refer to the strike as a ""strike,"" just in case the issue gets litigated."
In which European countries is illegal to publicly state an opinion that in the US would be protected by the first amendment?,"Almost every European nation has a ""hate speech"" law that makes the use of offensive bigoted words of phrases illegal.  The U.S. does not have any such laws, and the First Amendment makes such laws unconstitutional. The closest the U.S. can get are laws criminalizing ""Hate Crimes"" which are ordinary crimes which were motivated in part or in whole by the victim's actual or perceived protected class status. Other specific examples as mentioned in comments, are that Germany has strict laws about advocacy of Nazi ideology.  This is completely legal in the United States.  Nazi ideology is not popular in the U.S. by any means, but it's allowed to be advocated for because of the strong Freedom of Speech Laws in the United States. In other regards, while U.S. Law is fairly similar to U.K. Law (you have to get into weeds about the differences), it is way more difficult to sue for defamation in U.S. than in the U.K.  For starters, the U.S. has the ""Public Person"" rule which requires that any defamation about a person who is largely known to the public (politicians and celebrities largely) must prove Actual Malice Or Reckless Disregard for the Truth (I.E. You didn't even do the basic research into the statement) in order to prove defamation.   But there's also the matter of the burden of proof.  In the U.K. the speaker of the alleged defamation must prove in court that the statement was not defamatory.  In the U.S., all legal challenges to are ""protected speech"" until proven otherwise in a court of law.  This means that even with the ""Public Person"" rule set aside, the statement's original speaker need not prove that their speech is truthful, and the burden's on the accuser of defamation to prove it. Edit: Additional Info based on comments, but ""Protected Speech"" is a legal term used in the U.S. that defines speech that is protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States as opposed to commercial speech, which is speech used to make advertise or to further commerce and is restricted, and unprotected speech, which is speech that can land one in trouble.  While the list of types of speech is long, every form of speech restriction is very very narrowly tailored.   ""Hate Speech"", which would be the utterance of words or phrases that can be offensive to people of a protected class (a characteristic that is beyond the individuals control).  ""Hate Crimes"" are not necessarily spoken during the commission of the crime, but rather can be charged in addition to the crime.  Suppose a serial killer was killing people of a certain race, this is not enough for police to go on because most serial killers target victims that meet a physical description (same skin color, same hair color, same gender).  Once the killer is captured, police search his apartment and find a manifesto where the killer admits that he is selecting his target because he believes people of this protected class are subhuman and thus his superior nature gives him the right to kill them, this would show that the killings were motivated out of hatred, and thus qualify as a hate crime.  The way he phrases this may be purely academic and use in offensive language OR it could be laden with all manner of crass slurs.  It doesn't matter... what he said is protected speech but what he did is... well... to quote Guardians of the Galaxy... is ""murder... on of the worst crimes of all. So also illegal."" Hate crimes criminalize crimes that are motivated by hatred... they do not criminalize speech that is hateful."
USPS Back Room - Trespassing?,"Trespassing requires that you be on someone else's property without their permission. The supervisor has explicitly given you permission, so it's not possible for you to trespass. You are correct that someone with the proper authority could revoke this permission at any time, at which point you would have to leave or be guilty of trespassing. The only way this situation could constitute trespassing is if they revoke your permission and you ignore them. You can't trespass somewhere that the property owner has allowed you to be and you observe the rules they have set (which may be implied) for you being there."
"If Congress passed a bill written in a language other than English, would it be valid?","It would indeed be valid and legally enforceable. The Constitution places no limits on what languages bills must be written in. The Constitution specifically allows each house of Congress to make its own rules for how it passes bills, so, even if a house of Congress had a rule requiring its bills to be in English (which they don't, as far as I know,) they could simply change the rules and then pass the bill. From a practical standpoint, though, enforceability would also require courts to be able to discern Congress' intent from the bill. As such, unless we're expanding the assumption to ""the vast majority of the U.S., including the courts in all parts of the country, are now fluent in Spanish,"" then it's exceedingly unlikely that Congress actually would pass a substantive bill in a language other than English. Even without assuming all of Congress were fluent, it's possible that they could pass a resolution in Spanish as a gesture, but they would almost certainly not pass a substantive bill in Spanish (or any other language than English) due to the enforceability problems it would cause with courts (and, if relevant, regulatory agencies, etc.) Aside from the courts needing to be able to understand the normal meanings of the words in Spanish, there would also be the problem of the complete lack of any legal history of Spanish words in U.S. law (or even in common law in general.) Much of legal interpretation is steeped in history of what particular words have meant (and/or been ruled by courts to mean) in past laws. Throwing all of that legal history out the window by switching to another language would be quite problematic when trying to craft a bill on any substantive subject matter. Suffice it to say that crafting the definitions section for such a bill would be quite a task. So, yes, it would technically be legal and it would indeed be the law, but doing it with any substantive subject matter (without assuming that most of the population now understands Spanish) would be so problematic for enforceability in practice that they wouldn't actually consider doing it."
What are the legal repercussions of taking a stranger's picture in public?,"In the United States, You have no expectation of privacy in public. Anything you can see from a public place, you can take a picture of, even if the ""victim"" is in their own home but has the blinds open. If you are standing on a public sidewalk or street, you would legally be able to take a picture with certain exceptions. An exception to this would be: if with just your eyes you can see into a private home, you can take a picture of that, but if you require a telescopic lense with some sort of IR adapter to ""see through"" blinds. That MAY be considered illegal.  For real world examples of this question, check out PINAC. Another example is ""Creepy Camara Guy"", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs6iLtl0BAw. This guy basically goes around recording videos of people in public in a VERY obnoxious way. But he is within his legal right.  (Note: Video unavailable: ""This video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated."")"
After buying from a brick & mortar shop they've contacted me to say buying things from them is consent to arbitration. Is this legal?,"Technically speaking, it's not illegal: spontaneously making a false statement to someone does not fall under any of Ohio's laws regarding fraud or the like. It also doesn't have any legal effect.  You can't retroactively change the terms of a deal; if they didn't tell you about an arbitration requirement at the time you made the purchase, there is no arbitration requirement (and the burden of proof here is on them, not you)."
"In Germany, is it allowed for an employer to ask an employee to quit his job and threaten to find a critical error to end the contract immediately?","Your employer is most likely bluffing. It is better to be fired than to quit voluntarily. The problem with quitting voluntarily is that you won't get unemployment benefits (Arbeitslosengeld I) for a while. So don't quit voluntarily if you aren't keen on living from savings for three months. If you want to quit, get another job first. (You should get another job anyway instead of working for a toxic employer.) Your employer can only terminate your employment under certain circumstances, and with certain notice periods. Germany is very employee-friendly. Your company's establishment is currently large enough that the Kündigungsschutzgesetz (KSchG) applies. To be clear, it doesn't matter how large the company is overall, only how many employees there are in the office, shop, or other place of business. Part-time employees are counted partially. Contractors are counted as well. The KSchG fully applies if there are typically more than 10 (11 or more) employees. The KSchG does not apply to company leadership, e.g. C-level executives. Under the KSchG, the employer can terminate employment for one of three reasons: reasons in your person, reasons in your behavior, and operational reasons Personenbedingte Kündigung:
Your employment can be terminated for reasons in your person if you are unable to carry out work in the future,
for example if you need sick days so frequently that this puts an unreasonable burden on the employer.
It is generally impossible to use this reason without the normal notice periods. Verhaltensbedingte Kündigung:
You can be fired for reasons in your behavior if you committed some gross misconduct.
Typically this requires an Abmahnung (written warning) so that you have opportunity to cease the problematic behavior.
For example, you might get an Abmahnung the first time you skip a shift, and get fired the second time. In especially severe cases of misconduct, it is possible to skip the Abmahnung and/or the notice period and to fire an employee on the spot. For example, this might happen if you embezzled funds or stole your employer's property, even if the monetary damage was very small. As such dismissal with cause stems from your behavior, you would not get unemployment benefits for three months. Betriebsbedingte Kündigung: If the company has to downsize for economic reasons, it can lay off workers. However, the employer must apply social criteria for selecting the employees to lay off. Factors are: the length of employment, age, support obligations for children or other dependents, and disability status. That is, a young, new, childless and able-bodied employee is more likely to get axed. If you have a union (Betriebsrat) they can veto a termination in certain cases. These criteria can be clarified via collective bargaining agreements, but cannot be circumvented in an individual contract. So your employer will not be able to find any error in the contract that will allow them to fire you. The best they could do is to go really carefully over your application and paperwork to find any misrepresentation, and use that as the basis for a Verhaltensbedingte Kündigung. However, it is quite unlikely that they will find a misrepresentation so severe that it could serve as grounds for firing you without notice. Minimum notice periods are given in law. The minimum is one month notice. Your contract cannot have a shorter notice period in your context. In case of a dismissal for exceptional reasons (e.g. theft), no notice period is necessary. If you are terminated, go to a lawyer. You only have three weeks to file a lawsuit. Contacting the lawyer should be the second thing you do after getting fired, with the first thing being the registration with the Arbeitsagentur to start the clock for unemployment benefits. If your employer is making unprofessional threats like claiming that there could be a “critical error” in your contract, it is quite possible that the termination notice could be deficient in some way. If the dismissal was improper, a court can award compensation (lost wages) and reinstate the employment, though this is unlikely to be desired. Your wage from subsequent jobs (or wages you could have earned if you had looked for a job) will be subtracted from the lost wages. To summarize this large text dump, firing an employee is difficult unless the employee does something very stupid like stealing from the employer. Therefore: reasonable employers that want to get rid of an employee don't look for errors in the contract. Instead: They watch you very closely to find any behavior that merits a written warning (Abmahnung). This builds a case for a termination with cause. They offer an agreement to terminate the contract (Aufhebungsvertrag). With such an agreement you mutually terminate the employment. You won't get unemployment benefits for three months since this was your decision, so typically these agreements provide for generous compensation. A reasonable employer knows that paying for the notice period + additional compensation is cheaper than dealing with an unhappy employee + a potentially invalid termination + a prolonged legal battle. Of course, less reasonable employers resort to bullying to get you to quit yourself. This is cheaper than paying compensation with an Aufhebungsvertrag."
Is it a crime to take my own package from a delivery truck before it has reached my home?,"You are missing something terribly important: The package might not be your property [yet]. In any way, it is not in your possession, while it is in the hands of the postal service! The contents of the package started fully owned by the sender and were entrusted to the postal service to deliver it. This entrustment is (contractually) defined as the time it is handed to the postal service, but the postal service does not gain any ownership. They do however have insurance on the parcel (to some degree), as they are liable for the loss of it. In many cases, the transfer of ownership happens upon delivery (for example, in the UK), so that you can't even be sure you own the contents while the box is still on the truck. At least in the eye of many postal services I know, it is the basic presumption, that they hold the item as entrusted. So to be on the safe side, it's best to presume that the package only becomes your package the moment you sign for the receipt of the package or it is dropped into your mailbox or at your dedicated dropoff point (you can specify that with many postal carriers btw). Otherwise, your actions might interfere with the contract of the mail service [to bring it to your door] and might incur liability upon them as their insurance presumes the parcel was lost and it has to be replaced. By the way, it is customary that any message of the parcel is damaged go to the sender, not the receiver so that in the case of commercial mail they can send/fund a replacement, as the sender needs to ensure that a non-defect item is delivered under their own contract with the recipient. But, you want to know which specific law you'd be sued under 18 USC §1708 (2) not only for taking the box, but also for taking the item from the box (emphasis mine)! Whoever steals, takes, or abstracts, or by fraud or deception obtains, or attempts so to obtain, from or out of any mail, post office, or station thereof, letter box, mail receptacle, or any mail route or other authorized depository for mail matter, or from a letter or mail carrier, any letter, postal card, package, bag, or mail, or abstracts or removes from any such letter, package, bag, or mail, any article or thing contained therein, or secretes, embezzles, or destroys any such letter, postal card, package, bag, or mail, or any article or thing contained therein [...] Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. The act of taking is relevant. It is irrelevant that you would receive the parcel later. You take it from the car on the delivery route. You also do trespass under whatever jurisdiction applies where the car is parked. For example, Criminal Trespass on Indian country is defined under 25.CFR § 11.411 (b). The rules in other jurisdictions are very similar: you are not allowed to enter the car, as it is clearly off-limits to the general public. The car is btw. supposed to be closed to prevent such, so you have to actually break property of the postal service (which is an extra charge to just the normal B&E). (b) A person commits an offense if, knowing that he or she is not licensed or privileged to do so, he or she enters or remains in any place as to which notice against trespass is given by: (3) Fencing or other enclosure manifestly designed to exclude intruders. A car door, even if not locked and left ajar, is an enclosure manifestly designed to exclude intruders, and the inside of a car is ""any place"". So, in the correct jurisdiction, this statute of criminal trespass does apply. And as pointed out above, taking the mail without the driver knowing is illegal. In some fashion, taking your own mail is also a strange case of obstructing the correspondence, which specifically calls out that the parcel has to be given by the mailman to the recipient (emphasis mine). Whoever takes any letter, postal card, or package out of any post office or any authorized depository for mail matter, or from any letter or mail carrier, or which has been in any post office or authorized depository, or in the custody of any letter or mail carrier, before it has been delivered to the person to whom it was directed, with design to obstruct the correspondence, or to pry into the business or secrets of another, or opens, secretes, embezzles, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. If it is discovered by the driver while still on route, they will have to call the base and investigate the missing parcel, which takes time from the delivery, so might constitute retarding the passage of mail. If you break the lock to the car, you'd be charged as Injury to mail bags: Whoever tears, cuts, or otherwise injures any mail bag, pouch, or other thing used or designed for use in the conveyance of the mail, or draws or breaks any staple or loosens any part of any lock, chain, or strap attached thereto, with intent to rob or steal any such mail, or to render the same insecure, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. A Postal car, especially with a lock on the door, is such a device. And if you somehow had the key to the car, you'd break 18 USC § 1704 instead. Plus, your taking does possibly incur monetary damages to the postal carrier, so civil charges for that money and expenses in investigating would also accrue against the taking person. If you'd take the parcel, you make the postal driver accountable for the loss of the parcel and the worth of the package, as the internal system of the postal service does recognize that they did not deliver the parcel, did not scan it out at the home base, but they did scan it onto their route. So unless they can point the finger at you or a known thief, they might need to admit that they did not lock the car or committed some other misconduct that allowed someone to steal the parcel. This can lead to the financial loss of the delivery driver or them being fired. Should the mail carrier or the postal service discover it was you, the mail carrier can now sue you for the injury the lost parcel meant to them as you interfered with their work contract. The tort is Tortious interference. Then, the mail service can sue you for intentionally interfering with the delivery contract the service had with the one ordering the delivery done: they were required to bring the parcel to the target and got paid for that. Only your action of taking did prevent this. Would you not have taken the parcel, they would have delivered, so you interfered with their contract. Approach the driver, get out a photo-ID (Drivers license, passport, ID-card etc) and ask them something akin to this ""The website told me you might have a parcel for me. Can you look? I am this person, and this ID proves I live at the target address, as indicated on this ID."" With those credentials in hand, the postal driver can check and give it to you but isn't technically obligated to. But as it often means they can save a few valuable minutes getting to your house, they might, especially if you know your mail carrier and are friendly. On the other hand, it's extremely unlikely for letter mail to be given this way, as searching for a parcel on a truck is much easier than looking for the letter mails in the bags."
Is it breach of contract if dismissed before starting work?,"UK: For all I know you cannot be fired unless you are hired. They must hire you. Once a job offer is made and accepted, they must hire you. If they don't, call a lawyer.

The company had to hire him.  PS. ""Financial difficulties"" means you call a lawyer urgently. Once they are bankrupt your chances of extracting money are not good. "
Are lawyers allowed to lie about the law during closing arguments?,"A lawyer is obligated to accurately state the law as stated in the jury instructions in closing argument (and also not to make a clear and deliberate misstatement of the facts presented at trials, and also not to express personal knowledge of the facts based upon anything other than what the jury has seen). But a certain amount of poetic license is allowed so long as the closing argument is not so misleading, as a whole, that it is likely to lead the jury astray. In this case, the prosecutor is alluding, with poetic license, to the idea that an aggressor or interloper can't assert self-defense. You can't ""look for trouble"" and then be shielded by that doctrine. A more full quote from that prosecutor makes that more clear: you lose the right to self-defence when you’re the one who brought the
gun, when you’re the one creating the danger, when you’re the one
provoking other people I have no opinion concerning whether his statement does or does not cross the line. I'm not sufficiently immersed in the case, and don't have enough context from having heard the closing arguments as a whole, to have a confident opinion on that point. If there is an acquittal we'll never know. If there is a conviction and appeal and this is an issue raised on appeal, we might find out. Opposing counsel has a right to object in closing argument if it goes too far, and appealing an argument that a closing argument is objectionable is challenging unless it is preserved with a timely objection at the time. Particularly if the prosecution makes a misstatement in their initial closing, rebutting it in the defense closing may be more effective than objecting. But, if the prosecutor makes a misstatement in a rebuttal period to which the defense can't offer a corrective statement, an objection may be  wise in  order to preserve an issue for appeal."
Is it legal for a bar bouncer to confiscate a fake ID,"There are a couple of indications that a bouncer may not confiscate an ID. This policy document adopting licensing policies to Require licensees with fake ID violations to temporarily or
  permanently hire on-site law enforcement or certified security guards
  who are properly trained to check IDs during regular or peak hours to
  deter the use of fake IDs and give gatekeepers the opportunity to pass
  suspected fakes to an officer or guard for a second opinion and
  potential confiscation. Where appropriate, jurisdictions could empower
  the gatekeeper to confiscate fake IDs so they are not returned to the
  underage drinker and sent back into circulation. To ensure compliance
  with legal issues (e.g., property rights, bailment issues), arrange
  for the on-call or on-site presence of local law enforcement. Local
  bar and restaurant associations, especially those in concentrated
  entertainment zones, can join together to share the expense of law
  enforcement resources. That implies that the bouncer does not already have that authority, and also indicates that the confiscation should be performed by the police. This bouncer training manual says that Even though you may consider the ID to be fake, it is not considered
  the server's property. Therefore servers and sellers should not
  confiscate IDs they suspect to be fake. Rather... follow up with a
  call to the police to verify suspected false IDs. However, a jurisdiction may grant servers that power, as in the case of Colorado. Washington doesn't do that, so bouncers would need to call the police (not that they always do, since passing a fake ID is somewhere between a misdemeanor and a felony). The general principle is that you may not confiscate another person's property, but the police can seize property if it is reasonable to do so. A state may pass a law authorizing a licensee to do likewise (though it does raise questions about the bouncer's understanding of ""reasonable cause to believe""). The Colorado statute is restricted to licensee and their employees, and does not apply to ""anyone who suspects an ID"", nor does it allow civilian confiscation of other property such as an automobile that is suspected of being stolen."
Pokémon Go hot spots and private property,"What is the legality of someone putting a virtual hot spot on your property without permission? I know we are in uncharted territory but how would this compare to setting up a contest that would require going on your property without permission?  The existence of a game does not authorise entrance to private property, barring some agreement with the owner. That is - if it is trespassing without Pokemon Go (or, for that matter Ingress), then it is trespassing while playing them. That being said, the creators of the game are free to place their in-game targets anywhere they please, and it is hard to imagine a scenario where they would be liable for their users' actions, unless they have not taken reasonable steps to prevent their users from doing so - Niantic clearly instruct their users to respect the law and also, only require that their users be within a certain distance of these points, not actually be at them. Is it currently legal to say Go to person X house and touch a tree? If not, does the current law extend to augmented reality? Nope, unless it can be done without entering private property (which includes the airspace above the property, to some extent). And there are no special cases for augmented reality. Now, there is some possibility that if they create a private nuisance - by being too loud, or by otherwise interfering with the use of the property -  owners of a property could bring a claim in tort against players for doing so - or charges for a public nuisance, when done in a public area."
"If I'm the CEO and largest shareholder of a public company, would taking anything from my office be considered as a theft?","Let's assume this anecdote takes place while Gates was CEO.  Bill Gates doesn't own all of Microsoft, and as an officer of the company, he owes a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the company and its shareholders as a whole.  Taking the company's property for personal use breaches that fiduciary duty. Now, in this particular hypothetical, Gates might have a decent argument that, as a public figure who can afford any piece of technology he desires, him being seen using a Microsoft Surface actually is acting in the company's best interests.  But that wouldn't apply in the hypothetical scenario where he took, say, a printer."
Is the President at the top of all organ waiting lists?,"There isn't any rule which would prioritize the President, as far as I can tell.  Generally, organ allocation is required to be based on medical criteria, not on factors such as the occupation or societal role of the patient. 42 USC 273 specifies that organ procurement shall be administered by ""qualified organ procurement organizations"" and sets up ground rules for their operation, one of which is: have a system to allocate donated organs equitably among transplant patients according to established medical criteria. Further regulations implementing this law are to be found at 42 CFR 121.  121.8(a)(1) specifies that allocation policies ""[s]hall be based on sound medical judgment"". The actual policies that have been created can be found at https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/governance/policies/.  The OPTN policy document is very long, and the criteria are different for different organs, but everything I could find seemed to be of a medical nature.  Moreover 5.4.A says: Allocation of deceased
donor organs must not be influenced positively or negatively by political influence, national
origin, ethnicity, sex, religion, or financial status. The part about ""political influence"" would seem to rule out giving special consideration to the President."
Landlord gives 4 months notice to the rental agency which fails to give notice to the tenants,"You can stay as long as you like or for 4 months after they give you the correct notice. The landlord’s legal obligation was to give you 4 months notice: not his agent, or the Queen, or some guy he was chatting with at the pub. Whether that causes other people with other contracts problems is a matter for them to work out, it’s none of your business. However, … The management agency is the landlord’s agent. That means, as far as you are concerned there is no legal difference between what they do and what the landlord does. If either of them had given you a valid notice, it is as though the landlord had done so. However, if the landlord says something to the agent, from your point of view, the landlord is talking to themselves. If the landlord has sold the property, it comes with any existing leases. If the landlord has promised vacant possession and can’t deliver it, then they have broken the contract with the buyer and the buyers can sue your landlord for damages or possibly terminate the contract or both. If that happens, and it was a result of the agent’s negligence, the landlord can sue the agent."
"A Swiss watch company seized my watch, saying it was stolen. I bought it 10 years ago. Is that legal?","switzerland ""Gutgläubiger Erwerb gestohlener Dinge"" (buying of stolen goods in good faith) is a big topic in law. Different jurisdictions handle it differently, but most European (civil law) systems have some kind of rule that accept the ownership of a buyer in such a case. Here is a good article that compares different jurisdictions on exactly such an issue. Luxury watches are a kind of art. According to Swiss law (Art 934 ZGB), the item must be returned when discovered within 5 years of the theft. However, the rightful owner must pay for any expenses you had. Since the theft was more than 5 years ago, the watch is, in my opinion, rightfully yours. Since Blancpain is in Switzerland, they are obviously bound to Swiss law. Also, they are not the police, so they cannot seize an item. They can only safekeep it and report to the authorities. I would also contact a lawyer for help. It seems to me like a case you should win."
"Is ""My Cousin Vinny"" dismissal actually possible?","This is entirely possible in a number of different motions that could have been made.  At this point, Vinny had destroyed the Prosecutor's eyewitnesses by showing they had issues that called their testimony into question (The first has a timeline that doesn't line up with events, the second has poor vision and her prescription glasses were not doing their job, and the third had many obstructions blocking his view of the scene).  His first witness tears apart the ""expert"" witness, who was only there to testify that the tires were the same brand (albeit, a popular brand at the time... loads of cars had the same tires). While it might go by a different name in different jurisdictions, the Prosecutor is allowed to make a motion to dismiss at any point prior to the jury goes to deliberation (as is the Defense;  Also they might be able to make motions while the jury is in deliberations). If properly titled, the Prosecutor should have made a ""motion for nolle prosequi"" (not prosecuting).  This can mean any number of things including the prosecutor no longer believes the evidence can prove the charges OR even that the prosecutor is no longer convinced that those charged committed the crime. In the ""My Cousin Vinny"" case, as the jury was seated the case cannot be retried by the State of Alabama at this point. This is possible because the Prosecutor's duty is to uncover the truth behind a crime, no matter what that truth becomes.  In this case, despite his previous beliefs, the prosecutor in My Cousin Vinny, upon realizing he was wrong, admitted it and dropped the charges.  Given his backstory of having worked as a defense attorney and making the switch after getting a client off some serious charges (and knowing the client was guilty) shows that he was inherently an honest man and dedicated to finding the truth of the matter (as a government employee, he undoubtedly took a pay cut when he switched to prosecution.  Private industry almost always pays way more than a government equivalent).  With that in mind, it is expected of prosecutors to be perfectly honest with what evidence they have and make the choices in the case based on that evidence.  This comes up in another scene when Mona Lisa Vito explains to Vinny that the prosecutor was required to give Vinny all the files he had on the case... because Vinny, by representing the Defendant, is allowed to examine all evidence against his clients.  The only dirty trick he pulled was the stunt where his expert witness was not disclosed and while bad, really it's the judge allowing the witness to testify that would have caused a problem with the trial (his response to Vinny's objection could have created a mistrial on appeal). To give a real world example, I was charged with driving on a suspended license which I had no idea I was doing at the time.  As it turned out, the license was suspended for an unpaid traffic ticket that I had paid in the last minute... essentially the DMV forgot to unsuspend.  A quick call fixed that issue but I still had to go to court over the charge.  The day of the trial, I show up in the court room and the prosecutor walks over and tells me that they were going to enter a motion of ""nolle prosequi"" for the charge... essentially dropping it... because the matter was a clerical error on the state's part and not anything I did wrong. Edit:  Additionally had the prosecutor not motioned to dismiss, Vinny certainly could have.  In fact there are two points during the trial where Defense attorneys are expected to make these motions.  The first is when the Prosecution rests their case.   The second is before the jury is given the case to deliberate. As for why it was called a motion to dismiss in the film, it's likely to due with the fact that the audience would not know what a ""motion for nolle prosecui"" and it is a type of motion to dismiss."
How can I declare independence from the United States and start my own micro nation?,"You are courting seduction by the sovereign citizen doctrine.  This is a crackpot legal theory that will get you nowhere.  Run away as fast as you can. See, for example, Can a natural US person hold citizenship while remaining non-juridical?. See also ""Mercedes-Benz Financial (DCFS Canada Corp.) v. Kovacevic, 2009"", CanLII.  This person fared particularly poorly because his argument relied in part on the UCC, which is a United States model code, but he was arguing in a Canadian court.

Suppose someone kills more people than they intended. Did they murder the extra people?,"Through the legal doctrine of ""transferred intent"", wherein if one intends to murder A, and undertake actions to kill A, but one's actions kill B, one has murdered B. Whatever crimes one would have committed, had one performed them on one's intended target, are considered committed against the individual one actually performed them on. Many crimes require one to have mens rea to be guilty; they do not require one to have mens rea towards a given individual. So, so long as one had the proper intent to murder someone, the actual victim of their actions is irrelevant."
Is it true that men are forced to pay child support for children they didn't consent to have?,"Is it true that men are forced to pay child support for children they
didn't consent to having? Yes. This is true in every U.S. jurisdiction, in the U.K., and in every jurisdiction of which I am aware in the E.U., and it is the rule in many other jurisdictions. The duty to pay child support in these jurisdictions flows from the relationship between the father and the child, and is not a contractual concept based upon consent. The primary exceptions to this general rule are cases where a parental relationship is legally terminated (e.g., in connection with the adoption of a child born out of wedlock), and cases in which someone becomes a sperm donor in a statutorily authorized arrangement that generally does not involve sexual intercourse. Historically, roughly speaking in the early 19th century, and earlier in English common law, and most other European and European-colonist jurisdictions, a man only had a duty to support the children of his wife or the children of his deceased former wife if he was a widower. Even further back, in the Roman empire from which the foundations of Roman civil law were derived, a father had a right in his sole and absolute discretion to commit infanticide, killing his infant children, a right which was a major political issue in the Roman empire from sometime in the 100s CE until it collapsed. Some jurisdictions, such as Japan, only established a legal duty to pay child support to a custodial parent in any circumstances in the late 20th century, although those jurisdictions still recognized the legal duty of a father to support a child in his custody. It is also worth noting that women in every country of which I am aware have a duty to support the children to which they give birth, whether or not they consented to impregnation (e.g. even if they were raped), or to giving birth (e.g. even if they wanted an abortion but were denied access to abortion by law or otherwise). This support obligation persists in almost every case, even if the woman's child is in the custody of another parent or guardian, and a woman is much more likely to face criminal prosecution for failure to support her child than an uninvolved father (although criminal prosecutions of men for non-support do happen). So, the claim that this constitutes sex discrimination is ill-founded."
How does NC's atheism prohibition fit with the 1st Amendment of the US Constitution?,"In Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488 (1961), the US Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a similar provision in Maryland's constitution violated the First Amendment and could not be enforced.  So presumably the North Carolina provision is similarly unconstitutional and unenforceable. It's not clear why it wasn't removed in 1971. I found references to a 2009 incident in which an avowed atheist named Cecil Bothwell was elected to the Asheville, NC city council.  Opponents apparently threatened to mount a legal challenge to his eligibility under the Article VI provision.  It's not clear if they actually tried to do so, but in any event, Bothwell served his full four-year term and was then re-elected for another."
"Could I write a ""Parry Hotter"" novel?","Using the setting and characters of an existing and current book would probably, indeed almost surely, make it a derivative work. Creating a derivative work from a work protected by copyright requires permission from the copyright holder, unless an exception to copyright applies. In US law 17 USC 101 defines a derivative work as: A “derivative work” is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications, which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a “derivative work”. and 17 USC 106 provides in pertinent part that: Subject to sections 107 through 122, the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following: ... This means that creating such a fanfic without permission would be copyright infringement, and Rowling could sue for damages. In the US the primary exception to copyright available is fair use. Whether a work is a fair use of another is always a case-by-case decision, and often a complex one. There have not been many published US cases on whether fanfiction is or may be fair use.
This depends on the details, but from the description I do not think such a fanfic as the question describes would be likely to be held to be a case of fair use. See Is this copyright infringement? Is it fair use? What if I don't make any money off it? In general fanfiction has not fared very well under US copyright law. See this Wikipedia article. A recent Law Review article on this topic, one of the few available, is The Better Angels of Our Fanfiction: The Need for True and Logical Precedent, 33 Hastings Comm. & Ent. L.J. 159](https://repository.uchastings.edu/hastings_comm_ent_law_journal/vol33/iss2/1) by Stacey M. Lantagne. [Footnotes in the original shown here in {braces}.] On pages 168-9 Lantagne wrote: Although fanfiction is a flourishing medium, there has been no
true case evaluating it under a fair use analysis. For instance, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. v. RDR Books 575 F.Supp.2d 513 (SDNY 2008) involved a work created by a fan, but the work in question was an encyclopedic reference book about the original copyrighted material, not a piece of fiction spun off from the original copyrighted work in some way. The fan work's inconsistently transformative character swayed the court's fair use analysis{The court noted that at times the fan work lapsed into mere verbatim copying of the original copyrighted material, which detracted from its transformative nature}, and the fact that it used more of the original copyrighted work than was necessary.{The court found it telling that the fan work contained a great deal of verbatim copying of ""highly aesthetic expression,"" which tipped this factor away from a finding of fair use} These two factors would necessarily dictate a different analysis when a work of fiction is involved as opposed to a reference work.{Warner Bros., 575 F. Supp. 2d at 544. The court found troubling the excessive copying of ""distinctive original language from the Harry Potter works,"" using ""Rowling's original expression,"" in the work's entries. Id. Presumably, much less direct copying of original language would happen in a work of fiction. A similar implication occurs when considering the ""verbatim copying"" of whole sentences from the Harry Potter books. Id. at 547. Works of fanfiction seldom copy verbatim language, focusing on characters,
settings, and plots.} Lantagne  next discussed mthe case of Salinger v. Colting, 607 F.3d 68, 70. That case dealt with a novel called 60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye, whose protagonist, ""Mr. C"", is a 76-year-old Holden  Caulfield, (the  protagonist of the J.D. Salinger novel The Catcher in the Rye. Lantagne wrote: The defendant's novel embodies typical fanfiction activity: taking a recognizable character and re-imagining them at a different stage of life."" The court determined that the work was not permissible fair use and enjoined its publication.{This case [on appeal] recently settled, with Colting agreeing not to publish the book in the United States or Canada until the
copyright on The Catcher in the Rye expires, but being able to publish it in other international territories, as long as it was not marketed using reference to Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye, or the litigation between the parties.}
First, the court concluded that 60 Years Later was not a parody
because it ""contain[ed] no reasonably discernible rejoinder or specific criticism of any character or theme of Catcher. Rather than commenting on Holden Caulfield as a character, the purpose of 60 Years Later was to ""satisfy Holden's fans' passion"" for his character. The insertion of J.D. Salinger as a character in 60 Years Later was possibly, the court conceded, a criticism and commentary of Salinger, but not of The Catcher in the Rye. While the court admitted that there was some transformative element in the Salinger character in 60 Years Later, it was limited by the character's minor role in a work that was largely not transformative. The court concluded that merely aging the main character of a novel and altering the novel's setting was not sufficient to make the use transformative. Finally, because 60 Years Later was to be sold for profit, the court found that the first factor weighed against a finding of fair use. After finding The Catcher in the Rye to be an expressive work,
which weighed the second factor against a finding of fair use, the
court then concluded that 60 Years Later took much more from The
Catcher in the Rye than was necessary for whatever transformative
commentary it was trying to make. The court disapproved mainly of
the use of the main character of The Catcher in the Rye. 60 Years
Later also was similar to The Catcher in the Rye in structure, in a way that was not necessary to offer a commentary on Salinger (the only transformative purpose the court had found the work to have). Finally, the court found that 60 Years Later harmed the potential market for any permissible The Catcher in the Rye sequels. The court found that fair use should not protect the ability to publish unauthorized sequels: [B]ecause some artists may be further incentivized to create
original works due to the availability of the right not to
produce any sequels. This might be the case if, for instance,
an author's artistic vision includes leaving certain portions or
aspects of his character's story to the varied imaginations of
his readers, or if he hopes that his readers will engage in discussion and speculation as to what happened subsequently."" Although 60 Years Later may be classified as fanfiction, the
overtly commercial purpose of the work makes it an imperfect
representation of the genre because most fanfiction is not-for-profit.{See Tushnet, supra note 16, at 664. A recent development in fanfiction that has led to clashes is the rise of the use of fanfiction for charitable purposes. ""Fanfic auctions"" in which readers bid for the services of fanfiction authors to write a story based on their specifications, with the proceeds to benefit charity, are becoming more common. See Gabaldon, supra note 7 (""Recently, a couple of people have drawn my attention to a
person who's been posting on various boards about fund-raising for an uninsured friend named Stacie who has breast cancer. Her (the poster's) idea for fund-raising is to auction off a customer-written piece of fan-fic. . . .""). Fanfiction written for such a commercial purpose may change the analysis. But see Tushnet, supra note 16, at 672-73 (quoting
Gene Rodenberry).} Because the court weighed the novel's commercial nature against a finding of fair use, Salinger is not an ideal fanfiction precedent Lantagne  goes on to discuss the case of Suntrust Bank v. Houghton
Mifflin Co 268 F.3d 1257, 1259 (11th Cir. 2001). In that case a novel The Wind Done Gone, retelling Gone With the Wind from the PoV of the black characters, was held to be a parody as well as a sequel, to be ""highly transformative"", and allowable as fair use. A sequel uses the characters and/or setting of an existing work of fiction. It often constitutes a derivative work. The more distinctive and original the setting and characters are, and the more of those distinctive characteristics that are used in the sequel, the more likely the sequel is to be treated as a derivative work. On the matter of sequels, see the case of Anderson v. Stallone, 11 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989). In that case, a Mr. Timothy Anderson prepared a sequel to the film Rocky III  which he hoped would become Rocky IV. He presented it to MGM and Stallone.  They eventually declined to buy it, and Anderson sued, claiming that the film Rocky IV that was made infringed his script.  The district court held that Anderson's script was an infringing work not entitled to copyright protection. The court, citing Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp..  45 F.2d 119 (2d Cir. 1930), ruled that the characters in a  copyrighted work are protected when they are ""developed with enough specificity to constitute protect able expression."" Holding that the Rocky III characters met this standard, the court ruled that the Anderson script was a derivative work created without permission, and thus was not entailed to any copyright protection at all. Anderson appealed, and the case was settled out of court while this appeal was in progress. Details of the settlement were not disclosed. An unauthorized sequel to Harry Potter would probably face the same rule and reach the same result as in the Anderson case.It would depend on how much of the ""distinctive"" nature of JKR's characters and settings were used in the fanfic sequel. In This comment on the question user ""RedSonja"" writes: I know this is Law and you are looking for legal answers. But what you are proposing is plagiarism by the back door. JKR went to a lot of trouble inventing her universe. Why should you be able to just plug in and milk someone else's cow? If you are that highly original, write your own universe. Leaving aside the point that if the source is acknowledged it cannot be plagiarism, although it may be copyright infringement, this is essentially an ethical argument that the law should be different than it currently is.  Some authors make an essentially emotional argument, saying that their works or their characters are in effect ""children of the mind"" and that others should not touch them without permission, whatever the law may say. Some find such arguments persuasive or powerful.. I disagree with these arguments. Lantagne  on pages 172-179 of the law review article linked above, responds to such arguments, writing [Some footnotes omitted, others in {braces}]: Fanfiction is frequently devalued as not being ""real"" writing.
This is closely related to the aesthetic argument. Copyright only
protects creative expression.{See Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186, 219 (2002)} If the fanfiction is not creative
expression, then it is not copyrightable. That, however, is a different question from whether it is infringing.{See Tushnet, supra note 16, at 681 (""Fan fiction may not be copyrightable, but
that does not make it an infringing use...."").} It could be that the ""not real writing"" argument, translated into legalese, really expresses the idea that the work of fanfiction is not transformative enough.{See Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, 510 U.S. 569, 580 (1994) (""If, on the contrary, the commentary has no critical bearing on the substance or style of the original composition, which the alleged infringer merely uses to get attention or to avoid the drudgery in working up something fresh, the claim to fairness in borrowing from another's work diminishes accordingly (if it does not vanish), and other factors, like the extent of its commerciality, loom larger.""). Importantly, however, a work does not have to be transformative to be protected under fair use. See id. at 579. The fair use test is not forgiving of shortcuts.} However, this alone does not automatically make the work a copyright infringement because other fair use factors remain. Many authors frequently describe fanfiction as being the
equivalent of an affront against their relatives.{See Gabaldon, supra note 7 (""[L]et us just say that there's a difference between
someone dating red-haired men, and the same someone trying to seduce my husband.... I wouldn't like people writing sex fantasies for public consumption about me or members of my family-why would I be all right with them doing it to the intimate creations of my
imagination and personality?""); Someone Is Angry on the Internet, supra note 11 (""My characters are my children, I have been heard to say. I don't want people making off with them, thank you.""); Hobb, supra note 7 (comparing fanfiction to PhotoShopping a family
photo).} While the artistic protectiveness for one's creation is understandable, it is not a valid argument in U.S. copyright law. Artists have the right to control derivative works of their creations. If the fair use factors come out the wrong way [for the reuser], artists can prevent that use of their work. However, the purpose of copyright is not to prevent all use by others of an artistic work.{See, e.g., Campbell, 510 U.S. at 574-77 (""From the infancy of copyright protection, some opportunity for fair use of copyrighted materials has been thought necessary to fulfill copyright's very purpose ...)} It never has been. The very character of the fair use test illustrates this, as it protects most strongly those uses of an artist's creation that the artist would never permit.{See Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co., 268 F.3d 1257, 1282-83 (11th Cir.2001) (Marcus, J., concurring) (""To the extent the Suntrust [sought to impose editorial restrictions] to preserve Gone With the Wind's reputation, or protect its story from 'taint,'
however, it may not now invoke copyright to further that goal. Of course, Suntrust can choose to license its derivative however it wishes and insist that those derivatives remain free of content it deems disreputable. Suntrust may be vigilant of Gone With the Wind's
public image-but it may not use copyright to shield Gone With the Wind from unwelcome comment, a policy that would extend intellectual property protection 'into the precincts of censorship,' in Pat Conroy's words."")} Arguably, the more that a fanfiction work criticizes or parodies the original work, the more that fanfiction is a fair use. Thus, the argument that fanfiction should not be permitted because it transforms the original authors' characters mirrors the argument for exactly why fanfiction should be permitted under copyright law. ... The arguments that authors advance when they argue against
copyright belong in a regime without fair use-a regime that would
ignore the central purpose of U.S. copyright.""' Such a conclusion is
not only potentially untenable under the Constitution, but is also
undesirable.""' ""The public's interest in free expression . . . is
significant."""" There is no question that courts have, throughout the
history of copyright law, sought to protect that public interest.
However, there is also no question that courts are inevitably
swayed by value arguments. This should not be the case, but such
influence is inevitable.  ' Furthermore, value is a chicken-and-egg
argument: Campbell did not base its decision on the popularity of
music sampling, but surely the popularity informed Campbell's
understanding of the critical commentary value of ""Pretty Woman."" ... [T]he use of the word ""fair"" in ""fair use"" does not mean that
it is fair to the author's wishes. Rather, it means that it is fair to the purposes of copyright. None of the emotional arguments frequently raised against
fanfiction support a blanket proclamation that none of it is fair use. Truthfully, much of fanfiction may very well not be fair use.
However, a true test case of fanfiction, logically evaluating each
factor, would be invaluable in moving the fanfiction debate past the
emotions of the participants. The argument should focus not on the
emotions of the author or the quality of the writing, but on the fair use factors: on the purpose, character, and possible transformative nature of the work, on the amount of the original copyrighted work used, on the nature of the original copyrighted work, and on the effect on the market of the original copyrighted work. These are the factors that best protect the advancement of the twin goals of U.S. copyright. I agree with Lantagne here, it is often exactly those uses that a copyright owner will not want to approve that should be permitted as an exception to copyright. The limited statutory monopoly is granted in return for a contribution to the clutural fabric, and such work should therefore be available for use in further developing that fabric where it does not deprive the copyright holder of financial rewards, and where such uses in general are of public benefit. I take it thatr current US copyright law follows that goal, more or less. The rule on derivative works is also contained in the Berne Copyright Convention and the WTO's TRIPPS Agreement, and so applies in almost every country. Exceptions to copyright, however, vary widely. The concept of Fair Use is originally a purely US concept, although it has been adopted by Israel, and in part by a few other countries. Other countries generally have more specific and narrower exceptions, but often have several different exceptions. India has some 28 different exceptions in its copyright law.  Few of these seem likely to be any more favorable to a fanfiction sequel than the US concept of fair use."
How is it legal for a hospital to put two patients together in the same room in the US?,"As a short answer, guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services has clarified that HIPAA does not require hospitals to provide separate rooms. As a longer answer, HIPAA is very deeply misunderstood. It does not prohibit ""leaking"" patient information; it prohibits unreasonable and unpermitted disclosures of protected health information (PHI). Among the PHI disclosures that are permitted are uses that are for the purpose of delivering medical treatment. Of course, the covered entity (in this case, the hospital) is required to take reasonable measures to safeguard that information. One of the areas that trips people up is figuring out exactly what it is we're safeguarding that information from. A lot people assume that the HIPAA imposes an absolute rule against disclosure of PHI, but it's more accurate to say that HIPAA requires reasonable safeguards against the unauthorized use of PHI. With that standard in mind, it becomes easier to see why you don't need to universally separate patients. In all likelihood, neither you nor your roommate is likely to use the other's PHI in any way not allowed under HIPAA. We can look at your question as proof: You've disclosed a person's health condition and medical history, but you were a reasonable person and omitted the man's name, birth date, record number, and anything else that might allow us to link that information to an individual. Hospitals -- and the law -- recognize that most people have no interest in a random strangers' medical information, let alone plans to do something nefarious with it. Because there isn't much of a threat there, the hospital isn't required to take exhaustive measures to protect the information. But when you put all that information for every patient for every doctor for every department for every hospital into a single database, the information starts getting a lot more valuable. That's why there are much tighter regulations surrounding protection of electronic records. Of course, the roommate situation might be different if the hospital had a patient that they somehow knew had a history of identity theft or even a history of disclosing PHI. I've never heard of this happening, but I'd imagine that that knowledge would require the hospital to either segregate that patient or otherwise take extra care to avoid disclosing any information about a roommate."
GDPR + git history,"I believe in this regard there is a legitimate interest to not delete this information. You would have to perform a legitimate interest assessment, but for us (with private repositories) the reason would be to ensure that if in the future any malicious or illegal code was found that was knowingly committed to a repository there is trail and a way of understanding who did it."
"Do the Ohio sheriffs suing Afroman have any legal standing in their claim of ""invasion of privacy and misappropriation of their likenesses"" lawsuit?","""Standing"" is just a legal principle that limits the legal process to people who have suffered certain types of injuries. Jen's answer offers a good explanation of why the answer is yes, they do have standing. But I assume you're less interested in whether the officers are capable of bringing the case than in whether their case is likely to succeed. The answer to that is no. Claim 1 alleges a violation of Ohio's right-of-publicity statute. But that statute includes a carveout for any ""use of the persona of an individual that is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution as long as the use does not convey or reasonably suggest endorsement by the individual whose persona is at issue."" Ohio Rev. Code 2741.09 . So the officers lose if Afroman's videos are protected by the First Amendment. And they almost certainly are, as the assumption is that all speech is protected unless it falls into one of several very narrow categories -- incitement, defamation, fighting words, etc. -- that are pretty clearly not applicable here. Claim 2 alleges misappropriation of persona. This claim strikes me as the strongest, but probably still pretty weak. To win this claim, the deputies must prove: Jackson v. Playboy Enters., Inc., 574 F. Supp. 10, 13 (S.D. Ohio 1983). See also Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broad. Co., 433 U.S. 562, 576 (1977) (""No social purpose is served by having the defendant get free some aspect of the plaintiff that would have market value and for which he would normally pay.""). It seems like it will be difficult to argue that the deputies' names or likenesses have any intrinsic value on which to premise damages. If the idea of this tort is to give the plaintiff the benefit of the commercial value of the misapporpriation, the court must evaluate whether there's any commercial value to the use of the deputies' names or images. Are these deputies moonlighting as models? Would they have licensed the use of their likenesses if Afroman had so requested? It seems unlikely. Instead, the value of using them in these contexts arises only from their connection with a newsworthy event on which Afroman wishes to comment. That seems to move us out of privacy territory and into protected speech territory, which means Claim 2 should fail. Claim 3 alleges false-light invasion of privacy. To win this claim, the deputies must prove: Welling v. Weinfeld, 113 Ohio St. 3d 464, 473 (2007). The complaint does not identify any statements Afroman made that were false or that placed the deputies in a false light before the public. The only things I can see as possibly ""false"" are the hyperbolic statements mocking the police officers, such as those suggesting that a female deputy is actually a man because her voice was ""three octaves lower"" than his, or his suggestions that the police are members of the KKK. Without something more substantial that reasonable people would have been likely to truly believe was true, this claim is likely to fail also, as hyperbole and opinion are generally protected under the First Amendment. Vail v. the Plain Dealer Publishing Co., 72 Ohio St. 3d 279, 283 (Ohio 1995) (“The ordinary reader would accept this column as opinion and not as fact. Therefore, the statements are protected.”). Claim 4 alleges unreasonable publicity given to private lives. To win this claim, the deputies must prove: Cox v. Hausmann, No. 3:17-cv-02420, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181458, at *33 (N.D. Ohio Sep. 30, 2020). From my review of the complaint and some of Afroman's media, it doesn't look like Afroman has publicized any facts that are subject to a legitimate claim of privacy. Instead, Afroman has published video of government officials, engaged in the work of government, and commented on those videos. Those are matters about the deputies' public lives, not private, and the conduct of police is of legitimate concern to the public. Claim 4 should therefore also fail. It seems more likely that this case was brought to intimidate Afroman or to create some kind of leverage in the civil-rights claim Afroman will probably be bringing based on potential violations of his Fourth Amendment rights. If this is correct, the deputies will be lucky to have the case simply dismissed. Sanctions and an abuse-of-process counterclaim are more likely."
"If the police search my vehicle or house without my consent, and they don't find anything, what recourse is there?","You can file a federal criminal complaint under 18 USC 242 - Deprivation of rights under color of law, or (most commonly) a civil claim under 42 USC 1983 for the violation of your civil rights. There are usually state laws, from some form of harassment (usually a summary offense) to misdemeanors like the Official Oppression we have in Pennsylvania. Note that you can file these complaints even if they do find something incriminating.  An illegal search is illegal regardless of its fruits."
Does Elon Musk have any grounds for legal action against people who track his plane?,"Specifically, the threatened action is about stalking and implicit threats to his family. I'm not suggesting that there is a lot of merit to the claim, but that is how he is presenting the argument. The question would be where there is an intentional, repeated following of a person for the purpose of harassing the person with express or implied threats of violence or death. The jury would have to decide whether the implicit threat is credible (somebody plans to blow him or his family out of the sky), a decision would probably turn on the number of death threats he receives."
What is the legal distinction between Twitter banning Trump and Trump blocking individuals?,"Trump was an officer of the government, and Twitter wasn't.  The First Amendment forbids the government and its agents from viewpoint discrimination, but private companies are not bound by it and can discriminate as much as they please. (There was a question as to whether such discrimination might affect whether the company enjoys a shield from liability under 47 USC 230, but even so they have the right to block and censor as they wish if they are willing to risk that liability.)"
What's the problem with red ink?,"It depends on jurisdiction and purpose. In Ohio, per O.R.C. 317.114(A) an instrument or document presented for recording to the county
recorder shall have been prepared in accordance with all of the
following requirements:.. (4) Black or blue ink only; There are also blue-specific requirements, for example in Pierce County WA juvenile courts, a petition to list a sex offender registration requirement must be signed in blue  (so that the original can easily be identified)."
Can you legally move a dead body to preserve it as evidence?,"In this specific scenario, not only is it not a crime, failure to do so is a breach of proper maritime protocols and could be illegal. A person manning a boat and sees a human in water in distress should immediately go to the rescue or recovery of the victim. This is commonly started by the crewman of the vessel who spots the body shouting ""Man overboard"" once... which triggers every crewman on the deck to also shout the same thing exactly once regardless of if they can see the man who is overboard (The idea is that the call is so all crew on the deck are not announcing the sighting but responding that they know there's an emergency situation in progress... and to muster to the appropriate situations). The boat's helmsman or pilot will then proceed to maneuver to recover the body in the water and bring it onboard the boat, (if traveling by sail, to then as soon as possible transfer to a motor powered vessel or to land which ever is quicker). Additionally, should the boat have radio communication, the situation should trigger a mayday communication which will alert other vessels, regardless of purpose and local emergency services to the situation, with GPS tracking aiding all responders.  Typically while underway at sea or in large bodies of water, all operators of watercraft are required to respond, regardless of actual purpose on the water (recall the famous ""Miracle on the Hudson"" incident where New York Ferry Operators were the actual first responders to get ALL passengers and crew off the crashed plane to land, where EMS and police services were waiting to deal with the survivors).  Most boating licenses these days require a basic understanding of duties with maritime safety and if you come upon a situation while underway, you are a first responder automatically. Remove the question of water and say that there is person who you are unsure of if they are alive or dead on dry land.  Under law, you cannot be held liable for anything you do in the course of saving a life so long as you are acting within your competency to do so, and do not take actions you are not licensed to do as part of training, oversight, and regulations dictate, you cannot be sued for medical injuries inflicted on someone in the course of saving their life (called ""Life over Limb""... that if the only way to save an unconscious person from death is to amputate a limb, you're not liable for cutting off the limb in question, so long as you are trained to do this. To a lesser extreme example, if CPR is performed right, you will break the victims ribs... since it's a question of keeping the person alive, the temporary pain and handicap of broken ribs is seen as acceptable). As a lifeguard (for pools, I wasn't certified for ""wilderness lifeguarding"" but the differences in this respect were minimum) your first thing to do when getting in the water to fish out a swimmer in distress was to get them back to the pool deck before life efforts could occur (there are a few times where you had to start the life saving efforts in water, but I can count them on one hand, and one of those incidents was only after confirming your victim was conscious and even then you still were moving to get them out of the water asap... it's just asap would be a little bit longer.  We also weren't trained to pronounce death.  If it was so serious that CPR starts, you do not stop unless another guard or EMS relieve you.). In these situations, there is proper evidence gathering procedures that will be used to establish what happened.  For example, the first responders will be fingerprinted and prints in the areas touched for life saving efforts will be noted as part of the evidence.   Additionally, paramedics, EMS and first responders will often alert police to any items of note they saw around the victim that were disturbed in the process of life saving efforts.  The police may collect evidence from you to rule you out as a suspect (by showing the evidence on the body was consistent with applied life saving techniques) and to identify evidence not related to you at all (a pink fiber on the body that doesn't match any of your clothes means the body came into contact with the fibers from another source). This also establishes ""Chain of Custody"" when you call the body in and stay with it and allow minimum contact with it (many larger ships will store the body in a locked room to keep crew and passenger contact to a minimum). Either way, so long as you tell the police everything you did in rescue and recovery, this isn't tampering with evidence on the face of it.  If something that is inconsistent with your story comes up, it's not necessarily incriminating either... in the heat of the moment in a rescue and recovery effort, tunnel vision can form and you aren't expect to recall everything you did.  Police should know this and understand that you were cooperating in what for most of the world is an unusual situation."
Can a soldier refuse to carry a weapon?,"In the UK Armed Forces, conscientious objection is grounds for a refusal at the admission stage and has been since the end of conscription in 1963. Where a person develops an objection to military service during their term of service, they have the option to appeal for a discharge. Interestingly there's no primary legislation to manage this process but there are established military procedures to take care of this when it happens. Mostly the process seems to be managed informally, with the objector simply being shuffled into a non-combatant role within their regiment and just left there for the foreseeable. Where that's insufficient for the objector, the process can be made formal, something that appears to invariably result in them being discharged from the service. A member of the forces who has a conscientious objection is generally expected to raise the issue informally with his/her commanding officer. The officer’s options include rejecting the objection outright or moving the objector to a different position (such as a non-combatant role). If the person concerned remains unsatisfied, he/she can make a formal application for discharge due to conscientious objection. After an interview which usually involves a chaplain or other third party, the commanding officer makes a recommendation to the chain of command where the decision for discharge or refusal is made. If turned down at this stage, the applicant can appeal to the Advisory Committee on Conscientious Objectors (ACCO) who hold a hearing and make a recommendation to the Defence Secretary. Discharges due to conscientious objection are rare, with only six granted between 2001 and 2010. ForcesWatch briefing: Conscientious Objection in the UK Armed Forces - Parliament UK That all being said, a proportion of objectors are (apparently) removed from service without their conscientious objection being acknowledged. They're just ejected as unfit, in the same way that you would remove someone who was persistently ill. The forces helpline At Ease reports that at least some who raise a conscientious objection have been discharged on other grounds such as for “service no longer required” or “unfit for further service”."
Is it legal to have an abortion in another state or abroad?,"Does the ""US national"" above matter? The nationality of the person is not relevant.  Like most criminal statutes, the law applies to acts within the jurisdiction of Alabama, which basically means within the state's territory.  The only foreign people who would be immune from that jurisdiction would be diplomats and the like, but such people would not be licensed to practice medicine in Alabama.  This brings us to the point in the next paragraph. is it still a felony to have an abortion outside of Alabama? No.  It is not even a felony to have an abortion inside Alabama.  The law does not criminalize having abortions.  It criminalizes performing abortions.  See section 5 of the law: Section 5. No woman upon whom an abortion is performed or attempted to be performed shall be criminally or civilly liable. Furthermore, no physician confirming the serious health risk to the child's mother shall be criminally or civilly liable for those actions. To extend your question, let us consider a doctor who is licensed to practice medicine both in Alabama and in some other jurisdiction where abortion is legal.  Such a doctor could not be convicted under Alabama law for performing abortions in the other jurisdiction."
"Consent to searches: Who wins ""my-word-against-yours?""","This is not a simple question. There are hundreds of page treatises on consent - explicit, implied, obtained by trickery, revoked, coerced by show, coerced by intimidation. If it ever was just a he said (s)he said situation, that certainly  does not mean that the testimony of those two individuals are all that's considered to determine (1) that the prosecutor failed to meet it's burden; nor does it mean (2) that the consent was (legally) given. None of these answers (nor this answer) could possibly adequately  address the complexity of the analysis a court will endeavor to undertake when evidence is the result of a search that was alleged to be consensual. The court will look to the totality of the circumstances to make this determination. What is correct is that this is a question of law for a judge, and not a question of fact for a jury. The clarifying comments (somewhat) allude to the depth of the inquiry. What is a complete misnomer is that there is one standard or burden, because they can shift based on the circumstances and the arguments made. It is always going to undertake a complete analysis of the entirety of the circumstances and never just the testimony of cop vs. suspect. The what, where, who and when of the search are also really important and will always impact the ruling. Was it a car? Rules as to vehicular searches are different depending on the circumstances. Who agreed to the search - a child?  A roommate? A spouse or domestic partner? Different rules apply to all these situations.  What was searched? Was it a house? A hotel room? Rules apply to threshold entry. If a dwelling and the defendant did not consent, how did they get in? Was the door broken? What was the scope of the search? Was it invasive or limited? Did it start with plain view evidence?  Was it a search of person? At an airport? At customs? Were they already under x-ray analysis? Was Miranda issued? These and many other things matter....a lot! It is almost never just the defendant saying that consent wasn't given (eg. police search because of consent then defendant denies consent)  There is always intrinsic or extrinsic evidence to consider. Actual physical or  circumstantial evidence. Witnesses to the search. Something.  Typically, what you see are cases where the scope of consent is broadened by the police without additional consent, (eg. defendant said police could look around living room and they opened up drawers or went into the kitchen), or coercion is argued, or most commonly, it is argued that although consent was given, it was involuntary. There are a million ways to argue these factors but nobody will ever believe the police searched on consent when it just blatantly never happened. They don't. They would sooner make up probable cause for a warrant, or claim that there was exigent circumstances than search based on consent that never occurred. Consent happens all the time. It is the most used type of search leading to arrest, because people just don't think they can say no. Testimony of the defendant alone is rarely going to be enough to overturn a search. There is always something more. The analysis is based on the totality of the circumstances....the court(s) have said this time and time again. As the United States Supreme Court explained, “The standard for measuring the scope of a suspect’s consent (or if a suspect consented) under the Fourth Amendment is that of objective reasonableness - what would the typical reasonable person have understood by the exchange between the officer and the suspect?” Florida v. Jimeno (1991) 500 U.S. 248, 251"

Why did this US prosecutor keep asking whether documents would refresh a witness's memory?,"united-states Witnesses are generally confined to giving testimony from their own personal memory; most of the time, they can't read a statement into the record or just tell the jury to go look at some other piece of evidence. But this creates problems when a witness knows an important fact but doesn't remember it when she takes the stand. Maybe she counted exactly how much money she stuffed in the robber's bag as she was doing it, and she wrote it down as soon as he fled, but a year later, she can't remember that it was $93,736.45. But the prosecutor isn't allowed to just give the witness a stack of evidence and let her go hunting through the documents to answer each question. Instead,he goes through the ""Do you remember"" colloquy to lay the necessary foundation to refresh the witness's memory, as contemplated by Rule 612, which then also triggers certain rights for the opposing party with respect to the document used to refresh the witness's memory."
"What is the legal status of ""warrant canaries""?","The question actually asked, ""what legal theories would support or harm..."", is somewhat unclear. But what the questioner seems to be asking is, basically, what would happen if you tried it? The answer, it seems to me, is pretty straightforward. In the hypothetical case, you have been publishing a notice for years, saying ""I have not been served with a subpoena."" You then get served with a subpoena that includes a gag order. The gag order, presumably, includes wording prohibiting you from revealing the existence of the subpoena. You then cease publication of the warrant canary. By doing so, you have revealed the existence of the subpoena, and you are in violation of the gag order. You will be subject to whatever penalties you would be subject to if you violated it in some other way; for example, by publishing a notice that said, ""Hey! We got a subpoena! It's a secret!"" The distinction between revealing the existence of the subpoena by action, rather than by inaction, is a false one. It's exactly the kind of cutesy legal formality that non-lawyers love to rely on, but real judges ignore. If you tell someone: ""Hey, you know John Smith's three sons, Joe, Ted, and Bill? Joe and Ted are good people; they have never molested any children. As for Bill--well, I don't have anything to say about Bill."" If Bill is not a child molester, you have defamed him, and you are not going to convince a judge otherwise. The EFF link you link to tries to claim it'll ""work"" because courts are reluctant to enforce speech. Even if that were true, that might mean your canary would be effective in the sense of giving the public notice of the subpoena. That doesn't mean you wouldn't be liable for giving the public notice. For example: I put up a billboard saying ""Bill Smith is a pedophile."" Even if the court can't force me to add the word ""not"", that doesn't mean the billboard isn't defamatory. Realistically, though, courts compel speech all the time. Court-ordered apologies, disclosures, and notices are not unusual. And if ever a court would be inclined to compel speech, it would be in a situation like this one, where a company intentionally set out to get around a gag order with this kind of convoluted sea-lawyering."
Isn't a hung jury proof of reasonable doubt?,"One cannot conclude the question of guilt in either direction, so one must try again to see if a different jury can answer the meta-question, to then answer the legal question of guilt. If only one person is voting against the consensus, or as many as are allowed by the jurisdiction, they are overruled. That's the allowance made for bias that has somehow reached the jury despite the filtering done beforehand. If more people are voting against the majority so that consensus is not possible, it is potentially because someone has made up their mind on the question of guilt regardless of what (some significant part or the weight of) the evidence indicates, defeating the purpose of the trial and providing all the evidence. A person not accounting for all the evidence can't be said to have reasonable doubt of guilt, since the doubt may be excluded by the remaining evidence. Similarly, guilt beyond reasonable doubt cannot be supported by only partial evidence, as exculpatory evidence may be among the part not accounted for. Finally, a jury split on the decision of how to weigh the evidence cannot claim either to have or to have dismissed reasonable doubt, because they cannot agree on what a reasonable doubt is, in the first place."
"Do I have legal rights against a company that offered me a raise to not leave, and then promptly fired me after turning down the other offer?","It depends to a large degree on local employment laws. Depending on how the counteroffer was worded, it might have constituted anything from a binding legal contract for employment for some reasonable minimum term, or a totally non-binding suggestion that was worth less than the air breathed while pronouncing it. Some things to consider would include: What are local employment laws like? Do they require that termination be for cause? If so, what are causes for termination? Does termination require any kind of remediation beforehand? Note that in an at-will, right-to-work state in the US, odds are that the employee can be fired for any time and for any reason, supposing the employer hasn't accidentally entered into a contract by extending the counteroffer. What did the counteroffer say? Did it stipulate that the offer was not for a definite term and that the company reserved the right to terminate the employee for any reason, or no reason at all? Odds are any sufficiently serious business in an at- will, right-to-work state would use standard legal language in any offer or counteroffer to ensure that they are on the right side of this, so odds are the counteroffer was accepted with no obligations at all on the company. Does the termination affect eligibility for unemployment benefits? I would say most likely not, as the termination would probably be recorded as being for no reason legally speaking (if they admitted to terminating the employee for seeking other employment, interested government officials could take a dim view of the company's actions). You'd probably have at least some unemployment compensation coming your way. Some professional - not legal - advice. Never accept a counteroffer. Only get another offer in the first place if you are committed to leaving your current employer no matter what. If your company really insists, you should insist on a minimum definite term of employment written into a legal contract which is signed by an executive and notarized. No company will agree to this (unless the term is shorter than you'd want as a full-time W-2 anyway) but if they do, hey, you have some security (if the company agrees to this, have your own lawyer - whom you pay with your own money - review the document). Even then, I would be very, very careful about staying at a company after getting a counteroffer. Don't do it. Ever. Never accept a counteroffer. One comment asks why I recommend never accepting a counteroffer. There are at least two reasons: The reason you are looking for a new job should be that there is something about your current job that isn't completely satisfactory and that you haven't been able to fix. Either you have grown out of the position, don't like the work, feel you're underpaid, don't get along with somebody, etc. If you were unable or unwilling to fix any of these issues without having another job on the table, having another job on the table shouldn't be what makes you willing and able to fix them. Why work somewhere that you'd constantly need to go job hunting to address workplace issues? Unless the company makes firm agreements about how long they're going to keep you around, you have no guarantee that they'll keep you. Presumably, you didn't have one before, and you don't have one at the new job, but the fact that you are currently employed might support the assumption that your employment would be continued at your current employer and the offer might support the assumption the new employer plans to employ you indefinitely. When you put in your notice, it makes the company more aware of the fact that you could leave at any time; while a perfectly rational actor would realize that this doesn't change the situation at all, companies are run by people and people often act irrationally. Perhaps your manager is vindictive, perhaps your manager is scared that you will still leave after accepting the counteroffer. Maybe your manager knows there are layoffs coming but needs you for the busy season. Hiring replacements can be time-consuming and expensive - and employees who are getting offers of employment elsewhere and putting in notice might be seen as risks. I'm not saying that accepting a counteroffer has always turned out badly. Falling coconuts kill 150 people every year. Still, I am not going to add a coconut rider to my insurance policy and I am not going to accept a counteroffer."
Was it illegal for Nancy Pelosi to tear up her copy of the State of the Union address?,"While there is an act that President Trump and his supporters are citing, titled the Presidential Records Act (PRA), 
 to accuse House Speaker Pelosi of breaking federal law, it is important to understand what actions the law accounts for. The act mandates that the President of the United States preserve records and other laws governing the federal government. This serves as a form of checks and balances to prevent the president and his advisers from shielding documentary information from public view. The act is fairly new, as it was passed in 1981. It is important to realize that this law does not apply to print outs or widely circulated documents. Moreover, the copy of the State of the Union that she was given is not a governmental record. Therefore, House Speaker Pelosi did not violate the Presidential Records Act, nor any other federal law. However, it is open to debate whether Pelosi's action was appropriate, though I will not supply my opinion on that matter."
What happens if a law contains an error of fact?,"Nix v. Hedden, 149 U.S. 304 (1893) is a famous ""error of fact"" case in the US. The situation was that there was an import tariff imposed on ""vegetables in their natural state"" brought in from outside the US, but not on ""Fruits, green, ripe, or dried, not specially enumerated or provided for in this act"" which were on a ""free"" list. Since imported tomatoes were taxed, it was said that tomatoes are fruits and not vegetables. The court ruled that for legal purposes the terms ""vegetable"" and ""fruit"" have their ordinary meaning, and are not held to a possibly variable scientific definition. Definitions were read from Webster's Dictionary, Worcester's Dictionary and the Imperial Dictionary, and witnesses with decades of experience in the produce trade were called who testified as to whether the words had ""any special meaning in trade or commerce, different from those read"". Dictionary entries were read regarding the definition of the words pea, eggplant, cucumber, squash, pepper, potato, turnip, parsnip, cauliflower and so on. The court reasoned as follows based on the evidence. First, The passages cited from the dictionaries define the word ‘fruit’ as
the seed of plaints, or that part of plaints which contains the seed,
and especially the juicy, pulpy products of certain plants, covering
and containing the seed. These definitions have no tendency to show
that tomatoes are ‘fruit,’ as distinguished from ‘vegetables,’ in
common speech, or within the meaning of the tariff act and since the terms do not have a special meaning in trade or commerce, they must receive their ordinary meaning. Observe that ""scientific definition"" is not even a contender in this discussion. The court observed that ""dictionaries are admitted, not as evidence, but only as aids to the memory and understanding of the court"". The crux of the ruling is the following observation: Botanically speaking, tomatoes are the fruit of a vine, just as are
cucumbers, squashes, beans, and peas. But in the common language of
the people, whether sellers or consumers of provisions, all these are
vegetables which are grown in kitchen gardens, and which, whether
eaten cooked or raw, are, like potatoes, carrots, parsnips, turnips,
beets, cauliflower, cabbage, celery, and lettuce, usually served at
dinner in, with, or after the soup, fish, or meats which constitute
the principal part of the repast, and not, like fruits generally, as
dessert. In other words, specialized scientific definitions are not assumed to underlie the use of words selected by lawmakers. If lawmakers list ""fish, such as pike, capybara, and perch"", then for purposes of that law and that law alone, capybara is defined to be a fish. Explicit redefinitions are fairly commonplace in writing laws, and lawmakers universally have the power to redefine words so that ""and means or and or means and, as necessary"". An example of a deliberate statutory redefinition is the fact that a bee is a fish in California, for some purposes, see Almond v. Fish. In the Fish & Game Code, FGC §45, “Fish” means a wild fish, mollusk, crustacean, invertebrate,
amphibian, or part, spawn, or ovum of any of those animals which means that worms and jellyfish, and insects, are legal fish. The Endangered Species Act §2062 then says “Endangered species” means a native species or subspecies of a bird,
mammal, fish, amphibian, reptile, or plant which is in serious danger
of becoming extinct throughout all, or a significant portion, of its
range due to one or more causes, including loss of habitat, change in
habitat, overexploitation, predation, competition, or disease. Notice that under an interpretation of the law that ignores the statutory redefinition in §45, invertebrates and a number of chordates would not be protected by law. The court notes that this was a deliberate action by the legislature in 1969, in that
enrolled bill reports in support of this modification included the argument that The expanded definition of fish will permit closer control and
monitoring of the harvest of species such as starfish, sea urchins,
sponges and worms, and the ... Commission will be authorized to make
regulations deemed necessary for proper protection and management of
these species"
Why don't laws have examples?,"They are called “judgements” Every case decided by a court is an example, in common law jurisdictions at least. When those cases are decided by an superior court they become precedents - binding “examples” on courts in their hierarchy and persuasive “examples” on other courts. When you go to a lawyer for advice, she doesn’t just parrot back the statute, she looks at the precedents and decides whether the case decided by the House of Lords in 1848 or the High Court of Australia in 1912 more closely matches your situation. Also, statute law often has examples written into them Statues exist in hierarchies, Constitution, Acts, Regulations, Departmental Policies etc. and the lower you go the more specific the law is and the more likely it is to have examples. For example, this answer I wrote for another question quotes examples from the new-south-wales Evidence Act. "
Is ban evasion illegal?,"In theory, such an action could be considered a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, specifically 18 USC 1030 (a)(2)(C): Whoever...intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains... information from any protected computer; Where the relevant ""protected computer"" definition is in the same section under (e)(2)(B): As used in this section...the term “protected computer” means a computer...which is used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United States; Every computer connected to the Internet is used in interstate and foreign communication. One could imagine a situation where a prosecutor might use this particular quirk of the CFAA, for example if Jody was evading bans in order to harass someone and the prosecutor wanted to throw the book at her, but I'd guess most prosecutors would not pick up such a case if Jody's ban evasion didn't cause any damage."
Is it a real legal principle that any ambiguity in a contract is interpreted to the benefit of the side that did not write the contract?,"However, it's a principle that is rarely applied in practice since it's at the end of a long line of judicial reasoning that gets applied first. Ambiguity in contract provisions are usually resolved by the golden rule: In the vast majority of case, this approach will give a meaning the court adopts without needing to invoke the contra proferentem rule. However, in the minority of cases where the rule is applied it works like this. The ambiguity should be interpreted against: Finally, contra proferentem may not apply because:"
"If you are a lawyer of a thief, drug dealer, or human trafficker, what would you tell your client to tell IRS?","NAL, but I used to work for the IRS. GS-0592-08, AUSC W/I CSCI (for non-feds, that means General Sector, series 0592 grade 8, Tax Examiner, Austin Service Center, Division -> Wage & Investment, Section -> Collections Services and Compliance Operations. Yeah, no joke.) And I wanted to add some insider insight to help clarify some of the thoughts already shared here. First off, I feel like clarification is needed because lay people get especially confused about this very, very easily: the IRS is an agency exactly like the FBI, except the IRS falls under the US Dept of Treasury and the FBI falls under the US Department of Justice. Like all federal agencies, both the FBI and the IRS exist to enforce federal law. They're both law enforcement agencies. And again, the difference is the kind of law they enforce: the FBI enforces federal criminal law. The IRS enforces federal tax law. The IRS does not need (and wouldn't accept, not that the FBI would try - completely different jurisdictions) any help whatsoever from the FBI in enforcing tax law, including criminal tax law. The IRS does not disclose tax information; the confidentiality of taxpayer information is more intense than HIPAA. Literally nothing short of an act of Congress or a certain breed of court order can compel the IRS to disclose federal income tax information. (Not going to get into charitable orgs in this answer, but even then, the IRS doesn't make those filings public - the orgs themselves do, public self-reporting is a requirement of maintaining their tax-exempt status.) The FBI didn't get Al Capone; the IRS did. For tax evasion. Anyway, in answer to the OP's question: THE IRS IS NOT ACTUALLY CONCERNED WITH THE ORIGIN OF THE INCOME AS LONG AS YOU PAY TAXES ON IT. Anything and everything beyond federal tax law falls outside the IRS's scope. Which is why uou can write quite literally anything you want on line 80 (or whatever it is these days) of your 1040A (occupation) (technically, as long as you don’t perjure yourself, not that anybody's counting.) It's pretty much just a footnote anyway. As a tax preparer, you can skip it, and even if that line weren’t specifically, explicitly protected by the 5th Amendment, it wouldn't matter if it weren’t, because the IRS does not disclose federal income tax information with any other agencies or organizations under any circumstances. As long as whatever you put there is factually accurate - if you fill it out at all. You can answer in Klingon; nobody cares (unless you write something funny, which we actually appreciate btw ;) ), because it's not necessary to process your return. Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this return
and accompanying schedules and statements, and to the best of my
knowledge and belief, they are true, correct, and accurately list all
amounts and sources of income I received during the tax year.
Declaration of preparer (other than taxpayer) is based on all
information of which preparer has any knowledge. ""Sources of income"" means ""all the money you got paid, as best as you could record it"" - if you got paid cash waiting tables (tips) or slinging heroin, the IRS doesn't care as long as you report the income. You can write ""slinging heroin"" (it's the IRS, not the DEA) but tax preparer would probably pick the code for ""inside sales."" When the IRS participates in joint task forces, it is because the IRS's ability to track money is second to none (and even then, IRS involvement in task forces are usually related to terrorism.) The IRS occasionally assists other agencies with criminal law enforcement efforts, but the IRS doesn’t prosecute them and doesn’t involve confidential tax information in them. For example, as far as the IRS is concerned, if you embezzle a hundred grand and then launder it, the IRS’s criminal jurisdiction they’d be pursuing you for would be underreporting (and probably tax evasion.) If you embezzle a hundred grand, but file and pay your quarterly withholding (I never worked in Underreporter but I'm pretty sure fraud would be considered self-employment since by definition it's off the books) you’re in compliance with the IRS’s criminal jurisdiction. And yes, you have the right to itemize deductions, but not every expense is necessarily allowable - for example, some expenses have limits on how much can be deducted. So even if an expense was related to earning income, it doesn't mean you can necessarily claim it, or all of it; gas mileage driving to places you rob at gunpoint, sure - bullets? I guess if hunters or game tourism or shooting ranges / instructors can deduct bullets, a hitman could too, but I’d expect to get flagged for audit to see how much of what is actually permissible. But even if some or all of those deductions ended up being disallowed and you wound up with a balance due, as long as the IRS determines that you were not intentionally seeking to avoid or circumvent tax law, it wouldn’t be a criminal [tax] matter. I'd have to look, but if parking tickets aren't allowable, I strongly doubt bail, fines, restitution, etc. in conjunction with being criminal convictions associated with earned income would also not be allowable. The only way other agencies would gain visibility into this would be if someone were dumb enough to go to court at the conclusion of an audit, at which point the tax situation would become a matter of public record. To illustrate the lengths to which the IRS seeks to facilitate voluntary taxpayer compliance in meeting their obligations, when I was at the IRS in the mid-2000s, there was a program for drug dealers to file quarterly withholding as self-employed using a sort of special sticker book provided by the IRS to use in lieu of receipts. If a professional tax preparer or tax planner were assisting someone who discloses, or starts to disclose that this is actually illegal source income - the tax preparer just puts in a code for whatever comes closest to describing the occupation that earned the most income and the taxpayer doesn't have to be specific as long as they are not untruthful. (Honestly, you really can write whatever you want. Nobody cares. People put stuff down like ""pirate"" and ""bridge troll"" as well as stuff like ""slinging heroin"", ""bookie,"" ""racket,"" ""al qaeda"", etc.)"
Is it legal to copy a software license text from other companies to write my own?,"Software licenses are protected by copyright, meaning that you need the author's permission to copy them. One way to get permission is to buy a license, since many of them are for sale. Sometimes (e.g. CC licenses) a license to copy the license is granted. You can also read and understand what is in a license, and use that knowledge to write your own. This is different from copying the license, since what you are extracting from the existing licenses is the ideas, not the specific expression."
Can someone legally require me to return a gift they gave me?,"If someone gave a gift than requested it back is it legal? The request itself is legal, but that does not mean that you have to comply with it.  I never promised anything that tied to the tablet. So I'm not sure if

An unconditional gift (which initially you did not even want) fails to meet the elements of a cognizable doctrine such as contract, promissory estoppel, fraud, or unjust enrichment. he says he will report the tablet as stolen if I don't return it He might get in trouble if he does that, since he knows or should know that the tablet was never stolen.

Legality of penalising Russian Oligarchs,"In the united-kingdom, the legal basis flows from the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018. This allows regulations to be made for particular sanctions regimes, in this case The Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 and its several amendments, including three revisions this year. Under those regulations, the Secretary of State may designate individuals who are then subject to particular sanctions. A consolidated list is available for all individuals and organizations who have been named under any of the regulations, not just the Russia one. Working backwards from the list, we see such names as Vladimir Putin, who has an asset freeze on the grounds that - Vladimir Vladimirovich PUTIN is the President of the Russian Federation, carrying ultimate authority for the policy of the Russian government and Russian armed forces. In February 2022, PUTIN ordered Russian military forces to launch an invasion of Ukraine, undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. Thus, he has been named for the purposes of regulation 11, and the statement of reasons (required by regulation 8) refers to the specific grounds in regulation 6 by which a person can be added to the list. In this case, those grounds are 6(2)(a)(i) as interpreted by 6(3)(a), (2) In this regulation, an ""involved person"" means a person who —
(a) is or has been involved in—
 (i) destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine
...
(3) For the purposes of this regulation, a person is “involved in destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine” if—
(a) the person is responsible for, engages in, provides support for, or promotes any policy or action which destabilises Ukraine or undermines or threatens the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine For ""oligarchs"" who are on the list, the Foreign Secretary has specifically drawn attention to Gennady Timchenko, described as Russia's sixth-richest oligarch. The statement of reasons says: Gennadiy Timchenko, hereafter TIMCHENKO is a major shareholder in Bank ""Rossiya"". Bank ""Rossiya"" is a key stakeholder in the National Media Group which supports Russian policy which is destabilising Ukraine. Following the annexation of Crimea, Bank ""Rossiya"" has expanded its bank branches and provision of insurance and investment throughout Crimea and Sevastopol; and offers support to military activities and the formation of major transport links and cards that allow the public to travel easily around the peninsula. Therefore, Bank ""Rossiya"" has supported the consolidation of Crimea into the Russian Federation by integrating the financial system following the annexation of Crimea. TIMCHENKO therefore is or has been involved in engaging in, providing support for, or promoting any policy or action which destabilises Ukraine or undermines or threatens the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. Additionally, TIMCHENKO is associated with a person involved in destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine. These are the same regulation 6 grounds as for Putin, but with additional reasoning to draw the connection (also, a citation under 6(2)(d) for ""associated with""). One reason for this text being required is to undercut any suggestion that the listing is because of ""guilt by association"". In judicial review, for which continue reading below, this kind of statement and the process that gave rise to it is powerful evidence against a suggestion that the Secretary of State was acting other than rationally. We can now look back to the 2018 Act, which authorizes the 2019 Regulations and provides rules about how the Secretary of State can designate people. Detailed provisions in the Regulations trace back to rules in the Act about the shape of a sanctions regime; for example, the ""asset freeze"" of regulation 11 is within section 3 of the Act on ""Financial sanctions"". There are also procedural safeguards around the making of regulations, mainly relating to Parliamentary approval, and around the designation of individuals. For example, a designated person can ask the Secretary of State to be removed from the list, and under section 22(3) she must do so if the person doesn't fit the criteria by which they were originally included. That would include if they are no longer an ""involved person"", or if their designation were no longer deemed appropriate based on the purpose of the sanctions regulations. As with other executive actions, judicial review is available (under Chapter 4 of the Act), which could bring in considerations of whether the Secretary of State acted within her powers, did so ""reasonably"", etc. Human rights grounds are also possible, in relation to procedural fairness (Article 6) or the right to enjoy property (ECHR Protocol 1, Article 1). Against those stand arguments on the public interest, UK compliance with international obligations, national security, the general integrity of the sanctions system, and so forth. It is plausible that if a claim reached this point, the Secretary of State would be able to show that the designation - as described in the statement of reasons above - was on sound policy grounds, was taken after a sober review of the evidence, and was proportionate in the circumstances. There is not much case law on the 2018 Act, given its recency. One example is R (Youssef) v Secretary of State [2021] EWHC 3188 (Admin) in which an Article 6 claim failed. That was in relation to UN sanctions against Al-Qaida, which is a different position from the one here, but it has some force for understanding the current UK system. The present Act was created partially in response to the judgement in HM Treasury v Ahmed [2010] UKSC 2 against a previous version of the sanctions laws, and the 2021 case found that the new version was acceptable. The judicial review avenue and the requirement to give reasons are directly aimed at complying with Article 6. While a court could always potentially find another problem, the current Act and the Regulations are as watertight as the drafters can make them in the light of existing precedent."
Is the typo in the 25th amendment significant?,"Prologue, a magazine published by the National Archives, had an article about the missing S back in 2012. In short, the problem was due to a scrivener's error. Congress recognized the error at roughly the same time it submitted the amendment to the states but decided it was too late to fix it: There was a brief discussion of the possibility of recalling the joint resolution for reconsideration in each chamber, but Congress was operating under severe time pressures as it worked toward adjournment for the summer, and it was decided that the record of congressional debates and actions on successive versions of the joint resolution made the intent so clear that the missing s could not affect interpretation of the text. The proposed amendment was therefore allowed to go to the states in its imperfect form. Given the basically undisputed nature of the error, I think it would be unlikely that courts would indulge an argument that ""department"" should be interpreted differently than ""departments,"" at least in any way that would change the outcome of a dispute under the 25th Amendment."
Is it legal for BMW owners to enable heated car seats without paying the subscription fee?,"There are limits to what you are allowed to modify on your car.  Federal safety regulations require certain features to be installed by the manufacturer, and to be maintained by the owner in a state that they remain functional.  Besides obvious things like brakes, you need working headlights, turn signals, bumpers, wipers, etc. Heated seats is an option.  A luxury convenience feature.  Most cars don't have heated seats.  If you had heated seats, but left them off or the switch broke and they weren't working, there would be no reason for the State Patrol to care one bit that your rump was a bit chilly. So, the state doesn't care enough make it illegal to have heated seats or not.  It is entirely your choice. The question then becomes, does the state have any reason to care whether you have a manual switch to turn them on or off, or use a special software code to enable the feature? Logic dictates that if they don't care whether or not you have the feature, and don't care if you are using it or not, they would have not reason to care about the particular method you use to turn it on or off... Therefore the only real question is does BMW care?  They might, if you came up with a method of enabling heat without a subscription and it became known to them.  Especially if you made money publishing a how-to guide that cost them potential revenue.  But that would be a civil, rather than a criminal matter. To me this action would be equivalent to buying a burger at a place that charges $.25 for a packet of ketchup, and instead using your own ketchup.  It's your burger, and your ketchup, do what you want! ADDENDUM:
Based on discussion on the other answer, as well as a suggestion in comments, I would like to briefly address (my opinion) on the applicability of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DCMA) of 1998. I actually just looked up this act, and have only a layman's understanding of copyright law, but there is a basic element that needs to be met for a violation to occur:  The copyrighted material must be reproduced, altered, repurposed, and distributed in some manner.  Private avoidance or selective non-use of a digital feature would not seem to rise to that level. I touched on this above when I alluded to publishing a written hack.  It would probably also apply if you offered code that would bypass a feature, or to a car tuner offering to enable the feature for a fee.  If there is a commercial benefit, there is a potential ""victim"", and a copyright issue. However, even code is questionable...  There are many examples of companies offering aftermarket Engine Control Module code to enhance performance or improve gas mileage.  Of course a manufacturer could always challenge a commercial competitor, but lawsuits cause money and create publicity - positive and negative.  About the only ""free"" enforcement tool a manufacturer has is to not honor the warranty on any owner altered parts. Of note is the fact that seat heating elements are not digital, copyrighted, or otherwise protected work.  The digital intellectual property that MIGHT potentially be at the center of a copyright controversy is the function of the pay system and the processing of an access code that unlocks a relay.  What that relay sends electrical current to is really immaterial.  It could be your stereo, it could be the airbag... One person snipping and splicing wire to avoid the IP ""brain"" and install a simple on/off switch or rheostat for personal use of seat heat should not be violation of any digital copyright law."
What legal liability does one's participation on Stack Exchange carry?,"I imagine that under English and Welsh law, the relevant tort would negligent misstatement, as there is no contract between the parties. From Practical Law: A claim for negligent misstatement may arise whether or not a contractual relationship exists between the parties. However, if there is a contractual relationship, it is more likely that a claim would be brought for negligent misrepresentation. Whether or not a claim for negligent misstatement would succeed would depend on several factors. Firstly, a duty of care must exist between the parties. From the Oxford Dictionary of Law: A negligent misstatement is only actionable in tort if there has been breach of a duty to take care in making the statement that has caused damage to the claimant. There is no general duty of care in making statements, particularly in relation to statements on financial matters. Responsibility for negligent misstatements is imposed only if they were made in circumstances that made it reasonable to rely on them (Hedley Byrne v Heller & Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465 (HL); Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605 (HL). Whether or not it was reasonable to rely on the advice is hard to say, as it depends on a number of different factors. In the light of the fact that most cases of negligent misstatement involve professionals acting in their professional capacity, it seems unlikely that a court would find it reasonable to rely on advice taken from an internet site. Most relevant for this question, however, is the case of Gary Patchett and Karen Patchett v Swimming Pool & Allied Trades Association Ltd  [2009] EWCA Civ 717. This is possibly the legal precedent you are looking for. Practical Law again: The Court of Appeal held by a majority that, although the website made representations that it knew users would be likely to rely on, there was not sufficient proximity between the parties, and the website advised users to obtain an information pack before engaging a contractor. Accordingly, the appellants had failed to establish the duty of care that is a required element of a claim for negligent misstatement. If a website owner does not owe a duty of care to its users, then it seems highly unlikely that one user would be found to owe a duty of care to another user.  On that basis - and with the large disclaimer that I am not a lawyer - it would seem that were one to rely on the advice given on a StackExchange site, there would be few, if any, legal repercussions for the person who gave the advice. The conclusion is to get professional advice from a professional, rather than any StackExchange site - including this one!"
Why are common people selected for jury duty?,"That is, every person is entitled to have their guilt or innocence decided by people ""like them"" - not kings, lords or, heaven forbid, lawyers. In fact, if you were a peer (a Member of the House of Lords), you had the right until well into the 20th century to be literally tried by your peers - that is, by the House of Lords itself; however, this was more of a burden than a privilege as such a trial had fewer protections for the accused. The jury doesn't need to know the law and indeed, in many jurisdictions, lawyers are explicitly disqualified from jury service (hint: if you want to avoid jury service, get a law degree). The role of the jury is to decide the facts - what happened and whether that meets the prosecution's burden of proof. The jury is told what the law is by the judge - that's their job. Most law shows on TV skip over the very important role of the judge's instructions to the jury. These usually go along the lines of (greatly abridged and paraphrased) ""If you decide that X, Y & Z are true then you must return a guilty verdict but if any of them are not true you must return not guilty."" A very brief potted history of the jury system is contained in this answer: Why 12 Jurors, why not 11, 10, 9, 1? Now, this is, according to those from common law traditions, the great truth and beauty of the jury system. To those from civil, sharia and other legal traditions: it's just stupid."

Why would someone get a fine when using a disabled parking space when the disabled person is not in the car?,"There isn't any indication in that news story that the disabled son was anywhere nearby. I agree the situation you describe sounds like a legitimate use of the placard, but it seems in this situation, the placard was being used in a manner totally unrelated to the transport of a disabled person. My guess is that the cops cited her because the son wasn't in the car, and was not inside the establishment at which she parked. California code has this to say: A person to whom a disabled person placard has been issued may permit
  another person to use the placard only while in the presence or
  reasonable proximity of the disabled person for the purpose of
  transporting the disabled person. So as long as the disabled person is within a ""reasonable proximity"", and the placard is being used to transport them, they do not have to be inside the car to make using the placard legitimate. In this case, the woman was just transporting herself and using the placard anyway, which is illegal."
Can women also go shirtless in public legally?,"Specifically regarding the question ""let's say this goes to the Supreme Court"". In Minor v. Happersett, which admittedly was back in 1875, the Supreme Court ruled that 14th Amendment ""Equal protection"" clause did not entitle women to vote. The question of whether it entitled them to go topless wasn't under consideration, but I think we can safely suppose they'd take a dim view. The opinion of the court included: Neither the Constitution nor the Fourteenth Amendment made all citizens voters. A provision in a state constitution which confines the right of voting to 'male citizens of the United States' is no violation of the federal Constitution. ...
  the Constitution has not added the right of suffrage to the privileges and immunities of citizenship as they existed at the time it was adopted. This makes it proper to inquire whether suffrage was coextensive with the citizenship of the states at the time of its adoption. If it was, then it may with force be argued that suffrage was one of the rights which belonged to citizenship, and in the enjoyment of which every citizen must be protected. ...
  But if it was not, the contrary may with propriety be assumed Fairly obviously, it was not. The case wouldn't have needed to be brought if it was, so one might conclude that the court ruled ""sex discrimination is OK in law because sex discrimination already exists in law"". They also observed that the 15th Amendment is redundant if voting is a ""privilege or immunity"" already covered by the 14th. So, back then voting was not an inherent right of citizenship (later supreme courts apparently have backed off from this position). One can plausibly imagine a court ruling that walking around topless isn't either. They also explicitly said that they took the 14th Amendment as intended only to concern the rights of former slaves, not to change any other unequal rights that might already exist (I don't know exactly what the status is here. Numerous cases have applied the 14th Amendment to various forms of discrimination other than against ex-slaves. Certainly it has been politically argued that a fresh Amendment stipulating equal rights for women would be redundant, but I don't know the positions of the current Justices on that). The 19th Amendment (1920) gave women equal rights to the vote, but did not restrict any other privileges and immunities from being abridged on the basis of sex. So it overrides the outcome of Minor v. Happersett, but not their view of the 14th Amendment. Move on. A more recent court (under Brennan, in the 1970s) further developed the idea for different standards applying to different kinds of discrimination: laws that discriminate on account of 
  race, national origin, and alienage 
  are 
  subject to strict scrutiny,
  laws that discriminate on account of 
  gender and 
  “
  illegitimacy
  ”
  are 
  subject to intermediate scrutiny,
  and 
  the vast bulk of 
  social and 
  economic legislation, as well as 
  laws that discriminate 
  on account of 
  age and disability,
  are 
  subject to 
  rational basis review https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Crossroads-Chapter-8.pdf ""Rational basis review"" means that the law can discriminate as long as it finds some arguable public benefit from doing so. As usual this means an argument and a benefit that a court accepts, not an argument that you or I accept. In particular, the court doesn't necessarily have to agree about the details of the supposed benefit, they merely have to agree that the legislature has standing to decide that it's a benefit. Of course this is all ancient history, and the current court would take into account current attitudes and common practice, as well as the fact that these days people in general and Supreme Court Justices in particular have different ideas about the nature of inherent differences between men and women, as well as perhaps different ideas about whether existing laws are so important as the definitive source of ""rights"" on a given subject. So for example Obergefell v. Hodges prevented the prohibition of gay marriage on grounds of equal protection, which I think we can safely conclude that no Supreme Court other than the very recent would have done. The opinion laid out further significant development in the court's understanding of equal rights. Scalia is history too, but recent history, and he wrote: Certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex. The only 
  issue is whether 
  it prohibits it. It doesn't. Nobody ever thought that that's what it meant. Nobody ever voted for that. If 
  the current society wants to outlaw discrimination by sex, hey we have things called legislatures, and 
  they enact things called laws The Originalist, California Lawyer (January 2011) Unsurprisingly, he also dissented from Obergefell v. Hodges. Scalia's originalist position essentially was that if the Congress that passed the 14th Amendment was sexist (or homophobic, or whatever), then the constitition is sexist (or homophobic, or whatever). End of. If you don't like it, pass a law to change it. In contrast to all this, Bader Ginsburg has taken a different view of the 14th: What 
  [the framers of the 14th Amendment]
  were getting at, basically, and you will find this popping up 
  again and again in the legislative record, they were against caste. They did not want the United States to 
  have any classes 
  or castes that would identify people by their birth status Nicole Flatow, 
Justice Ginsburg’s Take on Originalism
(Nov. 22, 2011) She, in common with other liberal Justices, thinks that an ""exceedingly persuasive justification"" is needed for laws discriminating on the basis of sex, but note that doesn't mean even she categorically rules out that such a justification might be made in some cases. IIRC there are stacks of 5-4 and 6-3 decisions that Bader Ginsburg joined and Scalia dissented from, where the majority of the court more-or-less believes that changes in public opinion what constitutes ""equal"" or ""reasonable"" on a subject can change the effect of the constitution. So, for cases like yours, they might think it doesn't matter whether the framers of the 14th were sexist; what's relevant is whether the current court is sexist. Opponents of those rulings call this ""legislating from the bench"". So you cannot have absolute confidence that the court will rule that in every situation it is unconstitutional for the law to treat men and women differently. We can hope they will, and offer arguments why they should, but the institution's past record doesn't justify assuming they necessarily will. A lot depends on Kavanaugh, who replaces Kennedy. Obergefell v. Hodges was 5-4: Kennedy voted for it; Kavanaugh is expected to be considerably more conservative but that doesn't necessarly mean he's as originalist as Scalia was."
"What if I say ""this statement is false"" while under oath?","See 18 U.S.C. s. 1621 (a). Perjury only relates to material matter. In my opinion, your little logical paradox isn't material.

Why and when would an attorney be handcuffed to their client?,"My impression, and the plausible explanation in the absence of the actual facts, is that this was something that the attorney agreed to, in order to allow a skittish client to reveal information pursuant to a favorable plea agreement. The police probably insisted that the client be handcuffed to someone while doing this to prevent the client from fleeing. The attorney probably offered to do the job instead of a police officer, to be able to provide advice to his client and keep his client calm enough to do it, which might not have happened (sacrificing the favorable plea deal that the attorney negotiated) if someone else were in that role."
"Could a British monarch ""go full dictator"" if they wish to do so?","Parliamentary Supremacy was established by the Glorious Revolution of 1688  in which James II & VII was deposed by Parliament, and the line of succession was changed by Act of Parliament to favor William and Mary. Key laws passed during the aftermath of the Revolution included the Declaration of Right (which forbade keeping a standing army without Parliamentary consent, and put control of the military in Parliament), and the Coronation Oath Act 1688 which established in law obligations of the monarch. Since 1688 it has remained the governing principle of English (later British and UK) law that ultimate authority lies in Parliament, not with the monarch, and that Parliament can at any time depose a monarch  for failing to act properly, and can settle the line of succession to the crown. A British King or Queen who tried to exercise dictatorial power, or even to use remaining Royal Prerogative powers to assume personal rule, could and quite likely would be deposed."

"USA: Is ""I am not a lawyer"" disclaimer generally necessary?","What you are talking about here is the tort of negligent misstatement, a subset of the tort of negligence. First, there is no presumption in any jurisdiction that I am aware of that anyone is or is not a lawyer (or doctor, or engineer etc.). If people knew that you were, however, then it is reasonable that they would give your statements more weight then if they did not know. It may also be reasonable if they suspected you were. The practical purpose of such a disclaimer is to ensure that they know you aren't. For the specific facts you give, you would certainly be in a better position if you said: ""But I'm not a lawyer, so you should seek professional advice""; not so much because you told them you weren't a lawyer but rather because this changes your advice to ""seek professional advice"". It's impossible to be wrong with that advice! The standard form in Australia is: ""this advice is general in nature and not to be taken as personal professional advice"". If the statement is limited to ""I'm not a lawyer"" or if your neighbour knew you were, for instance, a dog catcher with no professional qualifications, then you could still potentially be liable. Your neighbour would need to demonstrate: The main point of the disclaimers is on the 2nd point: what is ""unreasonable"" for a professional is different than for a ""lay person"". Oh, and by the way: this advice is general in nature and not to be taken as personal professional advice."
Can someone's legal name be all lowercase?,"Or maybe capitalization is not even part of the name That's pretty much it.  No court would fail to recognize the name ""John Doe"" in the string ""JOHN DOE""; similarly, if someone established or claimed to establish their legal name as ""john doe"" then the only violations committed by someone writing it as ""John Doe"" or ""JOHN DOE"" would be violations of style, perhaps, or of etiquette. Now, just in case this is related to the crackpot conspiracy theorists from the ""sovereign citizen"" or ""freeman on the land"" movements, a few words are in order.  If you don't already know about this, you might find it interesting.  In general, this is a school of thought that attempts to establish the illegitimacy of government authority by employing a number of illogical and willful misinterpretations of (often obsolete, foreign, or otherwise irrelevant) legal texts.  Among these is the idea that the capitalization of a name is significant. From Wikipedia's article on the sovereign citizen movement: In a criminal case in 2013, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington noted: Defendant [Kenneth Wayne Leaming] is apparently a member of a group loosely styled ""sovereign citizens"". The Court has deduced this from a number of Defendant's peculiar habits. First, like Mr. Leaming, sovereign citizens are fascinated by capitalization. They appear to believe that capitalizing names have some sort of legal effect. For example, Defendant writes that ""the REGISTERED FACTS appearing in the above Paragraph evidence the uncontroverted and uncontrovertible FACTS that the SLAVERY SYSTEMS operated in the names UNITED STATES, United States, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and United States of America ... are terminated nunc pro tunc by public policy, U.C.C. 1-103 ..."" (Def.'s Mandatory Jud. Not. at 2.) He appears to believe that by capitalizing ""United States"", he is referring to a different entity than the federal government. For better or for worse, it's the same country. From its article on strawman theory: One argument used by proponents of the strawman theory is based on a misinterpretation of the term capitis deminutio, used in ancient Roman law for the extinguishment of a person's former legal capacity. Adherents to the theory spell the term ""Capitis Diminutio"", and claim that capitis diminutio maxima (meaning, in Roman law, the loss of liberty, citizenship, and family) was represented by an individual's name being written in capital letters, hence the idea of individuals having a separate legal personality. Proponents of the theory believe the evidence is found on the birth certificate itself. Because many certificates show all capitals to spell out a baby's name, JOHN DOE (under the Strawman theory) is the name of the ""straw man"", and John Doe is the baby's ""real"" name. As the child grows, most legal documents will contain capital letters, which means that his state-issued driver's license, his marriage license, his car registration, his criminal court records, his cable TV bill, correspondence from the IRS, etc., pertain to his strawman and not his sovereign identity. (Note that there was no distinction between majuscule and minuscule letters in the Latin alphabet in ancient Roman times; this distinction arose in the 8th century, a few hundred years after the fall of the western empire.) And finally, from  Meads v. Meads, 2012 ABQB 571 (CanLII): [323] Given the obsessive focus of the OPCA movement for documentary and procedural formalities (real or imagined), it is unsurprising that they have developed a wealth of arbitrary name-related rules.

What crime is hiring someone to kill you and then killing the hitman?,"It appears you want to go for a defense strategy based on a self-defense argument. This won't work in many jurisdictions, because self-defense usually doesn't apply when you intentionally caused a situation where you knew you would have to harm someone in self-defense. Similar case: Bob regularly mugs old women in the park by threatening them with a gun. Charlie finds out and wants to stop him. But instead of reporting it to the police, he wants to take care of this himself. Charlie get a gun, dresses up as an old woman and waits in the park. When Bob shows up and tries to mug Charlie, Charlie shoots first. Well, anyone else who would have found themselves in a park threatened by Bob with a deadly weapon might have had a self-defense argument. But Charlie knew that by dressing up as an old woman, he would provoke Bob to attempt to mug him. This of course doesn't exonerate Bob. But Charlie actively caused the situation which would give him the opportunity to kill Bob ""in self defense"". Charlie even made a complex plan to arrange this situation and put serious effort into setting it in motion. It's premeditated murder. Your situation is basically the same. You caused someone to make an attempt at your life, and then killed them to ""defend yourself"". And you had plenty of other options: Further, when you hired the hitman you committed a crime: incitement to commit murder. The fact that you were also the victim of that crime doesn't really matter. It also doesn't matter that you wanted to die: Assisted suicide is only permitted in very few jurisdictions, and those only allow it if performed by medical professionals under very narrow circumstances. Those circumstances would certainly not have applied, so the hitman would have been guilty of murder if he had succeeded (he is at least guilty of attempted murder, but you can't put a dead person on trial), so you would too. When you commit a crime and cause someone to die in the process, then that falls under the felony murder rule in many jurisdictions. You will likely be convicted of manslaughter or murder of the hitman, depending on when you decided to kill the hitman before they kill you. When you can convince the court that you did not premeditate to kill the hitman but only panicked in the last minute, and no felony murder rule applies, then you might get away with manslaughter. You might also be found guilty of incitement of attempted murder (your own murder)."

Is the banning of large events in the USA constitutional?,"How is banning such events constitutional with the freedom of

They are subject to reasonable restrictions as to time, place and manner, especially if those restrictions are content neutral.  Restrictions narrowly tailored to protect against genuine threats public health and safety fall within the exception of the First Amendment even if they are not strictly content neutral, that is commonly described by the rubric that you don't have a right to falsely cry ""fire"" in a crowded theater (causing a riot that could harm people).  For example, suppose that a rope bridge over a deep gorge can only support the weight of ten people, and three dozen people want to hold a protest there. A regulation that prohibited more than ten people from engaging in the protest would be constitutional. Even then, however, a lack of content neutrality (e.g., restricting punishment to false statements likely to incite a riot) can't also be a lack of ideological neutrality (e.g. restricting punishment to anti-Catholic but not anti-Jewish statements likely to incite a riot). If it were a political protest/gathering would this change? Generally speaking political protest/gatherings are still subject to content neutral regulations of time, place or manner, and those narrowly tailored to protect genuine threats public health and safety. So, for example, if there is a genuine COVID-19 risk that public health officials are trying to address, and the regulation of gatherings is not viewpoint or content based, it would be upheld as constitutional in the face of a First Amendment freedom of assembly limitation. But, if the regulation applied, for example, only to Republican and not Democratic party protests or gatherings, which is a viewpoint or content based restriction, it would not survive a First Amendment freedom of assembly challenge.

"Is there a legal reason that organizations often refuse to comment on an issue citing ""ongoing litigation""?","united-states But what is that legal reason? Why would an organization not be able
to state their position with respect to the issue, such as ""We believe
we acted correctly, but this will be decided in court""? Is there a law saying that commenting a court case is illegal? Who
does this apply to? Or is this just some guideline or established
advice to avoid problems (which ones)? Legal Ethics Considerations There are circumstances when commenting publicly on litigation violates the ethical rules for lawyers related to trial publicity See Rule of Professional Conduct 3.6 (the numbering system for professional conduct rules for lawyers is uniform nationally in the U.S. although the substance of the rules can differ in detail from state to state - Colorado's rule is fairly typical). Mostly this rule calls for avoiding statements that could prejudice a jury unless the other side has already done so and those statements need to be rebutted. This rule states (in its Colorado version): (a) A lawyer who is participating or has participated in the
investigation or litigation of a matter shall not make an
extrajudicial statement that the lawyer knows or reasonably should
know will be disseminated by means of public communication and will
have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an
adjudicative proceeding in the matter. (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) and Rule 3.8(f), a lawyer may state: (1) the claim, offense or defense involved and, except when prohibited
by law, the identity of the persons involved; (2) information contained in a public record; (3) that an investigation of a matter is in progress; (4) the scheduling or result of any step in litigation; (5) a request for assistance in obtaining evidence and information
necessary thereto; (6) a warning of danger concerning the behavior of a person involved,
when there is reason to believe that there exists the likelihood of
substantial harm to an individual or to the public interest; and (7) in a criminal case, in addition to subparagraphs (1) through (6):
(i) the identity, residence, occupation and family status of the
accused; (ii) if the accused has not been apprehended, information
necessary to aid in apprehension of that person;(iii) the fact, time
and place of arrest; and (iv) the identity of investigating and
arresting officers or agencies and the length of the investigation. (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) and Rule 3.8(f), a lawyer may make a
statement that a reasonable lawyer would believe is required to
protect a client from the substantial undue prejudicial effect of
recent publicity not initiated by the lawyer or the lawyer's client. A
statement made pursuant to this paragraph shall be limited to such
information as is necessary to mitigate the recent adverse publicity. (d) No lawyer associated in a firm or government agency with a lawyer
subject to paragraph (a) shall make a statement prohibited by
paragraph (a). Statements such as ""We believe we acted correctly, but this will be decided in court"" are allowed and are not terribly uncommon. But, making a comment about something that can be easily inferred from the publicly available documents filed in court provides little or no positive advantage for a litigant. Also, one doesn't have to say much to create at least a colorable Rule of Professional Conduct 3.6 issue that a mediator can raise in settlement talks, or that a judge can be forced to analyze. Even if the claim of unethical trial publicity ultimately doesn't hold water, it still muddies the waters and distracts lawyers and litigants from dealing with the substance of the dispute. The Risk That A Statement Will Be Used Against You Usually, the main concern is similar to the concern about talking to police: Anything you say can and will be used against you at trial. For example, this week former President Trump's public statement about his knowledge of classified documents, which are the subject of an ongoing federal criminal investigation of him, seriously harmed his position legally. (His statement was made quite a while ago in a semi-private forum, but at a time when the possibility of a criminal investigation still should have been on his radar screen.) In the civil rape-defamation case against him (as noted, for example, in this Law.SE answer), Trump's decision to continue to speak publicly about matters that were the subject of active litigation against him in an earlier case resulted in an extended statute of limitations and an opportunity to refile the case without having to worry about Presidential immunity from liability for statements he made while in office. It isn't just former President Trump that does things like this, but his conduct provides good textbook examples of what lawyers worry about when their clients talk about cases that are being litigated. Social media statements about pending cases by litigants routinely provide powerful evidence against them in trials. Some clients (particularly politicians and many senior executives of big and medium sized businesses, but also more ordinary people with big egos) are ""forces of nature"" who can't resist running their mouths, usually to their detriment, when given the least leave to do so. It is easier to teach them to say ""no comment"" across the board about pending litigation, than to transmit the depth of understanding necessary to comment without saying something potentially harmful. Lawyers spend many hours and sometimes days preparing their clients for depositions for a reason. Avoiding Annoyance To Opposing Counsel, Parties, And Judges Making a comment about pending litigation has the potential to aggravate opposing counsel and can emotionally influence non-lawyer opposing parties with whom a negotiated settlement will be reached 90%+ of the time (only about 1-2% of civil cases go to trial, but some are resolved by default judgments or on motion practice as opposed to by settlement). It can also irritate a judge who frequently prefers to be out of the public spotlight when necessary, even when the statements made aren't prohibited, and judges in the U.S. have lots of discretionary authority."
"Stop, in the name of the law","In long ago English practice, the phrase used was ""Stop in the name of the King"". At one time this was, if I am not mistaken, required for a valid arrest. I am talking about a time hundreds of years ago, by the way. That phrase, in turn, goes back to a still older concept. At one time, in Germanic customary law, each important leader had a ""peace"" -- an area in and around his dwelling, domain, and presence -- in which any violation of law and custom was an offense against the leader, not just against a victim. Inside his ""peace"" a leader was allowed to enforce rules without any complaint from a victim. Later the peace of all lesser leaders was subsumed in the Kings Peace, which came to cover the entire kingdom, the area of the king's authority and rule. This concept came over with the Normans, although a version of it had come over with the Anglo-Saxons centuries before. That is why indictments in England (later England and Wales) long included such language as ""... That on or about {date} the said {accused} did, against the peace of our Lord the King, his crown and dignity, commit {offense} by {details}..."" I will need to do some searching to find the exact citations to support this, although Charles Rembar's The Law of the Land includes the part about the king's peace. Specifically, in a footnote on page 192 of my (trade paper) edition (and at location 3345 0f my kindel edition) Rembar writes: The concept of a “peace” that is a ruler’s right goes back to Germanic law. It belonged not only to a king but to each leader in the social structure. Every ruler, naturally enough, wanted order in his group, as do modern governments. The difference is that freedom from disturbance was considered the chieftain’s personal privilege, and disorder among those he led was a personal affront. With the strengthening of central rule, the king’s peace overrode all others. I will need to search further to learn just when the phrase ""in the name of the law"" became common, and when either phrase ceased to be legally required.  I believe that the phrase persisted in common use long after it was no longer legally required, but I will need citations for that also. I will update this answer with all of that when I can."
Can you make the police department pay for damage done to your property if you get swatted?,"There is a police power exception to the 5th and 14th Amendment rights to not taking property without due process of law and just compensation. In a similar case arising in Greenwood Village, Colorado, an innocent homeowner was denied any relief at trial in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, or on appeal to the 10th Circuit, after his house was trashed by SWAT teams trying to catch a guy accused of mere theft and fleeing police officers. (The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case sometime after the linked article was written.) But, there does appear to be a circuit split on the issue. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in a case appealed from a U.S. District Court decision in Texas reached a contrary conclusion in a case between Vicki Baker and the City of McKinney, Texas decided earlier this month in March of 2023 in which it affirmed a U.S. District Court ruling in favor of the homewoner. The fact that there is now a circuit split on the issue increases the likelihood that the U.S. Supreme Court would consider a Petition for Certiorari from the 5th Circuit decision in the Texas case, although it is far from a sure thing as only about 1% of Petitions for Certiorari presented to the U.S. Supreme Court (about 80 out of 7,000 to 8,000 per year) are granted. The key issue distinguishing these two rulings is the question of whether the police power exception to the eminent domain obligation of a government applies to cases in which the person whose property is taken is innocent of any wrongdoing and any legally relevant connection to a wrongdoer. Both circuits would agree that a government does not have eminent domain liability under the constitution if, for example, the property destroyed belongs to someone who committed a crime and has their house destroyed in the process of trying to arrest the criminal. Also, neither of the decisions disputes that police may, under the police power exception, destroy property in connection with efforts to apprehend a criminal or to prevent a crime, without seeking court approval in the usual situation where there are exigent circumstances that can't wait for the slow process of conducting a court hearing on the question. The question, instead, is whether an innocent property owner has a right to bring an ""inverse condemnation"" lawsuit to remedy the damage that the innocent property owner has experienced."
"What if a restaurant suddenly cannot accept credit cards, and the customer has no cash?","There is no intention to commit theft, so there is no criminal act on the part of the customer. Even if there was a criminal act, the ability of the restaurant to detain the cusomer (citizen's arrest) is very limited in most jurisdictions.  The restaurant can ask the customer for his name and address, but there is no legal obligation on the customer to provide this. Refusal to do so, however, might be evidence of intention to avoid paying and at that point the restaurant might call the police. The customer can leave, and the restaurant can pursue the debt through the civil courts if they have means to do so - they may have CCTV of the customer and his car registration which can be traced.  Petrol stations, where people often fill up and then realise they can't pay, usually have established ""promise to pay"" procedures where they take the customer's details and the customer has 48 hours to pay before police or civil enforcement action is taken. "
How to protect assets from being passed to a beneficiary in a will when they are likely to die soon also,"Wills typically handle this by specifying a survivorship period.  Such a clause may say, in effect, ""I leave all my assets to my spouse, provided they survive me by at least 30 days, and otherwise to beneficiaries X,Y,Z.""  That way, if your spouse dies shortly after you, your assets go to X,Y,Z, rather than going to your spouse and then to their beneficiaries. Another issue this avoids: suppose you are in an accident together, and by the time rescuers arrive, you are both dead.  Without a survivorship period requirement, courts might have to try to determine whether one of you survived a few seconds longer than the other, in order to decide whose beneficiaries get the assets.  That could be difficult and error-prone, not to mention gruesome and upsetting to loved ones. But with such a requirement, it's not necessary. The linked article notes that in many jurisdictions, if you don't specify a survivorship period, there may be a statutory period that applies automatically."
Is it illegal to take pictures of the police in public in Germany?,"It is not an offense to photograph people, especially if they are just caught at the edge or out of the center of the photography. However you do not have a right to photograph people either. In fact, under German law, you have to gain the consent of people that are the centerpiece of a photo for publication, or make the photo for a number of enumerated reasons. Among such is news reporting or documenting an ongoing crime - such material is made in the public interest. If you make a photo without consent or qualified reason, possession of the photo in general is no problem but you have no right to publish the photo. To prevent such publication, the photographed person may demand deletion or destruction of the photo - however, following the demand is not explicitly required. Such a demand however is equivalent to an explicit demand to not publish the picture. As such, it gets really tricky for the photographer. Publication without a release (or a no-release statement) or one of the few excusing reasons is a punishable offense, which can land you in prison for up to one year. This stems from Art. 2 GG, §22, §23 and §33 Kunsturhebergesetz. Hindering rescue services with your camera and creating photos of injured and vulnerable people is illegal under the same reasoning. Getting into the way of the police can constitute obstruction of emergency helpers atop of that. More on that specific part of German law can be learned in this question. Do note that such photography can also be a crime under §201a StGB, especially if your photography shows someone as vulnerable. Another possibility for the approaching police might have been, that the policeman was interested to find out if you might have photographed or filmed the incident that led to the arrest. In that case, he might have requested a copy for evidentiary reasons."
How to store refusal of cookie consent,"The so-called 'cookie law' obliges you to inform the user about the site's cookies (or use of Storage or such on the user's computer) and ask for consent for those that are not ""strictly necessary for the provision of an information society service requested by the subscriber or user"".  It does not require you to seek consent for the use of any cookie no matter what function it has. ""Strictly necessary"" cookies include those necessary for the website to comply with the law.  Per guidance from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in the UK (see the example box), a cookie set in relation to such consent or refusal is fine - it's for compliance with the cookie law. I would expect similar guides throughout the EU. You must consider its duration or lifespan: ""For example, whilst it may be technically possible to set the duration of a cookie to “31/12/9999” this would not be regarded as proportionate in any circumstances."" And consider including information about it in your cookie policy or such that users can find out more if they want."
Legality of creating a SE replica using SE's content,"Stack Exchange have already covered this in a couple of places, from MSE's A site (or scraper) is copying content from Stack Exchange.

Furthermore, the links must not be nofollowed"
Could double jeopardy protect a murderer who bribed the judge and jury to be declared not guilty?,"There is precedent for the idea that double jeopardy need not apply when the initial trial was a sham because the judge and/or jury had been bribed. See Aleman v. Judges of Cook County Circuit Court, 138 F.3d 302 (7th Cir. 1998).  This case was very similar to your hypothetical: Aleman was initially acquitted of a murder, but years later it came to light that he had bribed the judge (in a bench trial).  He was retried and convicted in state court.  He appealed his conviction on the grounds of double jeopardy, but the Seventh Circuit denied his appeal, accepting Illinois' argument that because of the bribe, Aleman was never ""in jeopardy of life or limb"" in the first place."
Pregnant spouse slipped abortion pills unknowingly. What would the legal ramifications be?,"Although abortion is legal in the US, not everyone is allowed to perform an abortion.
In Washington, the law allows a physician to terminate a pregnancy, and recognizes a woman's right to choose to have an abortion. An abortion performed by anyone else is not legal, and performing an illegal abortion is a class C felony. There are ""plan B"" pills which are legal in the US and levonorgestrel is available without a prescription, but the 
mifepristone and misoprostol regime is not available without a doctor's orders. In this scenario, the partner will have performed an illegal abortion, and is guilty of a controlled substances crime. In some states, there is a separate crime of fetal homicide. In Washington, this is covered under 1st degree manslaughter, a class A felony, if one ""intentionally and unlawfully kills an unborn quick child by inflicting any injury upon the mother of such child"". ""Any injury"" does not require ""great violence"" or ""striking"".
It is also the class B felony of poisoning which includes slipping in a harmful substance with intent to harm another person, as well as assault."
Do the UK TV licensing rules disregard innocent until proven guilty?,"If you watch or record live television or you download or watch programmes on BBC iPlayer (live, catch up, or on demand), you must have a TV licence. You do not have to let TV Licensing officers into your home unless they have a warrant, per Section 366 of the Communications Act 2003. They will check the TV and any other devices (such as a laptop, phone, etc.) that are capable of watching or recording live television as well as downloading or watching programmes on BBC iPlayer, and that will form part of the evidence in deciding whether to charge you with a criminal offence (Section 363 of the Act) or not. If charged with an offence, you would go before a magistrate court and plead your case like any other criminal matter. Therefore, the system still operates on ""innocent until proven guilty"" because you will not acquire a criminal record unless the court is satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that you committed the relevant offence."
Is it legal for a train company to create an art gallery using photographs of the graffiti on their locomotives and train cars?,"Copyright law doesn't say the art isn't copyrighted if it was made unlawfully. It seems the art can be copyrighted and the act of making it can be a criminal offence. I'm not aware of any such copyright cases that have gone to trial. A fairly well known case that settled out of court is that of Jason “Revok” Williams and H&M. Williams noticed his art in a photograph used in an H&M marketing campaign. His lawyer sent a cease-and-desist letter to H&M. In response, H&M applied for a court order stating that the product of an unlawful act could not be copyrighted. Following some bad publicity H&M relented and settled with Williams. H&M stopped using the photograph and withdrew the application for the court order. (News source) ... The debate over street artists’ copyright privileges has entered courtrooms quite a bit over the past few years, according to Philippa Loengard, deputy director of Columbia Law School’s Kernochan Center for Law, Media and the Arts. ... The [H&M] claim wasn’t surprising, Loengard said, but it also doesn’t hold up. At its core, a copyright requires only two things: that the work is original and that it is a tangible medium of expression. [Loengard said,] “ … Copyright is not a legal or illegal sanction of the activity that was done to produce the work. Copyright is a separate entity.” Another case settled out of court is that of Joseph ""Rime"" Tierney and Moschino. Tierney sued Moschino for using his art on its designs. One day before the court was notified of the intention to settle, Moschino sought to have the case dismissed on the grounds that unlawfully made art could not be copyrighted. (News source) ""As a matter of public policy and basic logic, it would make no sense to grant legal protection to work that is created entirely illegally."""
Why do statutes of limitations exist?,"Slightly going offside here Other answers mention the need/usefulness of statutes of limitation presenting cases of being accused twenty or 25 years later However, I should note that you don't need going back that far to show how it can be a problem. Just imagine that a police office knocks your door right now and hands you a citation because you got identified as the author of a robbery that happened two months ago in a nearby city. You probably would be sure not to have performed that, but you would likely struggle to prove that. If you are lucky, it would have been at a time where you were working at your office or the gym, and not only would you know that at that time you would have been there, but there would also be records -and hopefuly footage- showing you there, as well as coworkers able to testify that (or, more likely, that they don't remember you not being there). Otherwise, you would be having a hard time. Maybe you stayed at home? Could you get a witness that you didn't leave it? Even for other people that live there with you, perhaps you did unattended a short trip to the supermarket in which you would have had time to do the robbery? Or maybe you went to a shop, or just walking, where a security camera would identify you not being away. However, could you remember the path you followed and thus the recordings that need to be verified? And that's just in a couple of months. Obviously if you knew in advance you would need it, you would remember every step, actually, you would have made sure to have an alibi. But if this day was no special for you, you had no reason to remember its details. A real probatio diabolica. It is obvious why the burden of the proof must lie on the accusation. And even if finally everything resolves happily, a misguiding identification could result in a long and slow process to get out of. Obviously, the longer a lawsuit can be filed against you, the longer you would have to preserve any relevant evidence if you are serious. For instance, until Check 21 was passed in 2004, US banks needed storing the received physical checks many years, as there could be a claim about them. About 70 billion cheques were written annually in the US by 2001, according to Wikipedia citation of The Future of Money. You can imagine the giant warehouses they needed just to store used checks. All those requirements mean costs, and thus money. If there is a statue of limitations on a claim for a forged check, the bank would only have needed to store checks for that amount of time (nowadays, they store it electronically, but although a big improvement, still amounts to enormous disk space space requisites)."
"If someone catches a Pokemon that is on my property, is that theft?","In this answer, I address title question: ""If someone catches a Pokemon that is on my property, is that theft?""1 The Pokémon is an entry in a database, presented by Nintendo to users in their mobile app and can be included in a user's collections after that user completes some in-game actions. It isn't your property. It isn't even their (the users') property. Further, a Pokémon appears for all users can be captured again and again by multiple users until it disappears for all users. One user capturing a Pokémon doesn't make it unavailable for others. The Pokémon doesn't ""become subject to"" any property rights of the owner of the real property that it happens to be virtually overlaid on. Said another way, it doesn't ""incur"" any of their property rights. Capturing it in-game is not theft. 1. The question in the question body is ""does [a Pokémon] incur any kind of property right for the property owner"". Incur means ""to become subject to"". That is different than the broader verb ""implicate"". This question does not ask (and this answer doesn't answer) whether the Pokémon can implicate the property owner's property rights (e.g. via attractive nuisance, trespass, etc.). Some of that is addressed at a separate question."
Why does browser cache not count as copyright infringement?,"I'm only going to consider US perspectives, which may or may not answer your question entirely. Also, I'm not going to address the guesses in other answers because, and except to say, they don't appear to be based in law, but rather (mis)understandings of law.  17 U.S. Code § 512 provides protections for service providers when providing content, online. This expressly includes caching. In Viacom Int'l, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc., 676 F.3d 19 (2d Cir. N.Y. 2012) at 39, the Court held that to exclude these functions from the safe harbor would remove protections for service providers under subsection (c). The answer, however, lies in Perfect 10 v. Google, Inc., 416 F. Supp. 2d 828 (C.D. Cal. 2006), in footnote 17, at 852: The case referred to is Field v. Google, Inc, 412 F.Supp. 2d 1106 (D. Nev. 2006). Although the Perfect 10 v. Google, Inc. was overturned on appeal - Google was permitted to utilise thumbnails in their search pages - and the above is merely obiter, it is the closest to a ruling on browser caching I have been able to find. In short: Google's caching has been found to be fair use. It is unlikely that your local cache would not, as it is generally done automatically."
Is youtube-dl takedown due to their tests which use copyrighted content?,"The takedown action is a little sketchy. The law regarding takedown notices and host liability is here. The notice includes ""Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed"", a ""signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed"", and a statement that ""the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law"". These things are present in the notice, for which reason the items were taken down. The complaint states that The clear purpose of this source code is to (i) circumvent the
technological protection measures used by authorized streaming
services such as YouTube, and (ii) reproduce and distribute music
videos and sound recordings owned by our member companies without
authorization for such use. We note that the source code is described
on GitHub as “a command-line program to download videos from
YouTube.com and a few more sites.” and the source code expressly suggests its use to copy and/or distribute
the following copyrighted works owned by our member companies: Icona Pop – I Love It (feat. Charli XCX) [Official Video], owned by
Warner Music Group Justin Timberlake – Tunnel Vision (Explicit), owned
by Sony Music Group Taylor Swift – Shake it Off, owned/exclusively
licensed by Universal Music Group Complainants are ""confused"" about actual infringement (which is prohibited by copyright law), and creating a method for infringing copyright. Under DMCA and US copyright law, copying is infringing, programming is not infringing. The complaint does not clearly allege unauthorized copying of another person's intellectual property, and their complaint is based on the theory that certain programming actions constitute copyright infringement. I don't actually think they are confused, I think they are testing the boundaries. Github has no reasonable options but to comply; the authors have the option of filing a counter-notice; then RIAA has the option of claiming that they have filed a copyright infringement lawsuit. If they do, the material remains taken down and the courts sort it out if a lawsuit is actually filed. There is minimal burden on the complainant to reign-in over-zealous takedown notice practices: Lenz v. Universal Music finds that complainants must give good faith consideration to a fair use defense. 17 USC 1201(a)(1)(A) states that No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively
controls access to a work protected under this title. Let's assume that the removed material does circumvent a technological measure protecting a work. This is a separate offense in Title 17. 17 USC 501(a) defines infringement of copyright, saying Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner
as provided by sections 106 through 122 or of the author as provided
in section 106A(a), or who imports copies or phonorecords into the
United States in violation of section 602, is an infringer of the
copyright or right of the author Production of an anti-circumvention technology is not included in those sections: on a plain reading of the law, this is not infringement. To summarize the legal dance at issue: RIAA has taken the first legal step in alleging infringement, and Github has taken the material down because Github does not get to decide what the courts would conclude. Let's assume the authors file a counter-notice stating that there is no infringement; then, equally, let's assume that RIAA states that they files a lawsuit. Github will leave the material down. Let's also assume that RIAA actually files suit. Under the prior assumption that the material violates 17 USC 1201(a)(1)(A) which seems likely, the authors could be slapped for being in violation: but they would not have been in violation of §106-122. What recourse would the authors have for RIAA's misuse of the term ""infringe"", and against whom? Nothing against Github: the service provider does not get to decide the merits of the case. Perhaps RIAA. From Lenz supra, If an entity abuses the DMCA, it may be subject to liability under §
512(f). That section provides: “Any person who knowingly materially
misrepresents under this section—(1) that material or activity is
infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled
by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for any damages․” Id.
§ 512(f). Subsection (1) generally applies to copyright holders and
subsection (2) generally applies to users. Only subsection (1) is at
issue here. The court said that We must next determine if a genuine issue of material fact exists as
to whether Universal knowingly misrepresented that it had formed a
good faith belief the video did not constitute fair use. This inquiry
lies not in whether a court would adjudge the video as a fair use, but
whether Universal formed a good faith belief that it was not. Contrary
to the district court's holding, Lenz may proceed under an actual
knowledge theory, but not under a willful blindness theory. Perhaps the authors can prove actual knowledge. The Lenz reasoning on this point (§IV C) is rather contorted."
Why do non-lawyers refer you to lawyers even when they know the answer?,"Another possible answer: The legal profession is a cartel, protected by laws.  ""Unlicensed/Unauthorized Practice of Law"" is a big enough issue that its acronym (UPL) is well known among people who discuss law.  Non-lawyers may decline to provide legal advice because they don't want to be charged with UPL. Likewise, as a matter of policy (at least in the U.S.) most government agencies and many employers in businesses that frequently receive requests for legal information instruct their employees to avoid giving anything that could be construed as legal advice.  Which policy employees might cite to avoid helping with requests for even the most basic legal information."
Is it true that it's not illegal for a parent to sell their 13-year-old child to a drug dealer?,"I don't know of any crime specifically addressing the sale of a child, but a good prosecutor rarely needs such a narrowly tailored solution to bring charges against anyone. In real life, I imagine a prosecutor who wanted to charge the mother would have relied on New York's coercion statute, which makes it a felony when a person: compels or induces a person to engage in conduct ... or compels or induces a person to join a group, organization or criminal enterprise ... by means of instilling in him or her a fear that, if the demand is not complied with, the actor or another will cause physical injury to a person. Here, the mother and the dealer have compelled the victim to engage in criminal activity and join the dealer's drug operation by threatening that the dealer ""was going to hurt her"" if he didn't cooperate in the criminal enterprise. The coercion statute had been on the books for decades (at least) at the time this episode aired."
Is it legal to break into a locked car to get a child out in hot weather?,"Oregon allows it, see ORS 30.813. One who enters a motor vehicle, by force or otherwise, to remove a child or
domestic animal left unattended in the motor vehicle is not subject to
criminal or civil liability You have to verify that the car is locked, you have to have a good faith and reasonable belief that breaking in is necessary because of imminent danger of suffering harm, you must notify the police and you must remain with the child / animal until police arrive."
"What is the purpose of a disclaimer like ""this is not legal advice""?","In most jurisdictions, practicing law without a bar license is a serious offence, which, inter alia, is the primary reason why a non-lawyer would use this disclaimer.

Is it legal for Microsoft to install software without user approval?,"However, Microsoft's access is not unauthorized (my emphasis): You agreed to this when you installed Windows 10. As a law site - we don't consider whether things that are legal are ethical."
Do the police have to kick someone out the house if the owner demands it?,"Trespass to land in most instances is a civil matter, and as such the police do not have the power to assist. Initially, the landowner should ask the trespasser to leave the land and if he/she does then all is well. If he/she refuses to leave the land then you will need to consider taking civil action. It could be dangerous for the landowner to try to remove the trespasser themselves. The owner of the land could commit several criminal offences if he forcibly removes the trespasser and his/her property from the land. The best and safest course of action is to obtain a court order, which, if breached, can then become a criminal matter. If the police do attend an incident such as this, they are merely there as observers for any possible criminal offences committed by either party. The police cannot assist in the removal of the trespassers or their property from the land in question. Emphasis mine. https://www.askthe.police.uk/content/Q56.htm"
"If someone's record has been expunged, can they legally say that they have not been arrested?","New York Criminal Procedure - Article 160.6 states, Upon the termination of a criminal action or proceeding against a person in favor of such person, as defined in subdivision two of section 160.5 of this chapter, the arrest and prosecution shall be deemed a nullity and the accused shall be restored, in contemplation of law, to the status he occupied before the arrest and prosecution. The arrest or prosecution shall not operate as a disqualification of any person so accused to pursue or engage in any lawful activity, occupation, profession, or calling. Except where specifically required or permitted by statute or upon specific authorization of a superior court, no such person shall be required to divulge information pertaining to the arrest or prosecution. From this short article you will note: This is why the employment guide posted in @jqning's answer states: Remember from this previous answer, open arrests are on the record. The New York statute linked in that article explains the process and timing for sealing an arrest record after a criminal proceeding goes in favor of the arrested person."
"Can ""Dumb Starbucks"" be legally considered Fair Use as satire or parody?","This is likely not fair use. At first blush it appeared similar to things one might see in The Onion (parody print and online newspaper) or other parody publications or shows (SNL, Key and Peele, etc.). In this case, the context would have likely been deemed transformative.  However, since they are selling coffee called ""Dumb Starbucks"" while using their trademark, they would be be found liable if sued. You can parody a trademark brand, so long as the work is transformative such that the use of the brand goes from selling coffee to making a commentary in which the brand itself is relevant.  Amendment I don't think this would pass the test as a parody/commentary. Originally, I failed to notice that they are actually selling coffee. This takes it out of fair use and they would almost certainly lose if sued.  If they never sold the coffee, but just had it open as a performance art (like I had originally read this) giving the coffee away to complete the parody, I think they'd be fine. However, they are literally using the Starbucks logo, and selling the same product. This is clearly an infringement of their copyright and not fair use. Sorry for the confusion."
Can I get reimbursed if police shot the window of my car during a standoff?,"There is no legal obligation of the police or any of its officers to reimburse you. It comes within a police powers exception to the 5th Amendment obligation to provide compensation for takings. Sometimes a government will compensate someone even though it has no legal obligation to do so, but this is unlikely to happen. A petition for certiorari from 10th Circuit decision of Lech v. City of Greenwood Village (10th Cir.  October 29, 2019) recaps a lot of the relevant law and arguments for changing it (the petition was subsequently denied by the U.S. Supreme Court). The question presented in the petition was: Using explosives and a battering ram attached to an armored personnel
carrier, the Greenwood Village Police Department intentionally
destroyed Petitioners’ house. Afterwards, they offered the family
$5,000 “to help with temporary living expenses.” The family sued,
arguing that they were entitled to Just Compensation under the Fifth
Amendment for the intentional destruction of their house. The Tenth
Circuit, however, held that no compensation was due because the home
was destroyed pursuant to the police power rather than the power of
eminent domain. The question presented is whether there is a categorical exception to
the Just Compensation Clause when the government takes property while
acting pursuant to its police power. (To be clear, Texas is in the 5th Circuit and not the 10th Circuit, but there is not a circuit split on this particular issue between any U.S. Court of Appeals Circuits, and the Texas Supreme Court has not taken a contrary position.) Needless to say, that fact pattern was even worse for the innocent citizen, because law enforcement had more discretion and time to make a conscious decision about how to respond to the ""bad guy"" (an armed man wanted for shoplifting and resisting arrest) in the house to which the suspect had no connection. You could sue the ""bad guys"" who were involved in the shootout (if known) for causing an incident that foreseeably damaged your car, or you could make a first party insurance claim with your own car insurance."
What happens to a country’s debt if the country ends?,"If the country was defeated in war, the bondholders often lose all their money.  Sometimes, though, the conqueror has its own reasons to want the debt to be repaid.  If the country came to an end through peaceful negotiation, the same negotiation would decide who becomes responsible for its debts. So, at the end of the U.S. Civil War, the United States declared that no one who had lent the Confederacy money to fight them was ever going to get any of it back.  It even amended the Constitution (Amendment XIV, Section 4) to say that [N]either the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void. A clearer example of what you’re asking was Britain repudiating the debt of the republics it annexed in the Boer War: the republics had existed, they stopped existing, and the winner of the war decided that their debts were not its debts. More often, there’s one or more successor states that sign a treaty saying who is responsible for paying the former country’s debts.  An unusual example was when Germany was partitioned into the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) after World War II, the FRG declared that it wanted to repay the former German governments’ debts, in order to rehabilitate Germany’s reputation.  The United States and its allies wanted to strengthen the FRG’s claim to be the legitimate government of Germany, but did not want it to be crippled by debt as the Weimar Republic had been.  They signed a treaty in 1953 by which other countries would forgive some of the debts Germany owed them before the war, West Germany would pay most of the rest, and East Germany’s share would be repaid whenever Germany reunified (which happened in 1990).  Japan, however, had already defaulted on its foreign debts in 1942, and its new government defaulted on its domestic debts in 1946. Countries that break apart peacefully agree on how to split the debt. One country that did not break apart peacefully was the Russian Empire in 1917. In February 1918, the new Soviet Union repudiated the debts of both the Tsarist and Provisional governments, and in the early 1920s the Soviet Union signed bilateral treaties with Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Turkey and Persia agreeing that none of them would hold each other responsible for any of it—but France paid the interest on Russian bonds itself for the remainder of the war, and counted this sum as an additional loan to the defunct Russian Empire. These bonds continued to be traded until 1997, when, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation agreed to pay France $400M to settle all outstanding debt from before May 1945.  This was 1% of the amount France claimed its investors were owed.  Some of Russia’s other erstwhile allies did something similar, with Britain accepting compensation of 1.6% of face value in 1986.  Finland, however, which became independent from Russia at the same time, was the only country in the world to continue paying its debts to the United States from WWI through the Great Depression. In contrast, when the Soviet Union dissolved, the newly-independent republics negotiated its debts with the Group of Seven, consisting of the United States, the largest nations in Western Europe, and Japan (page 351).  They first attempted to make all the successor states “jointly and severally” responsible for the Soviet debt, then realized that none of the smaller republics would ever be able to repay the debt if Russia defaulted and renegotiated that Russia would inherit all the Soviet Union’s debt along with all of its overseas assets, and finally, agreed in December 1991 that the G7 would reschedule the debt and Russia would pass economic reforms. Most efforts to buy up old assets that a country defaulted on or seized and enlist another country to force someone to compensate you for it are not even as successful as the 1% settlement that France got from Russia in 1997.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, a group of speculators bought up a claimed $1.6 trillion in debt that the People’s Republic of China had issued before the Chinese revolution, and unsuccessfully lobbied to have the U.S. government try to force the People’s Republic of China to repay it, somehow.  (Linking does not imply endorsement.)  The least important of the reasons that will never happen is that the Republic of China still believes that it exists, on Taiwan, whereas the People’s Republic of China believes that it is the successor state of the Republic of China, which is wrong to believe that it exists.  Neither of them believes that it owes the owners of $1.6 trillion of the Republic of China’s old debts any money. Countries that merge also agree on who will repay the debts of both.  One interesting example is Texas becoming a state in 1845.  The new State of Texas officially assumed the debts of the former Republic of Texas, but whether the federal government would bail Texas out and the debts would actually be repaid in full was not resolved until 1855.  The debts of the formerly-independent realms that were annexed by Prussia in the 1860s were handled differently: while Prussia took over the debts of states it conquered in its wars of unification, and even agreed to accept a share of the Danish national debt along with the territory of Schleswig-Holstein, the Duchy of Brunswick, which negotiated its terms of unification, retained control over its own finances and repaid the money it had borrowed to build its railways through privatization.  In 1870, Prussia both took Alsace-Lorraine from France and made France pay them a large sum of money. In pragmatic terms, governments want to avoid defaulting on their domestic debts because that would harm their own people and economy, and on their foreign debts because that would damage their foreign relations and make it harder to borrow money again.  These same considerations usually apply to whatever new government rules the same territory. So, in another régime change (which didn’t really bring the end of a nation, but does demonstrate the point), Daniel Ortega in 1979 announced that his new Socialist government of Nicaragua would not recognize the debts of the dictatorship he had overthrown, but the Cubans convinced him that it would be unwise to antagonize the Capitalist countries that way, and he reversed course.. Today, governments that are seriously considering default as an option tend to also be in the position of needing to borrow more money, and often negotiate rescheduling through such organizations as the International Monetary Fund and the Club de Paris, which consists of 22 countries and describes itself as, “an informal group of official creditors whose role is to find coordinated and sustainable solutions to the payment difficulties experienced by debtor countries.”  Most of their debt-forgiveness programs, such as the Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries Initiative of 1996, ignore how the debts were acquired and focus on how much they are holding a country’s economy back. Although the above is a very Realist perspective on international relations, others argue that there is or should be a system of  international law based on rules, precedents and principles of justice.  One international treaty that proposes to establish some formal rules for what happens in the absence of any other specific agreement is the 1983 Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect of State Property, Archives and Debts—but this treaty has no legal weight because it is not in force, and only a handful of countries has signed it. Another frequently-cited concept is “odious debt” developed by Alexandre Sachs, which derives a principle from examples like the ones I gave above, and argues that this should be applied consistently as a normative international law.  Sachs argued that some debts need not be repaid because they are morally odious: If a despotic power contracts debt, not for the needs and interest of the State, but to strengthen its despotic regime, to oppress the population that combats it, that debt is odious for the whole State. The debt need not be recognised by the Nation[....] Other reasons that have been given in the past for a nation’s debt to be considered “odious” include: that the lender knew that the loan was exploitative, that the government that borrowed it had no authority to do so because it was illegitimate, that foreign rulers forced them to borrow it and used the money against the indigenous people now being asked to repay it, that a dictator borrowed in the name of his subjects but looted the money for himself, and that it was imposed under duress by an unfair treaty. This has never been codified as a principle of international law, but there have been a number of international treaties that have accepted some of these as valid reasons to repudiate a debt, such as the the United States forcing Spain to accept the debt of the former Spanish Captaincy-General of Cuba in 1898, rather than the U.S. occupation government at the time or the new Republic of Cuba, on the grounds that these funds had been diverted by Spain and not used for the benefit of the Cuban people (Thanks for correcting me, @Silverfish!); Russia’s treaties of the 1920s and 1990s; and the Treaty of Versailles nullifying the debts of German colonies in Poland and Africa that had been used to transfer land to German settlers. Note that there are organizations arguing that their interpretation of this principle should be applied universally to all nations,, leading to the emergence of a system more just, principled and consistent than the one we have now.  Other authors see it the opposite way: “Despite international law, the concept of odious debt has been successfully used as a post hoc rationale when the victors of such conflicts are powerful enough to enforce their will on world financial markets and international lenders.” There have been a much larger number of unilateral sovereign defaults where a government has made a moral argument that part of its debt is illegitimate, regardless of what anyone else thinks.  And, if you will forgive me my relapse, also numerous cases where countries didn’t bother with any justification other than that it was in their own people’s best interest, where countries said they were paying a debt purely for practical reasons even though they felt no moral obligation to, and where one country’s debts were not forgiven even though it would seem to have as strong a case as another whose debts were."
Can Prince Harry wear the uniforms of his former units?,"By Army regulations, no, he's not allowed to wear that uniform. Prince Harry technically isn't a ""retired officer"".  Rather, he resigned his commission in the Army, effective 19 June 2015.  See the London Gazette for 11 August 2015, Supplement 61319, page 14838, under ""Captain H. C. A. D. WALES 564673"". According to the Army Dress Regulations 02.45a (page 101 of the PDF), ""It is to be
noted that those who resigned their commissions are not authorised to wear uniform
under any circumstances."" Moreover, under the Uniforms Act 1894: (1)It shall not be lawful for any person not serving in Her [sic, now His] Majesty’s Military Forces to wear without Her Majesty’s permission the uniform of any of those forces, or any dress having the appearance or bearing any of the regimental or other distinctive marks of any such uniform: Provided that this enactment shall not prevent . . . . . . F1 any persons from wearing any uniform or dress in the course of a stage play performed in a place duly licensed or authorised for the public performance of stage plays, or in the course of a music hall or circus performance, or in the course of any bona fide military representation. (2)If any person contravenes this section he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding [F2level 3 on the standard scale]. Clearly Prince Harry is not currently serving in His Majesty's Military Forces, and ""His Majesty's permission"" would by default be granted only through the Army Dress Regulations promulgated in his name.  If Prince Harry were to wear the uniform anyway, then in principle he would be in breach of the regulations and thus the law, and liable for the prescribed fine. Of course, if he had worn the uniform, it would presumably have been because his father the King had in fact granted him permission to do so (on which point His Majesty would presumably have solicited the advice of his ministers).  But as a matter of politics and optics, that was probably not likely to be given.  Throughout the prince's active military service, there was a concerted effort to make it appear (accurately or not) that he was serving under the same conditions as any other officer of the same rank, without receiving preferential treatment.  So it would fit with that practice for him to comply strictly with the Army regulations, even though they could certainly be waived for his benefit."
What can I do if neighbor is blocking my solar panels intentionally?,"Maryland has no law requiring a neighbor to not plant / trim trees that might shade a solar panel (on the ground or on the roof). There are laws against deeds, declarations, covenants, contracts etc. (excepting registered historic properties) which prohibit of roof panels (e.g. as part of a HOA's rules). The law also recognizes the right to enter into an easement agreement, but that requires agreement by the neighbor. California has a law requiring tree trimming that would cover this case."
What is the legal take on the trolley problem?,"Doing nothing is legally safer than doing something, but you're not without hope if you pull the lever. Although you'll likely have committed murder or at least manslaughter, case law is littered with lenience in exigent circumstances, even where convictions have been affirmed.  Because this is a philosophical problem, there are plenty of opinions from that perspective, but not so many from a legal standpoint. Let's assume that you're an innocent bystander, (not an employee of the railway company or the train company, etc) and have no duty to act. If you do nothing, then it is unlikely that you would be charged with a crime - you had no duty to fulfill, and therefore not negligent. There's little doubt that not pulling the lever is the safer option.  More interesting is when you choose to pull the lever - then it's probable that you would have charges of murder, or at least manslaughter, brought against you by the state. What defenses does the law offer? Let's assume that you are aware that pulling the lever will kill a person. The primary defence is a legal principle of necessity: where your criminal actions are not protected or excluded by some other statute or principle, the fact that you were obliged to take this action in order to prevent some greater harm may safeguard you from penalties. There are certain elements of necessity: I see such a defense only possibly falling over on (4), where the prevented and caused harm, in the case of human lives, are inherently very subjective. Unfortunately, each state has different rulings regarding the threshold for evidence of this defense. One of the most famous cases where necessity was attempted as a defense to murder, with remarkable parallels to this hypothetical, is that of R v Dudley and Stephens: This case concerns essentially the choice you're making in the trolley problem: either the four crew members were going to die, or one of them would definitely die and the others might live. It's easy to say that they should have just waited, but they didn't have the benefit of hindsight. It's also a great example of a situation where although the law says one thing, it doesn't align with our morals and ethics, and while it's a UK case, I would wager that almost every lawyer in common law countries would have heard about it."
Does being engaged (to be married) carry any legal significance?,"There are only a few areas of law of which I am aware that U.S. law treats people who are engaged to be married differently (although perhaps with more thought I could expand the list). Fiance(e)s come under a special immigration status when applying for a visa. There is a body of law related to whether an engagement ring is an absolute gift or is conditional upon being married (this is not uniform from state to state and I don't recall what the majority rule in those cases is under the common law). In South Carolina, ownership disputes over engagement rings are litigated as breach of promise to marry actions. Pre-marital agreements governing a future marriage can be made by people who are engaged (although a post-nuptial agreement is also equal in effect in most cases). People who are engaged, like spouses, are generally considered to be in a ""confidential relationship"" with each other which imposes higher duties with respect to fairness in their dealings with each other than strangers, but generally less high duties than fiduciaries. While not strictly arising from the status of being engaged, adult cohabitants are generally agents for service of process of each other at their shared home, and are often considered to have a legally significant relationship for purposes of domestic violence statutes (usually related to either domestic violence crimes or temporary restraining orders). I am not familiar enough with the law of France to fully answer the balance of the question, which someone more familiar with that law can expand upon.  But, there is similarly a special immigration status in French law for a fiance(e). And, French law, in a flourish so romantic it could scarcely be any other country's law, also allows people who are engaged a right to marry after one of them has died in certain circumstances: ""The legislation that allows posthumous marriages stems back to when a dam burst in 1959 and killed 420 people in southern France."" It was most recently invoked in 2014 when a grieving French woman was granted permission by the French President to marry her former fiancé, who tragically died in 2012, just a month before they were due to wed. To be eligible the bride to be had ""to convince the President of France that her’s was a special case and that her love for Michael went beyond the grave. It took four letters to the president and 20 months of waiting, desperately hoping for a positive response."" The President's discretion in this matter is somewhat similar to the pardon power in U.S. law. This French law was also invoked in 2009. The law in question is set forth at Articles 171 of the French Civil Code. In English translation this states: Article 171 The President of the Republic may, for serious reasons,
  authorize the celebration of the marriage if one of the future spouses
  is dead providing a sufficient gathering of facts establishes
  unequivocally his consent. In this case, the effects of the marriage
  date back to the day preceding that of the death of the spouse.
  However, this marriage does not carry with it any right of intestate
  succession to the benefit of the surviving spouse and no matrimonial
  regime is considered to have existed between the spouses. I am aware of one documented case where a court entered a post-humous marriage in the United States between people who were engaged, but I am not familiar with any legal authority actually authorizing that action."
Why does it matter that a group of January 6 rioters went to Olive Garden for dinner after the riot?,"The article says: Defense lawyers say the evidence does not show a celebration of violence. Which implies that the prosecution claimed exactly that, or at least that the defense anticipates the prosecution to claim something along those lines. The article also says [bold italic emphasis mine]: Defense lawyers for Rhodes have previously addressed the dinner, saying that prosecutors’ theory of the episode is incorrect. Rhodes’ lawyers said in a court filing the dinner is evidence that the militia leader wasn’t working to foment a revolution. “The conditions would never be better. Yet, Rhodes and the others left the Capitol grounds and went to Olive Garden for dinner,” lawyers for Rhodes wrote. “The answer is quite simple: because stopping the certification, overthrowing the government, was not Rhodes’ intent. It was not the Oath Keepers’ intent.” So, from the CNN article, it seems that the prosecution interprets this as celebrating a successful attack whereas the defense argues that leaving the Capitol to go for dinner instead of continuing the attack proves that they didn't want to overthrow the government. Why does it matter where they go for dinner and how much they spend? It doesn't matter where, exactly they went, which restaurant they went to, and that it was an Olive Garden. For the prosecution, what matters is that they appeared to celebrate, for the defense, what matters is that they left the Capitol. It also doesn't matter how much, exactly, they spent. What matters is that the amount of money can be used as a proxy (by the prosecution at least) for how many people attended the ""celebration"", how long it lasted, and how much value was placed on the ""celebration"". (In general, people spend more money when they are celebrating something than when they are just getting a bite because they are hungry.) So, in short:"
"""attempted murder"" of a dead man?","Not only is this possible, it has been done. At least in Canada. On July 27th 2013 Sammy Yatim was on board a Toronto Transit bus and began brandishing a knife and threatening passengers. Constable James Forcillo of Toronto Police Service responded, and when Yatim ignored warnings and advanced towards police, Forcillo fired three shots, which felled Yatim, followed by another six shots when he was on the ground. An autopsy revealed that the first volley of three shots had killed Yatim almost instantly. At his trial Forcillo was found not guilty of murder, since the first three shots were deemed justified. But the second volley were deemed not justified. Since Yatim was already dead, Forcillo was not guilty of murder but found guilty of attempted murder."
"Does a private citizen in the US have the right to make a ""Contact the Police"" poster?","There is no law against a person creating and distributing such a poster, to the best of my knowledge. However such a poster pretty clearly implies that the person shown is guilty of a crime, or at least strongly suspected. If the store somehow made an error, pulling the image of a person who did not use the stolen card or there is some other error, the person pictured might well suffer a significant loss of reputation, and might sue for defamation. Damages could possibly be significant. Such suits have, I believe, happened when surveillance photos were posted but there later proved to have been an error.  Mary might wish to double check how sure the store is that the photos are of the person who actually used the stolen card."
"California: ""For quality assurance, this phone call is being recorded""","The recording is not illegal because you've been told it would happen, and by not hanging up, you've agreed to have a conversation that can be recorded. This was determined in Kearney v. Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. applying the exception of Penal Code 632 that communications are not considered confidential if there is a reasonable expectation that the call will be overheard or recorded - being explicitly told that the call will be recorded makes this true. It would not be illegal for them to only record their own statements during the call, nor for you to record only your statements, either. In particular, the company is allowed to record the part of the call where they make this statement, as they are not recording a conversation, only their own (likely pre-recorded) statement (again?). Indeed, including their statement about the recording in the recording is common practise partly for protection against claims that the other party was not informed of the recording occurring."
Do I have the right to enter into someone house without permission if my child is in there?,"I don't know anything about Filipino law. I just looked up the law in Michigan in the United States. First, under Michigan law, it doesn't sound like you are guilty of ""trespassing"". Trespassing in Michigan is when you enter someone else's property after they have told you that you are not permitted, or if you refuse to leave when ordered. In practice, trespassing is mainly about being on someone else's yard or porch, not inside the house. It's not a crime to walk up to someone's front door and knock, or to chase a ball or a stray dog onto someone else's property. It's not a crime until they tell you to leave and you refuse to go. So unless Mario told you to leave and you didn't, there's no trespassing. Second, what's really relevant is ""breaking and entering"". Interestingly enough, under Michigan law to be guilty of breaking and entering you must not just enter another person's house, but do so with intent to rob the place or assault someone. The fact that your son threatened Mario would work against you here. If that part hadn't happened, I think you could argue there was no intent to rob or assault: you were trying to protect your daughter.  I wasn't there when they wrote this law, but I think I see the reasoning. Suppose you see that your neighbor's house is on fire, and so you rush in to rescue their baby from being burned to death. No one in his right mind would say that was a crime. Or if a small child or a mentally ill person blunders into someone else's house. Etc.  I think your case is arguably similar to the fire: Your goal wasn't to rob the house, but to rescue your daughter. Again, I don't know Filipino law, but were it not for the threat, I think you'd have a pretty good defense. Even with the threat, I think most courts would overlook that.  Again, by Michigan law, 16 is old enough to consent to sexual activity, with some exceptions. Like, a teacher or a boss cannot legally have sex with someone under their authority. But I don't think any of the exceptions apply here, so Mario isn't breaking the law. Unless he was using force against her, you can't claim to have been protecting her from a crime."
If I cause a crash can I delete my dash cam footage?,"As an example, under the laws of Colorado, USA, deleting the footage would be a crime.  See CRS 18-8-610: A person commits tampering with physical evidence if, believing that an official proceeding is pending or about to be instituted and acting without legal right or authority, he: (a) Destroys, mutilates, conceals, removes, or alters physical evidence with intent to impair its verity or availability in the pending or prospective official proceeding;   If you cause a crash, you should certainly believe that you are going to be sued, and a lawsuit is definitely an official proceeding.  And it sounds like your purpose in deleting the footage is to prevent it from being used in that lawsuit.  So you'd be clearly guilty under this law.  It is a class 6 felony, carrying a sentence of 12-18 months in prison and a fine of $1,000 to $100,000. It may be counterintuitive, but according to a law firm, a digital video would be considered physical evidence: Physical evidence may include electronic records, videos, or audio recordings. This includes emails, text messages, social media messages, image files, video files, and computer files. If you don't delete the video, it is likely to be demanded by the plaintiff during the discovery process so that it can be entered into evidence.  Rule 37 of the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure lists the sanctions that can be imposed if you refuse, such as: charging you for legal fees incurred by the plaintiffs in trying to obtain it assuming that the video proves whatever the plantiffs say it would show (e.g. that you were speeding, driving recklessly, etc) entering a default judgment against you (the plaintiffs automatically win the suit, as if you had refused to show up in court) holding you in contempt of court, which can lead to you being put in jail until you choose to comply, as well as fined."
How is a plain-clothes officer entering your house not an unreasonable search?,"Wooden made two arguments to suppress the evidence, first that he had not consented to the officer entering his house (the officer and the court disagreed) and the second that even if the officer's entry had been legitimate, the evidence wasn't legitimate because of the Fourth Amendment: Much of Wooden’s challenge turns on the fact that Mason was neither in uniform nor identified himself as a police officer. Both are true. But generally speaking, neither amounts to improper deception in the Fourth Amendment context. United States v. Baldwin , 621 F.2d 251, 252–53 (6th Cir. 1980) (citing Lewis v. United States , 385 U.S. 206, 211, 87 S.Ct. 424, 17 L.Ed.2d 312 (1966) ). Nor did Mason take any affirmative steps to attempt to deceive Wooden regarding his identity. Mason was silent as to his official position; he did not hold himself out to be anything he was not. He merely asked to speak to Harris and then asked if he could come inside, to get out of the cold. Probably relevant also is that the officer didn't ""search"" for the rifle that prompted the arrest. Wooden picked it up in plain sight, the search of Wooden's person that revealed the second firearm was done as the officer arrested him for the rifle and the subsequent search of the house was carried out with the consent of the other resident Janet Harris."
Can a person start new businesses to compete relentlessly with someone they hate?,"Generally speaking, there's nothing wrong with setting up shop to compete with someone, even if you hate them, and even if you hope to bring them to financial ruin. But there are laws surrounding what is and is not fair competition, and the behavior you're describing -- relying on greater resources to cut prices until a competitor folds up shop -- is known as ""predatory pricing."" In the United States, it's illegal under the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, assuming that Bob is cutting prices below cost, and that Alice's exit from the market could lead to a monopoly for Bob. I don't know the limits on predatory pricing anywhere else, but my understanding is that it's illegal throughout the E.U., including in Germany, where Wal-Mart has struggled mightily to adapt to local competition law."
How will anyone know if an employer fires an employee for an illegal reason?,"There is a rather elaborate three step analysis that is done in civil rights cases under U.S. precedents. Circumstantial evidence, as opposed to direct evidence of
discrimination (which is less frequently available to plaintiffs), is
analyzed under a three-part test created by the Supreme Court in
McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). STEP 1/prima facie case  (burden on plaintiff) They belong to a protected class (or the person taking the action thought that they did and alleged acted on that basis) They were qualified for the job and performing in accordance with the
expectations of their employer Employer terminated their employment The employer replaced plaintiff with an individual who was comparably
qualified to the plaintiff, but not in the protected class. STEP 2 (burden on defendant) Employer must produce evidence that its actions were the result of
legitimate and non-discriminatory reasons STEP 3 (burden on plaintiff) Employee must prove that the non-discriminatory reason(s) offered by
the employer in Step 2 were not true reasons, but were a pretext for
discrimination based on age. In Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., 530 U.S. 133, 146-7 (2000),
the Supreme Court held that “it is permissible for the trier of fact
to infer the ultimate fact of discrimination from the falsity of the
employer’s explanation.” Also, Reeves allows the trier of fact to
consider the evidence used to establish a prima facie case of
discrimination (first prong of McDonnell Douglas) when they are
deciding the final prong of McDonnell Douglas framework.  Notably,
the Supreme Court later held that “[t]he reason for treating
circumstantial and direct evidence alike is both clear and deep
rooted: ‘Circumstantial evidence is not only sufficient, but may also
be more certain, satisfying and persuasive than direct evidence.’”
Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. 90, (2003) (quoting Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U.S. 500, 508, n. 17 (1957)). The ""quote"" above adapts and closely paraphrases this source. A jury doesn't have to believe the testimony of the employer and discovery through depositions and written communications and historical hiring and firing patterns can all be used to provide evidence that the claimed reason is pretextual. There are more than a dozen tactics for proving that a claimed reason is really a pretext for an invalid reason at trial."
Do Legal Documents Require Signing In Standard Pen Colors?,"That is not correct. If the purple will not photocopy well, the other party might reasonably ask for a color that will. But a signature is normally only evidence of agreement to the provisions, and it is the agreement that is legally important. The color of the ink used does not change the agreement. It is normal to expect a signature to be in a permanent ink. A signature in pencil or erasable ink might be legal, but the other party will not want to accept it, and it would be reasonable to comply. "
Can I booby-trap my property against police?,"First off, you cannot booby trap your property, period. It is both illegal and tortious. But, as you noted, there are already questions/answers that deal with this issue. Sure enough, if the police get a no-knock search warrant, that in and of itself is the Court order allowing entry by any means necessary. When the officers, there by right of law, breach the outer perimeter and stop at the warnings, they will not be seeking any other court orders to have you allow them ""safe entry"". Their warrant gives them all the right they need, as probable cause of crime and violent intent or intent to destroy evidence was already presented to a judge. If, in real life, you actually put up signage or state explicitly that they're being forewarned that you intend to harm, trap, maim, or otherwise make it unsafe to enter; or that doing so will result in an attempt to destroy evidence, that is something they have already assumed (hence the seeking and granting of the no-knock vs. a regular search warrant). However, the signs in and of themselves are not protected speech, but rather overt threats, and that would put you in a very precarious position indeed.  If the police get a ""no knock"" warrant (the most invasive, difficult to get warrants, whereby there is a grave risk of destruction of evidence or injury to persons), the police will ensure they have safe passage – they've come prepared for dangerous entry long before your signs, but once they see them, you could rest assured they will take them as they are intended: as a direct threat to their safety, and they will deploy a SWAT or other heavily armed entry team (who is usually there anyway for these dangerous entries). You could expect things like smoke/out canister and teargas, flash bangs, and heavily armed and well armored officers attempting to force you from your dwelling. Presumably, if you need to disarm traps to escape the situation, they can enter.  Assuming you're home when they invade with chemical weapons, whether you come out or not, they will force you to disarm whatever booby trapping you may have in place that may destroy evidence, likely walking you in as their human shield in the event you're lying about any dangerous ones. That is probably your best case scenario. They may just decide to throw you through the perimeter once they get their hands on you, just to see what happens! If you don't exit and are home or if you are lucky enough to be out, the bomb squad, ATF, and SWAT will converge on your property in less than typical means. Because from your warning they can assume some incendiary or explosive device exists, bringing it into the jurisdiction of other agencies. If they cannot disarm the trap, they would send a robot in first to set it off, or cut through your roof, or knock down a wall – whatever it takes to get in without using a typical means of ingress/egress, so as not to chance your trap. Regardless, you can rest assured that they will get in, and you will pay for the trap you set for law enforcement. Further, to whatever charges you'd have been faced with from evidence flowing from the original warrant will now be added additional charges like attempted murder of a peace officer; if you have any roommates or known associates: conspiracy to do those things; attempted destruction of evidence, criminal interference with a police investigation ... all at a minimum. If anyone is actually harmed, your signage offers you no shield from criminal or tort liability, and you will be lucky to live through the experience once they get their hands on you. Police tend to not like being the targets of intentional maiming, dismemberment or death.  You have to understand that, according to this hypothetical, you are intentionally trying to harm law enforcement, or destroy evidence of your dangerous criminal activity. These are not invaders, or intruders according to the law; they are the people whose job it is to enforce the laws, collect the evidence (if you weren't getting arrested pursuant to the fruits of the warrant, you certainly would be at that point). The signs themselves would make excellent exhibits in the coming case of State v. you. BTW: The only reason they have left John Joe Gray alone is that he knows the Henderson County Sheriff Ronny Brownlow, who has been told that the ATF, FBI, and State SWAT, would all be happy to enter and get or kill Mr. Gray if need be. Since the Sheriff never filed any federal charges, and has determined that he doesn't want to breach (and it's in his jurisdiction to determine this), the Sheriff, aware that Gray's entire family is holed up in the ""compound"", decided it's not worth going in. It's as well known as it is anomalous. When the police want in, and have the right to get in, they will get in. That Sheriff just decided it's not worthwhile."
What's so Grand about Grand Theft Auto?,"Grand theft, a term which is used in some jurisdictions, is ""big theft"". It is defined in California in terms of what and how much you steal, for instance ""over $950"" except over $250 for domestic fowl (and other things). It also includes any auto theft. Otherwise, it is known as petty theft (""small theft"": the terms derive from French and sometimes spelled ""petit""). On the other hand, Washington state does not use those terms, instead they have 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree theft, as well as theft of motor vehicle, two degrees of taking of motor vehicle, and so on."
Ordered to unlock my car trunk. May I lawfully refuse?,"If you comply without protest, this will be taken as consent to a search, and make anything found admissible. One can verbally object. The ACLU suggests the form ""I do not consent to searches"" to any request to search your car, your house, your person or any other property of yours or under your control. There is no need to give any reason for your refusal. However, one is required to follow any ""lawful orders"" given by  police officer during a traffic or pedestrian stop.[1] Failure to follow lawful orders may well be a separate crime.  Even if the lawfulness is suspect, it is usually better to comply and challenge the order later, in court. One might make a second objection, such as ""I don't see that you have probable cause for a search, and I do not give consent. Are you ordering me to permit a search?"" If the officer clearly orders you to open the trunk, one might place the keys in reach of the officer, while not opening the trunk oneself. That might help establish that there was no consent to the search, and require probable cause to be established before anything found could be used in a trial. One might also repeat, as the officer opens the trunk ""I am not consenting to any search."" If it is possible for any person present to record video without obstructing the officer(s) that might hrlp to establish the absence of consent and other relevant facts, later. People in general have a right to make such recordings, but not to obstruct or interfere with police activity. The Washington Post in an opinion article dated July 23, 2015 ""Sandra Bland and the ‘lawful order’ problem"" wrote: The Bland video brings up an overlooked problem with the law of police-citizen encounters. The police can back up their orders with force because it’s often a crime to disobey a lawful order from a police officer. But from a citizen’s perspective, it’s often impossible to know what is a lawful order. As a result, it’s often impossible for citizens to know what they can and can’t do during a police encounter. The first problem is knowing what counts as an “order.” If an officer approaches you and asks you to do something, that’s normally just a request and not an order. But if there’s a law on the books saying that you have to comply with the officer’s request, then the request is treated as an order. You can’t know what is an “order” unless you study the law first, which you’re unlikely to have done before the officer approached you. In the case of Oregon v Rose Mary ILLIG-RENN, 42 P.3d 62 (2006) The Supreme Court of Oregon held that ORS 162.247(1)(b), a statute that makes it a crime to ""refuse[] to obey a lawful order by [a] peace officer."" is constructional against challenges under the Oregon and US Federal constitutions. [1]: A person commits the crime of interfering with a peace officer or parole and probation officer if the person, knowing that another person is a peace officer or a parole and probation officer  ... Refuses to obey a lawful order by the peace officer or parole and probation officer. (a) It is unlawful to willfully fail or refuse to comply with a lawful order, signal, or direction of a peace officer, as defined in Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 830) of Title 3 of Part 2 of the Penal Code, when that peace officer is in uniform and is performing duties pursuant to any of the provisions of this code, or to refuse to submit to a lawful inspection pursuant to this code. (a) No person shall willfully fail or refuse to comply with any lawful order or direction of any law-enforcement officer or traffic-control officer invested by law with authority to direct, control or regulate traffic, which order or direction related to the control of traffic."
What is jury nullification?,"Quoting from here, Jury nullification occurs when a jury returns a verdict of ""Not Guilty"" despite its belief that the defendant is guilty of the violation charged.  The jury in effect nullifies a law that it believes is either immoral or wrongly applied to the defendant whose fate they are charged with deciding. In essence, a jury decides that a law should not be legal in the situation, and as such the charge is unwarranted. One of the first cases was in the trial of John Peter Zenger, in 1735, where a law against libels was used against him, and subsequently nullified by a jury. It was subsequently used against the famous Alien and Sedition Acts, as well as The Fugitive Slave Laws. Zenger was the first case in America; in 1670, it was used in the case of William Penn and William Mead, who were acquitted of ""illegal assembly"" as Quakers. In an interesting twist, the jurors were imprisoned, as jury nullification was not explicitly legal, but they were later released. Interestingly enough, according to The New York Times In 1895, the Supreme Court ruled that jurors had no right, during trials, to be told about nullification. The court did not say that jurors didn’t have the power, or that they couldn’t be told about it, but only that judges were not required to instruct them on it during a trial. The Times also wrote that nullification had been used against laws against alcohol and gay marriage, though it did not cite specific cases."
"At what point is it ""legal"" to overthrow the government?","Think through the logical combinations of two questions: The government is tyrannical or just, the revolution is successful or not. So 'legal' is the wrong category for your question. The 2nd Amendment allows the citizens to stockpile arms, which helps both justified and not justified revolutions. Finding the justification for a revolution is a moral category, not strictly a legal question."

Can a bank sue someone that disseminates information that starts a bank run that destroys the bank?,"Can a bank sue someone that starts a bank run that destroys the bank? No (assuming, of course, as is the usual case, that the person who starts the bank run is not engaged in perpetrating a defamatory falsehood). Most bank runs are, and certainly the Silicon Valley Bank bank run was, based upon wide disclosure of a true fact. In the case of SVB, the bank run was triggered by the fact that its balance sheets failed to reflect the true value of fixed nominal rate bonds that it held as assets. In the usual case, a lawsuit also isn't a very helpful option to a bank that suffers a bank run. In the case of SVB, the bank had a book value (which is often a fair measure of a bank's value since its assets are so monetized) of $34 billion which was reduced to a pittance by the run on it. Even if someone who started a run on the bank had a moderately high net worth of $3.4 million that could be collected in a money judgment, that would cover a mere 0.01% of the loss to the bank, and there would be serious issues over the causation of any loss (i.e. how much of the losses suffered bound to occur sooner or later anyway due to causes unrelated to someone who triggered a panic). Another fine point of procedure is that when a bank becomes insolvent, it is promptly taken over by the FDIC or similar regulatory agency, which installs a receiver. This makes it effectively impossible for the bank itself to sue anyone. If the bank would otherwise have had a right to sue, the receiver for the bank would have the right to sue rather than the bank itself. But, this subtly while not irrelevant, doesn't capture the core reason for the question."
"Is it legal to go take my license plates off a car I sold, without realizing I should keep my plates?","License plates in Texas are governed by the Texas TRANSPORTATION CODE, TITLE 7. VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC, SUBTITLE A. CERTIFICATES OF TITLE AND REGISTRATION OF VEHICLES, CHAPTER 504 LICENSE PLATES Texas code section  504.901.  TRANSFER AND REMOVAL OF LICENSE PLATES (subsections (b) and (c)) provide that (b)  On the sale or transfer of a motor vehicle to a person who does not hold a general distinguishing number issued under Chapter 503, [i.e. not a dealer] the seller may remove each license plate issued for the motor vehicle.  The license plates may be transferred to another vehicle titled in the seller's name if the seller obtains: (1)  the department's approval of an application to transfer the license plates; and (2)  a new registration insignia for the motor vehicle. (c)  A license plate removed from a motor vehicle that is not transferred to another motor vehicle must be disposed of in a manner specified by the department. It seems that the seller is not required to remove the plates when selling the vehicle Section 504.010  ISSUANCE AND PLACEMENT OF LICENSE PLATE. provides that: (a)  On payment of the prescribed fee, an applicant for motor vehicle registration shall be issued a license plate or set of plates This seems to tie the plates to the registration, which means to the person registering them as well as to a particular vehicle. Section  504.943.  OPERATION OF VEHICLE WITHOUT LICENSE PLATE provides that: (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (b), a person commits an offense if the person operates on a public highway, during a registration period, a motor vehicle that does not display two license plates that: (1)  have been assigned by the department for the period; and (2)  comply with department rules regarding the placement of license plates. Section. 504.944.  OPERATION OF VEHICLE WITH WRONG LICENSE PLATE.provides that: A person commits an offense if the person operates, or as the owner permits another to operate, on a public highway a motor vehicle that has attached to it a number plate or registration insignia issued for a different vehicle.  An offense under this section is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $200. It would seem that under 504.943 or 504.944 (and the related 504.945) the person who bought is committing a misdemeanor  every time that the person drives it on public roads or streets. The seller could inform the buyer of this and request the buyer to get new plates, or report the buyer to the police as having improper plates, which would allow them to stop the buyer for having improper plates. Use of certified mail would preserve a record of the notification of the buyer. Note that notification is in no way required before reporting to the police, but might induce the buyer to get new plates on his or her own. Secretly removing the buyer's license plate would probably not be theft, as it seems that the plates actually remain the property of the state, but would at the least involve trespass. It seems unwise at best."
What are the rules on businesses that wish to only hire attractive females?,"There is a good answer at the Skeptics StackExchange here. Its three most relevant references are: Wilson v Southwest held that being attractive and female is not a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ) for being a flight attendant, even when the company marketed themselves using female sexuality: sex does not become a BFOQ merely because an employer chooses to exploit female sexuality as a marketing tool or to better ensure profitability Most scholars believe that the BFOQ exception would not apply to Hooters servers for the same reason. The job is serving food, and the sexualized nature of the service is just the manner in which they do the job, not a requirement of the primary job itself. Hooters has never had a discrimination suit go to trial, however has been sued and settled out of court multiple times. Employment discrimination based on gender has been allowed only in cases where the primary product being sold (not merely the manner of delivery of the primary product) requires  a particular gender. One example would be  sexual entertainment. This would include strip clubs, modelling agencies, Nevada brothels, etc. I'll say it one other way. Simply offering attractive female service as part of a business strategy is not enough to trigger a BFOQ exception. To allow a BFOQ defence based on an employer's desired manner or means of achieving its primary business purpose would render the statute inoperative, and the BFOQ exception would ""swallow the rule"" Phillips v. Martin Marietta 400 U.S. 542 (1971).

Can bills (the documents of laws/legislation) have pictures? Or text only? Can images become part of the legal code?,"In in the united-kingdom diagrams are found in regulations, for example legislation dealing with roadside symbols. There are two kinds of legislation in the UK: Acts of Parliament and Statutory Instruments (normally called Regulations). The procedure by which an Act of Parliament is passed is that it has to be approved by both Houses of the legislature and then receive Royal Assent (Royal Assent is a formality). The procedure in each House is that the main debates occur at the Committee Stage when amendments are proposed and voted on. At the next stage (Third Reading) the House votes again on whether to approve the Bill in its amended form. Statutory Instruments (Regulations) are issued by the government (executive) and are known as delegated legislation because the government only has power to issue a regulation if an Act (called the parent Act) gives it power to do so. As you would expect there are safeguards. First of all the courts can declare invalid (ultra vires) any regulation whose terms go outside the limits of the power delegated by the Parent Act. Sometime the parent Act will provide that Regulations issued by the government under delegated powers become law without further involvement of Parliament but sometimes an Act will provide for some limited further Parliamentary scrutiny. This can be either by the Positive Resolution (the regulation will not become law until Parliament approve it) or by the Negative Resolution procedure (the regulation will become law unless Parliament passes a resolution annulling it). A key point, in the context of the question, is that neither the Positive nor the Negative Resolution procedure allows Parliament to amend the regulation - Parliament only has a binary choice to approve  or disapprove. Of course if they disapprove then the government can issue a new amended regulation which then goes through the same process but the Positive/Negative resolution procedure does not allow Parliament itself to amend any regulation. I think this explains why diagrams which are sometimes found in regulations are rarely found in Acts. Constitutional proprieties require any Bill to be amendable and any member of the legislature can propose a amendment. If the Bill included diagrams then there would be huge practical problems because any member who wanted to amend a diagram would have to produce his own amended diagram which he might not be able to do/might not have time to do before parliamentary deadlines. So constitutional proprieties would normally mean that in practice Bills must be solely words. Regulations however cannot be amended by Parliament (see above) so such considerations do not prevent regulations from containing diagrams. Having said that normally Bills will only contain words, there is this example of an Act which includes a diagram of a symbol. That symbol, however, is defined in an international convention so in practice no parliamentarian would want to amend it. I know of no examples in the UK where a Bill (as distinct from regulations) contains an image which a member of the legislature might want to propose an amendment to."
Jurors not allowed to talk to each other during the trial?,"The rule on whether jurors may discuss a case before closing arguments is almost always a matter of statewide law and not a decision left to a particular judge in a particular case. There is good reason to believe that prohibiting pre-closing deliberation by jurors tends to make ultimate jury verdicts more accurate for reasons discussed below. The question about juror questions seems to be based upon the inaccurate assumption that jury questions are only allowed if collectively approved by the jury. First of all, prohibiting jurors from deliberating or discussing a case prior to the close of evidence and closing arguments is not universal practice. Colorado, for example, is one of the minority of reformist states that allow jurors to deliberate at any time that they are all present together in a case, after the panel is chosen. Arizona was one of the first states to experiment with this innovation. But, there is a rational reason for the older majority rule. This is first, to discourage jurors from reaching conclusions before all of the evidence is in, because people have a natural tendency to place more emphasis on the evidence that they hear first and to jump to conclusions before hearing all of the evidence, such as the defendant's evidence that comes last. Talking to other jurors consolidates and solidifies opinions and that makes it harder to change opinions when new evidence confronts an original opinion. Groups cling more tightly to an initial consensus than individuals. In contrast, individual jurors often change their minds during the course of a trial. Secondly, it is to maximize the independence with which jurors reach their conclusions at the close of evidence. This matters because, empirically, the ultimate decision of a jury panel is overwhelmingly consistent with the initial pre-deliberation inclination of the median juror on the issue of guilt or innocence. The ultimate verdict of a jury is almost completely foreordained by the initial impressions of the jurors when they start their deliberations, even though it doesn't feel like that because jury deliberations cause people who are in the minority in an initial straw poll on the verdict to change their minds based upon what the other jurors have to say about 90% of the time. Twelve Angry Men  (a drama and movie in which a holdout juror convinces all of the other jurors to change their mind on their verdict from their first straw poll) is an extremely outlier case that almost never happens in real life, especially in non-death penalty cases. So getting the first straw poll right is much more important than getting deliberations right since those have very predictable results. Deliberations almost never matter unless the jury has a 50-50 split in their initial straw poll and a lot of cases where there is a 50-50 split in the initial straw poll will produce a hung jury. To put some flesh on the numbers, the best empirical estimates of the overall accuracy of jury panels in making guilt-innocence determinations is about 90%. (Estimates on false convictions range from about 2.3% to 7% for all serious felonies including convictions arising from plea bargains in a 2007 study, a 14% acquittal rate was found in stranger rape cases where DNA evidence can lead to acquittals following jury trials, and roughly 40-47% of death sentences are overturned in the appellate and post-conviction review process.) Note that about 90% of criminal cases, overwhelmingly those with more clear cut guilt, result in plea bargains, so only about 1% of criminal defendants who are convicted are wrongfully convicted as a result of an inaccurate jury verdict. This accuracy rate somewhat underestimates how hard it is to be that accurate. It has been shown statistically (in the same article supporting the majority rule of jury verdict outcomes linked above), that about 68% of cases are pretty much guaranteed to produce convictions regardless of the makeup of the jury or the process used, while about 14% of cases that produce acquittals are sufficiently clear that the makeup of the jury or the process used doesn't matter (in a large, representative Sarasota, Florida sample). Thus, only about 18% of cases presented to juries are actually close cases and on those cases juries get the right result only a little better than 50% of the time. It is reassuring that about 95%+ of cases that are prosecuted have predictable outcomes in the system either through plea bargaining or correct jury verdicts, but not very comforting that about 2%+ of criminal prosecutions, and about one in five criminal jury trials, involve such unclear facts that their outcome at trial is basically a coin flip. In general, as a matter of mathematics, it is universally true (subject to assumptions that are present in this situation) that when something is more than 50% likely to happen in each trial as you would like it to happen, you are more likely to get a good result if you maximize the number of independent determinations that are made. In contrast, if something is less than 50% likely to happen as you would like, you maximize your odds of a desired result with as few independent trials as possible. The leading article explaining this idea is called ""How To Gamble If You Must."" In a jury context, in real life, any given independent juror who ends up on a jury poll is more than 50% likely to get the right answer in an initial straw poll the vast majority of the time. So, the more independent jurors you have, the more likely it is that a majority of them will get the right answer. And, the fewer independent jurors you have, the more likely it is that a majority of them will make a mistake. So, by preventing pre-judgment deliberation, you increase the number of independent evaluations of the evidence that are made by the jurors and increase the probability of a correct result on the merits. The counterargument for the modern rule is that an overall mistake on guilt or innocence flows from multiple earlier mistakes in interpreting particular items of evidence, and that the ultimate conclusion flows from a lot of mini-determinations. And, if someone makes a wrong mini-determination early on and can't be swayed from it once deliberations come along, this can lead to the jury being wrongfully hung. In contrast, if jurors deliberate on each item of evidence as it comes along as a complete group, the likelihood of getting any particular sub-issue wrong is minimized, and getting sub-issues right consistently may be more important to reaching a correct decision than maintaining independent points of view throughout the trial. The traditional position is that jurors can't ask questions at all. To the best of my knowledge, juror question asking is a very recent phenomenon (probably late 1980s or later). The modern position, followed in a minority of states, allows jurors to ask questions if they are not objectionable under the rules of evidence that apply to lawyers. Some jurisdictions allow this in both civil and criminal cases, while others allow it only in civil cases. I honestly don't know what the rule in Colorado is on juror questions in criminal cases, because my practice is exclusively non-criminal. The state of the law on jury questioning in criminal cases in the federal courts is summarized in a recent 6th Circuit opinion: Juror questioning, we have explained, “should be a rare practice,” but
“the balance of risks to benefits is more likely to weigh in favor of
juror questions in complex cases.” The concern about allowing juror questions in criminal cases is that the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is on the prosecution and it can lose simply by failing to meet that burden of proof. An answer to a juror question could provide additional evidence that turns a case where it seems likely that a defendant committed a crime but there has not been proof beyond a reasonable doubt, into one where there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, unfairly and unconstitutionally disfavoring the criminal defendant. In a civil case where the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof makes the balance equal between the parties, and where the focus is more on getting a right result between two people who are equal before the state as opposed to protecting people from state overreach, the same considerations about aiding one side in meeting a burden of proof with jury questions don't apply to the same extent. The argument for the modern position is that psychology research shows that people make more accurate decisions when they can ask questions on points about which they are unclear. The lawyers and judge in the room may think that a point made by a witness was perfectly clear, but some of the jurors may not understand the word that someone used and come to the wrong conclusion. But, lawyers can't clarify the facts so as to assist the jurors in making the right decision if the jurors can't ask questions that illustrate what the jurors aren't understanding of the presentation before them. A related issue is asking questions. Obviously if the jury wants to
ask witnesses questions, they may need to talk among themselves to
decide what question to put to the witness, so the instruction would
seem to directly conflict with basic juror rights, such as the right
to question witnesses. In my experience when juror questions are allowed, any juror who wants to ask a question may do so unilaterally without reaching the agreement of the other jurors, on the theory that even one juror who doesn't understand something about the testimony or has unanswered questions when facts are available to them, is one too many. Usually, a few jurors ask lots of questions, and many jurors ask few or no questions. So, it isn't clear how a prohibition on jurors deliberating prior to the close of evidence would change the practice of jurors asking questions. Perhaps there are places where jurors are allowed to ask questions only if they agree on those questions, but I am not aware of any such jurisdiction. In every jurisdiction that I am aware of that allows questions, individual jurors can ask them, and questions are not asked by jurors only if no juror has any questions for a witness. Also, even if jury questions did require the approval of the entire jury, my experience with how juries interact is that most juries would routinely approve almost every question of almost every individual juror anyway, so I don't know that it would make much of a difference."

So, if your hypothetical soldier asserts they had a reasonable apprehension that they would have immediately suffered serious bodily injury if they didn't reveal the intelligence, then they should not be convicted by a court-martial, unless the prosecution can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this was not the case (Rule 916 (b)(1))."
"If my electronic devices are searched, can a police officer use my ideas?","Mere ideas are not, as others have said, protected by copyright. However, the police officer in such a situation may have a duty of confidentiality, particularly if s/he is informed that the contents of the phone are confidential. For example the ""Officer's Code of Conduct"" of Canton Ohio, says: Whatever a Police Officer sees, hears or learns of that is of a confidential nature will be kept a secret unless the performance of duty or legal provision requires otherwise. Members of the public have a right to security and privacy, and information obtained about them must not be improperly divulged. Many police departments have similar codes of conduct or policies. Such a policy might apply in the circumstances described in the question. In this page on ""Confidential information"" posted by the TaylorWessing law firm, it is said that: There are three circumstances in which the disclosure of information gives rise to an obligation of confidence: The best way of ensuring that confidential information is recognised and treated as such is by contract. If no express requirement for confidentiality is imposed, the manner in which the discloser treats the information can be held as indicative of its level of confidentially. Talking about information in public places, for example, would cause the recipient to assume it was not confidential in nature. An action for breach of confidence is based on the conscience of the recipient who must have agreed or known that the information is confidential. Thus an action for breach of confidence can be brought against the original recipient of the information and any subsequent recipient who becomes aware of the fact that the information is confidential. An action for breach of confidence may be brought against a person who has used or disclosed, or threatened to use or disclose, confidential information without permission. A police officer engaged in a search of confidential documents, whether found on a phone, on a computer, or in a filing cabinet, is in a ""special relationship""  with the sub ject of the search, and the ""circumstances of disclosure"" are unusual. Use of such information for private, personal gain unrelated to any police function might be held to violate an implied duty of confidentiality, particularly if the officer is informed of the confidential nature of the documents. If the documents contain or constitute trade secrets, unauthorized use will give grounds for a lawsuit. This would not apply to proper use within a police investigation or criminal case, but it would apply to private use or disclosure by the officer. in ""Release of personal information to
police: your privacy rights"" from the Government of Ontario it is said that: Ontario public sector organizations, such as provincial ministries and agencies, municipalities, schools, and transit systems, are required by
law to protect your personal information and to follow certain rules when collecting, using, and disclosing your personal information. This document is primarily about when other governnment agencies can release personal information to law enforcement, but it might be taken to imply a similar obligation to respect privacy being imposed on law enforcement officers. In this page and other linked pages the UK metropolitian police indicate that they are subject to the Data Protection Act 2018 This is closely related to the GDPR. This restricts processing of personal data to lawful purposes. In the absence of the consent of the person searched, I doubt that use of information for personal gain having no connection with a police investigation would constitute a lawful purpose. I have not found an authoritative source, nor a court case, in which the situation described in the question, nor any closely similar situation, is addressed or decided."
Is it legal to publish a cease and desist letter that I have received?,"Is it legal to publish a cease and desist letter that I have received? Generally speaking, yes. My interpretation of your post is that you published your opinion about a business or businessperson, and the businessperson now is trying to intimidate you or deter you from sharing with others your opinion. The phrase ""the actionable statements listed are clearly statements of my opinion"" is otherwise unclear. Under defamation law, only false statements of fact are actionable whereas statements of opinion are not. The businessperson is not entitled to your silence. If your criticism is about the business, the cease and desist letter sounds in unfair and misleading practices to the extent that the business is trying to conceal from the public some inconvenient information that you as actual or potential customer possess. Even if you published as a competitor, your statements would have to be untrue and misleading for these to constitute disparagement. See the Black's Law Dictionary definition of disparagement [of Goods]. For the reasons stated in the other answer, copyright issues are not a matter of concern. It is preferable to publish the letter as is. Transparency preempts confusion as to ""I said, he said"". By contrast, paraphrasing the letter for the purpose of avoiding an imaginary violation of copyright creates a risk of you inadvertently giving him grounds for a claim of defamation."
What's the difference between a share and a stock?,"Short answer: There is no difference. Long answer: Come, ride with me through the veins of history. I'll show you a god who falls asleep on the job. (And how can we win, when fools can be kings? Don't waste your time or time will waste you.) The word 'company' (as in a corporation) is derived from the word 'company' (as in a group of people, like the Company of the Ring). The word 'corporation' reflects the fact that the organisation has an independent existence for legal purposes, that is, it metaphorically has a 'body' ('corpus') or has been 'incorporated'. (If you have ever wondered why corporate culture is so boring then consider the common etymology of the words 'corporation' and 'corpse'.) Before there were incorporated companies, there were 'joint stock companies'. The term 'joint stock' referred to the fact that members of the company (analogous to what we would today call shareholders) jointly held the 'stock' (as in 'inventory') of the company. This use of the term 'stock' to describe a type of company makes no sense in today's language, but originally the term was used to distinguish a 'joint stock company' from a guild (also known as a company) where the members each maintained their own inventory. For example, in the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers (the printers' guild in London, which managed censorship on behalf of the government in exchange for the right to suppress piracy), each printer had their own stock of paper and finished products; in contrast the Muscovy Company had a single stock of wool that it took over to Russia and a single stock of furs that it brought back to sell in London (the 'joint stock').  (The early joint stock companies were of course technically partnerships, which is why, in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, the definition of 'partnership' excludes a company and the definition of 'company' excludes a partnership, forming a neat circle which everybody ignores in practice because they want money. Incidentally, as you would imagine, a limited partnership, which may be incorporated, is a partnership rather than a company for tax purposes, unless it is a 'corporate limited partnership' in which case it is a company. But that is tax law, you must never go there Simba.) So anyway, back in the day, if you had put 10% of the capital into a joint stock company then you could be said to have a right to 10% of the 'stock' of the company. Over time, as the trade in interests in companies evolved, the term 'stock' came to refer to a member's rights in respect to the company, e.g. 'I own stock in the XYZ Company.' Since what you hold is a share in the stock of the company, it was said that the member held a 'share'.  Subject to company law and the company's constitution, etc, a company could split or merge shares. So, if you had 100 shares in the company, the company might split each share into 10 shares, giving you 1,000 shares.  Back before we had electronic computers and the Internet, keeping track of shares was a lot of work. If a person had 1,000 shares then you might have to move around 1,000 printed share certificates. Therefore the practice developed of converting a person's shares in a company into stock. Stock representing 1,000 shares could be documented as a single item instead of 1,000 items. (Of course, you could still sell one 1,000th of that stock if you wanted to.) Of course a shareholder could never convert their shares into stock. That would make no sense. Shares (or stock for that matter) do not exist outside of the records of the company. Therefore the company, or more precisely the directors on behalf of the company, must be the ones to convert shares into stock or vice versa. The terminology that developed, and which persists to this day outside of strict legal contexts, is: In Morrice v Aylmer (1875) LR 7 HL 717, the House of Lords confirmed that a bequest (in a will) of the deceased's 'shares' would imply a bequest of their 'stock'. So, even in a legal context, there's not much of a distinction. The one distinction of note is this: you cannot have partly-paid 'stock'. If shares are only partly-paid, then you have to keep track of them individually. You can't have the company converting a bunch of shares to stock, not distinguishing between which are paid up and by how much, and then converting them back into shares, with who-knows-what consequences (probably none to be frank, but we're talking about 19th-century information processing systems here). Therefore there was the rule that you can only convert shares to stock if they are fully paid-up. In Australia, in the 1995 draft of the Second Corporate Law Simplification Bill (written by the Attorney General's Department's 'Simplification Task Force') it was proposed to abolish 'stock' and force all Australian companies to convert stock into shares. This proposal became law in the Company Law Review Act 1998, and today is reflected in  section 254F of the Corporations Act 2001, which says that a company cannot issue stock or convert shares into stock.

"My bag falls off the overhead rack of a train onto the seat below. In case of damage or injury, who is liable and what to do?","It depends on whose (in)actions caused the damage. Perhaps passenger A was negligent in positioning their luggage in the overhead rack. Possibly passenger B was negligent in rearranging A's bag. Rail company C might be liable either because their engineer was driving recklessly, or because the luggage rack was foreseeably inadequate for securing the intended luggage (something with no edge). Then again, A might have put a too-large bag in the rack. The situation with airlines is similar, except that there are regulations requiring airlines to check the security of luggage and they have to check luggage (and warn passengers about shifting luggage). Failure to check the security of a compartment would be an inaction that can lead to liability."

Should I serve jury duty when I have no respect for the judge?,"If this judge is truly biased, won't the litigants be all the more glad to have a jury of their peers? You are proposing to abandon your duty to others. At trial you serve the community, not the judge. Back on scope for Law SE: If you refuse to serve on a jury, that could be a separate offense or general criminal contempt, for which you (this all depends on your jurisdiction) could get 30-90 days in jail. Edit: like several others have pointed out, I would not expect much trouble if you politely told the court that you felt you would be biased b/c of past connections. Even if the judge doesn't dismiss you, one of the litigants is likely to strike you. P.S. In most states, no one except a prosecutor (sometimes another state employee) can ""take someone"" to a criminal court. Individuals can only take someone to civil trial, where one cannot be sentenced, only ordered to pay a judgement."
Does ripping up the only signed contract form invalidate it?,"The contract remains valid. Most contracts don't need to be written at all. Even if yours did need to be written under the Statute of Frauds or some other law, you're saying that it was made in writing, even though you later tore it up. The fact that the contract is missing or destroyed doesn't change the fact that it exists and obligates the parties; it just makes it harder to prove what it said."
Why register a logo as trademark if copyright protects it?,"Copyrights protect the mark as is, and derivatives of it, but does not protect the brand from look a likes or from new trademarks that would be confusing. Consider the Pepsi logo:  I could easily draw a circle half red and half blue with a white line straight across, vertically, or diagonally. In fact:  © 2018 A. K. all rights reserved. There it is my new logo for my cola company called Hep-C (I'm raising awareness). Under copyright law Pepsi could not come after me because the logo is my own creation. I could even call it Pepsi and it would not be a copyright violation as you cannot copyright words. However, Pepsi has better lawyers than that and with my trademark so similar to theirs and the name sounding so similar (and my new name being potentially disparaging to Pepsi) it would likely confuse consumers between what was Pepsi and what was Hep-C thus under trademark law it would be disallowed for commerce. Now you would have common law trademark protection by virtue of using your mark in commerce, but it would only be for the states in which you used it. Additionally a lack of a registered trademark would disallow you from seeking statutory damages under 15 U.S.C. § 1117."
"In the US, why are companies giving big ""let go"" package to people they want to let go?","There are really about three tiers of employees for these purposes. Also, the reasons are a mix of legal and business considerations. At the bottom, severance payments can be made in lieu of unemployment insurance claims being made by the laid off employees. Severance payments for workers at the very bottom are often modest. At the top, ""golden parachutes"" are often written into the individually negotiated employment contracts of senior executives. Someone like a Steve Jobs will have negotiated a contract very favorable to him in the event of his termination with the board of directors when he is hired with attorneys on both sides heavily involved in its drafting. In between, one of the reasons is to get a waiver of claims, for example, due to allegations of employment discrimination, harassment, and past work place related injuries that weren't properly processed through the worker's compensation system, and to reaffirm the existence of non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disclosure, non-disparagement, and assignment of intellectual property rights of the terminated employees. Being able to ""dot i's and cross t's"" and definitively foreclose litigation from laid off employees also looks good to stockholders and prospective investors. If severance agreements cutting off liability and ruling out the possibility that sloppy paperwork could compromise the firm's intellectual property to be compromised by disgruntled former employees who no longer have a stake in the firm's well being were entered into, a larger layoff would often be followed by a stock price lag reflecting unknown contingent liabilities and intellectual property risks from former employees. Closing off residual liability is particularly important in firms with stock or stock option compensation for a large group of employees and for firms with defined benefit pension plans. But, it goes beyond that. There is also just a sense of moral obligation on the part of senior managers establishing the severance terms to good, loyal employees who are losing their jobs of often many years through no fault of their own. Most of those senior managers were once in the same position, worked with the employees who were laid off personally, and can related to their plight. In a publicly held firm, even for insider members of the board of directors, the shareholders are an impersonal abstraction, while the laid off employees are genuine people whom the executives implementing the plan know a sample of personally. Of course, institutionally, this economy wide practice of big businesses also helps to fend off pressures from governments to impose bigger severance payment requirements as a matter of law. Substantial severance payments also discourage unionization by the employees who aren't laid off since it makes the employer look trustworthy despite not having its feet held to the fire by the law or a union. Finally, it is a given that many of the laid off employees will land on their feet finding mid- to senior level jobs in the same industry or a related industry, or starting their own firms that may do business with the firm that laid them off, either as consultants providing institutional knowledge that was lost in the layoff to due carelessness, or as vendors or joint venture partners. A stingy severance package could sow ill will towards the former employer that could come back to bite that firm later, while a generous package will rarely leave significant ill will from the former employees who find new positions whom the firm will end up dealing with later on."
Can an employer fine an employee in Virginia?,"Not by payroll deduction, unless the agreement to do so was not a condition of employment While it is true (as Just a guy's answer notes) that under § 40.1-29(C) an employee may agree via ""written and signed authorization"" to an employer withholding money from paychecks, the agreement to do so must be voluntary and not a condition of employment/continued employment. § 40.1-29(D) of the Code of Virginia states: No employer shall require any employee, except executive personnel, to sign any contract or agreement which provides for the forfeiture of the employee's wages for time worked as a condition of employment or the continuance therein, except as otherwise provided by law. This does not mean that an employee who damages company property or otherwise negligently causes the company financial harm is not liable for such damages, though.  Damages to a vehicle or costs incurred for cleaning it might be possible damages.  ""Excessive tardiness and absences"" seems like it'd be difficult, but not impossible, to prove monetary damages for.  But to recover these damages against the employee's will, they'd have to file a lawsuit: they cannot simply deduct the damages from wages unless the employee voluntarily agrees to pay them that way (a blanket authorization as a condition of employment does not count). This article has some more information and a couple relevant examples (including one about vehicle damage)."
Why does the victim have to press charges?,"Criminal charges are filed and prosecuted by the government, on behalf of the public, and there is no requirement for approval or cooperation by the victim. As a policy matter, a DA may decide to not charge a person in case the victim is unwilling (though less so in cases of domestic violence), perhaps because of the widespread impression that the victim has to ""press charges"" (which indeed they would have to do in the case of private prosecution, which is no longer allowed in the US). The alleged victim's reddit exchanges on the topic are here. An uncooperative victim does not make a good witness, even if they are compelled to testify. The police statement that they cannot pursue an investigation should not be interpreted as a statement of law, it's probably a statement of policy and practicality. "
Is it legal to lie about an illegal requirement?,"Lying may be wrong, but it in the United States, it is generally not illegal. United States v. Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. 2537 (2012). For a lie to be illegal, it generally needs to fall into one of a few specific categories, usually involving either fraud or the frustration of legitimate government activities (as in perjury, falsification of records, or lying to a federal agent). In any of these cases, the First Amendment is generally going to prohibit any penalties unless the false statement is material, i.e., it had the potential to change the outcome of the event in which it was uttered. As you noted, it is generally illegal to discriminate against Asians, so I would expect a court to treat the tenant's ethnicity as immaterial and require the landlord to honor the rental contract. Of course, this assumes that the landlord is prohibited from disciminating against Asians, which is not always true. The Fair Housing Act has exemptions for (a) private clubs; (b) for buildings with four or fewer units, one of which the landlord occupies; (c) for single-family homes that the landlord is renting without the help of an agent; and (d) for religious organizations. In such a case, the landlord may be actually be permitted to disciminate against Asians, so the tenant's false statement about their ethnicity would become material the transaction, and a court may therefore permit the landlord to rescind the contract. (Note, though, that even though the FHA permits discrimination in those limited situations, it forbids advertising discriminatory preferences. The landlord's ""No Asians"" language is therefore illegal, whether it is communicated on a sign in the window or in a classified ad or by word of mouth.)"
Could there be consequences for Googling how to do something that is normally a crime?,"The Google search is not itself a crime or any other kind of offense. It could be used as circumstantial evidence that you did something intentionally or with pre-mediation, rather than accidentally, or not at all. If you can provide an alternative explanation for the search that is plausible, such as the one in the question, and there isn't a close proximity of time, a jury is unlikely to give the search much weight as circumstantial evidence. But ultimately, the weight to give any piece of evidence is for the jury to decide in the context of all of the evidence in the case combined."
Can an open source licence be revoked if it violates employer's IP?,"The Apache 2.0 license purports to be irrevocable, but it also presupposes that the supposed licensor has the right to grant permission to copy. In this case, that is untrue, so there never was a proper license and nothing to revoke (the copyright owner grants permission in the form of ""a license"" which is a legal abstraction, that normally is specified in the license document). An end-user snared by this illegal license might attempt to sue the author because of the legal screw-up but paragraph 9 says that the supposed licensor cannot be held liable. In this case, though, ""licensor"" is defined not as the person who hands you the license document, but as the copyright owner. So it's the employer who would be not liable under the terms of the document (but since the employer had nothing to do with the license, it's as though the license never existed). The end-user is a secondary infringer (the employee is the primary infringer, in illegally distributing the material). Under US law, that doesn't matter, the user is still liable. Under UK law, secondary infringement includes the element that you have to have reason to know that the copy is infringing, which in the scenario that you describe is not the case."
"In the US, is it legal to lie to a business such as a hotel to obtain a discount?","It is basically fraud, and there are two ways in which it could be illegal: it might be a crime, and you might get sued for doing it (you would not be fined or imprisoned, but you may have to compensate the hotel chain for their loss). Whether or not it is a crime depends on the jurisdiction. In Washington, there are very many laws against fraud such as RCW 9.38 (credit), RCW 9.45 (numerous things where a business defrauds others), RCW 9.60 (forgery) but none of them would apply to lying about a material fact to a business in order to get a discount. Texas likewise has a long section on criminal fraud. It is not clear from the wording whether a customer lying to a business (not involving forgery, vehicles, credit, or financial institutions) is covered. 32.42(b)(10) says A person commits an offense if in the course of business he
  intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence
  commits one or more of the following deceptive business
  practices... making a materially false or misleading statement of fact
  concerning the reason for, existence of, or amount of a price or price
  reduction The question of interpretation that this raises is whether a person who has said ""I'm over 70"" so that they can get a discount has made a statement ""concerning the reason for a price reduction"". The ordinary interpretation of ""concerning the reason for"" would be that it refers to explaining why or under what conditions a price reduction exists. For the moment, I am skeptical that this definition would include the case at hand, but that will require a search through case law and jury instructions. From the lawsuit angle, you would have knowingly made a false material statement in order to obtain a value, which is illegal, and they could sue you to recover the discount."
What law governs shopping carts?,"When Aldi came to australia, they introduced their coin-in-the-slot model. The previous norm was that the trolleys were just available and people returned them. Some other chains also introduced the coin model. AFAK, they have all been disabled by the store because trolleys with coins were far more likely not to be returned by the user than coins without. Because “F#@k you making me carry around a dollar coin. For a bloody dollar I’m not returning the damn thing, my time’s more valuable than that!”. But we’ll happily take the time to return the ones without coins because you respected us to do so and didn’t make it a commercial transaction. Take your bloody German cultural expectations back to Germany: if you want to operate here, you learn our culture. Well, I enjoyed that tangent. Back to the topic … The trolleys always belong to the store and are provided for the convenience of their customers. Whether you insert a coin or not doesn't change that - the coin is a deposit and since you get it back it doesn't count as consideration. The licence which you are using them under contains an implied term that you will use them only for so long as you are interacting with the store in some way. If your intention is to steal the trolly, that is to permanently appropriate it for your own use outside the implied terms of the licence, then you’ve committed the crime of theft and the tort of conversion. In new-south-wales at least, it doesn’t matter that you intend to return it at some future time when you make off with it (so permanently has a bit of an odd definition here)."
Would it be legal according to the laws of war if Ukrainian forces killed Putin in Moscow?,"Providing the attack was otherwise made in accordance with the rules of war, enemy civilian leaders who are directly responsible for the prosecution of the conflict (so, the Minister of Defence, yes, the Minister of Housing, no) are combatants under International Humanitarian Law."
What is the intent of Donald Trump's $200k bond?,"The Fulton County Superior Court's bond order is online here. It says with consent of counsel for the State of Georgia and for the Defendant, the Court hereby GRANTS and ORDERS that bond is set in this matter as follows. (Emphasis by me.) It ends with Consented to by: followed by the signatures of the District Attorney Fanni T. Willis as well as representatives for the defendant: Drew Findling, in what was probably one of the last legal services rendered to Trump in this case, Marissa Goldberg and Jennifer Little. The decision lists the various charges and their respective bond amounts as listed in another answer here, resulting in a total of $200,000, and then states: Defendant may post bond as cash, through commercial surety, or through the Fulton
County Jail 10% program. I read this thus: CNN provides more detail: The approval process The approval process for consent bond orders involves prosecutors with Willis’ office and defense lawyers meeting and agreeing on the terms of the order. They then share the agreed upon order electronically with court staff of the judge assigned to the case. The judge will look over the terms and if they agree with the framework, the judge will sign it and send the bond agreement to the clerk’s office before it is published publicly online. If either prosecutors or defense lawyers cannot agree on a bond, a bond hearing with the judge would be scheduled. CNN also states that Trump election attorney John Eastman, who also surrendered on Tuesday, went with the 10% option, as did Hall. Trump may have simply paid the bail in cash, avoiding additional fees. Considering this information, I assume the following regarding your actual question: Bottom line: The court did the usual thing, surely in part exactly to do that. It also imposed a few restrictions specific to the case, with the implicit threat to revoke bail. And I agree: The bail amount is an utterly ineffective flight deterrent for a defendant as resourceful as Trump. Setting bail is rather a ceremonial motion performed to create the appearance of a nominal procedure. By contrast, the restrictions regarding Trump's communication have teeth because violating them can get him in prison. Given Trump's refusal to let other people mediate his social media activity even as President, this will be hard for him, and my prediction is that conflict with the court over these provisions is likely."
Held indefinitely for contempt of court?,"Can the courts hold someone indefinitely for contempt of court? Yes. This is civil contempt which is imposed to compel compliance with a court order that the disobedient person has the ability to comply with, rather than criminal contempt which is limited to a set time period to punish disrespect for the Court in an instance that is over and complete. Often, it is eventually vacated on the grounds of futility (i.e. it is clear that further incarceration will not secure compliance) or mootness (e.g. when a witness refuses to testify in a trial and then the trial is completed). In the case of government officials who refuse to comply to an order directed to them in an official capacity, the government official can be released forthwith by resigning from their official post. Long periods of detention for civil contempt are most common for cases like this where someone refuses to provide the location of something of great value, or in asset protection trust type cases involving millions of dollars worth of assets where the detained person refuses to disclose hidden assets or to take the steps necessary to cause them to be turned over to a creditor or ex-spouse, and the Court has determined that the person detained is capable of doing so. Less often, it is done for quite a long time in cases involving national security secrets. Persons held in civil contempt also have fewer due process protections than persons charged with indirect criminal contempt which is just a procedurally unusual form of crime (direct criminal contempt is even more procedurally unusual and involves less due process, the person held in direct criminal contempt can be jailed or fined for a set period of time summarily by a judge without a hearing for disrespectful conduct in the judge's physical presence with only a brief few seconds opportunity to speak up for himself or herself without a right to counsel in response before being punished). When would this situation be considered 'cruel and unusual'
punishment? No. Cruel and unusual punishment applies to punishment for wrongdoing. Civil contempt isn't designed to punish wrongdoing. It is calculated to secure compliance going forward with a lawful court order with which the person incarcerated has the ability to comply. In a case of civil contempt, a fundamental principle is that the person detained, who has refused to comply with a court order that the person has the ability to comply with and does so without lawful justification, ""holds the key to the jail"" and can be released forthwith upon complying with the Court's order at any time."
Can a website incur liability for linking to a funding campaign for a lawsuit against it?,"The directors of a company have a fiduciary duty to act within the law for the benefit of their shareholders - not to their customers, not to the government, not to the environment and not to the public. A lawsuit against the company will incur financial loss irrespective of if it is won or lost. It is difficult to see how it is in the shareholder's interest for the company to be enabling the funding of a lawsuit against it."
Can a landlord fine me for a non-existent business being listed at my address on Google Maps,"Can a landlord dictate what I put online? No, unless the lease you signed has a provision to that effect. As for the underlying matter, the landlord has the burden of proof. A fictitious Google listing clearly falls short of proving that you are running a business at that address. Furthermore, any friend willing to perpetuate the joke(!) could reinstate the listing as soon as you remove it, thereby forcing the landlord back to the same laughable allegation that some listing online implies running an actual business there."
"Am I allowed to kill a person threatening me? CA, USA","I would just like to clarify, in addition to the other answers and what Dale M alluded to, one important detail: Unless you are carrying out the death penalty, no one under any circumstances is allowed to kill anyone else. What you are sometimes authorized to do, is to use deadly force.  There is an important distinction between the two. When using deadly force, you are using extreme force to stop someone doing something, which may result in getting that person killed, but killing isn't the point, stopping whatever he is doing is. If instead of a knife you had a gun on the train, you shot the guy in the face, his crime spree came to and end, yet he was still alive but unconscious, and you decided to ""finish the job"" and shoot him some more, you'd be going to prison. The language is important. Even if in self defense situations, if you say that you were shooting to kill, you're going to be in serious trouble, but if you say you were shooting to stop, you're in the clear."
"Does ""statistically significant"" have a specific legal meaning?","Therefore, my null hypothesis is that they have next to no knowledge of statistics and couldn’t tell a median from a mean on their best, let alone, their average day - mean, median, or mode. Courts turn to experts to fill in the gaps in their knowledge. If they are asking the wrong questions, then it is the expert’s job to, respectfully, tell them so and guide them to the right questions. However, you shouldn’t guess what the right question is. “Excuse me, your honour, the term “statistical significance” can’t be applied to a data set, only to the result of an a priori null-hypothesis tested against that data set.” Feel free to explain p hacking if necessary. Ask the judge to explain, in layman’s term, what they want from you. Feel free to admit that just like you don’t understand their legal jargon, you don’t expect them to understand your statistical jargon; if everyone speaks plain English, you can go and do your statistics thing and they can go and do their law-talking thing."

"Is it illegal to market a product as if it would protect against something, while never making explicit claims?","In the EU this could constitute a misleading advertisement under Article 3 of the Misleading and comparative advertising directive: In determining whether advertising is misleading, account shall be taken of all its features, and in particular of any information it contains concerning: (a) the characteristics of goods or services, such as their availability, nature, execution, composition, method and date of manufacture or provision, fitness for purpose, uses, quantity, specification, geographical or commercial origin or the results to be expected from their use, or the results and material features of tests or checks carried out on the goods or services; Of course, a judge will have to decide whether that particular phrasing constitutes ""information about the results to be expected from their use"", but there's a high chance they will. Note that it is sufficient for the results to be reasonably expected, not just ""explicitly stated"" or ""guaranteed""."
Can a judge suggest to the jury that a witness is lying?,"It is the jury's job to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses, and it is the judge's job to inform them of that responsbility. It is not appropriate, however, for the judge to indicate to the jury what answer they should come to on those questions. In Quercia v. United States, 289 U.S. 466 (1933), the defendant in a drug case took the stand to deny the charges. Before the jury went to deliberate, the judge made the following observation: I am going to tell you what I think of the defendant's testimony. You may have noticed, Mr. Foreman and gentlemen, that he wiped his hands during his testimony. It is rather a curious thing, but that is almost always an indication of lying. Why it should be so we don't know, but that is the fact. I think that every single word that man said, except when he agreed with the Government's testimony, was a lie. The jury convicted, but the U.S. Supreme Court reversed, holding that the instruction was an error. It said that the judge has the right, generally speaking, to comment on the evidence, but that right is not unlimited, because juries are likely to be swayed by the judge's assessments, even if he instructs them to make their own decisions: The influence of the trial judge on the jury is necessarily and properly of great weight and his lightest word or intimation is received with deference, and may prove controlling. This court has accordingly emphasized the duty of the trial judge to use great care that an expression of opinion upon the evidence should be so given as not to mislead, and especially that it should not be one-sided; that deductions and theories not warranted by the evidence should be studiously avoided. The comment you seem to be imagining is a closer call than this, but I think most judges would agree it would be inappropriate. At a preliminary hearing, though, where there is no jury, there is no real problem with the judge making that comment. If I were the defense attorney, I'd be glad he did, as it would help inform my decision about whether to pursue a jury trial or a bench trial."
Why are ink signatures considered trustworthy?,"TL;DR: You have to do something to accept a document; a signature is often used because it is simple and permanent; signature alone is often not enough (e.g. wills); claiming a false signature annuls the contract for both parties and you cannot keep the accrued benefits. Signing something means you accept it and it becomes legally binding. Many things can become binding without signature (including your usage of this website) and signatures alone are not considered trustworthy in many circumstances. Important documents (e.g. wills, marriages, real estate transactions) in many jurisdictions require a public official (notaries, marriage commissioners etc.) or a trustworthy person (lawyers, doctors, professional engineers, etc.), who will often require rigourous identification documents, and/or witnesses to be involved for the documents to be legally effective. Some high-value commercial transactions will also involve witnesses for signature, or require witnesses for executions of certain articles. Otherwise I can always claim that I didn't really sign that document when it becomes convenient for me. You can and people do. Then the parties go to court or other dispute resolution mechanism, and the judge will consider all relevant evidences to decide (often on a balance of probabilities, i.e. more likely than not) if you consented to a document. Particularly, ""when it becomes convenient for me"" is often after some elements of the contract having been executed, which is evidence in favour of the existence of the contract and nonexistence of a contract removes obligations and rights for both supposed parties, as such the executed part could be undone. If for a sales contract the other party has sent you a computer, you cannot claim that you did not sign that contract and keep the computer they sent. Without the contract, the computer is not rightfully yours. Also, claiming false statements for benefit or under oath is fraud/perjury and can be criminally prosecuted. So, why are they used everywhere? You have to do something to affirm your consent to a document.
It is symbolic but symbolic does not mean meaningless and a symbol of your consent is often desirable. A signature is simple and: which is enough for most purposes. As a bonus, it is also somewhat unique and can be compared to certain extent. For purposes demanding higher level of confidence, ID documents can be demanded and more complex procedures (e.g. with notaries and witnesses) can be undertaken."
Why does Disney omit the year in their copyright notices?,"For works released after 1989, Copyright notices don't have any legal consequences in the United States. They are just a friendly reminder of who created the work and that they take their copyrights seriously. But those notices are not required anymore to enforce your copyrights on the works you created. If you have proof that you own the copyright on something and when it was created, and if it's still within the term limits, then you can take legal actions against people who violate your copyright. Disney has a history of repeated worldwide lobbying for extending the expiration durations in copyright laws in order to avoid any of their classic cartoons from falling out of copyright protection. So it could be that they try to intentionally muddy the waters and make it harder to find out which of their works expire when. That way people are less sure about what Disney works are and are not in the public domain, making it more risky to use them. But that's just my theory."

Is the new Texas law on social media invalid on first amendment grounds?,"The government can't compel people to some sort of speech under the 1st amendment. Forcing a company to host people is compelled speech by the company. It is well established that the government can't compel a newspaper to host its messages as it wants. The key case might be Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo 418 US 241 (1974). In this case, it was deemed unconstitutional that a newspaper would need to host speech of a political candidate the newspaper didn't like in the same amount it had used to disparage that candidate. While the Miami Herald brought the newspaper into the line by the action of the newspaper, Wooley v. Maynard 430 U.S. 705 (1977) held that the state could not force any citizen to host its motto. Or for the matter, any message. The State may not constitutionally require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an ideological message by displaying it on his private property in a manner and for the express purpose that it be observed and read by the public. Pp. 71717. Forcing a public web page to host advertisement or speech from any government - or under the threat of the government action - is compelled speech and violates the rulings of Miami Herald, Wooley and other cases. However, there is a little light for the government under PruneYard, Turner Broadcasting and Rumsfeld. However, all of them don't cut here: Turner Broadcasting was about a service provider for radio that did not host its own speech. PruneYard is a shopping center that doesn't host its own speech and is only useful in California as there is a California constitution issue. And Rumsfeld dealt with military recruitment, which always is special. A similar Florida law was deemed to be very likely unconstitutional by the (federal) Northern District of Florida (Injunction Text) A joint lawsuit by NetChoice & CCIA was filed against Texas on 22nd September 2021 (Complaint), asking for a preliminary injunction. NetChoice puts its filings on their website. Indeed, the relevant parts of HB20 were put out of enforcement via  injunction on December 1st, 2021, reasoning that: Social media platforms have a First Amendment right to moderate content disseminated on
their platforms. See Manhattan Cmty. Access Corp. v. Halleck, 139 S. Ct. 1921, 1932 (2019) (recognizing
that “certain private entities[] have rights to exercise editorial control over speech and speakers on
their properties or platforms”). Three Supreme Court cases provide guidance. First in Tornillo, the
Court struck down a Florida statute that required newspapers to print a candidate’s reply if a
13
newspaper assailed her character or official record, a “right of reply” statute. 418 U.S. at 243. [...] In Hurley v. Irish-Am. Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Grp. of Bos., the Supreme Court held that a
private parade association had the right to exclude a gay rights group from having their own float in
their planned parade without being compelled by a state statute to do otherwise. 515 U.S. 557, 572–
73 (1995). [...] Finally, the Supreme Court ruled that California could not require a private utility company
to include a third party’s newsletters when it sent bills to customers in Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Pub.
Utilities Comm’n of California, 475 U.S. 1, 20–21 (1986). HB 20 compels social media platforms to
significantly alter and distort their products. Moreover, “the targets of the statutes at issue are the
editorial judgments themselves” and the “announced purpose of balancing the discussion—reining
in the ideology of the large social-media providers—is precisely the kind of state action held
unconstitutional in Tornillo, Hurley, and PG&E.” Id. HB 20 also impermissibly burdens social media
platforms’ own speech. Id. at *9 (“[T]he statutes compel the platforms to change their own speech in
other respects, including, for example, by dictating how the platforms may arrange speech on their
sites.”). For example, if a platform appends its own speech to label a post as misinformation, the
platform may be discriminating against that user’s viewpoint by adding its own disclaimer. HB 20
restricts social media platforms’ First Amendment right to engage in expression when they disagree
with or object to content. For these reasons, IT IS ORDERED that the State’ s motion to dismiss, (Dkt. 23), is
DENIED. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, (Dkt.
12), is GRANTED. Until the Court enters judgment in this case, the Texas Attorney General is
ENJOINED from enforcing Section 2 and Section 7 of HB 20 against Plaintiffs and their
members. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), Plaintiffs are required to post a
$1,000.00 bond. IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ motion to strike, (Dkt. 43), is DISMISSED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE AS MOOT."
How can the UK government fine itself?,"Expanding on @Rick's answer, the UK government does not hold all of its money in an undifferentiated general fund (although much of it is held that way). In non-profits and government, one generally uses ""fund accounting"", in which particular pots of money can only be used for particular purposes and the government keeps track of how much money is held in each fund. In this case, credit in a fund for cabinet operations would be transferred to a fund for privacy violation fines whose disposition would be set forth either  in the Data Protection Act (2018) itself, or in some other piece of legislation (perhaps statutes on court administration) setting forth how funds collected as fines are used. This said, the intuition of the question isn't wrong. When one part of the government fines another part of the government, especially if the fine has the impact of preventing the fined part of the government from carrying on necessary governmental operations, the economic effort of the fine can be swiftly wiped out in the next annual appropriations bill, or in an interim emergency appropriations bill, if necessary. And, if the individual offenders who committed the violations aren't penalized, this may not be a very effective incentive to bring about compliance with the law. Of course, even if the economic incentive that the fine creates to comply is negligible, this doesn't mean that the symbolic and political cost of holding a government agency accountable in the same way that a private firm would be held accountable, that indicates the magnitude of the wrong done, is meaningless for the politicians running that agency."
"Can a US President, after impeachment and removal, be re-elected or re-appointed?","Impeachment of a president does not on conviction automatically disqualify the convicted party from becoming president again.  However, after conviction, the Senate can vote to add to the punishment of removal from office ""disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.""  This requires only a simple majority vote. Does impeachment by the House of Representatives, with or without subsequent removal from office by the Senate, actually disqualify one from being re-elected to the same Presidential office? See above.  It requires impeachment by the House, conviction by the Senate, and a separate vote by the Senate to impose the punishment of disqualification. It's conceivable that the Senate could disqualify the convicted party only from becoming president, though it looks like in the two prior instances where this punishment was imposed it was the broader disqualification.  But if a person disqualified only from being president is in an office that would normally be in the line of succession, that person is simply omitted from the line of succession.  This happens routinely with naturalized citizens, and there's no reason to think it would be any different for a former president who had been disqualified only from the office of the president after being convicted on articles of impeachment."
ISP is not hashing the password I log in with online. Should I take any action?,"The GDPR does indeed require that the password be stored ""securely"". It does not specify the technology which must be used for that purpose. Hashing the PW is a common method, and should be sufficient if properly implemented (strong hash function, use of salt, etc).  But other methods of securing the password might be sufficient. Encrypting the PW rather than hashing it, so that an authorized person could decrypt it temporarily might be OK. Or perhaps a security app can separately retrieve only the specified characters of the PW through some sort of encryption. Or perhaps the ISP is not using proper security. In the case of Knuddles in the linked news story, an actual breach occurred which led to the poor security being reported.  You could send a report to the appropriate national Data Protection Authority."
"What does ""corruption of blood"" mean?","In English law during the late Medieval and early modern period (from 1321 to 1798), it was possible for Parliament to pass a ""Bill Of Attainder"". This declared a person guilty of a crime, often treason, by legislative act, without any trial or other legal process. See the Wikipedia article for more detail. Often a Bill of Attainder not only decreed that a person (or people) was guilty, but also confiscated the convicted person's property, preventing his (or rarely her) heirs from  inheriting, and possibly rendering those heirs ineligible to hold public offices or peerages. The heir would also be prevented from inheriting through the attainted person. For example, property held by the father of the attainted person would not pass to the child of the attainted person.  This was called ""corruption of the blood"", and was viewed with particular horror by many during the  colonial period and before. It effectivly treated the heirs of the attainted person as illegitimate. Attainder was usually followed by execution, possibly by torture. The bill might specify the specific fate of the person attained. The US constitutional provision prohibits declaring people guilty of crimes by legislative act, and prohibits sentences for crimes that take property or rights from the family or heirs of the convicted person, even in cases of treason. At least that is how it has been interpreted. Fines may be levied, but may only fall on the actual property of the person convicted.  The US Supreme Court has dealt with this clause in several cases:"
Presidential line of succession and age,"This is an interesting question. The relevant provision seems to be subsection (b) of the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 (codified at 3 USC 19. That subsection provides that: (b) If, at the time when under subsection (a) of this section a Speaker is to begin the discharge of the powers and duties of the office of President, there is no Speaker, or the Speaker fails to qualify as Acting President, then the President pro tempore of the Senate shall, upon his resignation as President pro tempore and as Senator, act as President. Thus a Speaker would not become acting President unless the Speaker ""qualifies"". I believe this would include fulfilling all the requirements for a President, including the minimum age, and the requirement that the President be a ""natural born citizen"". Subsection (d)(1) further provides that: If, by reason of death, resignation, removal from office, inability, or failure to qualify, there is no President pro tempore to act as President under subsection (b) of this section, then the officer of the United States who is highest on the following list, and who is not under disability to discharge the powers and duties of the office of President shall act as President: Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Secretary of Transportation, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of Education, Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Secretary of Homeland Security. The Act has never been invoked, nor have either of the two prior Presidential Succession Acts, so there is no case law or precedent available. The Wikipedia article on the Act describes the history of all three versions, and the times when an invocation might have occurred. The Wikipedia article quotes a statement by Judge M. Miller Baker made during a September 2003 joint hearing before the U.S. Senate's Committee on Rules and Administration and Committee on the Judiciary. This statement argues that the Act as currently written is unconstitutional. The statement reads: The 1947 Act is probably unconstitutional because it appears that the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate are not ""Officers"" eligible to act as President within the meaning of the Succession Clause. This is because in referring to an ""Officer"", the Succession Clause, taken in its context in Section 1 of Article II, probably refers to an ""Officer of the United States"", a term of art under the Constitution, rather than any officer, which would include legislative and state officers referred to in the Constitution (e.g., the reference to state militia officers found in Article I, Section 8). In the very next section of Article II, the President is empowered to ""require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments"" and to appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, ""Officers of the United States"". These are the ""Officers"" to whom the Succession Clause probably refers. This contextual reading is confirmed by Madison's notes from the Constitutional Convention, which reveal that the Convention's Committee of Style, which had no authority to make substantive changes, substituted ""Officer"" in the Succession Clause in place of ""Officer of the United States"", probably because the Committee considered the full phrase redundant.[1] Since the Act has never been invoked, this contention has never been tested in a court. Given the 25th Amendment's provisions for filling a vacancy in the office of Vice-President, the likelihood of the act ever being invoked is much reduced.

Is it illegal to throw away the previous tenant's mail?,"Do not throw away mail that is not addressed to you.

Accessing public CCTV footage about you,"You have a right to access per Art 15 GDPR. You can make a request to the data controller (the person managing those cameras) free of charge. In your request, you should mention the approximate time periods during which you might appear, and you should make it possible to identify you in the footage. The data controller has one month to respond.
The response should include the following items: If the data controller denies your request, they should describe their reasons for doing so. Here, they could at most argue that your request was excessively broad (cf. Art 12(5) GDPR). In principle, they could also argue that your right to access is restricted by an exemption in Schedule 1 Part 2 of the Data Protection Act 2018, however none of those will fit. The data controller cannot deny your request with the argument that the CCTV surveillance is a “purely personal or household activity” (Art 2(2)(c) GDPR) since the cameras seem to cover a public space. The ICO also writes: If your CCTV captures images beyond your property boundary, such as your neighbours’ property or public streets and footpaths, then your use of the system is subject to the data protection laws. If the data controller has no footage (because the cameras are dummies, are switched off, don't make persistent recordings, or footage was deleted prior to your request) then of course you can't get a copy of your data. The other elements of the response should still be provided, in particular an explanation of the purpose of processing and the retention periods. If you are not satisfied with the data controller's response to your request, you have the following remedies: It is possible that the CCTV cameras as currently set up are actually unlawful. A basic GDPR principle (Art 5(1)(b)) is that data shall be collected only for “specified, explicit and legitimate purposes”. If there is no pressing purpose for using the camera, it violates the GDPR. In particular, cameras that are directed away from the controller's property and primarily cover a public space are unlikely to serve a legitimate purpose. Additionally, the GDPR requires all such collection to be transparent. As soon as public spaces are involved, there must be a privacy notice per Art 13 GDPR. The ICO asks controllers to Let people know you are using CCTV by putting up signs saying that recording is taking place, and why. A great resource in this context is the Fairhurst v Woodard case from 2021. A neighbour had mounted multiple cameras, all of which were covering public spaces to some degree. The neigbour claimed that some of these cameras were dummies. The court considered the lawfulness of each camera separately. While a Ring doorbell camera that primarily covered the owner's property but would also incidentally record passer-bys was considered legitimate, a camera that was primarily directed at a public space or other homes was not."
When is ignorance a legal defense?,"In general, ignorance of a law is an excuse only when the law specifically says it is. There are extreme cases where a law has been found invalid because it did not give people enough notice. Actually, only one case I know of -- Lambert v. California, 355 U.S. 225 (1957). The city of Los Angeles passed a law making it illegal for anyone who had ever been convicted of a felony to remain in the city for five days without registering as a felon. Lambert was arrested on suspicion of doing something else, but convicted for being an unregistered felon. The Supreme Court held that it was a violation of Lambert's due process rights to convict her of a crime she had no way of knowing about, or even suspecting. This is a very rare, extreme case, and does not apply to things where people might be expected to suspect that there might be a law. Otherwise, notice of a law is only required if the statute says so; for example, if a speed limit law requires the posting of signs, but the signs aren't posted, the law may not be in effect. However, ignorance still isn't an excuse--if the sign is posted, but you just didn't notice it, you're still on the hook."
Can a prosecutor hold back charges so they can try again?,"united-states For a particular sovereign in the United States, the criminal law test for this is from Blockburger v. United States (emphasis mine) 12
Each of the offenses created requires proof of a different element. The applicable rule is that, where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not. Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S. 338, 342, 31 S. Ct. 421, 55 L. Ed. 489, and authorities cited. In that case this court quoted from and adopted the language of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in Morey v. Commonwealth, 108 Mass. 433: 'A single act may be an offense against two statutes; and if each statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not, an acquittal or conviction under either statute does not exempt the defendant from prosecution and punishment under the other.' Compare Albrecht v. United States, 273 U. S. 1, 11, 12, 47 S. Ct. 250, 71 L. Ed. 505, and cases there cited. Applying the test, we must conclude that here, although both sections were violated by the one sale, two offenses were committed. What this says in more plain language is that a person can be prosecuted under two different statutes for the same logical act as long as there is at least one fact that has to be proven for each count which doesn't have to be proven for the other count. This does mean, for example, that a person could not be prosecuted for aggravated assault, acquitted and then later prosecuted for simple assault on the same facts if there aren't any facts required for simple assault that aren't required for aggravated assault. For the example in the question, this does seem to mean that if, for example, a robber was first prosecuted for murder, and then later separately prosecuted for carjacking after the murder, this would not be double jeopardy.  I would guess in practice that courts wouldn't appreciate this kind of game-playing since it wastes the court's time as well to adjudicate two trials when there could just be one, but I don't know if there's a hard rule against it.  Blockburger was actually arguing that multiple convictions from one trial should be overturned because some of them relied on the same facts as another.  In this case SCOTUS ruled against Blockburger, but on the basis that the facts did not overlap, not that the legal basis of the argument was unsound. I noted in the beginning that this applies to particular sovereigns, which in terms of US law means either a state or the US Federal Government.  Under the dual sovereignty doctrine (e.g. Gamble v United States), if the same set of facts of a case constitute both a state crime and a federal crime, or the also likely case that a federal crime requires all the facts of a state crime plus a few more, both the relevant state government and the Federal government can prosecute the person under their own statutes.  This would technically also apply if two states wanted to prosecute someone, although it's unlikely that there is any way to have the exact same set of facts break two different state's laws since state laws generally can only cover actions taken inside the state or affecting that state in particular."
Can a significant change in incentives void an employment contract?,"Can a significant change in incentives void an employment contract? Yes, because a party's unilateral, significant imposition which the counterparty did not expect strikes the premise of a contract/agreement being entered knowingly and willfully. Here, the contract or relevant portion thereof is voidable by the employee, because the employer's belated imposition is tantamount to a misrepresentation as contemplated in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts at § 164(1). The contract clause regarding an employee's off-work hours might be unenforceable as unconscionable, more so where the incentive being slashed represents a significant portion of an employee's income (since it reflects that the employee's salary is not that high so start with). See the Restatement at § 177, 178, and 208. is the employee entitled to any compensation or the right to retain
  the property? Yes, but the applicable alternative --compensation vs. withholding the IP-- depends on what agreement the employee reaches with the employer. I presume what prompts this part of your question is the mention --in the Workplace SE post-- that the engineer rejected the employer's bid (offer is somewhat of a misnomer) of $25,000 for the employee's off-work IP. The engineer's reluctance is rightfully cautious. Prior to accepting the employer's proposal, it is in the engineer's best interest to ensure (with enough specificity in a new contract) the terms and conditions of that proposal, lest the employer subsequently argue that the payment of $25,000 encompassed any and all subsequent IP produced by the employee during his employment there. Likewise, insufficient caution by the engineer regarding the aforementioned proposal may permit a finding that the parties' subsequent conduct reflects the engineer's acceptance of the new conditions (including the slashing of incentives)."
Are jurors allowed to teach law to one another?,"I finally found the actual transcript of the voir dire part of the case mentioned in the question. http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=2012090614295190 As can be evidenced from the transcript, the judge has specifically instructed the two jurors working as engineers at the local tech companies that they'd have to ""forget"" what they know about both the software engineering and the patent law itself, too, starting their work on the whole case with a completely clean sheet, using a very simple criteria for making decisions: One side or the other is going to have the burden of proof on -- one side has the burden of proof on some issues, the other side has the burden of proof on other issues. When you go into the jury room to deliberate after you've tried your hardest to understand the evidence, if they haven't educated you on it or if they haven't persuaded you, the party with the burden of proof loses. It's that simple. You don't have to -- you have to make a good faith effort to understand it, but if the party with the burden of proof has failed to do that, the party with the burden of proof loses. That's the standard. You have to -- you, the jury, decide. Now, what you cannot do is bring to bear something that you've learned in some other case, some other patent case, about how some piece of equipment works or something like that. You can't do that. It has to be based on the record here. Then, after a short break and a consultation with the lawyers, where Oracle seems to have expressed some concern to having the computer experts be on the panel, which subsequently prompted the judge to declare the following to the two potential jurors who worked at Cisco and HP: So this is really going to be directed at both of you, but, you know, you come to the party, so to speak, with some prior training that bears upon the subject matter we're going to be hearing a lot about here. That's okay. That's not disqualifying, but you -- it's okay to use your common sense when you render a verdict, but you cannot add to the record in court something that you know about the way software programming works that the witnesses didn't actually testify to. You see what I'm saying? You've got to decide the record -- the case based on the record made here as opposed to adding into it what else you may have known about the way programming and software works. Since both jurors had so much software and patent experience that they couldn't disregard it easily, they were thus both excused (page 95 of 224). All right. I think it would be too hard
for you to sit in this case and sort out what you knew already
against what is proven or not proven here, and itwould not be
fair to the parties to have that extra burden even though you
two actually know something about the subject. It's in a way
too bad, but it's for the best. So you two are excused to go
back to the jury assembly room. Thank you. The other instructions that the judge gives to the potential jurors is also worth reading (starts on page 36 of 224) The full transcript is at http://www.groklaw.net/pdf3/OraGoogle-942.pdf. In summary -- jurors are only allowed to talk to one another when the deliberation process starts, and, no, they are not allowed to bring any ""baggage"" to the case at stake."

According to testimony presented during the trial, from both Rittenhouse and Ryan Balch, Rosenbaum had told their group that “If I catch any of you fuckers alone, I’m going to fucking kill you.” Given that Rosenbaum had ""spent most of his adult life in prison starting at age 18 for sexual conduct with five preteen boys"" (in the NPR article), was straight out of mental hospital and was (from both earlier video and other testimony) acting in a psychotic manner earlier in the evening, including using the N-word at black protesters, while ostensibly protesting racism, the jury believed that he was disturbed enough to have made such a threat. Rittenhouse was running away from an older, bigger, and stronger man who had made an explicit threat to kill him in that exact scenario (alone), was chasing him in an apparent attempt to make good on his threat, did not stop chasing him even when Rittenhouse pointed an AR-15 at him and tried to run away some more, and only shot at literally the last second when Rosenbaum had caught up, had his hand on the gun and Rittenhouse could not run away any more. The above is sufficient for self defense, but in terms of specific crimes: making death threats, assault and apparent attempted murder."
Is there any specific law outlawing private nuclear weapons?,"In Germany, nuclear weapons are considered weapons of war, which are heavily regulated. In particular, under § 17 KrWaffKontrG, it is prohibited to develop or produce nuclear weapons or trade in them or acquire them from or leave them to another person or import or export them or transport them through the territory of the Federal Republic or in any other way take them into or out of the territory of the Federal Republic or in any other way exercise the actual control over them (my translation). Exceptions apply only to nuclear weapons controlled by the governments of NATO members, not to individuals. If you happen to come into the possession of a nuclear weapon without breaking the law yourself (e.g. if you inherit it from someone who illegally built it), it can and certainly will be confiscated under § 24 KrWaffKontrG."
Why is drunk driving causing accident punished so much worse than just drunk driving?,"You have raised the issue of moral luck, a long recognized problem in criminal theory. The classic expositions of this issue are by Thomas Nagel, in his chapter, ""Moral Luck"" (1979) and Bernard Williams, ""Moral Luck"" (1976). Specifically, you are describing what they call outcome luck, or consequential luck. Driving while intoxicated vs. driving while intoxicated and causing death is not the only example where moral luck results in a distinction in punishment. Other examples are: Nagel writes: If someone has had too
much to drink and his car swerves on to the sidewalk, he can count himself morally lucky if there are no pedestrians in its path. If there were, he would
be to blame for their deaths, and would probably be prosecuted for
manslaughter. But if he hurts no one, although his recklessness is exactly the
same, he is guilty of a far less serious legal offence and will certainly reproach
himself and be reproached by others much less severely. To take another legal
example, the penalty for attempted murder is less than that for successful
murder – however similar the intentions and motives of the assailant may be
in the two cases. His degree of culpability can depend, it would seem, on
whether the victim happened to be wearing a bullet-proof vest, or whether a
bird flew into the path of the bullet – matters beyond his control. ... ... How is it possible to be more or less culpable depending
on whether a child gets into the path of one’s car, or a bird into the path of
one’s bullet? Perhaps it is true that what is done depends on more than the
agent’s state of mind or intention. The problem then is, why is it not irrational to base moral assessment on what people do, in this broad sense? It
amounts to holding them responsible for the contributions of fate as well as
for their own – provided they have made some contribution to begin with. ... If the object of moral judgment is the person, then to hold him accountable for what he has done in the broader sense is akin to strict liability, which may have its legal uses but seems irrational as a moral position. Two considerations often raised as justification for differential treatment based on outcome are (David Enoch & Andrei Marmor, ""The Case against Moral Luck"", 26 LAW & PHIL. 405 (2007), pp. 415–17) A couple of quotes from Enoch and Marmor: All other things being equal, the occurrence of an accident is plausibly considered as at least some prima facie evidence for recklessness, or indeed for a higher
degree of recklessness. A conception of fairness that requires
agents to internalize the costs of their risky activities does not
necessarily reflect a view of responsibility or blameworthiness.
It may simply reflect a judgment about the appropriate distribution of the costs of risky activities."
"What are the actions a resident should take against police remaining, with no warrant, on residential property after being repeatedly asked to leave?","Yes, your best bet for immediate relief is to call 911 and ask for a supervisor. Generally speaking the police are not legally obliged to explain themselves to you on the spot. They are obliged to explain themselves to the courts and their supervisors."
Is there a law against destroying works of art of historic importance when you are the owner?,"In general, ownership of a thing includes the property right to dispose of or destroy the thing. However, there may be statutory prohibitions for special categories of property. Many countries have entered into treaties that obligate them to identify, protect, and conserve for future generations the cultural heritage in its territory. This includes ""architectural works, works of monumental sculpture and painting."" See e.g. Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. How this protection is realized is dependent on the nation's domestic implementation. For one example of a protection regime, see british-columbia. When a work has been designated as a ""Provincial heritage object"" on the Provincial heritage register (Heritage Conservation Act, s. 3(1)), the owner is prohibited from damaging, desecrating, or altering that work without a permit (s. 12.1(2)(a)). There is also a complex web of import and export restrictions relating to objects that a country has identified as cultural heritage. Many countries make it an offence to import an item from another country that has identified the object as cultural heritage without an export permit from that other country. That export permit will often not be provided to an entity without demonstrated capacity to preserve the cultural property. The permit can also subject to conditions (presumably, at least to not destroy the thing). See generally ""Guide to Exporting Cultural Property from Canada,"" ""Cultural property export permits."" I am not familiar with the United States' implementation, but it is a party to the World Heritage Convention and has passed various statutes dealing relating to the protection of cultural moveable property."
Lawyer says bumping software’s minor version would cost $2k to “refile” copyright paperwork. Is this typical?,"I won't reiterate the points already made in David Siegel's and ohwilleke's fine answers about whether paying $2000 to a lawyer for copyright registration (or even filing a copyright registration for your software in the first place) is reasonable, and just assume that you've determined that it is (or, perhaps, have managed to find someone to do it for a more reasonable sum).  Instead I'll just focus on your question about whether it's necessary to refile the registration every time the minor version number changes. The obvious answer to that, of course, is that it isn't — there's nothing magical about that particular number in the version string, and copyright law doesn't know or care anything about version numbers. However, given that you say that your software's ""major"" version number is ""pretty locked in"" and rarely if ever changes, a change to the next component (i.e. the ""minor"" version number) presumably represents some kind of a significant milestone in the development of the software.  Certainly it's a bigger milestone that changes to the last two numbers in the version string, which might well happen several times a day, whereas you're probably only changing the minor version number maybe a couple of times a year.  You even say yourself that a change in the minor version number often represents the addition of significant new features to the software. As such, if you're going to be updating your copyright registration regularly, that indeed seems like a reasonable time to do it.  Of course, it's not the only possible choice — for example, you could decide to register the latest version of your software, whatever it happens to be, once a year on some particular date. Would that make more sense than refiling the registration for every minor version?  Maybe.  At least it would decouple the copyright registration from the release process and make the annual cost of registration predictable, which could be useful if you're releasing many minor versions each year and you're worried about the cost.  Of course, as noted in the other answers, in that case you might want to look into other ways to reduce the cost first. In any case, having the copyright registration be slightly out of date compared to your release schedule shouldn't be a problem.  (And, if it was a problem, you'd have to also update the registration for every patch version you release!)  Unless you somehow regularly throw all your old code away and rewrite your whole software from scratch (which would, at a minimum, probably merit a major version number change!), each version of your software will be a derivative of the previous versions and will likely share more than 90% of its code with them. Thus, if someone were to pirate the latest version of your software, while you only had your copyright registered for an earlier version, you could almost certainly still sue them for infringing your registered copyright on the earlier version, noting that the pirated version was clearly a derivative of and in substantial parts identical to the registered version. (And of course, as already noted in the comments, copyright is automatic under the Berne Convention and not dependent on registration, although in certain jurisdictions — such as, notably, the United States — registration may be advantageous and even required for certain purposes such as claiming statutory damages.)"
"If a law is new but its interpretation is vague, can the courts directly ask the drafters the intent and official interpretation of their law?","No. Under U.S. Jurisprudence, any vagueness in a criminal law must be given an interpretation favorable to the people, rather than the government, since the government had the opportunity to make their intentions clear when drafting the law.   Additionally, the U.S. Constitution has what is called the ""Vagueness Doctrine"" which renders vague laws at any level of government to be unenforceable (Found in the 5th and 14th Amendment as an interpretation of the Due Process clauses). The quickest way to overturn the court's ruling is for a legislature to pass an amended law that defines the vague terms in terms that are better understood and can give the courts a proper interpretation of what should happen, however, no one who was charged under the law can be recharged under the new definition."
Can the President of the United States pardon proactively?,"Yes. The precedent is President Gerald Ford's pardon of his predecessor Richard Nixon in proclamation 4311 before any possible prosecution had started.
The pardon was granted specifically to prevent the disturbance of ""the tranquility to which the nation has
been restored"" by ""the prospects of bringing to trial a former President of the United States"" (emphasis mine). It is noteworthy though that a pardon can be rejected by the recipient, and that there may be good reason to
do so, because accepting one is an admission of guilt.1 In the words of the Supreme Court
(Burdick v. United States, 236 U.S. 79 (1915): There are substantial differences between legislative immunity and a pardon;
the latter carries an imputation of guilt and acceptance of a confession
of it [...]. (Again, emphasis mine.) Proactively pardoning large swathes of current and former government officials, family members and other people connected to the Trump administration would therefore be a double-edged sword: It surely may save a lot of the money and headache coming with being the target of an (even unsuccessful!) investigation; but it may also amount to admitting that the Trump administration was essentially  a criminal organization. 1  As always, things are a bit less clear-cut when one takes a closer look. Because I googled ""prospective pardon"" after the correct remark by JBentley I stumbled upon the entirely relevant and eminently readable Congressional Research Service reports on pardons. The first one is a ""pardons FAQ"", the second one is a more thorough legal exploration of what pardons actually do. The bottom line is that the Supreme Court and Federal Courts have edged away from a 19th century opinion (Ex parte Garland, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333, 380-81 (1866)) which viewed a pardon as an all-encompassing expungement. Newer decisions (prominently, Burdick v. United States, 236 U.S. 79, 86 (1915) which I quoted) don't."
Why do some licenses have a clause stating that one can't violate the law?,"(Necessarily). Were you to use the model to 3D-print a gun and rob banks with it, without this clause, you have not broken the contract. That would mean that the provider could neither sue you for any damages the use of their model in your crime spree might have caused them, nor can they legally terminate the licence with you."
Do these NY old dumb laws actually exist?,"This is a mixed bag of so-called ""laws"", often interpreted in an unfavorable or satirical light. Because of this, you might say that none (save one) of these laws are literally laws, but they are the effects of laws that do exist. I'll do my best to sort this out. A fine of $25 can be levied for flirting. Almost certainly an anti-prostitution law taken to the extreme. I only found one example of a bill, but it failed, and was only tangentially related. It's not hard to imagine that at some point, flirting was technically illegal. A license must be purchased before hanging clothes on a clothesline. This is most likely a satire of the actual law, which probably states that you cannot hang anything out your window or in your yard without a permit. Many cities and states have rules about what you can, and can't, put on your property. These are usually related to health and/or aesthetics. Carmel: A man can't go outside while wearing a jacket and pants that do not match. It's too hard to track this one down right now, but that sounds like a satire of something like a specific situation where a person must be wearing specific clothing. For example, I would imagine a firefighter or school crossing guard having these requirements for safety reasons. Citizens may not greet each other by ""putting one's thumb to the nose and wiggling the fingers"". Edited for clarity While we do have the First Amendment right to Free Speech, it is sometimes recognized in jurisdictions that certain actions and phrases may pass the ""imminent lawless action"" exception. It is likely some kind of ordinance that prohibits being unnecessarily rude to the point where the offender may end up being assaulted or worse as a result of the gesture. This gesture was known as early as Shakespeare, with the ""I thumb my nose at thee"" line, also known as the ""cock-a-snook"" gesture in some regions. Of course, the actual law is probably much more nuanced than that, and this is just a funny way of reducing this law down to the most absurd example that someone could think of. Thanks to some comments, I just realized that this is very likely § 240.20 Disorderly conduct. A person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause
public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk
thereof: ... ... Several states have some sort of statute like this that are technically First Amendment Free Speech violations, yet generally recognized by those jurisdictions as having legal force, since the purpose is to discourage violence that can be caused by ""fighting words."" Donkeys are not allowed to sleep in bathtubs in Brooklyn, N.Y. This is likely a structural integrity joke that doesn't hold up well (sorry, couldn't resist). Floors only have limited strength. If you look up the weight of a cast-iron bathtub and the maximum weight of a full-grown donkey, you'll find it weighs just less than a ton (about 1,800 pounds, assuming a heavy tub and large donkey). Someone probably saw a law about the maximum weight you can put on a floor, then looked up how much things weigh, and the joke practically writes itself. During a concert, it is illegal to eat peanuts and walk backwards on the sidewalks. Again, this is probably taken out of context, but I presume that someone was doing something stupid and got hurt or killed, so a law was written about not walking on the sidewalk without paying attention to where you were walking. For example, if a sidewalk had a open manhole cover or something, and a person fell in. This is just a hyperbole example of the actual law, whatever it may be. In New York, you can teach your pet parrot to speak, but not to squawk. Easy. Noise ordinance law somewhere. A parrot's squawk can exceed 105 dB, and is generally disruptive to living next door to you in a thin-walled apartment. This person just found something really loud, and translated this law to match that law's prohibition. It's unlikely you'll find a law this specific, but noise ordinance laws exist in many areas. My area is 75 dB during the day, 70 dB at night. In New York City it's illegal to shake a dust mop out a window. That's definitely still on the books. It's part of the littering law. Littering, sweeping, throwing, or casting any material such as ashes, garbage, paper, dust, or other garbage or rubbish into or upon any street or public place, vacant lot, air shaft, areaway, backyard, court, or alley is illegal. Throwing garbage out of windows (for example, from buildings or vehicles) is also a violation. In addition, no person may allow anyone under his/her control (agent or employee) to commit a littering, sweep- out, or throw-out violation. Merchants must put all sweepings into suitable garbage receptacles for pickup by a private carter. Residential units must put sweepings into suitable garbage receptacles for pick up by DSNY. Sanitation litter baskets may not be used for this purpose. It is against the law to throw a ball at someone's head for fun. As far as I can tell, this has a serious history. Carnival workers (""carnies"") often had setups that involved heavy solid balls. The kind that could literally cause concussions if they were hit in the head. Dunk tanks, knock-stuff-over games, and so on. Presumably, people thought it would be funny to assault the carnies, so laws were written. Of course, assault is already illegal, but it was probably put there was a way to let people know it was a serious situation. Jaywalking is legal, as long as it's not diagonal. That is, you can cross the street out of the crosswalk, but you can't cross a street diagonally. This is really just saying that there's no law prohibiting jaywalking specifically, but there are laws about when you're allowed to cross an intersection diagonally. Again, making it sound weird or strange. It's just a loophole in the lawbooks. Presumably, if people started getting hit while crossing mid-street, they'd add a new law to address that. Slippers are not to be worn after 10:00 P.M. This is likely another oversimplification. It's probably something more like ""you have to wear solid-soled shoes at night to protect your feet from broken debris and rats"" or something like that. Staten Island: You may only water your lawn if the hose is held in your hand. This is likely a water conservation law. Automated sprinklers and lawn sprinklers waste water. In an effort to combat that problem, requiring hand-holding your hose makes you more likely to not overwater your lawn. While riding in an elevator, one must talk to no one, and fold his hands while looking toward the door. Of this list, this one is presumably a satire law that makes a statement about societal customs in some places of New York. It's highly unlikely this would be real law, but rather an expectation of how to behave in an elevator if you didn't want to have a bad experience. So, overall, I'd say that virtually none of the laws actually read like they do on this list, but some variant of the law in a more generalized form probably does exist."
Is it legal to use force against a person who is trying to stop you from rescuing another person?,"germany Bob through his actions is harming Alice.  Thus Eve may use the minimum necessary force to help Alice as Nothilfe, which is defined as using §32 StGB (Self protection/Notwehr) and §34 StGB  (justifying state of emergency/Rechtfertigender Notstand). As a result, it is allowed to harm someone to the degree of self protection for the benefit of someone else that can't protect themselves - such as Alice. However, the amount of force allowed must be proportional to the harm done to Alice - so Eve may use the least needed amount of force to get Bob from stopping Eve from helping Alice. As an example, Eve might shove Bob out of the way, hit him, or use the threat of serious harm (which is usually illegal!) to deter Bob from getting in the way, but unless Alice is actually at risk of dying from Bob keeping her from applying pressure on a lacerated artery this very moment, she can't shoot at Bob - that would overstep the Notwehr, but might not be punished if the overstepping is for the right reasons defined in §33 StGB. Bob also is liable for not rendering aid, §323c StGB unterlassene Hilfeleistung/Behinderung von hilfeleistenden Personen (Failure to provide assistance/hindering persons providing assistance)."
Do I (witness) have to respond to email from defendant's lawyer?,"However, if you don’t it’s very likely you will be subpoenaed. Then you’ll have to talk to them at a time and place of their choosing rather one that’s mutually agreed."
"If the President's power to grant pardons is absolute, could he face any consequences?","There are 2 separate issues here: what happens to such a President and what happens to the person who has been pardoned. While at least one attempt at reversing a pardon has been discussed in recent history (Clinton's pardon of Mark Rich), there is no case of a pardon that has been reversed without the wishes of the person who was to be pardoned. There were 2 SCOTUS cases which decided that a pardon is a form of clemency rather than an act of overturning a judgement. Both (fmr President) Nixon and (fmr Sec of Defense) Weinberger were pardoned without ever being tried for the crimes for which they were pardoned. Even after Burdick v US, the issue of whether a pardon does amount to a formal admission of guilt remains controversial (i.e., not fully settled legally). In Nixon v US (not to be confused with the more famous US v Nixon), the court referred to Black's Law dictionary, rather than to the previous 2 opinions, to state that a pardon does not overturn a ""guilty"" judgement but rather provides a clemency. It is established that all punishments (jail time or fines), that one would receive for the crime, would not be applied if the person is pardoned. However, it is not established, for example, if the the presumption of guilt that goes with the accepting of a pardon The current DOJ FAQ states that a pardon removes ""civil disabilities"" such as restrictions on the right to It is widely claimed that a President cannot pardon anyone for state crimes.  However, as far as I know, it's never been attempted. The current interpretation of the US Constitution's Supremacy Clause is that states cannot interfere with the proceedings of the Federal government.  So should a President attempt to pardon anyone for a state crime, it would (almost certainly) result in a court challenge.  Any claims, that the outcome of such a challenge would result one way or another, are (by definition) nothing but a speculation. Further, if a pardon does remove the civil disability of not being able to hold a state office, then it does remove punitive consequences of some states' laws.  Which may potentially bolster the claim that a President may pardon a state crime.  But again, this is a pure speculation and there are plenty of good arguments to be made against such a possibility. That having been said, no official act performed by a President is automatically reversed if the act is found to have been done corruptly (in exchange for a bribe or any other personal consideration contravening his oath of office). However, the Congress has the enumerated power to impeach a President and remove him from the office if he is found to have taken a bribe.  Removing him from the office does not, in itself, reverse any of his official actions (including the ones performed corruptly). The Congress, however, does not have the power to reverse pardons.  Nor can it create such a power with a legislature.  For Congress to gain such a power would require a constitutional amendment."
Does the government control what time it is?,"15 USC Subchapter IX gives the Secretary of Transportation powers to set rules about the 11 time zones, and those laws supersede state and local laws. Observance of Daylight Savings Time is optional for a state. This is the DST law. First, it says that at the DST changeover times,   the standard time of each zone established by sections 261 to 264 of
  this title...shall be advanced one hour...however, (1) any State that
  lies entirely within one time zone may by law exempt itself from the
  provisions of this subsection providing for the advancement of time,
  but only if that law provides that the entire State (including all
  political subdivisions thereof) shall observe the standard time
  otherwise applicable during that period, and (2) any State with parts
  thereof in more than one time zone may by law exempt either the entire
  State as provided in (1) or may exempt the entire area of the State
  lying within any time zone. which allows a state to stay on permanent standard time (but not permanent DST). The appearance that government has to approve the change comes from the fact that states (other than Arizona, Hawaii, Guam etc) seem to want to switch to permanent DST, not standard time. The standardization of time is governed by laws passed by congress, so the government can change it, if they can pass a bill through both houses and get the president to sign. "
"Can I put up a joke sign on my private land that reads ""Active Minefield""?","At the federal level, 18 USC 35 is as close as you can get: (a) Whoever imparts or conveys or causes to be imparted or conveyed
false information, knowing the information to be false, concerning an
attempt or alleged attempt being made or to be made, to do any act
which would be a crime prohibited by this chapter or chapter 97 or
chapter 111 of this title shall be subject to a civil penalty of not
more than $1,000 which shall be recoverable in a civil action brought
in the name of the United States. However, the false information has to have a specific character. Ch. 97 regards trains and mass transportation systems (entering to commit a crime, terrorist attacks). I assume you don't have railroad lines running through your property. Ch. 111 regards shipping, presumably not relevant to your land. Finally, Ch. 2 (""this chapter"") regards aircraft and motor vehicles: 18 USC 33 prohibits endangering... so for the sake of discussion, perhaps there is a false threat against motor vehicles (assuming there is a highway near your property). So... (a) Whoever willfully, with intent to endanger...causes to be placed
any explosive...in proximity to, any motor vehicle... is a criminal. Therefore conveying false information that an explosive is in proximity to a motor vehicle is also against the law. That's probably close enough to warrant hiring an attorney before you end up arrested on a federal charge. Para. (a) makes this action a matter for a civil penalty ($1,000 limit), whereas para. (b) of §35 makes it a crime if you act ""willfully and maliciously, or with reckless disregard for the safety of human life"". You joke would not rise to the level of willful and malicious, but it could easily be found to be negligent, so you could get a civil penalty."
How can roomate finder offer an 'LGBT household' option for filtering potential roomates without violating USA's fair housing act?,"The words of the prohibition in 24 CFR 100.60(a)are that It shall be unlawful for a person to refuse to sell or rent a dwelling
to a person who has made a bona fide offer, because of race, color,
religion, sex, familial status, or national origin or to refuse to
negotiate with a person for the sale or rental of a dwelling because
of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin, or
to discriminate against any person in the sale or rental of a dwelling
because of handicap. It would be discriminatory for the landlord to refuse to rent to a person because they are or are not of some sex. Based just on the plain language of the prohibition, the author of the app or operator of a website is not renting / refusing to rent. Nevertheless, Roommate.com was sued, and found not liable, though not on the grounds that they hadn't discriminated Fair Housing Councils v. Rommate.com addressed an attempt to punish roommate.com on discriminatory grounds. The court states that ""The pivotal question is whether the FHA applies to roommates"".
The court's reasoning is a clear application of the notion of ""Congressional intent"". As they say, There’s no indication that Congress intended to interfere with
personal relationships inside the home. Congress wanted to address the
problem of landlords discriminating in the sale and rental of housing,
which deprived protected classes of housing opportunities. But a
business transaction between a tenant and landlord is quite different
from an arrangement between two people sharing the same living space.
We seriously doubt Congress meant the FHA to apply to the latter.
Consider, for example, the FHA’s prohibition against sex discrimination. Could Congress, in the 1960s, really have meant that
women must accept men as roommates? Telling women they may not
lawfully exclude men from the list of acceptable roommates would be
controversial today; it would have been scandalous in the 1960s The court continued on other grounds, observing that given that the FHA is a remedial statute that we construe broadly...
we turn to constitutional concerns, which provide strong
countervailing considerations That is, even if you ignore congressional intent, there is a constitutional reason why FHA cannot apply to roommate choice. SCOTUS in Bd. of Dirs. of Rotary Int’l v. Rotary Club of
Duarte, 481 U.S. 537 stated that ""the freedom to enter into and carry on certain intimate or private relationships is a fundamental element of liberty protected by the Bill of Rights"", and ""Courts have extended the right of intimate association to marriage, child bearing, child rearing and cohabitation with relatives"". Then in order to ""determine whether a particular relationship is protected by the right to intimate association we look to 'size, purpose, selectivity, and whether others are excluded from critical aspects of the relationship'"". After extensive analysis centered around the point that ""Government regulation of an individual’s ability to
pick a roommate thus intrudes into the home, which 'is entitled to special protection as the center of the private lives of
our people'"", the court ""adopt[s] the narrower construction that excludes roommate selection from the reach of the FHA"". TL;DR the FHA doesn't apply to roommates and it's legal to select one's roommates based on their race, color, religion, sex, sexuality, etc..."
What's the most crucial issue when deciding Senator Cruz's citizenship?,"At time of answering, the question is: What's the most crucial issue when deciding Senator Cruz's citizenship? The 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, Section 1, states: All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States[.] Cruz did not go through a naturalization process.  He was also not born within the territorial limits of the US.  If either of those facts were different, those would be the crucial issue.  Since they are not, we then look to the Naturalization Act of 1790, passed by the first Congress, which states that children born to citizen parents outside the United States are also citizens, specifically: The children of citizens of the United States, that may be born beyond sea, or out of the limits of the United States, shall be considered as natural born citizens[.]
(emphasis added) According to the Wikipedia article and/or sources it cites, this is the only legislation to use the phrase ""natural born citizens"" and it seems clear this is intended to refer to Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution which states a requirement:  No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years, and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States.
(emphasis added) The 1790 Act was repealed and replaced in 1795, but the new law also contained the language (lacking ""natural born""): The children of citizens of the United States, born out of the limits and jurisdiction of the United States, shall be considered as citizens of the United States[.] The specific laws have been further changed, as the naturalization process has, reintroducing ambiguity about the ""natural born"" requirement, but birthright citizenship from parents is not in question and the ""natural born"" aspect is not in this question.  So, to answer the question directly, the most crucial issue is: Were Cruz's parents citizens when Cruz was born?  Cruz's Wikipedia page says his father was not naturalized until later, but his mother was born in Wilmington, DE, which is in the United States, and so unless she renounced her citizenship she would have been a US citizen at the time of Cruz's birth.  This means there's a crucial issue: Did Cruz's mother renounce her US citizenship before Cruz was born? ""Kaithar"" commented on this answer with speculation that she voted in a Canadian election at a time (1947-1977) when Canada didn't recognize dual citizenship in that it required its own citizens to give that up if they acquired foreign citizenship; ""user102008"" refutes that.  However, if we don't want to end this issue-identifying answer at that question, let's assume the answer is ""no"" and that Cruz's mother was a US citizen when Cruz was born. Then we have to see if birthright citizenship from parents extends to Cruz.
For this, we can look to Public Law 414 (66 Stat. 236), passed June 27, 1952, especially section 301(a)(7): The following shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth:

  A person born outside the geographical limits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents one of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United States who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically present in the United States or its outlying possessions for a period or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five of which were after attaining the age of fourteen years: Provided, That any periods of honorable service in the Armed Forces of the United States by such citizen parent may be included in computing the physical presence requirements of this paragraph.   Side note: Section (4) (modern (d)) would matter if Cruz's father were considered a noncitizen national of the US, slightly relaxing the requirements so that the mother only had to spend only one continuous year in the US prior to the birth.  The armed forces exemption was broadened Nov. 6, 1966 to cover the parent (or their parent's) nonmilitary employment by the US government or certain international organizations.  If that's relevant, this answer can be edited to expand on this point. Section 309 of that law addresses children born out of wedlock, and says that section 301(a)(7) (quoted above) applies directly as if the parents were married, ""if the paternity of such child is established while such child is under the age of twenty-one years by legitimation.""  To the best of my knowledge, section 301(a)(7) applies to Cruz.  If I were wrong on that, we'd look to Section 309(c):  A person born, after December 23, 1952, outside the United States and out of wedlock shall be held to have acquired at birth the nationality status of his mother, if the mother had the nationality of the United States at the time of such person’s birth, and if the mother had previously been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of one year. The equivalent of the first quote today is in 8 U.S. Code § 1401(g) if parents are married at the time of a child's birth, replacing ""ten years, at least five"" with ""five years, at least two"" (Nov. 14, 1986; see Section 12 in this law). The quote from 309(c) is now 8 U.S. Code § 1409(c). So then the crucial question is: Did Cruz's mother spent the requisite period of time in the US before Cruz was born? Apparently she did, regardless of marital status, and if that's true it means Ted Cruz is a US citizen and has been since at least birth*.  Again, the ""natural born"" aspect is omitted from this now-answered question.  The answer to the question you meant to ask (perhaps ""What's the most crucial issue when deciding if Senator Cruz's citizenship makes him eligible for the Presidency?"") is ""What does the phrase 'natural born citizen' mean in context of Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution?"" (*) Which may mean that he hasn't been a citizen his whole life, using a Cruz definition for when life begins.  That's a separate discussion, though, and not very relevant to this one."
Copyright a Land Feature?,"Who knows. It doesn't matter. 17 USC 102 lists the kinds of things protectable by copyright under US law. These are: (1) literary works;
(2) musical works, including any accompanying words;
(3) dramatic works, including any accompanying music;
(4) pantomimes and choreographic works;
(5) pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works;
(6) motion pictures and other audiovisual works;
(7) sound recordings; and
(8) architectural works. A landscape feature is none of these and is not subject to copyright protection under US law, nor I think under the law of any other country.  The ""copyright notice"" has no legal effect. In US Law, particularly under the Fiest vs Rural case, only works with original content, created by a person, are protected by copyright. (Other countries generally have similar limits on copyright.) But a feature of the landscape is not the original creation of any person. (If someone carved the landscape into a designed shape, it might be protect able as a sculpture.) 3 and 4. If it were a building, you could take pictures of it from a public place or a private place where you have a legal right to be, under  17 USC 120 . But since a part of the landscape is not protected by copyright at all, this is not really relevant."
How can the US president give an order to a civilian?,"The executive branch of the US government, or specific parts of it, can demand that a person do particular things, when a statute has authorized such a demand. Such demands are not usually made at the level of the President of the United States, but the president could order a specific official to take such action. For example a National Security Letter orders a person to turn over specific information, and not tell anyone about doing so, as described in this article from The New Yorker. 50 USC 3162 provides that: (a) Generally (1) Any authorized investigative agency may request from any financial agency, financial institution, or holding company, or from any consumer reporting agency, such financial records, other financial information, and consumer reports as may be necessary in order to conduct any authorized law enforcement investigation, counterintelligence inquiry, or security determination. Any authorized investigative agency may also request records maintained by any commercial entity within the United States pertaining to travel by an employee in the executive branch of Government outside the United States. ... (2) Requests may be made under this section where— ... (B) (i) there are reasonable grounds to believe, based on credible information, that the person is, or may be, disclosing classified information in an unauthorized manner to a foreign power or agent of a foreign power; (ii) information the employing agency deems credible indicates the person has incurred excessive indebtedness or has acquired a level of affluence which cannot be explained by other information known to the agency; or (iii) circumstances indicate the person had the capability and opportunity to disclose classified information which is known to have been lost or compromised to a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. ""authorized investigative agency"" is defined as: an agency authorized by law or regulation to conduct a counterintelligence investigation or investigations of persons who are proposed for access to classified information to ascertain whether such persons satisfy the criteria for obtaining and retaining access to such information;  Accordingn to this ACLU page: In April 2007, the ACLU filed a FOIA request seeking information about the Department of Defense and CIA's use of National Security Letters. After filing a lawsuit, the ACLU received over 500 documents from its request. According to this ACLU page: An ACLU lawsuit revealed that the CIA has also used National Security Letters to demand Americans' personal financial records without prior court approval. The CIA has acknowledged using National Security Letters ""on a limited basis"" to obtain financial information from U.S. companies. According nto this NY Times article from Jan 13 2007: The C.I.A. has also been issuing what are known as national security letters to gain access to financial records from American companies, though it has done so only rarely, intelligence officials say. There are other circumstances in which an executive branch government official may order a private citizen to take specific action. Indeed, this happens in almost every case of a police arrest, except those done by an arrest warrant (which is a court order).  During the Korean War, President Truman issued an order seizing a number of steel mills, to be operated by the government, in order to stop a strike which was, he said, impeding the military effort and thus the security of the United States. This order was challenged in the case of Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952) and was overturned on the ground that the President was not only not-authorized by any law, but had failed to follow the provisions of a law dealing with situations of the kind at issue. In that case the Court made it clear that such a seizure would have been permitted if done in conformance with a statute, and might have been permitted had no law dealt with such cases. "
"If mathematical equations are not patentable, why are algorithms patentable?","Aren't computer programs mathematical equations? Any program can be
  represented mathematically. . . . But how are programs different from
  mathematical equations? . . . Don't encryption algorithms precisely
  come under the definition of mathematical equations? In the context of patent law, the ""mathematical equations"" that aren't patentable are those that are discovered and are mathematical laws of Nature.  For example, you cannot patent a mathematical equation which is the equivalent of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (which tells you how many solutions there are to all possible polynomial equations), because it is a statement about what is fundamentally true about something, not about how to do something that works better than other possible ways of doing something. An algorithm, in contrast, in patent law, is a method of doing something that is not inherently the only way of doing something as a consequence of the laws of mathematics or other laws of Nature (although it could very well be the ""best"" way of doing something). For example, the simplex method of linear programming would probably be patentable if it hadn't been publicly disclosed prior to anyone obtaining a patent on this method. Most computer programs are the digital embodiment of algorithms, rather than of equations that were discovered that represent fundamental truths that are always and uniquely true about numbers or reality. Notably, recent governing U.S. Supreme Court case law has now made it categorically true that there mere fact of embodying an algorithm or other business method in digital form with a computer program, as a matter of law, does not make an idea that would not be patentable if not embodied in a computer program patentable. The underlying idea that is embodied digitally in a computer program must, itself, be patentable. A method for doing something, even if it can be or is represented mathematically, is not inherently not subject to being patented. But, not every method of doing something is patentable either. The ""business method"" must still clear the hurdles of being original (you can't patent ideas that have already been disclosed publicly by someone else, or by yourself for that matter), of having ""utility"" rather than merely aesthetic value, and of not being obvious to a person of ordinary skill if the field in which the invention arises.  For example, anything that would follow as a lemma or corollary of an existing aspect of prior art would not be eligible for a patent either, even if it is novel and useful. Now, there is some room for sophistry here.  For example, you could call a computer equation that calculated a Lorentz transform a method for calculating the relationship between two coordinate frames to which relativistic mechanics apply. But, because that relationship is a law of Nature which is always true, even if it isn't the only means to calculating that relationship, it would not be patentable even if it were not prior art. I want to start a company that uses machine learning algorithms. While it is a risky business model, it is worth considering that over the last 10-15 years the legal threshold necessary to patent a computer program has gotten much, much higher. The Patent and Trademark Office used to routinely grant these applications, but due to a string of important statutory and case law changes, software patents are now denied at a very high rate, and existing software patents are routinely determined to be invalid in litigation. If there is serious reason to doubt that an existing patent that would be important for your business is really patentable, you should consult a patent lawyer to consider the possibility of bringing an interpartes review action in the Patent and Trademark Office to have a previously issued patent revoked. This is an expensive and time consuming process, but it is much cheaper than losing a patent infringement lawsuit after having invested time and money into running a business using a patent you know to be infringing because you believe that it won't hold up in court."
Do disclaimers need to be capitalized?,"Do they have to use all caps? Well, no. It's just that companies feel that's the easiest way to make the text ""conspicuous"" which is required by the Uniform Commercial Code explicitly in § 2-316. Exclusion or Modification of Warranties. (2)Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it states, for example, that ""There are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof."" The term ""conspicuous"" is defined in § 1-201. General Definitions. ""Conspicuous"", with reference to a term, means so written, displayed, or presented that a reasonable person against which it is to operate ought to have noticed it. Whether a term is ""conspicuous"" or not is a decision for the court. Conspicuous terms include the following: (A) a heading in capitals equal to or greater in size than the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same or lesser size; and (B) language in the body of a record or display in larger type than the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same size, or set off from surrounding text of the same size by symbols or other marks that call attention to the language. So you could make the text all bold and italic. You could make the font color purple. It's just that most companies use the caps lock key, whatever their individual reasons may be. I'll also note that this is a commercial code and these rules are found under Article 2 - Sales. So you'll only see this requirement taking effect in terms/disclaimers for companies which actually let end-users engage in commercial activity (they're actually selling something). Any site which doesn't facilitate commercial activity will likely be using a warranty disclaimer as a note of ""hey, this is a free site, so no you don't get a warranty or legal expectation of service of any sort."""
Why the obscure but specific description of Jane Doe II in the original complaint for Westenbroek v. Kappa Kappa Gamma Fraternity?,"This case was filed in federal court under diversity jurisdiction, meaning that it’s a lawsuit between citizens of different states. In most cases, diversity jurisdiction requires “complete” diversity: every plaintiff has to be a citizen of a different state than every defendant. If one of 12 plaintiffs is a Maryland resident and one of 15 defendants is also a Maryland resident, that tiny overlap means the entire lawsuit is kicked back to state court. In this case, the defendants are an Ohio fraternity, an Illinois resident, a Wyoming company, and a person whose residence is unclear. Defendant Smith might be a Wyoming resident, a Utah resident, or a Washington resident. The plaintiffs aren’t sure. However, as long as the plaintiffs aren’t residents of any of those states, there’s complete diversity of citizenship. It doesn’t matter whether Doe II is from Alaska or Florida, just that she isn’t from the same state as any defendant."
"If someone steals something of mine, is it legal to steal it back?","As the previous reply says, you can't steal something if it was yours already. That's by definition – stealing can only be of something that isn't your possession. However there are three ways you can have a problem despite this, partly referred to in another answer: If there is a law or other legal basis for the other person to have control and keep that object, either for a while or indefinitely. So if your phone is legitimately taken by a police officer, you can't ""steal"" it but you may still not have the right to take it. But this would be treated as some other crime, not ""theft."" If you cannot gain legal access it, and would have to commit another kind of crime to get it back. So you can't legally get back money by hacking someone's bank account, or defrauding them, or get back an object by breaking down their front door or using illegal force, or by making unlawful threats and blackmail.On the other hand, if you were invited by them to visit their house (or persuaded them to let you visit) and you found it and took it back while visiting under their consent, or they gave you a lift and while in the car you rummaged in the glove compartment and saw your property there, then the issue of legal consent for access is potentially a non-issue, meaning that taking it back under those conditions (even against their objections when they realised) may well be technically legal in many cases, depending on the exact facts of the case and applicable law. (less likely) If something has happened that means, technically, it isn't yours any more, or never was yours. For example, you accidentally give or throw your valuable phone away in error and someone else legitimately (in law) assumes ownership afterwards, or sign away or renounce something without realising it, or allow someone to use something in a way that gives them some ownership-like rights over it, so that by law you are deemed to have relinquished or waived some/all of your rights as an owner (the other person was honest and didn't defraud you), and you later try to take it back without consent, then in principle you could now be seen as stealing it back.You might also believe something is absolutely yours but in fact legally you don't own it and never did. For example you 'bought' some music or software, or a right to use something under license, and believe you actually own it or that you have a moral right to own it. So, later on, you sell it, dispose of it to someone else, or treat it as yours, when in law, it never was yours to do these things. Technically depending on the situation and exact wording of the law, this might be construed as stealing, in some cases and some jurisdictions. Between these legal limits, there is a grey area where you can get it back in practice despite an illegality. For example if the unlawful access is so minor you are sure it won't be a criminal issue, or you're sure it wouldn't be reported, you might chance it. But that's not a legal issue as much as a personal one. An interesting variant of this applies in English law, although I doubt it has any legal relevance in US law. In English law, ""theft"" was defined by the Theft Act 1968 as, ""A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with intention to permanently deprive the other of it"". This meant that a person who could show a court that they did not ""intend"" to ""permanently deprive"", or did not act ""dishonestly"" or ""appropriate"" the property (treat it as if they were its owner), might in fact have a strong legal defence against a charge of theft. Update from comment below ""If you saw it in a shop would you be able to take it and run away?"" You wouldn't have to. In almost all cases if something isn't legally yours, you can't legally pass ownership to anyone else, such as a store, whether for money or not, because it wasn't ever yours to pass good (legal) title. So the item is still owned by its original legitimate owner, meaning the exact same legal position still applies as above, if you had discovered it was in someone's house. It could change hands many times (not just once) from thief to fence to store to shopper to friend as a gift, and even so, the same would still apply - it would remain yours in law. If anything it's a bit easier if you saw it in a shop. A shop usually consents to members of the public entering - they don't have to ask normally! - and you might ask to see the item or look closely (if it's locked in the window). You now have it with consent and without any crime. If confident, you can walk out completely legally with your possession. (Tracking down the ""rogue"" or recovering any money paid for it, is their problem not yours in the eyes of the law). That said, realistically you wouldn't do it that way. This is slipping into personal view rather than law, but this is how I'd do it instead of ""grab and run."" Assuming a ""typical"" store and store staff, you would ask them to fetch the manager, and you would explain firmly that you claim this is your stolen property, and therefore not owned by them (nor do they have any rights to make any decisions about it), and you are taking it back. You would offer sight of ID or some means of contact, telling them this is so that they have a means to contact you, if they wish to dispute it via lawyers or police. You would offer to wait for the police if they wish, but maintain that you are not parting with it and they may call the police if they disagree;  when they arrive, tell the police exactly the same, and that you have given your ID and waited there, as a mark of good faith, and invite them to come back with you to see where you live or proof of purchase or anything else, if relevant. You would tell the police that if they think you have committed a crime according to the law then they must of course arrest you for it, but if not, you now wish to go. You would meet any police request to give it to the police or store by asserting that it is your property and you would rather not, or by asking if you will be committing a criminal offence (if so which) if you refuse, and refuse if you feel able to do so. Then follow whichever way it goes. You would do these things because they are fair, reasonable, and they mark you out as someone asserting a right, not a thief yourself, and they reduce the odds that you will be taken for a thief, or meet with violence in their efforts to recover it.  After all, the storekeeper and police can claim ""reasonable belief"" for any of their actions afterwards, so it's best that you reduce their likelihood of something nasty."
Resume Writer asks: Who owns the copyright - me or my client?,"This  is a common issue when a contractor is hired to write a technical document. Under united-states law, at least, the answer is clear. The contractor owns the copyright unless there is a written agreement transferring the copyright. This may or may not be a work-for-hire agreement, and there are some significant differences in the effects if it is, but an agreement in writing there must be. Otherwise the author (the contractor) retains the copyright. If you were an employee, the result would be the reverse. Even though you hold the copyright, I think you should, at a minimum, change any identifying details. There might be an invasion of privacy issue otherwise, and there surely would be an ethical issue. However, you do not hold the copyright of any original version that the client wrote. The client holds that, unless there was a written agreement giving you the copyright.  If your final resume is sufficiently close to the original as to be a derivative work then you must have the client's permission before publishing it. If this is in the US, the issue of the client's copyright on the original version might be avoided via a claim of Fair Use (FU), as a comment mentions. This is a specifically US legal concept, although some other countries have a somewhat similar but narrower concept of Fair dealing. There is no automatic formula for what use will be considered a fair use -- the specific facts of the matter must always be considered. The statute lists four factors to consider, but the court may consider others as well, and caselaw says no one factor is dominant in all cases, they must be balanced The four factors as set out by 17 USC 17 are: (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. Here as the writer would be using the whole work, factor (3) , the amount of the work used, would tilt against FU. The use is not educational or non-profit, nor transformative, so factor (1)  also tilts against FU. There is probably no market for the original, which tilts factor (4) toward FU. The original is highly factual which tilts factor (2) toward FU. There is no telling where a court would come out, and the OP doesn't want to rely on a risky issue. If anyone were to relay on fair use for this sort of thing, consulting an attorney who could look at specifics would be a good idea."
Is signing a document that I have not seen legally binding?,"You are entitled to at least see, and probably get a copy of, any document you sign. If you insist, they will have to show you or give you a copy. It may well be that they are supposed to give you a copy even if you do not ask. But if you are going to insist, allow a bit of extra time at such appointments. If they describe the document, even in rather general terms, your signature is probably binding, unless they have significantly misrepresented the document. If they tell you it is consent to be treated and it is actually an agreement to purchase a timeshare, that would be fraud and the document would not be valid, but that would be very unlikely. There might be some provision that you do not like, but such agreements are usually fairly standard, and also usually not very negotiable if you want service at that office. Still, it is better practice to at least look over and get a copy of any document you agree to."
What does it mean if your apartment is in two cities at once,"The location of your residence entrance is irrelevant for the law, what matters most is your ""street address"", i.e. mailing address. That is the address (therefore city) that you use for voter registration, and basically how you identify ""where I live"". If you lives 5 miles out in the country in an unincorporated area, you'd still use Needles (e.g.) as you mailing address: but you would not be able to vote for a mayor of Needles, just based on your mailing address.  Both municipalities might claim jurisdiction based on the physical location of the property, especially for matters of building code. It should not be possible for both municipalities to tax the full value of your property, but they could split the assessment proportionally. The cities themselves are not collecting the tax, the county is (though property straddling a county line raises an interesting question)."
"If vampires were real, what would one who broke into someone's home to drink their blood be charged with?","In addition to criminal charges, the victim could also press civil claims as compensation for the physical injury and the psychological trauma they experienced from a stranger entering their home at night and drinking their blood. A possible defense which the vampire could use is to claim that they are no longer a human, so human laws do not apply to them. But this would be a rather dangerous strategy, because if human laws don't apply to them, then by the same argumentation human rights might not apply to them either. If they insisted on being tried as an animal, then the court could very well reason that the best way to deal with a dangerous animal that can not be controlled and can not be kept away from humans is to euthanize it."
What will happen if one is caught smuggling something that is not illegal?,"It should be pointed out that smuggling doesn't just involve illegal goods but also includes legal goods that are brought in without following proper procedures such as paying required duties. https://www.findlaw.com/criminal/criminal-charges/smuggling-and-customs-violations.html False declarations can happen when a person returns to the U.S. or enters for the first time. They must declare the value of any goods they are bringing in from overseas. You can violate the law by misrepresenting the value of the goods, omitting them from the declaration form completely, or making false representations. Also, if you fail to disclose leaving or entering the country with $10,000 worth of currency, you can be criminally charged. While I am not a lawyer I could see that the authorities might have an issue with someone pulling a stunt like that in order to ""test"" them. Even if there is no legal issue the person could be put through a lot while they run tests to confirm that nothing illegal is being brought in and there is nothing preventing them from making the process as long and painful as they can. Something else to consider they also have rules in place for brining other legal objects on board planes if they resemble objects that are not allowed. https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/toy-guns-and-weapons Squirt guns, Nerf guns, toy swords, or other items that resemble realistic firearms or weapons are prohibited. We recommend emptying water guns, which must follow the 3-1-1 Liquids Rule. Replicas of explosives, such as hand grenades, are prohibited in checked and carry-on baggage. TSA officers have the discretion to prohibit any item through the screening checkpoint if they believe it poses a security threat. It is also possible to be charged with selling fake drugs and the local authorities can bring those charges and it can become their word versus your word about what your intentions are. In this case you might not be intending to sell them but it would be impossible to argue that you are not trying to pass it off as fake drugs. https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/legal-advice/criminal-defense/drug-charges/jail-selling-fake-drugs.htm Question: I sold a baggie of aspirins that I said was OxyContin to a guy at a concert. After the show, I heard that there were undercover officers in the crowd. Could I be busted for selling fake drugs? Answer: Yes. States and federal laws make the sale of fake drugs illegal, and you can even be charged with an attempted drug sale under some laws."
Who owns copyright on works found in a storage unit/attic?,"Note:  this answer refers to US copyright law.  Other jurisdictions may differ, though the Berne Convention means that the general rules are largely the same.  See chx's answer for more details. There are two different ""things"" you can own when it comes to an artistic/creative object:  the physical object itself, and the right to reproduce it (i.e., the copyright).  US Law specifically notes that owning the physical object does not imply that you automatically own the copyright, or vice versa: Ownership of a copyright, or of any of the exclusive rights under a copyright, is distinct from ownership of any material object in which the work is embodied. Transfer of ownership of any material object, including the copy or phonorecord in which the work is first fixed, does not of itself convey any rights in the copyrighted work embodied in the object; nor, in the absence of an agreement, does transfer of ownership of a copyright or of any exclusive rights under a copyright convey property rights in any material object. If you find the manuscript to an unpublished Kurt Vonnegut novel in your attic, you are within your rights to auction off the manuscript to the highest bidder.  This is analogous to finding a ""lost"" Warhol painting in your attic and putting it up for sale.   But just because you own the original does not necessarily give you the rights to reproduce it, either for the painting or the manuscript.  By default, the copyright in any creative work belongs to its creator, and physical ownership of the work does not also grant the owner the copyright by default.  In the case of the Vonnegut novel, the right to reproduce and publish the manuscript would still belong to Vonnegut's estate, unless Vonnegut (or his estate) had explicitly granted that copyright to another party.   The analogous situation for the Warhol painting would be taking the painting and selling prints of it, or putting it on a mug or a t-shirt.  If Warhol (or his heirs) never granted the copyright in the painting to anyone else, then the right to reproduce it still belongs to them.   The medium of expression does not make a difference in the legal principles involved, and who has the right to do what.  It only makes a difference in how easy it is to faithfully reproduce it.  As noted in the comments, works that are sufficiently old will eventually pass into the public domain.  If the work is ""unpublished"" (as the hypothetical Vonnegut novel would be), this happens 70 years after the death of the author.  Anyone could legally publish the novel at this time, not just the owner of the manuscript."
What was the relevance of 'crossing state lines' in the Kyle Rittenhouse case?,"The ""crossing state lines"" narrative originated from the false presumption that Kyle Rittenhouse illegally carried a rifle across state lines from Illinois into Wisconsin. If this had been the case, Rittenhouse could have potentially been charged with a federal crime. In the context of this case, it was never a relevant factor as he was charged by the District Attorney's office and not the Department of Justice."
What prevents laws from being interpreted pedantically?,"This ultimately is a matter of Statutory Interpretation. One of the principles of statutory interpretation is that all words are interpreted in their context. For your example, that means we look at the title of 1464, ""Broadcasting obscene language"". From this it becomes apparent that radio is used in its common meaning of AM and FM radio broadcasts. Statutory interpretation is broader than that single rule, though. Legislative intent is another important factor, and that is rather effective in eliminating absurd arguments. Via the link above, from New Mexico's State Court: words have their ordinary meaning ""as long as the ordinary meaning does not render the statute's application absurd, unreasonable, or unjust."" In other words, absurdity is so bad that the court will prefer an alternative interpretation of the offending words."
What are some possible law suits or civil actions the Las Vegas shooting victims could take?,"You can sue anyone for anything. I will answer these on the assumption that the real question is whether there is a legal basis for such a suit. 1) Could someone open a civil action against the city of Las Vegas for
  failure to provide security? Or are city/county municipalities immune?
  And is the state of Nevada immune? This would not prevail. There is governmental immunity and there is no duty of care. And there is also no plausible argument, factually, that somebody in the government did something wrong. Note also that a comment accurately notes that the incident took place in the City of Paradise rather than the City of Las Vegas, and the question has been revised accordingly. Some states have a general victim's compensation fund that helps partially cover losses of crime victims, but I am not aware that Nevada has one. 2) Could someone sue the concert promoters for failures to provide
  safety? And/or was that safety limited to the actual physical area of
  the concert? No. The risks were unprecedented, unforeseeable, and there would have been no cost effective way to prevent them. 3) Could someone sue the hotel/casino for failure to provide general
  safety? What about failure to prevent the gunman from bringing weapons
  into the hotel/casino? The hotel/casino is not a guarantor of general safety. The trouble with ""failure to prevent"" is that the weapons were legally obtained and owned. While it could have raised suspicions, there was no crime or illegal activity to report due to the lax guns laws of the U.S. and Nevada. Notably, in a similar suit arising out of the Aurora, Colorado theater mass shooting at a showing of The Dark Knight Returns, a court dismissed claims of those injured against the theater because the crime was not foreseeable at the time and because the crime was an intervening and superseding cause of the harm. The precedent is not directly applicable, since Nevada is in the 9th Circuit and is a different state, while Colorado is in the 10th Circuit. But, the principles of law that apply would be very similar and persuasive to a court in Nevada. 4) What about the store that sold the firearms to the shooter? Even
  though those sales appear to have been legal in Nevada? No. As you note, the sales appear to have been legal. If someone could show that the sales were made illegally, or worse, were made illegally with knowledge that this was intended, that would be a different story. 5) Or one or more of the firearm companies themselves? No. The guns were not defective and were in compliance with federal regulations. Specifically, this is governed by the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act which would also apply to the conversion kits that he purchased to make some of the firearms more like automatic weapons. 6) What about the shooter, his estate, and/or his family? I assume it
  can be alleged that they might have known of the shooter's plans
  and/or failed to intercede. Claims Against The Shooter The shooter is dead, so he would be hard to serve with process (i.e. you can't sue dead people, you can only sue their estates).  Another way that crime victims often receive compensation is from restitution awards in a criminal case. But, in U.S. jurisprudence, criminal charges cannot be brought against dead people and are automatically dismissed if a defendant dies before he is convicted or after he is convicted but before the conviction is final. Claims Against The Family Family is not legally responsible for other family member's torts and crimes simply by virtue of being family members (although claims against a decedent's estate may impact them by reducing the inheritance that they might otherwise have received) and there is no plausible reason to believe that anyone, other than possibly his girlfriend, would have had any knowledge of his plans. He appears to have had a distant relationship with his brother who knew nothing, his parents are dead, he was not currently married, he divorced each of his two successive wives long ago, and he has no descendants. Claims Against The Girlfriend His girlfriend might have knowledge and involvement (her ID was used, but apparently without her consent while she was out of the country, and the $100,000 sent to the Philippines, probably for her, could be construed as a unilateral dying gift) and the FBI is investigating that, but there is no terribly good reason to think that she could foresee what was going to happen or acted negligently in some respect. She has denied having any knowledge in public statements made by her lawyer - she says she thought he was just breaking up with her when he asked her to take a trip to see family in the Philippines and there is no immediate reason to doubt her statement. There is also not a general duty to report crimes which one suspects that someone you know will commit in the future.  One could argue that the shooter had an arsenal of guns that could have clued in the girlfriend, but so does about 3% of the total population, and a much larger proportion of the population that is wealthy and has a hunting hobby. So even if she'd told authorities about the arsenal, this concern probably would have been dismissed, and without causation there is no cause of action. The $100,000 sent to the girlfriend could probably be recovered for the creditors of his estate as a fraudulent transfer action against the recipient. This has nothing to do with the fault of the girlfriend. But, any gift made while someone has liabilities or anticipated liabilities in excess of his assets are voidable, and the tort liability anticipated in this case would have been far in excess of the shooter's assets. Claims Against His Estate Claims for wrongful death absolutely can and should be filed in his estate. He was a wealthy man and there should be enough to at least make some payment to every victim. It may be necessary for a public administrator or a creditor to step forward to open the estate as it is unlikely that the shooter's family wants that job. They would not want the job because the heirs will almost surely get nothing from his probate estate because his tort liabilities almost certainly exceed his net worth. But, it is important that someone step up to serve as the executor of his estate, because otherwise his assets could be depleted by failures to pay debts resulting in penalties and seizures of collateral, and by failure to collect property to which his estate is entitled such as rent and mortgage payments owed to him or to companies he owns.  There is a strict time limit for asserting claims against an estate that can often be a short as three months after the date of death. The relevant statute is as follows: 147.040. Claims: Limit on time for filing A person having a claim, due or to become due, against the decedent must file the claim with the clerk within 90 days after the mailing
  for those required to be mailed, or 90 days after the first
  publication of the notice to creditors pursuant to NRS 155.020. A creditor who receives a notice to creditors by mail pursuant to subsection 5 of NRS 155.020 must file a claim with the clerk within 30
  days after the mailing or 90 days after the first publication of
  notice to creditors pursuant to NRS 155.020, whichever is later. If a claim is not filed with the clerk within the time allowed by subsection 1 or 2, the claim is forever barred, but if it is made to
  appear, by the affidavit of the claimant or by other proof to the
  satisfaction of the court, that the claimant did not have notice as
  provided in NRS 155.020 or actual notice of the administration of the
  estate, the claim may be filed at any time before the filing of the
  final account. The period of 90 days prescribed by this section is reduced to 60 days if summary administration is granted under chapter 145 of NRS. Nev. Rev. Stat. § 147.040. It is possible, and even likely, that filing new lawsuits against the shooter or his estate after his death, other than by filing a claim against his estate in a Nevada state probate case, would be barred by Nevada probate law, so that claims are concentrated in the claims process. Also, while federal courts would usually have jurisdiction over a diversity lawsuit brought by an out of state plaintiff against an in state defendant, there is a probate exclusion from diversity jurisdiction that requires claims to be filed in the probate estate rather than in federal court. The hardest question for the estate once it is liquidated will be how to allocate the estate's limited assets among unrelated debts of the decedent, claims of the deceased victims and claims of those victims who were injured or suffered property damage only. There are, of course, rules to govern that in the Nevada probate code and in case law. The primary rule that applies is as follows: The debts and charges of the estate must be paid in the following
  order: Expenses of administration. Funeral expenses. The expenses of the last illness. Family allowance. Debts having preference by laws of the United States. Money owed to the Department of Health and Human Services as a result of the payment of benefits for Medicaid. Wages to the extent of $600, of each employee of the decedent, for work done or personal services rendered within 3 months before the
  death of the employer. If there is not sufficient money with which to
  pay all such labor claims in full, the money available must be
  distributed among the claimants in accordance with the amounts of
  their respective claims. Judgments rendered against the decedent in his or her lifetime, and mortgages in order of their date. The preference given to a mortgage
  extends only to the proceeds of the property mortgaged. If the
  proceeds of that property are insufficient to pay the mortgage, the
  part remaining unsatisfied must be classed with other demands against
  the estate. All other demands against the estate. Nev. Rev. Stat. § 147.195. Of course, often people end their lives and go on killing sprees when their situation is much worse than it appears and it could be that he has debts that left him on the verge of bankruptcy with nothing left for others to recover out of his estate. Claims Against The Shooter's Liability Policies The shooter almost certainly had comprehensive general liability insurance policies in his businesses and homeowner's insurance that cover him for liability for negligence. But, these policies are required as a matter of public policy, and do as a matter of commercial practice, have an intentional acts exclusion. So, there is no reasonable argument that he or his estate were covered by insurance for his acts. Claims Against The Shooter's Life Insurance Policies and Retirement Plans As a wealthy accountant, the shooter probably have life insurance and probably had retirement plans. If the beneficiary of these financial instruments was his estate, the analysis is unchanged (but the IRS has a priority claim for taxes due upon the distribution of the retirement plan assets).  Also, the fact that he killed himself does not invalidate his life insurance policy if it is incontestable (which is usually defined in the policy to mean at least two years old). If the beneficiary of these financial instruments was someone other than his estate (particularly if the beneficiary designation is more than four years old, removing the fraudulent transfer act as a challenge to the designation), the default rule is that these assets are not available to his creditors including the shooting victims. Some states allow an insolvent estate to invade certain non-probate transfers.  I would need to do further research to determine how this applies in Nevada, but his probate estate might have a basis to recover some of the life insurance and retirement asset proceeds with third-party beneficiaries for the benefit of the insolvent estate. (There is also a choice of law issue presented. Many life insurance policies and retirement plans state that they are governed by the law of a particular state. It isn't always clear if that choice of law provision, or Nevada law, would control the question of whether an insolvent probate estate may access funds otherwise payable in a non-probate transfer to another beneficiary.) The main statute in Nevada governing invalid non-probate transfers is Nev. Rev. Stat. § 155.093, et seq., and it does not allow an insolvent estate to secure those funds, but I am not an expert on Nevada probate law and there may be another exception that allows an insolvent estate to reach these amounts. A Nevada statute which could be applicable to override these beneficiary designations says: SB 454, § 51. Creditor claim: General power created by powerholder Appointive property subject to a general power of appointment created by the powerholder is subject to a claim of a creditor of the
  powerholder or of the powerholder's estate to the extent provided in
  chapter 112 of NRS. Subject to subsection 1, appointive property subject to a general power of appointment created by the powerholder is not subject to a
  claim of a creditor of the powerholder or the powerholder's estate to
  the extent the powerholder irrevocably appointed the property in favor
  of a person other than the powerholder or the powerholder's estate. Subject to subsections 1 and 2, and notwithstanding the presence of a spendthrift provision or whether the claim arose before or after the
  creation of the power of appointment, appointive property subject to a
  general power of appointment created by the powerholder is subject to
  a claim of a creditor of: (a) The powerholder, to the same extent as if the powerholder owned
  the appointive property, if the power is presently exercisable; and (b) The powerholder's estate, to the extent the estate is insufficient
  to satisfy the claim and subject to the right of a decedent to direct
  the source from which liabilities are paid, if the power is
  exercisable at the powerholder's death. Nev. Rev. Stat. § SB 454, § 51. The beneficiary designation could be reviewed as a power of appointment. Chapter 112 of the Nevada Revised Statutes is Nevada's Fraudulent Transfer Act. 7) And more of an opinion: could a group of victims attain class
  action status against any of those entities? Against the shooter's estate, yes. Against anyone else, there is not a valid cause of action unless new facts are revealed. On the other hand, since the probate claims process consolidates claims into a single case at a single forum before a single judge, it would usually be unnecessary to file a class action in this situation. Other Possible Plaintiffs and Defendants The Hotel The shooter damages the hotel's windows and his room, and he may not have paid his bill. These would be claims of the hotel in his estate. Criminal Enterprise Victims Josh Marshall at the Talking Points Memo is among those who have suggested that his spending was far in excess of his apparent source of income, and that he may have been engaged in some form of illegal activity which could conceivably even have caused him to decide to end his life. The shooter reported his source of income in real estate transactions as $1,000,000 per year from ""gambling"", which as Josh Marshall accurately points out, is pretty much impossible given the type of gambling that he engaged in which is overwhelmingly biased in favor of the House in the long run. Professional gamblers play games like poker where it is possible, at least in principle, to win in the long run without cheating. But, he didn't play those kinds of games with any frequency. One of the more plausible explanations for why he would gamble so much is that it is a form of money laundering that allows him to turn ill gotten gains that he would use to purchase chips at casinos into gambling winnings, in exchange for the house's inevitable net gains from his bets in the long run (which can be a pretty small percentage transaction cost, on average, compared to other forms of money laundering). If so, others may have claims against his estate, that compete with the claims of the shooting victims, under statutes such as RICO, based upon this conduct if there was any. Criminal Conspiracies Of course, if evidence came out that this was actually done at the direction of some criminal syndicate (perhaps to raise the price of gun company stocks?), that would be another thing entirely and one could sue the other conspirators (as well as prosecuting them criminally), but there is nothing strong enough to file a case in court that would survive an attorneys' Rule 11 obligations to file claims with a genuine factual basis at this point. It would be an avenue to investigate on the long shot possibility that this conspiracy theory was true. Such conspiracies are not entirely unprecedented. One mass shooting incident in Germany recently that was originally believed to be a terrorist attack turned out to have been motivated by a desire to influence the financial markets. Life Insurance Policies Everyone who has a life insurance policy that was killed could make a claim against that policy. The harder legal question is whether people who had only ""accidental death"" life insurance policies could make claims in this case. Worker's Compensation Claims Everyone who was killed or injured while on the job at the scene (e.g. roadies for the concert, security guards, police, photographers working the show) could make a worker's compensation claim against their employer's worker's compensation policy. This would include medical costs, lost wages and funeral expenses. Health Insurance Everyone with health insurance who was injured who was not on the job could make a health insurance claim for their medical costs. CGL, Auto and Homeowner's Insurance Claims Most comprehensive general liability insurance (CGL) policies of businesses would cover property damage in this incident. Most automobile insurance policies (but certainly not all) would cover damage to a car in this incident. Most homeowner's and renters insurance policies would cover property damage to property other than a vehicle in this incident. It wouldn't be unusual for a CGL policy for the concert organizers or the venue would have a provision that covers medical expenses up to a small dollar limit for injuries sustained by invitees (i.e. concert goers) at the concert or venue as the case might be. But, it wouldn't be unusual for there to be no such coverage. Travel Insurance Claims From the comments: Many tourists from the UK would have travel insurance. Other European
  countries probably as well. I checked the online terms of a random UK
  company, they would pay for the cost of hospital treatment or funeral
  in case of ""unexpected injury"", and I seriously hope they wouldn't
  claim that if someone fires a gun at you, an injury would be
  ""expected"". Plus travel related expenses, like transport home, just
  losing your flight etc. The one I checked wouldn't pay for disability
  except for ""personal injury"", that is something you caused yourself.
  And no compensation, just the actual financial loss. Tort Claims Of People Not Personally Injured The tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress tort, which is recognized by Nevada, while by its terms applicable only to ""negligence"" cases not at issue here, allows recovery by someone who had a near miss with physical harm and suffers emotional distress as a result. There is a reasonable chance that Nevada courts would allow this tort to be applied to ""near miss"" cases of intentional physical injury. Pretty much anyone on the scene (roughly 22,000 people) could arguably make such a claim against the shooter's estate. Spouses of people who are injured can often make a claim for ""loss of consortium"" in Nevada for physical harm to their spouse, even if they are nowhere near the scene of the incident. These claims could be made against the shooter's estate. This would allow claims by several hundred people in this situation. Many of the wrongful death claims would be statutory claims of next of kin, rather than claims brought by their estates. these would be brought against the shooter's estate. Trivia Point If this had happened on certain Indian Reservations, there probably would have been federal liability to all Indians harmed in the attack, as the federal government has liability for all criminal harm caused by ""bad men"" on the Indian Reservations in question to Indians under the treaties creating those reservations. But, obviously, the Las Vegas strip is not in Indian Country, even though many casinos in the U.S. are in Indian Country."
"If applied in the United States, what is the most obvious legally functional difference between the British and American ""mirandizing"" phrase?","So the most obvious is that the U.S. Miranda Rights specifically mention right to legal counsel and right to state provided legal counsel (Public Defenders) if you cannot afford legal counsel (Contrary to some opinions, these guys are very good at their job... it's just that they are also very over worked and private industry pays better).  While the right exists in the U.K., the U.K. version of the required reading of rights only speaks to right against self-incrimination, which, if you want a difference is a good place to look. In the self-incrimination clauses, the U.K. and U.S. versions are very different.   The U.K. right is a qualified right where as the U.S. is an absolute or unqualified right.  This is a distinction which sounds silly upfront but is very serious in how things will transpire. Suppose that you are arrested for the murder of your spouse.  You definitely did not do and the ""one armed man"" definitely did.  Either way, you remain silent during interrogation.  At trial, your defense is ""It wasn't me it was the one armed man"" and you intend to present evidence of this.  In the U.S. this would be permitted, no further questions asked (or at the least, defeated by other means unrelated to you giving the cops the cold shoulder).  In the U.K., this would be first be challenged by the prosecution with ""Why didn't you say this when you were arrested?"" and your silence on this matter will be used against you. In fact, asking that challenge in the U.S. is very inappropriate, as was recently seen in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, where the Prosecution did ask that up front to Rittenhouse, prompting a scolding from the judge out of view from the jury. The reason for this is that in the UK there are more strict rules placed on cops during interrogation than there are in the U.S. (In the former, cops cannot lie to you about the facts of the case and they cannot interrupt your statements to them once you start to respond.   This is par for the course in the U.S. for cops.  In fact, in the U.S., shouting ""It was the one armed man"" on arrest can do more damage than just shutting up until you're before a judge and jury since that lets the prosecution use the implausibility of a one armed man against you (in both nations, statements that are against your interest do not violate hearsay rules, thus, the cops will only use such a statement against you... it's your job to prove it true or at least plausible enough to make a jury doubt the cops are right.). Also note that this is England and Wales jurisdictions only.  Scotland, having its own legal system, retains the right against self-incrimination as an absolute right. Also a big obvious one but the read rights would not be called the ""Miranda Rights"" by the police or legal community (it may be, by the crooks they are arresting who have no clue that the TV version might be the U.S. one since it's more likely to get shown there than on U.K. TV.).   In the U.K. they would be called ""Standard Cautions"" or ""Reading the rights"".  The U.S. name derives from the SCOTUS case  Miranda v. Arizona which was the ground-breaking case that made this required by all police when interrogating a suspect.  Additionally, each state has their own version, which generally reads the same way (they explain your 5th and 6th Amendment rights to silence and an attorney) and may vary on asking if you choose to waive the rights upon receiving an affirmative answer that the rights were understood (""With these rights in mind, do you wish to speak to me?"" is the proper phrasing).  They also are read from cards (business card to index card sized) where the right is printed in English and Spanish and the suspect must sign it as part of acknowledging that their rights were read."
Is the requirement to have positive attitude discriminatory?,"Almost certainly not. See, e.g., Lopez-Mendez v. Lexmark Intern., Inc., 680 F.Supp.2d 357, 375 (D.P.R. 2010) ""This incident, however, is not sufficient to constitute direct evidence of discriminatory animus...[Defendant's agent]'s anecdote could be interpreted as emphasizing the importance of a positive attitude, rather than plaintiff's interpretation that it expressed a preference for younger male employees...This benign interpretation seems more plausible...In light of these facts, there does not appear to be any evidence on the record that gives a 'high degree of assurance' that discriminatory animus was behind the decision to terminate plaintiff"" (emphasis added). NOTE: OP's original question was simply whether listing 'positive attitude' on a job description was illegal. OP has now changed the question to whether making employment decisions based on a depressed individual's lack of a positive attitude is illegal. Although I have great sympathy for those with mental illness and personally wish the law were different, my answer is still that this is almost certainly legal. Another example of a court finding attitude to be a legitimate reason upon which to base employment decisions is: Martin v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., 126 F.Supp.2d 809 (M.D. Pa 2000). In this case, the court accepted as a legitimate reason for promoting one individual over another that the promoted individual ""demonstrated good interpersonal skills."" Id. at 817. A third example is Lloyd v. Swifty Transp., Inc., 552 F.3d 594 (7th Cir. 2009). In this case, the Seventh Circuit explicitly noted that ""[t]he employer, not a court, determines what functions are essential, and we will not second-guess that decision."" Id. at 601. It then went on to affirm dismissal of the plaintiff's ADA claim because the employer ""said that lead drivers must have knowledge of the mechanics of the trucks and be able to manage the other drivers on the truck through a positive attitude and ability to get along well with others. But the supervisors in charge of hiring lead drivers testified without contradiction that [the plaintiff] had a negative attitude that drew complaints from other drivers."" Id. at 601-602 (emphasis added). After a relatively exhaustive search, I've found no case to counter these pretty clear statements that basing employment decisions on 'attitude' is legal. FURTHER NOTE: OP has now modified the question again to add the qualification that the lack of a positive attitude ""doesn't prevent the employee from doing their job."" IF this were actually true, then the answer likely becomes that illegal discrimination has occurred because then the employee would be 'otherwise qualified' (a key phrase in employment law litigation). BUT, there is an inherent contradiction in premises in OP's question now because if X is a requirement of a job, and Y employee cannot do X because of Z, then Z is preventing Y employee from doing that job. In other words, if a job requires a positive attitude, then one can't do that job without a positive attitude. Ultimately, what OP's question is really trying to get at is 'what if the employer makes 'positive attitude' a job requirement, but I don't think it should be a job requirement?' Unfortunately, there's almost certainly no legal recourse for this as long as it's a legal job requirement because, to reiterate the 7th Circuit, ""[t]he employer, not a court, determines what functions are essential, and [a court] will not second-guess that decision."" Id. at 601."
"If someone orders a pizza in the US and doesn't pay for it, could they be arrested?","Yes. See Florida Man's Version of Dine and Dash Involving A Pizza Delivery James Chandler was arrested after allegedly ordering a pizza and cinnamon sticks and partially eating them without paying.  The basis for arrest was defrauding an innkeeper. Any person who obtains food, lodging, or other accommodations having a value of less than $1,000 at any public food service establishment, or at any transient establishment, with intent to defraud the operator thereof, commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083 (Emphasis added; this is the current text of the law, but ""less than $1000"" was ""less than $300"" at the time of the incident.) For anyone doubting this or looking for more detail, the case number is 2016MM002854A before the Circuit Court of St. Lucie County, Florida, and not only was he arrested, but he was convicted and sentenced to 60 days in county jail. The above example was pizza by delivery.  For an example involving dine-in pizza see Crime briefs: Father's Day fight, copper theft, unpaid pizza bill a woman was arrested at Blue Line Pizza in California on suspicion of ""defrauding an innkeeper"" after refusing to pay the bill. Another Florida example is Off The Beat: Price of pepperoni pizza and vodka? A trip to jail: Brown’s bill was $30.36, consisting of three Ketel One vodka drinks ($19.50), a pepperoni pizza ($9) plus tax ($1.86). ... Told by a deputy that the restaurant wanted her to settle up her tab, Brown said she brought no money ... Deputies arrested Brown on charges of defrauding an innkeeper and obstruction without violence. The above case is 19001773MMAXMX of Marion County, Florida.  She entered a plea agreement, whereby she pled no-contest to the non-violently resisting in exchange for the defrauding an innkeeper not being prosecuted, and was sentenced to time served (about 3 days in jail) and $735 in fees and fines. Also, see Selma [North Carolinia] police: Arrested man glad to go to jail: Police were called to the Pizza Inn at 1441 South Pollock St. after the man allegedly filled his plate with food then walked out the door. Police found 49-year-old Alan Miscavage, of New Jersey across the street. Miscavage allegedly told officers he was homeless and was happy to be going to jail. He told them the jail offered free food, running water, and a place to stay until his court date. Miscavage was charged with defrauding an innkeeper for not paying for the food, and misdemeanor larceny for leaving with the food plate valued at $10.  Bond was set at $3,500. His court date was set for August 22. Also, see Police: Man didn't pay for pizza, tried to flee from officers: A Lemoore man was arrested Sunday for allegedly defrauding a pizza delivery driver and trying to flee from police. The Hanford [California] Police Department was called to the 900 block of West Sixth Street at 10:37 p.m. for a report of a man refusing to pay for a pizza delivered by a Pizza Hut delivery driver. Officers found Peter Delano, 59, sitting in his car eating the pizza. So, in conclusion, if you order pizza and don't pay you could be arrested for defrauding an innkeeper."

USA: Can a witness take the 5th to avoid perjury?,"Your ability to assert your Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination is not limited to cases where you are on trial or have been accused of a crime. Your ability to assert that right is also not an absolute bar against being ordered to testify: if you are given immunity, you can be forced to testify. Alice cannot hold Bob in contempt – only the judge can. Bob can explain to the judge why a simple truthful ""yes"" or ""no"" answer is not possible, if he knows how to do that (does he understand the notion of a false presupposition, or unclarity?). He could for example assert truthfully that he does not understand the question (pointing to the distinction between ""Charlie's body falling on the vase, causing it to fall and break"", and ""Charlie acting with apparent intent to break the vase"", since it's not patently obvious that the former scenario constitutes ""breaking the vase""). However (changing the scenario a bit), he has to understand that if the question is ""Did Charlie shoot Delilah?"" and the fact is that Ethan forced Charlie to shoot Delilah, saying ""No"" based on a theory of blame is not reasonably interpreted as truthful testimony. Taking the 5th, without setting forth your basis (not understanding the question) runs the risk that the prosecution will grant immunity from prosecution, and therefore you don't get to avoid answering the question. Immunity covers various things except that it does not cover prosecution for perjurious testimony. See US v. Apfelbaum, 445 U.S. 115: the Fifth Amendment does not prevent the use of respondent's immunized
  testimony at his trial for false swearing because, at the time he was
  granted immunity, the privilege would not have protected him against
  false testimony that he later might decide to give. Immunity is conferred under the control of some applicable statutory law, such as 18 USC 6002 which says that no testimony or other information compelled under the order (or any
  information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or
  other information) may be used against the witness in any criminal
  case, except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or
  otherwise failing to comply with the order."
Landlord wants access to CCTV footage after we leave and possibly in realtime while we live there,"This article basically says ""it depends"": If it is genuinely used to improve tenant safety then that is OK, but if it is used to track your private life then that is not acceptable. Cameras that cover communal areas used by several properties are generally acceptable, but cameras covering individual properties are much less so. It sounds like this falls into the latter category. Assuming you haven't got the camera yet, I suggest you write to the Landlord asking for a written justification of the cameras, and a policy for the use of the camera. E.g. it will only be viewed if an incident is reported. Once you have the justification you can then look for inconsistencies (e.g. if they aren't planning to snoop at random times, how are they going to notice someone up to no good? And how would they tell?) You could also just say ""no"". The installation of this camera probably counts as a material variation of the rental agreement. You could also propose a compromise: you will install the camera, but only provide footage as you see fit rather than allowing your landlord to view the camera at any time. CCTV installations are covered by the GDPR, so you should ask your landlord for the associated paperwork. Amongst other things they will need to state how long they want to keep the footage and provide a justification for that. ""We might want to re-run it"" is not a justification. Having all this stuff written down will help if you ever suspect he is abusing the footage. Edit Another thought: does the landlord own other properties? Are they having cameras installed too? If not, why not? They should have a policy about this."
Can people criticize the Imperial Family in Japan?,The 1947 constitution abolished Lèse majesté in Japan.
Is it considered kidnapping if an underaged teenager willingly goes with someone else without the permission of their parent or guardian?,"canada The child's will or consent is relevant to a plain kidnapping charge. The child's will or consent is not relevant to abduction charges. This answer presents Canadian law for this body of offences, divided based on who is doing the taking (because of the specific offences created for abduction by a parent). In Canada, a parent or guardian taking a child from the other parent implicates sections 279, 280, 282, and 283 of the Criminal Code. If the child is held against their will, this supports the offence of plain kidnapping under s. 279. This is an indictable offence (the higher of two categories of offences in Canada). Very young children will not possess the capacity to consent. Older children, even those younger than 14, may be capable of consent (see the discussion at paragraphs 401-417 of R. v. Al Aazawi, 2021 ABPC 155). If the child taken is under 16, the offence of abduction (not necessarily by a parent or guardian) of a person under 16 is available (s. 280). For this offence, the consent of the child is not relevant (explicitly stated at s. 286). It is considered an offence against the parent or guardian. If the taking is by a parent or guardian of a child under 14, then this supports an offence under s. 282 (abduction by a parent in contravention of custody or parenting order) or s. 283 (abduction by a parent in the absence of a custody or parenting order). Again, under these offences, the consent of the child is irrelevant (explicitly stated at s. 286). Sections 280, 282, and 283 create hybrid offences, punishable either by indictment (higher category of offence) or as a summary offence (lower category of offence). Often the age and circumstances of the taking may support multiple overlapping charges. See e.g. M.M. v. United States of America, 2015 SCC 62. That was an extradition case in which the corresponding Canadian charges were both s. 280 (abduction—by anyone—of a person under 16) and s. 282 (abduction by a parent in contravention of a custody or parenting order). Prosecution directives for this family of offences is available. E.g.: The same plain kidnapping offence will be available (s. 279) as will the offence of abducting a person under 16 (s. 280). However, there is an additional offence of abduction of a child under 14 (s. 281), also a hybrid offence. Again, the consent of the taken person is not relevant for the abduction offences (see s. 286), and the circumstances that give rise to an abduction offence are broader when the taken person is under 14 than when the taken person is merely under 16. A comparison of the elements of these two closely related offences can be found at paragraphs 17-24 of R. v. Gibson, 2018 BCSC 1869. Section 285 provides: No one shall be found guilty of an offence under sections 280 to 283 if the court is satisfied that the taking, enticing away, concealing, detaining, receiving or harbouring of any young person was necessary to protect the young person from danger of imminent harm or if the person charged with the offence was escaping from danger of imminent harm."
"Why are Hollywood studios permitted to collectively bargain with employees, and what are the limits of this apparent antitrust exemption?","The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) (together with related federal labor laws and regulations) sets the rules for what level unions are organized at in different industries, through the actions of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Most industries are organized either at the level of all of the locations of a single firm that is an employer, or at the level of a single worksite, like a particular factory or store. But a few industries are organized at the industry level, either nationally, or for everyone in an industry in a particular region. The main industries which are organized by industry rather than by employer or worksite are construction, live theater, music recording, and the movie industry. It is also done in professional sports. The reason for the special treatment of these industries is that in these industries, worksites and employers are typically in existence for only a single project. A new company is formed for each new movie, and for each new Broadway or Off-Broadway union live theater production. Similarly, in the construction industry, work is bid by different combinations of firms, each of which are independent contractors rather than employees for every new project, often for a different owner each time. Due to the ephemeral nature of the firms and worksites in these industries, it is futile to try to organize collectively bargaining on a project by project basis. So, an exception to the general rule regarding the level of organization at which unions are formed has been made in these industries. But, unions can only form collective bargaining agreements if they have employers to bargain with, and the NLRA allows suitable representatives of the employers in these industries to reach collective bargaining agreements with their counterpart unions which are exempt from anti-trust regulation for this activity. This is considered tolerable because in unionized industries, the collective bargaining agreement, rather than the market, is used to determine the compensation of union workers in that industry. Union-management negotiations are an alternative to a market basis for determining prices and working conditions. And, generally speaking, the workers with unions acting as their agents, and the employers, with the employers' associations formed for this purpose acting as their agents, which make up all of the interested parties, consent. This is in contrast to the usual anti-trust case where merchants are colluding to benefit themselves, while consumers are disorganized and are not in a position to bargain collectively."
What was the original idea behind the practice of courtroom wigs?,"The courtroom wig actually dates from an era centuries ago when it was common for the upper classes to shave their heads and wear wigs - a practice that arose for hygiene reasons. That is, at the time when this practice first arose in courtrooms, such wig-wearing simply reflected an ordinary style of dress. The practice dates from the 16th and 17th centuries. What happened since is that styles of appearance in wider society have moved on, but not amongst lawyers in the courtroom, and in the modern day such wigs have become characteristic of courtroom dress. Until the mid-Victorian era, such sartorial traditions were the least of the anachronisms carried forward from earlier centuries. There have been some reforms in recent decades that limit the archaic appearance of judges, but one of the argument for courtroom dress has always been to make the proceedings seem solemn and formal, and to depersonalise the appearance of those who participate as officers of the court."
How to discover/be aware of changes in law that might affect oneself personally?,"The short answer is that, as a practical matter, you can't be aware of every change in the law that could conceivably affect you. Even lawyers don't have enough time to keep up with every change in the law until after a specific legal issue presents itself. Firms selling legal research products have scores and hundreds of employees working full time every day to keep track of every change in the law, to the exclusion of all other working time in their lives. You can read the mainstream media and trade publications in fields in which you are engaged which often address these questions. You can take continuing education courses in your occupation or profession. You can confer with a lawyer before taking action in areas where you aren't familiar with the law. You can proceed with caution when you do something that everyone else you know of who is similarly situated is not doing. You can pay special attention to the news and government provided information during periods of major emergencies. But, the rule that ignorance of the law is no excuse is sometimes simply harsh and unfair. Nonetheless, this rule is the law with respect to most kinds of laws in most legal systems. As a practical matter, law enforcement authorities and courts will often show leniency towards someone who innocently violates a new law of which they were unaware, at least the first time, sometimes letting them off with a warning or a minimal penalty. But you have no legal right to that kind of treatment."
Is it legal to track users of pirated software?,"Building off @DigitalFire's answer, I looked into the TOS related requirements that Google Analytics puts out and I found this on Google Analytic's TOS: You will have and abide by an appropriate privacy policy and will comply with all applicable laws relating to the collection of information from visitors to Your websites. You must post a privacy policy and that policy must provide notice of your use of a cookie that collects anonymous traffic data. Apparently, Google themselves also requires you to notify users when you are using their service to track people (That's pretty good of Google). Here is a simple example of what a privacy policy would look like. There doesn't appear to be any issues with laws in other countries either.  For my purposes, I'll just implement an agreement that pops up during installation that users will have to accept. "
Can a university make rules about students' lives outside campus?,"With respect to disciplining its students and employees, a private school can basically do whatever it wants. There's more freedom to do so with respect to students than with employees, who have greater protections derived from anti-discrimination laws, collective-bargaining agreements, and the like. If a private school wants to impose a No Burger Tuesdays and a complete ban on political activity, that's probably going to be permissible. The First Amendment will protect the school's right to associate with only those who meet its standards, as absurd as those standards may be. Again, there are exceptions to this rule, like Title IX, which requires equal educational opportunities regardless of sex, but they don't have much bearing on your question. Even for a public school, there will be quite a bit of latitude here, because these rules don't actually regulate off-campus conduct. If a student wants to attend an off-campus public gathering, the campus police aren't going to lock him in his room or arrest him for leaving campus. The rule is simply that if you attend a public gathering off campus, you may not come back on campus afterward to threaten the lives of your classmates."
How does one prove paternity if the father has an identical twin?,"Can Alice still get child support, or will she be denied because she
can not definitively prove which man is the child's biological father? The legal standard is a preponderance of the evidence (i.e. more likely than not) and there is plenty of evidence that can be offered in addition to DNA evidence, such as testimony under oath from people in a position to know who was having sex with whom at the relevant times. Contrary to a common misconception, testimony under oath is still solid evidence that can support a verdict on appeal. Alice had neither a long standing romantic relationship with Bob nor
anyone that was a witness to the sexual act, thus making the question
of who she slept with difficult to prove. It isn't that hard to prove. Q to Alice's physician: Based upon an ultrasound, when did Alice
conceive? A: April 5-8, 2021. Q to DNA expert: Based upon the DNA test, who could the father be? A: Billy or Bob. Q to Alice: Did you have sex with Billy between April 5-8, 2021? A: No. Q to Alice: Did you have sex with Bob between April 5-8, 2021? A: Yes. Q to Billy: Did you have sex with Alice between April 5-8, 2021? A: No. Q to Billy: Why not? A: I was at the Shuffleboard World Cup in Tibet, I have time stamped
pictures. Q to Bob: Did you have sex with Alice between April 5-8, 2021? A: -- if Yes, judge says he believes Bob and Alice and the case is
over.    -- if No, the judge decides who among Bob, Billy, and Alice
the judge believes based upon other evidence. Ultimately, the judge has to rule between the two based upon non-genetic evidence and resolve credibility disputes just as in any other case that doesn't involve DNA evidence (which is the vast majority of cases). Also, the edge cases are few are far between. Identical twins are rare to start with, and few women have sex with more than one identical twin in the several day period when she could have conceived or didn't know which twin she had sex with. It has happened at least once in history (post-DNA testing), but you can probably count the number of times that it has ever happened on one hand. For example, presumptions from cohabitation, marriage, and claims of paternity often resolve paternity disputes without DNA evidence. Further, to the extent that there is good faith uncertainty (perhaps everyone agrees that the mother has sex with both twins on the only possible day of conception and nobody really knows), the downsides to a mistake in the larger cosmic sense of the overall paternity law system are minimal, as identical twins very rarely become deeply alienated from each other and instead tend to be close and intensely cooperative once they discover each other, and tend to be similar to each other in almost every respect depriving the child of little if the court gets it wrong. Realistically, identical twins are particularly likely to settle out of court so the judge doesn't have to decide. In one of the only two actual cases I could locate that went to trial (in Brazil), both twins were ordered to pay child support because the evidence showed that they actively conspired with each other to confound the mother and the court regarding who the father was, and conspiracies can support joint and several liability. The other case reported in a news story had convincing circumstantial evidence supporting one identical twin over the other that probably establish a presumption of paternity for one twin and not the other. One of the twins, who cannot be named for legal reasons, went to court
last summer in the hope of forcing the mother to grant him access to
the child. Although his name is not on the birth certificate, he
claims he is the only father the boy has known, cared for him every
other weekend, provided financial support and was even known to him as
'papa'. But then the man's relationship with his girlfriend broke down and the
visits halted. When he began legal proceedings to prove his paternity,
the mother made her claim that she had been sleeping with his twin at
around the same time. The twins have said they knew they were both having sex with the
woman, but argue that only one had sex during the period of
conception. Both refused to undergo a DNA test: the complainant
refused to pay the £335 charge while his brother, who has since
married and fathered children, does not consider himself involved in
the dispute. Now, however, Judge Jolin has asked the complainant to take a DNA test
by 1 December to ensure he can claim even possible paternity, while
his brother may also be tested. (The second case is in Quebec and the cost of the test in pounds is apparently a currency conversion value.) (It is possible in principle to distinguish even identical twins from each other with high coverage whole genome tests that would reveal a few random mutations in each twin out of billions of possible mutations, but it is currently prohibitively expensive to do so.) Can she even get a paternity test given that it would not be
definitive proof which man was the father? Yes. This rules out all 4 billion men in the world minus two of them. It has great probative value, narrowing the list of possible fathers down to two."
Is it legal in the USA to pay someone for their work if you don't know who they are?,"Under US law you are required to file a Form 1099 with the IRS for this payment if it was for a trade or business purpose. ( $1,000.00 is above the current reporting limit of $600.) This you cannot do without the recipient's name (personal or business) and address. You will also need their SSN or TIN. Failure to file the 1099 may be a violation of law. Private people, as well as businesses, get 1099s which are also filed with the IRS. I myself have received 1099s as a private individual for freelance work. (Corporations mostly do not get 1099s.) Private individuals as well as businesses report payments on 1099s. Such a person might be involved in unlawful tax evasion, and the demand for payment in bitcoin might support a reasonable suspicion of this. If so, you might be accused of being an accessory. If the person is foreign (non-US) and the work was not done in the US it may not need to be reported, but if you do not know the person's location you cannot safely assert that it is outside the US. If you intend to deduct the payment on your own taxes as a business expense, you may also need to have a receipt showing the recipient of the money. It would seem that if the payor/client is in the US and the work was done for a trade or business (which includes a non-profit, but not a hobby or personal site) and the amount is $600 or more, there is no safe and legal way to  hire a person or firm without knowing the name, address, and (in most cases) TIN (taxpayer identification number) of the contractor, or at least using ones ""best efforts"" to obtain the TIN. See the various IRS instructions below for details. According to the Form 1099-Misc/1099-NEC insatructions Report on Form 1099-MISC [or 1099-NEC] only when payments are made in the course of your trade or business. Personal payments are not reportable. You are engaged in a trade or business if you operate for gain or profit. However, nonprofit organizations are considered to be engaged in a trade or business and are subject to these reporting requirements. Generally, payments to a corporation (including a limited liability company (LLC) that is treated as a C or S corporation) [are not reportable]. If you are required to file Form 1099-MISC, you must furnish a statement to the recipient. Enter [in Box 3] other income of $600 or more required to be reported on Form 1099-MISC that is not reportable in one of the other boxes on the form. File Form 1099-NEC, Nonemployee Compensation (NEC), for each person in the course of your business to whom you have paid the following during the year: At least $600 in ... Services performed by someone who is not your employee (including parts and materials) (box 1); Generally, you must report payments to independent contractors on Form 1099-NEC in box 1. If the following four conditions are met, you must generally report a payment as NEC. Instructions for Form 1042-S specify that one must report for foreign payees: Compensation for independent personal services performed in the United States. General Instructions for Certain Information Returns says: Recipient names. Show the full name and address in the section provided on the information return. If payments have been made to more than one recipient or the account is in more than one name, show on the first name line the name of the recipient whose TIN is first shown on the return. ... TINs. TINs are used to associate and verify amounts you report to the IRS with corresponding amounts on tax returns. Therefore, it is important that you report correct names, social security numbers (SSNs), individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs), employer identification numbers (EINs), or adoption taxpayer identification numbers (ATINs) for recipients on the forms sent to the IRS."
Can you be charged with employee theft after being fired?,"If you are facing felony charges, you need to hire a criminal defense lawyer, not ask for legal advice on the Internet.  Do not talk to the police without your lawyer present.  Do not attempt to represent yourself in any kind of hearing. Ignore any advice based on what seems fair or reasonable to someone on the Internet unless it is based on a real case in North Carolina or written by a real lawyer. That said, it appears to me that you have at least two strong defenses.  First, if you you returned the laptop (It will help if you sent it by registered mail or otherwise kept a receipt, although, remember, they need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you kept it), that shows you had no “intent to steal” or “purpose to steal” it, which is a necessary element of the crime.  Second, according to the University of North Carolina criminal law blog, you appear to have been charged with the wrong offense (although I don’t think that will actually help you if the prosecutor decides to bring the charge that matches what your former employer alleges you to have done).  It cites a relevant North Carolina Supreme Court ruling on the difference between larceny and embezzlement, State v. McDonald, 45 S.E. 582 (N.C. 1903). I would focus on getting yourself cleared of these charges first.  You can ask your lawyer if there is any recourse you might have against your former employer.  I’m skeptical that suing them would be worth it, but I don’t know the circumstances.  If you have proof of what they said to you and about you, hang on to it."
Do I really have to Open Source my project?,"You need to know two things about the GPL: The GPL is a license which requires that when you distribute binaries, you distribute the source code with them (binaries being the things you can directly run) The GPL is copyleft - any project using something licensed under the GPL must also be licensed under the GPL The easiest way to comply with the first point is to simply make the software open source by making it available to all online. Many, if not all, large projects licensed under the GPL do this. The other way of complying is to simply give anyone else who has a copy of the binaries, or who makes use of them, a copy of the source code. In your case, all you need to do is send your friends a copy of the source. As long as no one else uses this project, I think you satisfy the requirements of the license. You must, however, also license your code under the GPL. This means, as mentioned in the comments, that you must somehow make your friends aware that if they redistribute your code, they must also do so under the terms of the GPL. This can be as simple as including a file called LICENSE in the root directory of the source code, containing a copy of the text of the GPL. This further means that your friends will be able to share your code with other people without letting you know. You could politely ask them not to, but you can't stop them. (That said, you have no reason to be worried - only big breaches of license misuse by large companies ever tend to get chased up. However, it's great that you want to be careful about this! Software licensing, especially FOSS licensing, is very important.)"
"Would a giant ""F*** BIDEN"" flag mounted on a truck be first amendment protected?","The First Amendment controls in the US, so it does not matter if this is Idaho or Berkeley CA. This is clearly an expression of a political viewpoint, which is protected by the First Amendment. Any attempt to suppress a political viewpoint by appeal to ""obscenity"" or ""zoning"" or the like will ultimately fail in the courts. The word fuck is not lewd, filthy, or disgusting, and clearly does not constitute ""obscenity"". There is a test, the ""Miller test"", for obscenity, that requires all three of these conditions to be met: (1) whether ‘the average person, applying contemporary community
standards’ would find that the work, ‘taken as a whole,’ appeals to
‘prurient interest’ (2) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law,
and (3) whether the work, ‘taken as a whole,’ lacks serious literary,
artistic, political, or scientific value. The word fuck is not obscene under this test, especially in this context."
Can I tell police to wait and call a lawyer when served with a search warrant?,"You cannot legally force police to wait to carry out the search. They can search even if you are not present. In fact, they are required to execute the warrant within a certain time frame, which precludes delaying the execution of the warrant. You can inspect the warrant to see if it is ""proper"" (has the judges name, correct address, is a search warrant and not a warrant of
removal/deportation...). Calling a lawyer is always wise, but that does not stop the search."
Is harmlessly appearing to be a school bus driver a crime?,"Setting aside kidnapping, child-endangerment, etc., there are a host of laws requiring the bus and the driver to have special licenses (ie, a commercial drivers license), inspections (including a physical and regular drug tests), training, insurance and so on. Breaking any of these laws is a crime. In most states, these crimes are treated as misdemeanors or gross misdemeanors, so the largest penalty will be something like a year in jail and/or $5,000 fine.  In other words: Even before the prosecutor gets to the serious stuff, the driver is in trouble.  For those of you who want to dig into the details, this page breaks out what you need to do to become a school bus driver in CA. This page links to the manuals for drivers and buses in WA, along with a list of all of the specific laws and administrative codes involved.  "
Does someone in the U.S. illegally have the same rights in court as a U.S. citizen?,"Everyone physically present in the US is protected by the US   Federal constitution. (In some cases persons not physically in the US also have protection from the US constitution. When that applies is too complex for this answer.) Most of the rights protected by that constitution are available to anyone present, whether citizen, lawful immigrant, lawful visitor, or a person in the US without lawful authority. A few rights, such as the right to vote and to run for public office, are limited to citizens. If a person was arrested but not informed of his or her Miranda rights, then statements made to the arresting officers (or later interrogating officers) would not be admissible in court, unless an exception to the Miranda rules applies, which is unlikely. I can't say if this happened in the particular case mentioned in the question. In general, in the area of criminal procedure, there is no difference between citizens and others subject to US jurisdiction (accredited foreign diplomats normally have immunity). A few crimes can only be committed by citizens (or others owing allegiance to the US) such as treason. A few crimes, such as unlawful entry to the US, can't be committed by citizens, as citizens automatically have a right to enter. But criminal procedure and constitutional rights affecting criminal procedure, are the same for all in the US, citizen or not. (Oh, there are special laws for minors, but that isn't a matter of citizenship.)"
"Is wearing ACLU's ""Let People Vote Pin"" to the polling place considered electioneering?","Illinois law has a bit more to say about ""electioneering"" in 10 ILCS 5/9-1.14. The core is any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication, including radio,
television, or Internet communication which is really about ""communication"", and certain other factors which are about ""electioneering"". Such buttons clearly are not ""communication"": the question is whether the court would apply a whole-act or whole-code canon to supply a definition when one is statutorily missing. The part that identifies ""electioneering"" is: (1) refers to (i) a clearly identified candidate or candidates who
will appear on the ballot for nomination for election, election, or
retention, (ii) a clearly identified political party, or (iii) a
clearly identified question of public policy that will appear on the
ballot ... (3) is targeted to the relevant electorate, and (4) is susceptible to
no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or
against a clearly identified candidate for nomination for election,
election, or retention, a political party, or a question of public
policy. The button fails to constitute electioneering in that sense, because any association between the slogan and a particular candidate is unclear. On a balance of probabilities, it most likely refers (negatively) to particular candidates, but the law is framed in terms of clear statements, and not vague implications. The law states a prohibition, but does not clearly say what the consequences of a violation are. Presumably, polling officials will tell an offender to remove the button. Under 10 ILCS 5/29-11, Failure to comply with order of election authority. Any person who
knowingly fails or refuses to comply with any lawful order of an
election authority issued by the election authority in the performance
of the duties of the election authority, shall be guilty of a Class A
misdemeanor. Then the prosecution would have to prove that the order was lawful. A judge is highly unlikely to read just the part of the definition that says ""to take an active part in an election"" (because then ""I voted"" stickers would be illegal). The whole definition specifically limits this to candidates and parties (which omits ballot propositions: that definition is defective)."
What happens to Donald Trump if he refuses to turn over his financial records?,"According to this Washington Post story: Vance is seeking the records from Trump’s longtime accounting firm, Mazars. Thus Trump himself will not be able to refuse to provide the tax return information. Should the accounting firm refuse, it could be held to be in contempt of court, and fined. It is even possible that a responsible person from the firm would be jailed until the firm complies. I do not see what additional appeals or legal recourse there might be against turning over the returns. But I cannot say that none could be available. There might be arguments that lawyers for Trump or the accounting firm could still raise. News stories published on 23 Feb 2021 say that Mazars intends to comply with the subpoena. The New York Times story ""Supreme Court Denies Trump’s Final Bid to Block Release of Tax Returns"" said: The firm has said it will comply with the final ruling of the courts, meaning that the grand jury should receive the documents in short order. On Monday, Mazars issued a statement saying it “remains committed to fulfilling all of our professional and legal obligations.”"
"If a moderator of an online forum edits my post to say something illegal, how could I prove I didn't write the incriminating message?","You do not have to. The burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove that you made the threat. Reasonable doubt exists in the circumstances that you describe, that there are no logs of who accessed what when and how. Your attorney may have to introduce expert witnesses who can explain how it is possible that text from your computer can end up on a web page, and they can testify that there are many ways that data can be entered into the database, only a few of which actually involve you."
Why is knowledge inside one's head considered privileged information but knowledge written on a piece of paper is not?,"The privilege against self-incrimination in the US 5th amendment isn't a right to not testify if you don't feel like it. It doesn't say ""a person may not be compelled to testify"" it says ""nor shall [a person] be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself"". It's not that the information in your head is privileged in the way that communication with a lawyer is. Rather the 5th amendment confers the right to not be forced to testify against yourself. The right isn't intended to protect against revealing information you don't want to reveal, but rather to protect against the government putting you in a position where you are legally compelled to give criminal evidence against yourself or else suffer some penalty for refusing to give the evidence (such as the penalties for perjury, or by having the refusal to testify itself taken as evidence of guilt). As such it isn't simply ""this information is in my head, therefore it's privileged and I don't have to give it to the state if I don't want to"". There has to be a real danger that responding to a specific request would incriminate you: To be self-incriminating, the compelled answers must pose a “substantial and ‘real,’ and not merely a “trifling or imaginary hazard” of criminal prosecution. Source: https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment A judge can overrule a claim of the privilege if it is clear that complying with the request cannot possibly self-incriminate. And if a witness has been granted immunity from prosecution for some criminal act, answering questions about that crime can no longer pose any danger of leading to criminal prosecution and thus they can no longer ""plead the 5th"" to those questions. Also, while the contents of pre-existing documents generally cannot be protected by the right against self-incrimination (because you weren't legally compelled to write those documents), it is possible to refuse to hand over documents when revealing the existence of the documents is itself giving the government new self-incriminating evidence: What the privilege protects against is the compulsion of testimonial disclosures. … A person may be compelled to produce specific documents even though they contain incriminating information. If, however, the existence of specific documents is not known to the government, and the act of production informs the government about the existence, custody, or authenticity of the documents, then the privilege is implicated. Source: https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment5/annotation04.html#who Basically, it's not the information itself that is privileged, nor a distinction of what medium the information is stored in. It's the specific act of self-incrimination that is privileged, so that the government cannot compel you to do that."
Why wasn't the attorney general's fraud lawsuit against Trump thrown out for lack of standing?,"Trump's case seems to fall on these grounds since the ones defrauded did not file the lawsuit. Why was it not thrown out on these grounds? New York State law gives the attorney general the authorization. From Executive (EXC) chapter 18, article 5, section 63, detailing the duties of the attorney general of the State of New York (emphasis by me): 12. Whenever any person shall engage in repeated fraudulent or illegal
acts or otherwise demonstrate persistent fraud or illegality in the
carrying on, conducting or transaction of business, the attorney general may apply, in the name of the people of the state of New York, to the supreme court of the state of New York, on notice of five days, for an
order enjoining the continuance of such business activity or of any
fraudulent or illegal acts, directing restitution and damages and, in an
appropriate case, cancelling any certificate filed under and by virtue
of the provisions of section four hundred forty of the former penal law
or section one hundred thirty of the general business law, and the court
may award the relief applied for or so much thereof as it may deem
proper. The word ""fraud"" or ""fraudulent"" as used herein shall include
any device, scheme or artifice to defraud and any deception,
misrepresentation, concealment, suppression, false pretense, false
promise or unconscionable contractual provisions. The term ""persistent
fraud"" or ""illegality"" as used herein shall include continuance or
carrying on of any fraudulent or illegal act or conduct. The term
""repeated"" as used herein shall include repetition of any separate and
distinct fraudulent or illegal act, or conduct which affects more than
one person. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, all monies
recovered or obtained under this subdivision by a state agency or state
official or employee acting in their official capacity shall be subject
to subdivision eleven of section four of the state finance law. In connection with any such application, the attorney general is
authorized to take proof and make a determination of the relevant facts
and to issue subpoenas in accordance with the civil practice law and
rules. Such authorization shall not abate or terminate by reason of any
action or proceeding brought by the attorney general under this section. The law quoted above gives the attorney general standing to file certain civil fraud suits despite the fact that neither she nor the state of New York was a victim of the fraud.  You can think of it as an exception to the normal rules of standing."
Job interview adjustment request was ignored. Is this an act of discrimination?,"The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that ""reasonable accommodations"" be provided to people with disabilities in both the job application process and in the workplace.  Specifically, this would be a failure to provide ""modifications or adjustments to a job application process that enable a qualified applicant with a disability to be considered for the position such qualified applicant desires"" as described in the EEOC enforcement guidelines. Software engineers generally are not required to stand up and move around much to do their jobs, so the employer wouldn't have an argument that requiring an applicant to do so in the interview process is somehow related to job requirements.  I'm a software engineer myself, and I spend almost my entire day sitting down (and very little time drawing on whiteboards, especially now that I'm not allowed to be in the building where the whiteboards are).  Possible reasonable accommodations would include getting a portable whiteboard that's lower to the ground or allowing the candidate to draw on paper instead."
How far can the meanings of commonly used words be redefined by a legislature?,"Most pieces of legislation have a “dictionary” detailing, for the purposes of that legislation (or generally) what specific words and phrases mean. This can broaden (or narrow) the definition compared to how they are used in normal English. The purpose of this is not to set a trap for the unwary, although this may happen, but to introduce precision and to allow a short defined term to be used in the drafting rather than having to explain what is meant verbosely every time it’s used. Of course, they can’t redefine terms so that they give themselves jurisdiction when they otherwise wouldn’t have it. For example, in australia, the Constitution gives the Federal Parliament the power to make laws about, among other things, “external affairs”. A law that tried to define “external affairs” more broadly than the Constitution does (which it doesn’t, so we fall back on what it means in English) would be invalid."
Are employers legally allowed to pay employees in goods and services equal to or greater than the minimum wage?,"As described, no. Paying employees with benefits instead of money is called in kind remuneration. There are various limits on in kind payments around the world, including the US. Very generally, in kind payments are only allowed for particular industries and occupations, only allowed up to a certain dollar value, and only allowed as a certain fraction of the employee's wages. Furthermore, the value of the benefit can't exceed the actual cost to the employer - a meal that's priced at $7.25 on the menu is sold at a profit, and would be worth less than the menu price as in kind remuneration. So, given the scenario described, a restaurant employer could not replace 100% of their employee's wages with food sold for the same amount. It's too high a percentage of the wage paid as in kind payment, and the menu price equivalent of the wage would not have sufficient in kind value. A more detailed description of in kind payment laws can be found here. It's a rather long document that's not particularly well-organized, and is structured by describing various aspects of law in different geographic locations, rather than describing all aspects of the law in a location-specific manner. I was able to find US-specific law by searching the document for ""United States""."
Strange Clause in Employment Contract Concerning Leaving Job,"Contracts can say all sorts of unenforceable things, you provided an example of one of them.  A person cannot be compelled to stay and work somewhere they no longer wish to work. At the risk of getting my wrist slapped for straying too far into the land of opinion, a clause like this is likely intended to take advantage of naive teenagers who will provide free employment referrals because they think they have to."
Is my employer allowed to make me work without pay?,"This is illegal, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, assuming you are not an ""exempt"" employee, which is primarily a salaried employee (your pay isn't based on how many hours you work). There are details about the complaint process here. It is useful to know that retaliation against an employee filing a legal complaint is also illegal."
"If a man is raped, resulting in pregnancy, and the woman chooses to carry the child to term, is the man still responsible for child support?","united-states The treatment of how paternity is handled in cases of rape, from which child support and child custody determinations flow, varies by U.S. state in the United States as a result of an ongoing and recent wave of legislative innovation, prompted by cases in which convicted male rapists sought child custody in connection with children conceived in acts of rape for which they were convicted. A state by state summary of the applicable laws as of January 2020 (which oversimplifies the situation in which there are additional distinctions not noted, some of which are differences in wording that could be relevant to how these statutes apply in the OP case) can be found here.  All of these laws are targeted at the case of a woman raped by a man who becomes pregnant, which is factually predominant, something that happens many thousands of times each year in the United States as a whole, and not at the case of a man who, in the course of being raped by a female, causes the female to become pregnant as a result. Cases of men being raped that are handled by the legal system, and do not involve statutory rape, predominantly involve sexual interaction that is not reproductive, i.e. something other than a man involuntarily having vaginal sex with a woman, often prison rape by a same sex inmate or rape with an object, and also, as in other cases of rape, often doesn't result in a conception of a child due to random chance. Likewise, many women convicted of rape are convicted as co-participants in a crime that involves physical penetration of a victim by a man or an object, rather than sexual intercourse with the woman convicted of the crime. So, the number of cases that could potentially be litigated with respect to this issue is much smaller. It is also worth noting that under U.S. criminal law, sexual intercourse procured by deception (other than deception regarding the person with whom one is having sex, for example, because of a blindfold or darkness, or deception regarding one's status as a medical practitioner making a medical examination, or as a law enforcement officer making a legally authorized cavity search) is not a crime and does not constitute rape. Also, generally speaking, having sex consensually in a manner not intended to lead to conception, which, in fact, does result in conception with consent to the sex giving rise to conception (e.g. where there is an agreement to ""pull out"" that isn't performed due to the acts of one or both parties involved), will almost never be prosecuted criminally as rape, whether or not a jury with perfect knowledge of the facts of the interaction could convict under the law of the minority of U.S. states where this might be possible. As @user6726 notes, the primary fact pattern related to the OP historically has involved instances of intercourse that are consensual in fact, but constitute statutory rape due to the age of the father which makes it impossible for him to legally consent, and in those cases, the default rule that the biological father of a child is recognized as the father for custody and child support purposes has been the predominant rule. But much of that case law predates modern rapist-paternity statutes and there is an equal protection argument that those statutes should have a parallel construction, although to the best of my knowledge, there are no reported appellate cases that have tested that issue. It remains an open issue of first impression in most, if not all, jurisdictions that have adopted rape-paternity statutes. In Minnesota, which had not adopted such a statute as of January 2020, being raped would not be a defense to a paternity, child custody, or child support claim."
Why is Trump's alleged fraud in New York not prosecuted as a criminal offense?,"In the U.S., public official enforce the law with both civil actions and criminal actions as they deem appropriate. In this case, the NY attorney-general did bring a separate criminal case against the Trump Organization and one or more of its top officials, and has another criminal case pending against Trump himself, but decided not to bring criminal charges for this case. Civil enforcement actions are routine for government officials in every U.S. state and local government, and for the federal government. Most kinds of white collar legal violations are predominantly enforced through civil enforcement rather than criminal charges, in part, because this is perceived as less harsh and because it affords the government a wider range of remedies. There are many legal protections for defendants in criminal enforcement actions brought by the government, that are not present in civil actions. For example, in a civil action: the case has to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt; the defendant can be compelled to testify (or have a refusal to testify held against the defendant); the defendant can be compelled to provide documents in the defendants' possession; a finding of no liability can be appealed; fewer steps of the case must be conducted in person in open court; economic damages can be awarded be beyond a statutory fine and ""restitution"" which is narrowly defined as actual out of pocket losses, and can instead include, for example, disgorgement of unjust gains received and punitive damages; civil consequences such as the termination of licenses, injunctive relief, placing assets and companies in receivership, and orders to judicially dissolve companies are available; there is not a right to a speedy trial in a civil action; the scope of the right to trial by jury in a civil action is narrower and permits judges to enter ""summary judgment"" prior to a trial on the merits; and indigent defendants are not entitled to counsel at state expense (probably not an issue in this case). Also, even if there are arbitration clauses between the offender and the victim, a civil action by a government official to enforce the same rights is not subject to the arbitration clause. But, some remedies available to the state are different in a criminal action than in a civil action: a losing defendant cannot be incarcerated simply for losing (brief incarceration could be authorized for the separate offense of defying the court during the case); the collateral effects of being a felon if convicted do not apply."
"Is it illegal to restore a car in my own driveway in Orange County, CA?","Yes, in Orange County, CA, in a residential zone or on residentially-developed property, this is a code violation. Specifically you are looking at Title 3, Division 13, Article 1, Sec 3-13-4(11): Sec. 3-13-4. - Prohibited Conduct. 

Except as provided in section 3-13-6, exemptions, it shall be unlawful for any responsible party having charge or possession of any real property in county territory to:...

(11) Keep, store, or maintain upon any premises under his/her control any abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicle, or part thereof, except as permitted by Table 3-13-6(c). You may store/work on this vehicle from a building or location that is not visible from the street, but you cannot work on or store the vehicle on the street or driveway. You might also be able to erect a 6' tall opaque fence around the car, provided the fence meets standards. The code making this illegal is a county ordinance for Orange County, CA, which is not applicable to other counties in California (other counties/cities may have their own ordinances). Codes which cover this sort of activity are generally made at the county or city level. They vary dramatically from location to location, and are often different based on the zoning of the property within the county or city."
How to satisfy GDPR's consent requirement for IP logging?,"In the question, you write: The GDPR requires consent of the subject for collection or storage of personal data (in this case, IP addresses in a log file). No, it does not. To quote Miss Infogeek:
GDPR DOES NOT MAKE CONSENT A MANDATORY REQUIREMENT FOR ALL PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA. Consent (Article 6 (1)a) is indeed one of conditions that can be used to comply with the GDPR requirement that processing must be lawful, but it is not the only condition  available to the controller to ensure lawful processing – there are alternatives (before the list of conditions it says that ""at least one of the following"" must be satisfied). All the conditions for lawfulness of processing are spelled out in Article 6 of the GDPR.  One of alternatives are Article 6 (1)f. It says says it is legal to process personal data if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child. (my emphasis) As noted in the question, logging IP addresses for the purpose of security is an extremely widespread practice. It is a legitimate interest to comply with standard security practices. It is the default, and most (all?) web-sites do this. I.e. it is legal to do this without consent (if this is not the case, I am pretty sure the outcry had been heard all over the Internet by now)."
Is it okay to admit to the police that you were speeding? Are there any benefits?,The benefit of not confessing is that they have no confession from you.  If you decide later to challenge it on some basis you will have given up any advantage you may have had to get the case dismissed.

Is it true that a teacher can't engage/attack a shooter from behind during a school shooting that is in progress?,"Is it true that a teacher can't engage/attack a shooter from behind
during a school shooting that is in progress? No. Any use of force of any kind that only harms or kills the shooter who is actively engaged in a school shooting (and indeed, even if it caused bodily injury that isn't grave or deadly to someone else who is innocent) is always justified. You can't shoot someone who is not an ongoing threat to others if they flee, in order to arrest or punish them (e.g. an unarmed shoplifter), but under the leading constitutional case, Tennessee v. Garner, this limitation doesn't apply to murderers and mass shooters anyway, at least if they continue to pose a future threat."
Can a car seller refuse to sell the car after the contract has been signed and the deposit has been paid?,"Nope, the seller can't refuse ""to sell"". They have sold it. They sold it right at the moment the contract was created (which, depending on where they were, would not necessarily even need to be in writing). The deposit is irrelevant. What is relevant is that now your friend must pay the full balance, and the seller must hand over the car. If the seller does not do that, that is a breach of contract which can be fixed by going to the court and obtaining an order to hand the car over."
Will Florida Social Media Bill Allow Trump back Online?,"The law regulates certain activities by large social media platforms (defined) and declares certain activities to be an ""unfair or deceptive act or practice"", which is already illegal Fla. Stat. 501.204 and analogous laws exist throughout the US. The key provisions of this law are that standards for censorship (defined), deplatforming, and shadow banning must be described in detail and published, and must be applied uniformly to users. SE, take notice. The law also outlaws bans without notice or opportunity to retrieve certain information, and must ""[i]nclude a thorough rationale explaining the reason that the social media platform censored the user"". However, traditional bans without notice are still legal in the case of posting obscene content. §4(1)(h) specifically addresses political candidates, disallowing the banning of a candidate ""beginning on the date of qualification and ending on the date of the election or the date the candidate ceases to be a candidate"". The law does not require a platform to rescind existing bans (etc.) when a person becomes a candidate (defined in Fla. Stat. 106.011(3)(e) as ""A person who files qualification papers and subscribes to a candidate’s oath as required by law"", which is a subset of the criteria under the campaign financing law and excludes write-in candidates), so insofar as Trump has been already banned and is not a candidate for public office, this law has no effect on him. It would have an effect on a future Trump who is not already banned, and who is an actual candidate. Whether or not a ""compelled speech"" argument would persuade the courts is unclear. California's Prop 65 compels speech, as do cigarette warnings etc. Commercial speech can be compelled, provided that the law doing so addresses a compelling government interest. Preventing deceptive and unfair trade practices are legally already an accepted government interest. The law allows viewpoint-based discrimination: what is disallowed is not stating explicitly what viewpoints are prohibited. That does not mean that SCOTUS could not find that the requirements for explicitness and equal application of the rules to all users is itself an excessively onerous burden on a company's rights, but this narrows the grounds for overturning the law."

Can a nation A stop nation B from issuing visas to citizens of nation A?,"I assume the goal here is for nation A to prevent citizen A1 from travelling/emigrating to nation B. It can be done, but not in the way you're suggesting. It can be achieved by instituting exit visas. Wikipedia reference: Nepal requires citizens emigrating to the United States on an H-1B visa to present an exit permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. This document is called a work permit and needs to be presented to immigration to leave the country. Which is essentially what you're after, if I understand your question correctly. In short, nation A cannot tell nation B to not grant a particular visa. But nation A can require citizen A1 to get nation A's explicit permission to travel to nation B.  However, as you can see in the list of examples on the Wikipedia page, exit visas are not all that common and are often linked to fascist or authoritarian regimes (which means that imposing an exit visa is liably going to raise a few eyebrows in western society, to say the least).
I was genuinely surprised that Nepal still has an exit visa; I initially wrote my answer under the assumption that I would only find historical occurrences."
Can diplomats be compelled to pay rent?,"Is that so in other jurisdictions too? This is the usual rule. Similarly, there are notorious stories about diplomats in New York City running up civil parking fines of tens of thousands of dollars without paying them. (Original study)."
Why doesn't everyone in UK just pay with exempted gifts?,"In short, because the government is not required to honor your characterization of the transaction. A gift is something given without receiving anything in exchange. In almost all taxable contexts this is not a plausible argument. A judge would almost surely rule for the government that your money transfer was rent and not a gift, for example. And, if you didn't report the income that was found to be rent and not a gift, on an income tax form, you would be assessed serious penalties and might even be charged with criminal tax evasion, since the sincerity of your gift would be in doubt. Also, while in the bare example of an informal roommate arrangement, proof of the existence of a lease in the event of a dispute between the parties might not be necessary, usually contractual documents are in place to protect the rights of both parties to a transaction and those would be inconsistent with a gift characterization. For example, if you sell lumber on credit and it was treated as a gift, you couldn't sue someone who failed to pay for their lumber, and if you sold lumber for cash, it would be a clear quid-pro-quo."
Can you be made a citizen against your will and extradited?,"You can be extradited from Country A to Country B even if you are a citizen of neither. What matters is whether B can convince A to do it, which is typically on the basis of a treaty between them as well as provisions of both country's domestic criminal law. If you committed a crime in B, then fled to A, your nationality is relevant to the extent that: But you do not have to be a national of B in order for it to have jurisdiction over you in B's domestic criminal law - just as if you were still in B, they could arrest you in the normal way. They are thus entitled to request A's authorities to arrest you in A, and transfer you to B. If your alleged crime was not in B, then their claim over you has to be on the basis that their domestic criminal law allows prosecution extraterritorially. This was the case when B was Spain, A was the United Kingdom, and the criminal was former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet; while his status as a former head of state was relevant, as was whether the crimes were extraterritorial offences in the UK as well, his lack of Spanish nationality was not. A more topical example is B being the United States, A the United Kingdom, and the arrestee being Julian Assange, an Australian who is alleged to have committed various crimes under U.S. law (while not necessarily having been present in the U.S. at the time). While all extradition relationships are different, a common thread of the criminal law in general is that what matters is the circumstances at the time of the alleged acts. Retroactively making you a citizen of B may not be satisfactory to A, to the extent that A's criminal law disallows making anything illegal retroactively. The supposed nationality grant by B might trigger provision's of A's domestic extradition law concerning requirements of due process, lack of political interference, and so on, and block the action. But equally, renouncing your citizenship of B does not extinguish B's claim over you for acts you did while you were a citizen of B. This is again a feature of typical criminal law."
Is asking users to waive GDPR compliance a legal way of escaping GDPR data handling requirements?,"GDPR does not cease to apply because of the location of data storage.  It applies based on the location of the data processor, data controller, and data subject.  If you are in the EU, you are a data subject covered by GDPR.  It does not matter where the data are stored. Note that you are asked to confirm that you're aware that US laws may be less protective, but you're not asked to acknowledge that anything about the arrangement causes the ""laws of your country/region"" not to apply.  The company also does not seem to be claiming that they don't apply, although it seems that they want you to think so, and it's not clear whether they think so. You are correct that GDPR doesn't allow its protections to be waived.  A data subject may always consent to certain processing, and some processing may be performed without consent, but it's not possible to waive the right to withhold consent for processing that does require it."
"Do I have legal obligation to change the payment method at a restaurant, if they refuse to (but have the ability to) accept my credit card?","You have the legal (contractual) obligation to pay the amount that you owe for your meal. The restaurant can refuse to accept a particular kind of payment, such as check, cash, credit cards (generally or brand-specific), various cash-transfer programs, foreign currency, bitcoin or ridiculous numbers of pennies. There is no requirement that they do today what they did yesterday. If you have in your possession only a Discover card, and if they are unwilling to accept service barter as payment (washing dishes is classical), then you would have a debt to the restaurant which you must pay in a reasonable time, using an acceptable medium (such as cash, unless they don't accept cash). They cannot make it impossible or highly burdensome for you to discharge your obligation (e.g. they cannot demand Krugerrands or Mongolian  ᠲᠥᠭᠦᠷᠢᠭ as the alternative payment, unless you are in Mongolia). You were given advance notice of this possibility of non-acceptance, yet you willfully proffered a card that you knew that they were not likely to accept a second time. Your hands were not clean, and if this had gone to court, you could not expect mercy from the court on the grounds that you were surprised that they didn't accept your card."
"Airport Security - advanced check, 4th amendment breach","The 4th amendment is irrelevant because you consented to being searched as a condition of passing through security - you don’t have to fly. You cannot revoke that consent once x-ray screening or metal detection has commenced i.e. once your bags are checked, your hand luggage is in the scanner or you have entered the metal detector. The relevant issue is whether there has been a violation of the 14th amendment requiring equal treatment. If the ethnicity of your name is the sole reason you were selected for advanced screening then that is clearly a violation of this. However, if it is only one factor among several then it isn’t. However, the problem is that TSA agents are not required to articulate their reasons for selecting you (or anyone else) and indeed, they do not have to have a reason. Therefore it is almost impossible to prove that this has happened. Several cases in the wider “policing” regime have suggested that even if statistically certain groups are disproportionately targeted then that is not evidence of such targeting in a particular case. Further it is not clear if you would even have standing to sue - to prevent this kind of discrimination you have to show that you personally at risk of harm in the future. Clearly this state of affairs is problematical - there is little doubt that airport screening, not just in the USA but worldwide is tainted by this sort of bias. The data shows it as well as plenty of anecdotal evidence - I’m 1st generation Australian with UK and Australian parents, my son’s girlfriend is 2nd generation but her grandparents were Thai: she gets stopped way more than I do. This is bad not just because it’s antithetical to human rights but also because it is demonstrably less effective than purely random screening - where there is bias, that bias can be gamed. This article from a TSA employee states ""Behavior Detection Officers (the guys who walk around and watch to see if you look creepy) are useless, and there are widespread rumors within TSA that the BDO program won’t be around for much longer."" ""The guys"" are people and, like all of us, are subject to overt and subconscious bias in deciding what ""look[s] creepy"". Notwithstanding, security is never “obliged” to “skip” a search even if the reason for that search is arguably illegitimate. You made the travel arrangements and you take the risk that you will not have enough time between flights for this or any other reason."
"In the US, can a state court issue a subpoena against, arrest, try, convict, or jail the US president?","With regard to subpoenas, the Supreme Court's recent ruling in Trump v. Vance makes it clear that states can issue subpoenas to sitting presidents.  (The case in question involved a subpoena to a third party for the president's records, not to the president himself, but the opinion makes it clear that the court would apply the same reasoning in either situation.) The questions of what actions a state may take to enforce such a subpoena if it is not complied with, or of arrest / indictment / trial by a state, have never arisen and thus have not been resolved by courts."
"Is a lawyer allowed to ""rescue"" his witness on redirect, and if so, when?","This is pretty much the entire purpose of a redirect, and almost always permissible. If your witness has given an unhelpfully incomplete answer, it is not just ""advisable"" to ask those follow-up questions, but perhaps mandatory as an ethical matter."
Are judges immune from prosecution of crimes committed while acting as a judge?,"It is true that judges in the US have absolute immunity from any lawsuit for damages arising from their performance of judicial functions. This applies even if those actions were corrupt, malicious, or illegal. The only exceptions to a judge's immunity to a lawsuit is if the conduct alleged was not a judicial action, or if the judge was acting in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. See, among others, Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9.  However, the term ""lawsuit"" doesn't refer to criminal charges. Footnote 1 of Mireles specifically says criminal liability isn't blocked by judicial immunity. While a judge can't be sued for damages for rigging a trial, the judge can be prosecuted for doing that.

Is it legal for a long truck to shut down traffic?,"The department of transportation/Federal Highway Administration provides information for oversize and overweight transports. Permits The Federal government does not issue permits for oversize or overweight vehicles. This is a State option.

Nondivisible is defined as any load or vehicle exceeding applicable length or weight limits which, if separated into smaller loads or vehicles, would: In this case, a super-long girder has its value from being a single item, so the state is allowed to make a special permit to exceed the normal regulations on weight and size. The regulations what is needed for a permit and what the permit allows is state specific. Typically, the permit is single-use and bound to a specific day and route. It's also not atypical for the crossings to be closed by police before the truck convoy arrives. Even without a police escort, the special permit allows them to block the road in specific circumstances, such as taking a tight turn."
Can I trick an innocent third party into doing something that would be illegal if the third party had mens rea without either of us being guilty?,"It depends on the jurisdiction, but generally speaking, this will not permit you to evade criminal responsibility. In Ohio, for instance, the complicity statute treats the conduct you're describing as equivalent to soliciting another to commit an offense or to aiding and abetting another in committing an offense: No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense, shall do any of the following: (1) Solicit or procure another to commit the offense; (2) Aid or abet another in committing the offense; (3) Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of section 2923.01 of the Revised Code; (4) Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense. The penalty for complicity is the same as for the underlying offense, so you don't really get any kind of break for running your offense through an innocent party; you just get a pissed off witness who can testify against you."
Is it legal for employers to hire only native speakers?,"Employment discrimination based on the initial or native language of a prospective employee is probably not lawful under US federal law. Requiring the English-language skills actually needed for a particular job is lawful. Doing ""editing, writing, or translation"" obviously requires language fluency. But unless a business can demonstrate that it is impossible for non-native speakers to achieve fluency comparable to native speakers needed for a particular position, demanding a specific native language would be demanding a particular national origin, and thus be an unlawful practice. According to 42 U.S. Code § 2000e–2 It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; (emphasis added) The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has a page on ""Immigrants' Employment Rights under Federal Anti-Discrimination Laws"" which says: The law protects people against employment discrimination on the basis of their national origin. Following are some examples of employment discrimination based on national origin. ... According to Nolo's page on ""Language and Accent Discrimination in the Workplace"": A job requirement that an employee must be fluent in English is legal if fluency is required to effectively perform the position. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency that interprets and enforces the laws prohibiting discrimination, has pointed out that the degree of fluency required varies from job to job, even within the same company. Therefore, blanket fluency requirements that apply equally to the customer service department and the warehouse workers might not be legal. According to Workplace Fairness's page on ""Language Discrimination"": Language discrimination is a subset of national origin discrimination. Language discrimination refers to the unfair treatment of an individual based solely upon the characteristics of their speech; such as, accent, size of vocabulary, and syntax. It can also involve a person's ability or inability to use one language instead of another. Because language discrimination is a form of national origin discrimination, the same body of law prohibits it. ... Language discrimination is the unfair treatment of an individual solely because of their native language or other characteristics of speech, such as accent, size of vocabulary, and syntax.  ... Some courts and government agencies have said that discrimination based on language is a form of national origin discrimination because primary language is closely related to the place a person comes from ... In ""What Recent Court Cases Indicate About
English-Only Rules In The Workplace"" by Rosanna McCalipst (U. PA. JOURNAL OF LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT LAW, volume 4 issue 2) it is said that: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that it is unlawful to discriminate in the terms or conditions of employment based on one's race, religion, sex or national origin. There are two ways a plaintiff can prevail.
Either the plaintiff can prove disparate treatment, meaning the employer intentionally discriminated on the basis of one of the protected grounds, or disparate impact, meaning a seemingly neutral employment practice puts an undue burden on members of a protected class. ... The disparate impact analysis was first set out by the Supreme Court in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. 401 U.S. 424 (1971). From
that case and the decisions of various courts interpreting the holding, a burden shifting analysis has emerged. There are three steps to the analysis. First, the plaintiff must establish that the policy in question has a disparate impact on a protected class. Next the employer must defend the policy by proffering a legitimate business purpose for it. Last, the plaintiff
can still prevail if it shows there is a less discriminatory method by which the legitimate business goal can be obtained. According to ""Avoiding Claims of Citizenship and National Origin Discrimination When Interviewing, Hiring, and Onboarding Foreign Workers"" by the Dickinson Wright law firm: National origin discrimination includes, but is not limited to, discrimination due to place of birth, country of origin, ancestry, native language, and may be based on a perception that the individual looks or sounds “foreign,” or any other national origin indicator. I should add that if an employer is using ""native"" simply to mean ""a very high level of fluency and skill with the language"" then such a requirement is not discriminatory under 42 U.S. Code § 2000e–2, and quite likely not under any US law. If the employer is using ""native"" to mean ""a very high level of fluency and skill  obtained by learning the language as a young child"" then the case is less clear, and most of the precedents cited above will be of only limited significance at best. I could not find a case squarely on point where a requirement for a ""native speaker"" in either of these senses, or indeed in any sense, was challenged."
"In Québec, are restaurants legally required to provide free potable water upon request?","No. There are plenty of Quebecois laws covering what you must have water for (food prep, bathrooms, etc) and that if you are using the water in any fashion that it might come in contact with a human mouth (i.e. food preparation, etc) it must be drinking water (as defined in the document I linked), but no such laws requiring free distribution of drinking water on request by restaurants. It's worth noting, I suppose, that tap water must be provided by restaurants in their bathrooms for the washing of hands and that said water must be of drinking water quality, but they are not required to offer it in a glass, free of charge. Anecdotally, I will also note that there are laws in several other Canadian jurisdictions that DO require free drinking water on request, but those laws also do not stipulate the glass must be provided for free."
Where is the line at which the producer of a product cannot be blamed for the stupidity of the user of that product?,"There is no bright, highlighted line, but the test is generally what a reasonable person would do or expect. Not a total moron. Let's take an example of using spray-on adhesive instead of hairspray. Would a reasonable person pour wood glue into their hair? Well, Hair gel is technically a very weak glue. But would you pour a glue that is (let'S take Gorilla Glue as a typical example) labeled as skin irritant, don't get in contact with eyes and skin onto your hair, or is it a misuse of a product the producer could not have expected? 2.1. Classification of the hazardous chemical
Classification according to the model Work Health and Safety Regulations (WHS Regulations) Flammable aerosols, Category 1 H222 Gases under pressure : Liquefied gas H280 Skin corrosion/irritation, Category 2 H315 Serious eye damage/eye irritation,

H319 Specific target organ toxicity — Single
exposure, Category 3, Narcosis
H336 And that is not even the crux: reading the chemical composition and MSDS, that stuff is laden with solvents while its glue-power is what one would expect from superglue. Is it foreseeable that a reasonable person puts superglue in their hair, in any shape or form? Is it even advertised as a possible hair-product? While you can sue for anything in the US, being stupid and (in our example) dousing your hair in a product advertised as extra-strong spray-on superglue is far from what any reasonable person would do. And in this case, Devin J. Stone and Steve Lehto agree that there are no grounds to sue, product liability does generally not cover gluing your hair to your head."
Is “do not resuscitate” on a t-shirt a legal order?,"I'm not a lawyer or a medical professional, but on Wikipedia's page about DNR, we see the following quote: In the United States the documentation is especially complicated in that each state accepts different forms, and advance directives and living wills are not accepted by EMS as legally valid forms. If a patient has a living will that states the patient wishes to be DNR but does not have an appropriately filled out state sponsored form that is co-signed by a physician, EMS will attempt resuscitation. Based on this, I would hazard the guess that you can't treat anything other than those forms as legally binding, as they even ignore a living will without that state's form."
How do free-speech protections in the United States apply in public to corporate misrepresentations?,"It is legal to be wrong, it is legal to say false things in public (leaving out defamation), and it is legal to buy and manufacture signs that say false things. Moreover, the sign does not make a false statement, in that legal liability is distinct from moral responsibility. In fact, the sign helps to decrease their legal liability. Via this sign, you have been put on notice that the truck may spray a bit of gravel, so by following too closely, you are negligently contributing to the damage. This is what also underlies those disclaimer signs with ""not responsible for theft from your auto"". There is nothing ""official in appearance"" about this sign (a legal citation of a statute might have such an appearance)."
What does a search warrant actually look like? How can I recognize one?,"The exact form used can vary based on the court. At the federal level, the Administrative Office for the US Courts has a standardized form, although I don’t know that district courts have to use it. State courts obviously wouldn’t be expected to use the federal form, and I’m having a harder time turning up a blank state warrant form. The standard elements are in the federal form, though. A search warrant will have a header identifying it as a search warrant and will have something identifying the court that issued it. It will be signed by some sort of judge. The body of the warrant will be written as a command to the police to do a search, telling them where to search and what to look for. There will generally be some standard language about what to do with the property once it’s seized."
What is the legal basis of requiring permission before one can link to a webpage?,"Please see this related answer  where this is discussed, although is a slightly different context. There have not been many cases on this subject, but it appears that, at least in the US and EU, a person is free to post web pages that link to others without permission and indeed against the wishes of the operator of the destination site. However, ""deep linking"" that bypasses a login or other access control page, or an advertising page that visitors who enter via a home page would be expected to load, particularly if such deep linking deprives the destination site of revenue, may constitute copyright infringement. ""framing"" a linked page so that it appears to be part of the linking site, may also be copyright infringement, and might also be actionable under trademark law. See Nolo's page on Linking, Framing, and Inlining And the Wikipedia article on Deep linking In  Intellectual Reserve, Inc. v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry, Inc, 75 F. Supp. 2d 1290 (D. Utah 1999) deep linking was held  to be contributory copyright infringement. See The Wikipedia article on the case In that case, the content being linked to had been posted without the authorization of the copyright holder, and no fair use issue was raised by the defense. In general, courts have found that publishing a page on the web invites others to visit it and link to it. In the Wikipedia article on ""Deep linking"" (linked above) it is said that: In a February 2006 ruling, the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court
(Copenhagen) found systematic crawling, indexing and deep linking by
portal site ofir.dk of real estate site Home.dk not to conflict with
Danish law or the database directive of the European Union. The Court
stated that search engines are desirable for the functioning of the
Internet, and that, when publishing information on the Internet, one
must assume—and accept—that search engines deep-link to individual
pages of one's website. In  Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc. 508 F.3d 1146 (9th Cir. 2007)  a US court held that links to copyrighted images as part of an image search were not copyright infringement. The Ninth Circuit court of Appeals held that Google's display and caching of thumbnails was fair use, mainly because they were ""highly transformative."" However, a ToS or ELUA may be a legally binding contract between a site operator and site users. If it forbids linking, that may be enforceable, depending on the laws of the country where suit is brought. Owners of publicly accessible databases are permitted, under EU law, to impose and enforce access restrictions. See the case of Ryanair vs PR Aviation brought in the European Court of Justice."
Is it criminal for POTUS to engage GA Secretary State over Election results?,"What exactly would a prosecutor charge? State? Federal? It depends on whether it is a state or federal prosecutor.  It appears that the president has at least flirted with violating both federal and state law, in which case he may be charged by both the federal and state prosecutors, each one laying charges under the relevant body of law. Would Trump be vulnerable to Federal prosecution of the phone call after he leaves office? Yes, if the facts support such a prosecution.  It's not clear to me that the conversation constituted an unambiguous violation of the federal statute, but I have no knowledge of any precedent that might inform such a determination."
Would publicly farting on a picture of the English monarch actually qualify as treason in 1798?,"The cartoon may call back to events of 1795, where George III had stones thrown at him while he was on his way to the State Opening of Parliament. In response, the government - headed by Pitt the Younger, who is the man in the picture saying ""That is treason, Johnny"" - passed ""An Act for the Safety and Preservation of His Majesty’s Person and Government against Treasonable and Seditious Practices and Attempts"", 36 Geo. 3 c.7. We now call it the Treason Act 1795. It was one of a series of Acts that suspended habeas corpus, banned political meetings, and so on, in the wake of the French Revolution. Section 1 deals with treason, at some length, but a fart probably doesn't count. The conditions are that somebody would: within the Realm or without, compass, imagine, invent, devise, or intend Death or Destruction, or any bodily Harm tending to Death or Destruction, Maim or Wounding, Imprisonment or Restraint, of the Person of our same Sovereign Lord the King, his Heirs and Successors, or to deprive or depose him or them from the Style, Honour, or Kingly Name of the Imperial Crown of this Realm, or of any other of his Majesty’s Dominions or Countries; or to levy War against his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, within his Realm, in order, by Force or Constraint, to compel him or them to change his or their Measures or Counsels, or in order to put any Force or Constraint upon, or to intimidate, or overawe, both Houses, or either House of Parliament; or to move or stir any Foreigner or Stranger with Force to invade this Realm, or any other of his Majesty’s Dominions or Countries, under the Obeisance of his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors; and such Compassings, Imaginations, Inventions, Devices, or Intentions, or any of them, shall express, utter, or declare, by publishing any Printing or Writing, or by any overt Act or Deed The text is substantially preserved in the Treason Felony Act 1848, section 3. The 1795 Act also created a ""High Misdemeanour"" for anyone who shall maliciously and advisedly, by Writing, Printing, Preaching, or other Speaking, express, publish, utter, or declare, any Words or Sentences to excite or stir up the People to hatred or Contempt of the Person of his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, or the Government and Constitution of this Realm, as by Law established This is closer to the fart; it is a lèse-majesté provision aimed at general disrespect for the King. The provision was due to expire in 1798. I do not know the detailed timeline of its expiry and proposed renewal in relation to when the cartoon was published, but this is a plausible connection to why it was a live issue again. In Scotland, but not England, there were common-law offences of sedition and ""leasing-making"" covering the same sort of idea. They were abolished in 2010 but were long obsolete. Hume (Commentaries on the Law of Scotland, 1797) distinguishes between them by saying that leasing-making is solely verbal, a species of slander, whereas sedition is words or deeds ""for the purpose of producing public trouble or commotion, and moving His Majesty's subjects to the dislike, resistance, or subversion of the established government and laws, or settled frame and order of things."" In any event, the political cartoon is satire and does not necessarily represent a legal reality. It is mocking Pitt's heavy-handedness in the Act of 1795, and perhaps challenging the authorities to define this very cartoon as criminal. Newton's mentor, William Holland, had been imprisoned for seditious libel for publishing Thomas Paine's Letter Addressed to the Addressers, on the Late Proclamation. The proclamation in question was the one of 1792 against seditious writing, also the work of Pitt, and aimed at Paine's Rights of Man, a work advocating for (among other things) freedom of the press and abolition of the monarchy. Therefore there is a specific personal and political edge to criticising Pitt's repressive legislation."

Am I legally able to use lethal force against a police officer in defense of another?,"I'll use Washington state as my source, but laws will be similar in other states. RCW 9A.76.020 outlaws obstructing a law enforcement officer, which this would be: it is a gross misdemeanor. In using lethal force, you would have committed first degree murder, under RCW 9A.32.030. There is a defense that can be used, per RCW 9A.16.050, that homicide is justified when: In the lawful defense of the slayer, or his or her husband, wife,
  parent, child, brother, or sister, or of any other person in his or
  her presence or company, when there is reasonable ground to apprehend
  a design on the part of the person slain to commit a felony or to do
  some great personal injury to the slayer or to any such person, and
  there is imminent danger of such design being accomplished. Law enforcement officers have access to justifiable homicide defenses as well under 9A.16.040, for example (b) When necessarily used by a peace officer to overcome actual
  resistance to the execution of the legal process, mandate, or order of
  a court or officer, or in the discharge of a legal duty or (c) When necessarily used by a peace officer or person acting under
  the officer's command and in the officer's aid: (i) To arrest or
  apprehend a person who the officer reasonably believes has committed,
  has attempted to commit, is committing, or is attempting to commit a
  felony The outcome of the case would hinge in part on whether the officer's arrest and use of force was lawful. To take two extremes, if the guy on the ground had just killed a dozen people and was aiming to rack up another dozen kills, the officer's arrest would almost certainly be held to be legal and his degree of force justified. Your personal belief that the suspect was compliant and unarmed might be refuted by the facts. On the other hand, if the guy on the ground had slept with the officer's sister and the officer wanted to rid the world of this vermin, then the arrest and force would almost certainly be held to be not legal. It can be legal to use deadly force to resist unlawful arrest. See John Bad Elk v. United States, 177 U.S. 529, where the court held that if a party resisted arrest by an officer without warrant, and who had
  no right to arrest him, and if, in the course of that resistance, the
  officer was killed, the offence of the party resisting arrest would be
  reduced from what would have been murder, if the officer had had the
  right to arrest, to manslaughter The court also said where the officer is killed in the course of the disorder which
  naturally accompanies an attempted arrest that is resisted, the law
  looks with very different eyes upon the transaction when the officer
  had the right to make the arrest from what it does if the officer had
  no such right. What might be murder in the first case might be nothing
  more than manslaughter in the other, or the facts might show that no
  offense had been committed. This ruling has been somewhat eroded, in US v. Simon: We recognize that law enforcement officers are frequently called on to
  make arrests without warrants and should not be held, so far as their
  personal security is concerned, to a nicety of distinctions between
  probable cause and lack of probable cause in differing situations of
  warrantless arrests. It is for this reason we believe that the force
  of John Bad Elk has been diminished The upshot of this is that (assuming no warrant), leeway is granted to officers in assessing probable cause (I'm not sure anybody really knows at a general conceptual level what constitutes ""probable cause"". The court seems to imply that the remote hearsay used as the basis for the arrest would not have been sufficient for a warrant, but it was ""reasonable grounds"" for believing accused had committed a crime). Your premise that the officer is about to shoot would have to be substantiated by some fact, such as a declaration ""I'm gonna kill you"". Otherwise, your belief that the officer was about to commit unjustified murder would itself be unjustified. With better fleshing out of the circumstances, you could manufacture a justified-homicide scenario."
I don't like the payment methods offered by my landlord. Do I still have to pay rent?,This situation is exactly why we have the concept of legal tender. Legal tender is a form of payment that must be accepted to settle a debt. Your friend is entitled to insist on paying the rent in cash — accepting any other form of payment is at the landlord’s discretion. 
Is it illegal to withhold someone's passport and green card in California?,"Stop asking around on internet now. Your uncle needs to talk to his daughter and get his Green Card (this should be possible seeing how she is is daughter?!).
If that doesn't work right away, police must be involved without much delay, but your uncle should first consult an immigration lawyer because there are several traps he can step on. A Green card can be revoked for several reasons (some well-known and obvious, some not so obvious --- therefore consult an immigration lawyer). Among these are misusing the Green card, committing crime and abandoning a permanent residence. So, it is of utmost importance to be 100% sure you are on the positive side for these before making it official with the police. Once you made something official there is no going back!
You know, just be sure you'll not shoot your foot. Lawyer up. USCIS tells you that you are required to carry your Green Card at all times. So, not having one is troublesome and may result in it being withdrawn if you are accidentially caught. Because, well, you're acting against the law. That's a problem. The fact that there is no good reason to not hand the Green Card that is legitimately yours to you, other than to e.g. traffic people into the country with it, which is clearly a ""misuse"", further shows that trouble may be ahead. Or why would one otherwise do that (plus, keep the passport). Coyotes regularly do such things to blackmail people, and it's clearly in the realm of ""illegal"". That's a problem. This situation must be resolved, and it must be done either secretly and amicably, and quick... or by a trained, specialized professional who makes sure the blame is not with your uncle."
Is the worst version of the accusations against President Trump impeachable?,"In the cases where a federal official has been impeached in the US, the reasons have been: This tells us how Congress has in the past construed the term. So yes, the current accusations are consistent with previous interpretations of the terms used in the Constitution."
"As an employer, can I compel my employees to vote?","Nobody so far has discussed Electoral law e.g. Representation of the People Act 1983 There are various clauses that may be relevant, one of which is: A voter shall be guilty of bribery if before or during an election he
  directly or indirectly by himself or by any other person on his behalf
  receives, agrees, or contracts for any money, gift, loan or valuable
  consideration, office, place or employment for himself or for any
  other person for voting or agreeing to vote or for refraining or
  agreeing to refrain from voting. Subsection 2 similarly makes it an offence to offer employment  to induce any voter to vote or refrain from voting but somewhat less concisely.
I believe this would make such a contract unenforceable. "
Is the EU Settlement Scheme legal?,"Isn’t this discrimination since nationals do not have to apply? Yes it is discrimination. But that does not make it illegal. In fact discrimination is in general legal unless it is based on some characteristic which is specifically forbidden as a basis for discrimination (e.g. race). And in general, all of the countries in the world allow and enforce  discrimination based on nationality; for example non-nationals will not be able to run for Head of State (and additional restrictions may apply). The EU members allowing similar rights to the citizens of other EU countries is the exception, not the rule, and once the UK stops being bound by EU treaties it can impose its own legal system on non-nationals. And while EU treaties give lots of rights to EU member-countries citizens, they still allow for discrimination based on nationality (for example you cannot run for Prime Minister or MP of Spain as a foreign EU resident). Isn’t the UK Government breaking the law? This could go against EU treaties, but the point is that the UK will no longer need to comply with them. is the UK Government responsible for the harm and distress caused to the individual health and mental wellbeing? No, the UK Government is not responsible if you do not like its laws to the point that it affects your health. Is there any ground for challenging this scheme legality in court? Unlikely. In any case it will not be because you are frightened by it, any challenge would be in the grounds that the government actions act against some other UK law. For example, if the decision to make such a list was made by the Executive but it contradicts some law approved by the Parliament. If this list does not contradict any law, then there are no grounds for challenging it. Would there a breach of my human rights if I was not to apply for settle status and then subsequentially got deported (taken away from my children, home, business, etc.)? How about if I was refused, re-entry or access to public services (NHS for example)?  If you do not apply you will not have any evidence that you were settled, and the government could legitimately believe that you are irregularly in the country and try to expel you; you probably would have an opportunity to prove that you were settled even if you were not in the list but that could be way slower, more expensive, riskier and stressful than just registering now. Get this clear: that settled person list is to help you to show that you were a UK resident before Brexit and to give you the protections that are being negotiated between the UK and the EU for expatriates. Probably you could choose not to enlist, but it would work against you."
"If someone stops a potential murder by subduing a gunman, what would be the possible consequences?","He would be thanked and sent on his way. We don't generally punish people for preventing murders, even if they are rogue cops or soldiers. If you wanted him to plausibly land in legal peril, he'd probably need to do more than simply save someone's life. The most obvious possibility, I think, would be if he were to continue inflicting harm on the attacker after cuffing him. At that point, there's probably no justification for a continued use of force, so he could face assault charges there. Also possible would be that the way he handled the situation -- the amount of force he used, the failure to de-escalate, failing to call for assistance -- just violates some police or military policy. I don't know if that would jam him up in the way you're looking for, though."
Why can courts refuse evidence?,"Different exclusionary rules have different reasons. Hearsay is frequently inadmissible because it's less reliable for the court to hear Alice saying ""Bob told me that Carol hit him"" than to hear Bob saying ""Carol hit me.""  Another even more critical problem with hearsay testimony is that the defense cannot cross examine the person who made the statement in court.  If Bob is there, the defense can ask questions such as ""where did Carol hit you"" and ""did Carol use her right or left hand"" to clarify the testimony or call its veracity into question.  Alice, not having been a direct witness to the act, will not be able to respond to many of these questions. united-states Evidence obtained in violation of a constitutional right is inadmissible because admitting it amounts to allowing police or prosecutors to violate people's constitutional rights in order to obtain convictions.  Not only does an unconstitutional search itself violate the rights of the person being searched, but so does the use of evidence acquired in such a search.  See Fruit of the poisonous tree at Wikipedia and the cases linked therein, especially Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States and Nardone v. United States."
Were people born in the Confederacy eligible to run for president?,"Technically, they were born in the United States, at least under US law, and the law of any existing nation. The United States never recognised the Confederacy, nor did any other country. There are occasional wingnut groups who declare themselves separate from the United States, but a simple declaration of secession does not create a country – you also have to win the war. The Supreme Court affirmed that the secessionist states were always an integral part of the Union in Texas v. White, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 700 (1869). Since they only had jurisdiction if Texas was a state at the relevant time (some time on or before January 15, 1865), by accepting the case, they implicitly affirmed that Texas was part of the Union. Further, in the judgement itself, they explicitly stated that the acts of secession of not just Texas, but every rebel state were “absolutely null”."
Why do we need lawyers in the Judicial system?,"The law is known to everyone in theory. But as various people are said to have said,  In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not. Starting from zero and actually finding out what law is applicable to your circumstances is not a trivial matter. To have an answer you can rely on you need to do the following: Find out what law calls it. Sometimes this is obvious, but not always. Go and find the law in question. Over the last 10 years this has got much easier. It used to mean going to your city library and looking up the relevant law. These days we have Google (other search engines are available).  Find any other laws which might have bearing on the matter. This can be a long way from obvious (see below). Find any relevant appeal court cases in which something like your circumstances have arisen, and figure out how they relate to your actual situation. You may find that some of the laws which you read in Stage 3 have been ruled unconstitutional, or that the standard of evidence required to prove or disprove something about it has been set impossibly high, or that the penalties or damages have been set absurdly high or absurdly low. If you are in the US then maybe some of those precedents were set in other circuits, in which case you need to figure out what your local circuit is likely to do about it should the occasion arise. Make a calm, dispassionate decision about what to do about your situation. Many people find this extremely difficult. The answer might be life-changing. Under these circumstances making a good decision is very hard. Just to give you an idea about (3), suppose you are planning on importing something for your business. Here is a list of areas of the law you might fall foul of, off the top of my head and I've probably missed some: Tax. Trade in endangered species. Drug prohibition. Environmental protection. Biosecurity. Health and safety. Consumer protection. And that is just the criminal laws. Theories of civil liability can get really complicated. But OK, lets suppose you figure out the law, but despite your best efforts you find yourself in court (criminal or civil). Now in addition to all the law you find yourself enmeshed in a complicated bureaucratic set of rules, depending on the type of court and where you are (e.g. US rules of civil procedure). At this point you need to learn not just the rules but how to play the game they describe. Think of it like playing chess; learning how the pieces move is only the first step on the long road to becoming a competent chess player. And the legal system is like chess in another way; there are no do-overs if you make the wrong move. (Incidentally, anyone who says ""Well lets just get rid of all the complicated rules and laws"" is committing the fallacy of Chesterton's Fence. Just because you can't see why the rules are there doesn't mean there isn't a good reason). Or you could just hire a lawyer."
Can I be charged for murder if I throw peanuts at someone who has a severe peanut allergy and they die as a result of that?,"You don't specify a jurisdiction but taking the US as an example, yes you could be charged with 2nd Degree Murder - you intended to harm them but not specifically to kill them: A second situation that constitutes second-degree murder is where the perpetrator intends only to cause serious bodily harm but knows that death could result from the act. For example, in the situation above, instead of shooting Bill, Adam grabs a shovel and whacks Bill in the head with all his strength. While Adam didn't specifically intend to kill Bill when he hit him, he did intend to strike him with the shovel knowing that such a blow to the head carried with it a distinct possibility of death. Adam killing Bill in this way would be classified as murder in the second degree. In English law you'd be facing charges for Voluntary Manslaughter"
"If a contract sometimes uses the wrong name, is it still valid?","If a contract sometimes uses the wrong name, is it still valid? Yes. It is valid as long as the contract as a whole permits identifying the parties (unequivocally) and ascertaining their role with respect to the contract. Using ""Contractor"" and ""Consultant"" interchangeably despite only the former being explicitly defined seems a bit sloppy, but it does not by itself alter or invalidate the meaning of the contract. The excerpt you reproduce is self-explanatory. Its first sentence identifies the parties, and there are only two. Thus, there is no reasonable way to dispute that the second sentence means ""Contractor shall indemnify Company"", since a clause of the sort ""he will indemnify himself"" makes no sense. Moreover, the legal definitions of Indemnitor and Indemnitee (Black's Law Dictionary) clearly make reference to ""the person"" (who protects or is protected, accordingly) and ""the other"" (that is, not to self)."
Peanut butter - may contain peanuts,"When the dangerous nature of a product is or should be known to a manufacturer and the product is being used in the usual and expected manner, the manufacturer has a duty to warn of the danger. Breach of that duty can lead to liability. The case Billiar v. Minnesota Mining and Mfg contains some useful precedent for understanding the issue. It is well settled that New York law holds the supplier of a product
which it knows or should know is dangerous if used in the usual and
expected manner to a duty adequately to warn users of the product of
the danger unless the danger is obvious or well known. ... When the user is fully aware of the nature of the product and its
dangers, however, the supplier cannot be held liable for failure to
warn him....
The rationale for this ""knowledgeable user"" exception is that
knowledge of the danger is equivalent to prior notice; no one needs
notice of that which he already knows. In this particular case, plaintiff was injured mixing an electrical resin at work, but was (deemed to be) an unskilled worker. The court recites various cases where individuals with some relevant knowledge were nevertheless harmed (and won their cases), because the warnings were insufficient. Food allergies have a special treatment, thanks to the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004. Peanuts (and other things) are ""mandatory warning"" substances, where the label must say ""Contains peanuts"". Omitting the warning makes the food misbranded. Also note that warnings carry a ""prominence"" requirement, which does not exist for ordinary ingredients which are typically in illegible microprint. Paragraph (w) spells out the labeling requirement, which is well worth reading for its complexity. The law does include the escape clause that if the name of the product contains the name of the allergen, you have been warned. If plaintiff is suing the manufacturer pro se and stipulates, in lieu of competent legal advice, that they knew that peanut butter contained peanuts and that they were allergic to peanuts, but they ate it anyhow, the manufacturer will not be liable."
Can a policeman have his service weapon on him in a building that does not allow guns?,"A follow-up story appears on the local ABC television station, indicating that the security guard pleaded no contest to simple assault. The fact that the security guard was convicted of a misdemeanor does not necessarily indicate that the deputy was allowed to have the gun in the IRS office, only that the security guard's response to the situation was not acceptable. I am not able to locate any firearm policy for the Lucas County, Ohio' sheriff's office. Many US law enforcement agencies have a policy that their officers carry their firearms essentially at all times, so that they can respond to unexpected incidents even when they are off duty. At the same time, owners of private property ordinarily can admit people, or not, for any reason at all. Unless the officer has an official reason for entering a property when the owner doesn't want the officer there, the officer isn't allowed to enter. It appears that in this case the officer had no official law-enforcement reason to enter. But this case doesn't involve private property, it involves federal property. A digest from the FBI states ""Federal laws or regulations are not superseded by LEOSA. Qualified officers may not carry concealed weapons onto aircraft under the act. They also cannot carry firearms into federal buildings or onto federal property."""
Can a private person deceive a defendant to obtain evidence?,"england-and-wales PACE s78 gives the court the discretion to decide on the admissibility of confessions obtained if it appears to the court that ""having regard to all the circumstances, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it."" There is deliberately no case law guidance on this. Superior courts in the UK have been scrupulous in saying that each case turns on its merits. The “circumstances in which the evidence was obtained” are certainly suss and would not be permitted by a police officer who is required to warn the suspect and advise them of their right to silence. However, that is not sufficient to exclude the evidence. The court also needs to consider whether it would have “such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.” If the confession is the only evidence then admitting it would clearly be unfair. However, if the Crown has mountains of other evidence, then the confession may only have a small probative value. Far more likely is that the Crown would not even seek to introduce the confession. It would just slow the trial and give the defence grounds for an appeal. Instead, they would use the confession to inform their investigation and get other evidence to convict. In England and Wales, legal advice privilege only applies where there is a lawyer present. If Badal is a lawyer, then the privilege attaches; if he isn’t then it doesn’t, irrespective of what he led Naina to believe. The same would be true even if Badal believed he was a lawyer but, for some reason, was not licenced in E&W. Litigation privilege is a broader concept and covers all advice, including from non-lawyers, where litigation (including criminal prosecution) has commenced or is reasonably likely. Based on the description, Naina has been committed to stand trial so everything she said is covered by privilege and is inadmissible. Most criminals are not sophisticated and will often implicate themselves if you give them enough space without the police or others violating any rules. Anecdotally, I have a relative who was a psychologist for a remand prison - prisoners charged but not yet tried. At the start of every meeting with a prisoner they would say “I work for the state, nothing you say is confidential and it can be used against you” - they still had prisoners confess to crimes they weren’t charged with, name accomplices, and tell where the loot was hidden."
Can Hollywood discriminate on the race of their actors?,"Yes this is legal. Under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, there is an exemption under Title VII - Equal Employment Opportunity that allows for discrimination based on a protected trait when there is a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ).   The wording is such that it can cover a slew of jobs that have just cause to discriminate against someone in their hiring process including certain roles for actors.  However, it does not allow for wholesale discrimination. In order to qualify, an employer must prove three things: As an example, a film about the work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would have a BFOQ in hiring a man of African descent to portray Dr. King, given that he is trying to accurately portray a historical person (direct relationship) to further educate the public about that historical person's work (Central Mission) and that a ""White MLK"" would offend audiences. While many roles in the hypothetical film would also qualify for the BFOQ, this doesn't give the production a blank slate... there is no need to discriminate against a set designer or a camera man, so a studio deciding to hire an all black production crew would face some legal troubles.  The restaurant chain Hooters, famous for it's amazing chicken wings they served, has a sometimes noticed habit of hiring very attractive women as their wait staff, almost to the point of exclusively.   All joking aside, they do get away with this by making a distinction that they are ""casting"" not ""hiring"" waitresses and their brand identity is entirely attractive ladies and not really the wings they serve.   This is a BFOQ (and they often come up in discussions about this matter of law).  With that in mind however, only Hooter's hiring of wait staff has a BFOQ.   The person in the kitchen cooking the wings could be a middle-aged balding man with a noticeable gut and managers at stores can be men or women who aren't as attractive as the standards used for wait staff (or were former wait staff but are not as young looking). Works adapting books and comics may have a little more leeway as certain characters may be portrayed as one race but have had their race switched for various reasons and with different success.  No one batted an eye when Lawrence Fishburne portrayed Perry White, Clark Kent's editor in Man of Steel or Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury in the various Marvel films (an unusual example as traditionally white Nick Fury was depicted as an African American in Marvel's Ultimate Marvel line).  His first appearance in August of 2001 in Ultimate Marvel Team Up, and a second appearance in Ultimate X-Men were of a non-descript African American, before his appearance as a regular in The Ultimates in March 2002, where his look was not only modeled after Jackson, Jackson was specifically ""cast"" as the visual model for the character, which he leapt at the idea (reportedly his initial pay was quite low given his standing as an actor with the difference made up for by a request of some exclusive artwork and an opportunity to play the character in a then not planned film.).  There are even some fictional works where the change in race might be the point of the work itself (for example, in William Shakespeare's play Othello, the titular character is explicitly of North African descent and many consider the work a very early rebuke of concepts of racial superiority (it's very much the subject of debate as to whether Othello being black was an important concept to the play or the Bard just added it for something a little different)).   During a 1997 Shakespeare Theater Company's 1997 adaptation, to hammer the ""it's about race"" side of the argument home, cast very much white Patrick Stewart to play the part of Othello, while the rest of the cast played by African American actors/actresses, a flip of the traditional depiction to highlight that Othello's race separates him from the rest of the characters in the play, regardless of what his actual race was.   This play would have a BFOQ to discriminate against white actors seeking to play the villain Iago (IMO, one of the best villains ever written.) because it's important that Iago and Othello not share racial traits for the entire story to work. While acting is usually where this comes up a lot, there are other places where it might be useful to discriminate against a protected class.  For example, when hiring a pastor for a church, it would be very important to make sure the Pastor or other spiritual leader was not only of the correct faith, but correct sect within that faith to minister to the flock.  A Seventh Day Adventist would be just as successful preaching to Catholic Church as a devout Muslim.  For start, all three differ on which day is ""the sabbath"": Catholics say Sunday (the day of the week Jesus rose from the dead), Seventh Day Adventists say Saturday, the day that those of Jewish faith like Jesus would have observed as the Sabbath, and Muslims say it's Friday (I don't know why off the top of my head). More practically, one might have a BFOQ for not hiring male therapists if one is working at a women's shelter (while gender has no bearing on being an effective therapist, many of the patients at a women's shelter might have problems discussing their situation with a man because most women's shelter's clients were abused by men in their lives, which might cause a delay in healing if the therapist working with them was also a man.)."
"In fiction, is it legal to state a newspaper wrote an article when in fact it never did?","Yes, as long as it is clear that this is fiction. It is utterly common for fiction set in the current world to mention real institutions and people, and have them do and say things that they never really did or said, to fit the plot or just to provide background. Busman's Honeymoon by Sayers included quotes from the (London) Times about Lord Peter Wimsey's wedding, an event which of course never occurred. Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe novels frequently included imagined stories in the New York Times, as well as in the (fictional) New York Gazette. The Novel Advise and Consent by Allan Drury included many fictional stories by real papers (often the Washington Post) about its fictional events, as well as fictional acts and statements by many real political figures of the day. The list could be extended almost forever. As long as a reasonable reader would understand this to be fiction, there is no issue of defamation. Nor does any paper have a copyright on its name. As for trademarks, as long as you aren't trying to sell a fake paper under a real name, there is no legal issue.  Go ahead, and I hope it is a great story."
Can a 401k plan exclude Union members?,"This fact sheet on the ""Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974"" or ERISA, published by the United States Department of Labor, includes this quote: Who can participate in your employer's retirement plan? ... Find out if you are within the group of employees covered by your employer's retirement plan. Federal law allows employers to include certain groups of employees and exclude others from a retirement plan. For example, your employer may sponsor one plan for salaried employees and another for union employees."
What happens when the opinion of the Court misrepresents the facts of the case?,"What are the legal consequences of substantive factual errors in an
opinion? None. I assume that this specific ruling is not affected in any way by the
text of the opinion? Correct. I assume that even an opinion of the form ""We got high and decided to
rule wrongly for fun"" wouldn't actually negate the ruling? Probably not, but it might precipitate a constitutional crisis or lead to an impeachment. How does this affect the precedent? It doesn't. Will courts in the future consider the true facts of the case
(whatever they perceive them to be), No. will they accept as legal fiction that the facts were as the Court
describes them? Yes. Could it be legal for the district to repeat exactly the same set of
actions in exactly the same set of true circumstances as before, since
those won't be the same circumstances that the Court claimed to rule
on? In such a case, is the lower court bound by the Supreme Court's
characterization of the facts of the case, Generally speaking the lower courts are bound by characterizations of the facts made by the appellate court. But, it depends to some extent on the procedural posture of the case. In most cases, the findings of fact made by the trial court following an evidentiary hearing are binding on appellate courts in the U.S. unless they are not supported by any admissible evidence presented at trial, but there are some exceptions to this rule and there is considerable art as well as science that goes into properly characterizing the evidence presented at trial. But, for example, many appellate cases are appeals from a dismissal of a case on a motion to dismiss at the outset of a case, in which all allegations of the Plaintiff's complaint in a civil matter are taken as true for sake of argument, and the legal issue presented is whether the Plaintiff can prevail if all of those facts are true. In a case in that procedural posture, assuming that the appellate court reversed the trial court and found that the facts alleged state a claim upon which relief can be granted, then the remand would be to move forward with discovery and other pre-trial procedures in the case and ultimately a trial, if necessary, to determine the actual facts of the case as opposed to the facts as alleged by the Plaintiff in the complaint or petition. Not infrequently, when appellate courts are divided over what happened in the trial court, one side of the debate, looking at the raw testimony and exhibits presented at trial, will conclude that the admissible evidence presented at trial did not support the findings of fact in a mixed question of fact and law made by a trial court judge, while another side of the debate will accept the trial court judge's findings of fact uncritically. It often isn't easy to know, from reading an appellate court opinion alone, which side is which in this regard. can it use the true facts of the case as long as it obeys the ruling
itself? Usually not. Usually, facts relied upon by an appellate court are by definition the correct facts (apart from clerical errors - e.g., an appellate court once misspelled my name in a court opinion, and the lower court wasn't bound by that mistake). This said, as noted above, the precise procedural posture of the case, nature of the court's opinion, and scope of the remand order is highly relevant to what a court can do on remand."
Could New Jersey Really Ban Pennsylvania Drivers?,"Constitution of the USA, Article IV, Section 1: Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof. and the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, clause 3): [The Congress shall have Power] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes; SCOTUS has found the former to mean that states that do not allow same-sex marriages in their laws must recognize same-sex marriages registered by other states - Obergefell v. Hodges. Maybe one could argue that driver licenses are not equivalent among states, but I would expect judges (SCOTUS) to require a very well reasoned explanation. For example, maybe Alaska could refuse to recognize licenses from Florida because Florida drivers do not know how to cope with snowed roads. But even in that case Alaska probably would need to produce data showing that these measures aim to serve the public interest (avoid accidents) and that there are no other ways of getting the same result. OTOH the Commerce Clause has been successfully used to avoid states mandating racial segregation of travellers, so it is quite reasonable to see it being used to prevent a state from trying to limit the mobility of citizens from other states (again, in the supposition that the state restricting it cannot show a compelling reason to do so). AFAIK, only the Federal Government could invoke the Commerce Clause; I would expect a lot more people (in your example, the PA government or maybe even any PA driver) would have standing."
Is there a legal risk in giving emergency first aid?,"This effectively comes under duty of care. Firstly, in England and Wales there is no obligation to be a Good Samaritan - in other words, there is no obligation to be a rescuer. Until you intervene to try and rescue someone, you do not owe that person a duty. As soon as you do intervene, however, you do owe them a duty. Specifically, you owe them a duty not to make the situation worse (Horsey and Rackley, Tort Law, 3rd ed., OUP 2013, p. 75). The specific situation Horsey and Rackley give is that of resuscitating a drowning child and breaking a rib as you do so: this may be 'making the situation worse' (Horsey and Rackley, pp. 75-76).  Does this mean that you'll be liable if you give someone first aid and in doing so, you make the situation worse? Not necessarily, because, as Horsey and Rackley point out, duty is different to liability. Using the drowning child example again, they state: So, for example, while someone who intervenes may owe a duty not to make the situation worse, their actions would still be judged against those of a 'reasonable person' in the circumstances (and so if a reasonable person would have tried to resuscitate the child in the same way, there will be no breach of their duty and therefore no liability to pay compensation.) (p.76) The 'reasonable person' standard corresponds to what you mentioned in the question about lack of expertise. If a doctor intervenes in such a situation, the standard of care they'd be expected to give would be higher than, say, for someone who's simply done a basic first aid course. The question is whether or not you've acted as the reasonable person in your situation would have done. On that basis, then, your tutor is pretty much correct: so long as you take such care as is reasonable based on your expertise, or lack thereof, then under English and Welsh law, you're unlikely to be liable."
It is really illegal to plug in a device to watch BBC iPlayer or Live TV in a Starbucks?,"I suspect this relates to the UK TV Licencing provisions as listed here, Specifically : Can I watch TV on my mobile phone without a TV Licence? If you’re using a mobile device powered solely by its own internal
batteries – like a smartphone, tablet or laptop – you will be covered
by your home’s TV Licence, wherever you’re using it in the UK and
Channel Islands. However, if you’re away from home and plug one of these devices into
the mains and use it to watch live on any channel, TV service or
streaming service, or use BBC iPlayer*, you need to be covered by a
separate TV Licence at that address (unless you’re in a vehicle or
vessel like a train, car or boat). I've said ""I suspect"" as I don't know for certain what Starbucks are doing, but it looks like this is means that either they are not providing you with use of their Licence at those premises, or that they don't have one for those premises (particularly likely if they're not in the UK, also possible if they are). Without mains power connection (ie. batteries only) it would be the user's home Licence that was relevant. TV Licencing is covered by Part 4 of the Communications Act 2003.

Where can I report criminal intent found on the dark web?,"1/06/17 update regarding comments and other answers: You can report criminal intent while reasonably remaining anonymous by using various methods, and this will let you do want to do: take an ethical step and make an effort to report the potential crime. Read below. First of all, using Tor is not illegal. Yes, there is illegal activity on Tor and the dark web it can access, and there is activity that promotes illegal things on Tor and IRL, but that doesn't make you a criminal by default by using a system that can be used by criminals. See Is it legal to use the Tor Network and Tor Software in the United States? The FBI and other law enforcement and intelligence agencies are well aware of Tor and the dark web; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace) . (That may give you pause because some FBI agents were implicated in crimes when the agency investigated the broader crime.) Or should I assume that the proper authorities are already monitoring
  the site? I wouldn't assume they are already monitoring that particular site, but it's possible; the FBI at least is aware of its existence. It's a good idea to assume they run their own crawlers to index the site, and have agents who are members. Think of all the news stories your read about law enforcement posing as perps online to ensnare people; and then think about how much there is we don't know about these types of activities and their prevalence. If you really want to be paranoid and know that Tor is not perfect security, and that government agencies have serious power, know that the NSA is well-known to run many Tor exit nodes to packet sniff and store metadata and the full text of traffic (as well as clear, non-dark web traffic, too). And, it's an accepted fact that SSL has been cracked (SSL may or may not be in use in your case or technically relevant right now) by them, too, all re: Snowden. Deleting Tor from your PC/Mac means nothing; any 5th grader can do forensic analysis and discover the remnants of the Tor browser. Your local ISP may log Tor traffic, as such traffic has a signature. But again, simply using Tor doesn't not make you a criminal, but it could draw attention to you. And warrants get be gotten for ISPs and your PC. You remaining anonymous overall also assumes that you have not given out any information on that SE clone site that could identify you IRL. If you have, then you need to assess the risks to yourself; that could be your most serious privacy breach to other users beyond any technology (as well as to law enforcement if they for other reasons suspected you of illegal activity yourself.) That said, if you want to report the possible crime - for either legal or ethical reasons - you can remain mostly anonymous via email. Use the Tor browser from public wi-fi (try on a USB stick on a public PC and not from your laptop) and sign up for anonymous email with a fake name (breaking their TOS) at Yandex, which does not require phone verification. (Google, Yahoo, etc., require a phone number; this could be a burner or IP phone, but that's up to you). https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/tutorial-how-create-anonymous-email-accounts You could also use one of the various disposable email sites, as pointed out by another user, but some such email domains and services are often automatically flagged as spam or blocked by agencies due to their nature. Try Google for ""disposable email"". Ditto the anonymous phone call services or email-to-fax services. There are different methods with different anonymity pros/cons. And, you could use snail mail, as was pointed out by another user. Mail a printout in a plain envelope (with no fingerprints) in a public mailbox some distance from where you live and usually use the PO; the USPS records metadata on all mail, but this can be reasonably anonymous, with care. In any case, since you read that the person has already ""cased the house"" and have a general geographic location, the FBI may take the information (and your tip) seriously and look into the possibility of a crime. If the FBI looks, they may not deem it serious enough - or see enough evidence - to do the work required to find the true IP or other digital forensics to locate the person. I don't know if it would make any difference (because of Tor's
  anonymizing)... But we don't know the other digital breadcrumbs the alleged perp has left; it's possible they could be tracked more extensively online - and then possibly located IRL - by the FBI. And, if you do send an anonymous tip by any method, you've done what is appears you want to do: take the ethical step and make an effort to report the potential criminal situation. 1/05/17 original answer: Take a look at FBI Forms — Tips - fbi.gov to submit an email tip: Please use this website to report suspected terrorism or criminal
  activity. Your information will be reviewed promptly by an FBI special
  agent or a professional staff member. Due to the high volume of

Can a software company forbid individuals to consult on how to use their software?,"They certainly can make that a license term and revoke the license if you do not comply. However, revoking the license is all they can do to ""forbid"". Or they could sue you for damages without revoking the license. That said, you are free to consult how to use their software so long as you do not hold a license so that you are not bound by the terms AND you do not break the law e.g. copyright. How to do it is up to you to figure. Maybe you could simply consult users that do have a license — on their premises and devices."
Does the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike licence allow you to specify exactly how attribution must be given?,"The Stack Exchange ""requirement"" of a particular type of attribution is unlikely to be enforceable, given the terms of the CC BY-SA license. The actual Creative Commons license, the part that governs the relationship between the parties, is the ""legal code"" license agreement. The CC BY-SA agreement contains two clauses relevant to the form of attribution. One, as the question points out, is paragraph 4(c), which states that ""credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner."" This language is much less restrictive than the StackExchange blog post. The other relevant clause is the last clause of the agreement, paragraph 8(e), which is a standard integration clause: This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. In other words, any changes to the license, which would include any additional restrictions on the nature of the attribution that may be given (besides the ""reasonable manner"" specified in the license) are effective only if both parties agree to do so in writing. The specific law applied from jurisdiction to jurisdiction is going to vary, but in general, in the United States, when you have a fully integrated agreement such as this license, a court will not look at anything outside the four corners of the agreement to determine the parties' rights and duties. If a court finds this to be a fully integrated agreement, and refuses to consider ""parol evidence,"" meaning statements outside of the contract, then StackExchange can post a page asking people to attribute content in a particular way, but no, they cannot require it."
On what grounds can Instagram contest the use of the domain name slutsofinstagram.com?,"The theoretical is that the domain slutsofinstagram.com does dilute or harm Instagram's mark because of the use of ""Instagram"" in the domain and because of the unwanted association of the parody story; that's the theory and ""grounds"" that Instagram would use in their lawsuit. Instagram would have to prove their theory of dilution or harm to the jury or judge, and convince either that the harm is not theoretical but real and financially damaging in order to win their case. The owners of slutsofinstagram.com would have to defend themselves and argue that they are not damaging Instagram's mark and their parody is a parody and is protected as such. Any actual court outcome is also theoretical. If Instagram won their case, one of the legal remedies could be the court ordering the owner of slutsofinstagram.com to transfer ownership of the domain to Instagram so they could simply park the domain and effectively take down the parody story. Or, the owner of slutsofinstagram.com could prevail because they argued the fact - and the court agreed - that the domain name and creative contents of the site is a parody and is protected speech and doesn't dilute Instagram's mark because any reasonable person could see that the site is a parody and not related to Instagram. In the US, a possible example of a parody not diluting a mark is L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publishers, Inc., 811 F.2d 26 (1st Cir. 1987), where  Imitation may be the highest form of flattery, but plaintiff-appellee
  L.L. Bean, Inc., was neither flattered nor amused when High Society
  magazine published a prurient parody of Bean's famous catalog. The reality is that Instagram can contest the use of slutsofinstagram.com because they can; they have deep pockets and can take the owner of slutsofinstagram.com to court, like any other trademark holder can contest another's trademark. The owner of slutsofinstagram.com would have to defend themselves in court, or settle - possibly for monetary damages or the ownership of the domain or use of slutsofinstagram - and not go to court. It's possible that the SLAPP (Strategic lawsuit against public participation - Wikipedia) California law could help the plaintiff defend themselves against a deep pocket lawsuit designed to kill the parody site - as  the suit would be ""intended to censor, intimidate, and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition"" - which could happen because Instagram is part of Facebook and is incorporated in California. But basically, in the legal world, one man's litigation bully is another man's trademark protection hero. This concerns the US. As always, your mileage may vary due to jurisdiction and national/international laws and agreements concerning trademarks. "
Is it legal for an employer to charge an employee for lost equipment?,"Possibly I am Australian so I am not familiar with Albertan labour law but I have done a little research and the underlying common law principles are similar. I will assume that you are covered by Albertan law and not the Canada Labour Code.  The next part of the answer is based on A Guide to Rights and Responsibilities in Alberta Workplaces. First, if you lost it they would need to ask you to pay for it, they could not deduct it from your pay without a garnishee order (p. 10). Second, if the device is safety equipment, and it is certainly arguable that it is, then it is the employee's responsibility to use it and the employer's responsibility to keep it in safe working order; this would include replacing it if it were lost (p. 12). The common law position depends on a) the contract and b) if any negligence were involved. Contract What does your current employment contract say about your use of the employer's equipment generally and this item in particular? If it says something then, unless it is an illegal term, that is what happens. If it is silent, then it turns on the particular circumstances.  Also, a contract cannot be changed unilaterally, if they are trying to introduce a new term then you have to agree to it; remembering that there may be consequences to taking a stand against your employer, you should say that you do not agree - this removes the risk that the employer could argue that there was tacit agreement. Negligence In order to establish negligence as a Cause of Action under the law of torts, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant: So, if you take reasonable care of the device and, notwithstanding, it is lost or damaged then you would not be liable for negligence ... probably.  Talk to your union rep; this is exactly the sort of stuff that they are there to sort out."
Is it legal to have unpaid volunteer moderators (or other types of volunteers) on a for-profit community website?,"An employee is someone that the employer ""suffers or permits to work"" - moderators would appear to be caught by this. There are specific exemptions carved out in the public and not-for-profit sectors where they ""a) work toward public service, religious or humanitarian objectives; b) not expect or receive compensation for services; and c) not displace any genuine employees."" However, they very specifically say “Under the FLSA, employees may not volunteer services to for-profit private sector employers.” So on the face of it, a moderator is an employee and is entitled to minimum wages and conditions for the hours they work. AOL settled a lawsuit in 2009 with their moderators who were suing for wages for an undisclosed sum and so the case did not set a precedent. This article suggests that ""for-profit companies don’t have volunteers; they have lawsuits waiting to happen"" and uses examines the situation at Reddit (which could equally apply here). Facebook employs moderators so the precedent exists that this is work that employees do. When the lawsuit happens, we'll find out. It will turn on the particular facts - some types of mods for some companies may be employees while others may not."
Are there any remedies for abusive or insulting behavior by agents executing a search warrant?,"There are two separate questions here, it seems to me. First: are law enforcement officers required to respect your house rules and avoid making a mess? At least in the United States, the answer is unequivocally no. If the only ""damage"" suffered is that you need to sweep the floor, or put your clothes back in drawers, that's not the police's problem. You have not suffered any damages that a court is going to reimburse, and your best case scenario, even if you win a suit against the police, is an award of one dollar as nominal damages. Second: are law enforcement officers required to reimburse you for any physical damage they caused while executing the search warrant? The answer here is tricker, and depends on the search warrant. If the warrant is invalid, then the answer is yes. But remember: just because, for example, the cops are looking for the guy you bought your house from, who moved out a month ago, that doesn't mean the warrant is ""invalid."" Just because the cops got a bad tip, or suspected you wrongly, or were in some other way wasting their time--as long as the warrant is technically proper and they were able to convince a judge it was reasonable, the warrant is valid. Even if the warrant is invalid, you may need to sue the police to get anything reimbursed. If the warrant is valid, in practical terms, you will almost certainly need to sue the police to recover anything, and you will have to show the Court that the police's actions that damaged your property were so extreme that they were outside the reasonable scope of the warrant. For instance: the warrant is for a large item, like a stolen car: the police cannot smash holes in your walls to make sure the car isn't hidden inside. If they're looking for drugs, they may be able to. If the officers' actions are consistent with the scope of the warrant, then you are not going to recover anything. The warrant is, basically, permission from a judge to enter your home and perform those actions, and they will not be liable for them. A number of relevant cases are discussed in this article: http://www.aele.org/law/2010all01/2010-1MLJ101.pdf"
Does the US Fifth Amendment only apply to criminal trials? Do any laws protect a person in civil court when testimony would implicate them in a crime?,"The Fifth Amendment always protects someone from being forced to testify against themselves if it would implicate them in a crime (see, among others, Ohio v. Reiner, 532 U.S. 17). Any person can assert the privilege, regardless of their role in the trial, with the possible exception of the plaintiff (who is the one person who wanted to go to court). Like always with the Fifth Amendment, they can answer some questions but not others (but if they do answer a question, they need to fully answer it). In civil cases, the Fifth Amendment itself does not keep the jury from making adverse inferences against whoever invoked the privilege; if you refuse to testify, they can assume that it's because testifying would be extremely damaging in that particular case. However, most states have rules against that, and so invoking the privilege in state courts generally works like it does in a criminal case (where the jury basically ignores that the question was even asked). In federal courts, if a case is being heard under diversity jurisdiction (plaintiff and defendant are from different states but the claim is not a federal claim) the state rule is supposed to apply; if the claim is a federal claim, the federal rule applies and adverse inferences are allowed. While the Fifth Amendment can be invoked by anyone, there may be consequences. In many states (where adverse inference isn't allowed), a witness who will just invoke the Fifth and answer no questions can't be called, because it's a complete waste of time. If the plaintiff invokes the Fifth to not answer key questions, then the court can potentially dismiss the case; they have the right to assert the privilege, but their lawsuit might suffer for it. In federal court, another possibility that's been done several times before is that the civil case is just put on hold until the criminal matter is resolved. Sources:

Under what circumstances am I obliged to show ID to a police officer?,"People in the UK (who are not subject to immigration control or other restrictions) do not have to carry any form of identification. This doesn't answer all parts of your question, but s164 Road Traffic Act 1988 is appropriate to the part about driving. a person driving a motor vehicle on a road ... must, on being so required by a constable or vehicle examiner, produce his licence and its counterpart1 for examination, so as to enable the constable or vehicle examiner to ascertain the name and address of the holder of the licence, the date of issue, and the authority by which they were issued. (s164(1)) So it makes no difference why you were stopped: a constable or traffic offiver can demand production of your licence if you were driving.  The same power exists if you're suspected of having caused an accident or committed an offence, even if you're not driving at the time of the production demand. Non-production is an offence: If a person required under the preceding provisions of this section to produce a licence and its counterpart ... fails to do so he is, subject to subsections (7) to (8A) below, guilty of an offence. (s164(6)) However, it is a defence to produce the licence (or a receipt for a licence) within seven days of the demand (s164(7-8)).  In practice, the officer will give you a 'producer' requiring you to present your licence at a police station within seven days, after which you will be guilty of the non-production offence.  The implication of this is that it is not required that you carry your licence; merely that you have it available to produce within seven days. 1 Presumably the reference to 'counterpart' will go away when the counterpart is abolished on 8th June 2015."
"Is ""I didn't think it was serious"" usually a good defence against ""duty to rescue""?","germany You have the duty to help others even if they cannot articulate that. There was a case recently where people stepped over an unconscious person to get money from an ATM, thinking it was a homeless person sleeping inside the rather warm entrance to the public bank building. Turned out it was a normal elderly customer who had a medical emergency. Three customers walked around them and did not get help. Only the fourth customer called an ambulance about 20 minutes later. The person died in hospital, doctors said the delay in treatment did not cause the death, the person would have died even if help had been available earlier. Police used the banks security cameras to prosecute all who had just ignored the person and ""thought it was okay, they were just sleeping"". Newspaper Article:
For example Der Spiegel. The actual text of the verdict:
AG Essen-Borbeck, 18.09.2017 - 3 Ds - 70 Js 654/16 - 252/17, 3 Ds 252/17 In this case it was monetary fines, but if the person had actively asked for an ambulance, like in your case, and were actively denied instead of ignored, I'm pretty sure that would have made it way worse for the defendants."
Can a person purposely provoke someone to hit him and then report a crime?,"People hurling abuse at one another and starting fights happens absolutely all the time, especially when drink has been taken, and will be a regular part of police business. In the UK, potentially both parties can be prosecuted; the Public Order Act prohibits ""abusive or threatening words or behaviour"". It specifically prohibits provocation: ""to provoke the immediate use of unlawful violence by that person or another"". However, because it's the public order act it only applies in public places and not in houses."
I am being threatened for defamation for sharing an article about an alleged scammer which was published in local news site,"This is known as the repetition rule and is illustrated in Brown v Bower & Another  [2017] EWHC 2637 (QB). In essence, the ""local news site"" is responsible for the reputational damage suffered by their publication and you are responsible for the damage caused by your amplification of that publication. So if the local news article was seen by a few dozen people locally, the damages might be relatively modest. If your publication caused it to be seen by millions of people and caused nationwide or worldwide damage to the person's reputation so that they are at risk of losing income or opportunities in the future, the damages can be vast. How you shared it is important. If you endorsed it, which includes forwarding it without commentary, then it is likely defamatory. If you were more circumspect and said something that shows an open mind to the allegations like ""This is an interesting story, I can't wait to see how it plays out"", then it's likely not defamatory. Of course, if the allegations are true then you have nothing to worry about; truth is a complete defence to defamation. You can prove that they are true, right? I mean with real evidence like a conviction for fraud. Or, at the very least, pending or actual charges from the police. Or, failing that you have good evidence that you yourself have been scammed specifically by this person. Or that you have had people who have been scammed tell you personally exactly how it happened? No? Well, I wouldn't count on a truth defence if I were you."
Why is the defendant presumed guilty in traffic court?,"It seems like the officer should have to present at least some kind of evidence that the alleged crime occurred. Testimony is evidence.  Officers can and do abuse this, but courts tend to give them the benefit of the doubt, so they typically attribute greater weight and credibility to a police officer's testimony than to that of a defendant."
Is it illegal to carry someone else's ID or credit card?,"I think the officer is probably lying, not just mistaken, but they are not required to always be truthful. In addition to the law against possessing ID with intent to commit, or to aid or abet, any crime, it is also against the law to be knowingly in possession of a stolen credit card, or any other property. An example of a strict-liability possession crime, which the officer knows of, is that it is a crime to possess heroin, period. I am skeptical that the officer actually believes that there is a law making it a crime to be in possession of a credit card with permission, and suspect that he thinks it is stolen."
"Is it a crime to ""steal"" your own money from a bank?","The physical cash in the bank is not your property, at least not in US law (according to Scalia). It becomes your property when the withdrawal is performed by some means specified in your contract. A deposit gives you a contractual right to demand money from the bank. Bank robbery is a crime. Having money deposited with the bank doesn't change that. The only possible chance a robber has at trial is jury nullification. I haven't found records for that in Lebanon, but it does have jury trials. Impartial review classifies Lebanon's justice system as somewhat corrupt, but generally compliant with the basic principles. So it might be possible to get away with it at trial, but a very long shot."
Can a lawyer take a ridiculous case?,"My answer does NOT address frivolous litigation by the client — it ONLY addresses the question ""Can the lawyer get into any trouble for taking the case and bringing it to court?"" If the lawyer has a history of taking on frivolous cases, the relevant regulatory body may get involved as the lawyer has the professional obligation to maintain the reputation of the legal profession—and taking on cases that have no merit undermines that. Taking on clearly frivolous cases may undermine that reputation, but it would be fact-specific and likely require the lawyer to act on a large number of clearly useless cases. Additionally, the lawyer has other professional obligations: such as advising the client not to pursue such cases and refusing to represent them where doing so is not in the client's best interests—again, the relevant regulatory body would be concerned with any breaches of that obligation. It is possible for a solicitor to be struck off and a barrister to be debarred. Any sanction will be fact-specific. I have outlined the relevant regulatory guidelines all lawyers need to follow below. A frivolous case may breach all three principles for each type of lawyer respectively, but the regulatory body will decide whether the lawyer gets off with a fine, a warning, and so on. Solicitors are required to follow the Principles set down by the Solictors Regulation Authority. In particular, Principles 1, 2, and 7 apply here: You act: in a way that upholds the constitutional principle of the rule of law, and the proper administration of justice. in a way that upholds public trust and confidence in the solicitors' profession and in legal services provided by authorised persons. ... Barristers are also required to follow the Bar Standards Board Handbook, known as the Core Duties: namely, Core Duties 1, 2, and 5: You must observe your duty to the court in the administration of justice [CD1]. You must act in the best interests of each client [CD2]. ... These are regulatory standards and failure to uphold them can lead to being removed from the solicitors' roll and debarred by the Bar Standards Board respectively."
Self incrimination during medical examination,"If such conversations are reported, it can place the suspect in a dilemma. Consider a man who appears to have overdosed on illegal narcotics.  He is taken to the hospital, and the doctor asks what kind of drugs he took, in order to plan his treatment.  If the man thinks that what he says could be used to prosecute him, he might lie to the doctor.  Then he would not receive proper medical treatment, putting his health at risk. Lawmakers or police authorities might decide that it is better for society for people to always be able to speak freely to their doctors and receive proper treatment, even if it means that it will sometimes be harder to prosecute criminals.  That would be one possible rationale for a rule like this."
"Can teachers search our dorms without our explicit consent if they have ""suspicion""?","A private school in the US is not bound by the 4th Amendment requirement for searches to be ""reasonable"", just as parents do not need a search warrant to search your room. Instead, limitations would arise from contract law. This typically means that per the contract whereby you can go to that school, you agree to certain things (as do they). This may or may not include the power for a teacher to conduct a surprise inspection. It just depends on what is said in the contract regarding dorm room searches. Typically, adjudication of this type of matter is left to parental outrage rather than courts, unless there is a clear violation of the contract terms."
"What does ""Have you been drinking?"" really mean?","Words and sentences have their ordinary meaning, unless a special meaning has been assigned by the legislature or (sort of) by the courts. The legislature may therefore specifically define ""deadly weapon"" to not include a knife with a 2 inch blade; or it might so define a short blade knife as a ""deadly weapon"". This expression has no special meaning, therefore it literally means what you think it means. It is used to get detainees to contribute to probable cause, at least in the case of traffic stops. Similarly, the statement ""it would help me a lot if I could look in your trunk"" is simply a statement of personal opinion and does not require any response by you, nevertheless the expression is used to get people to voluntarily expose the illegal goods in their trunk. The question is, grammatically speaking, quite vague, so if for some reason you say ""no"" and they still arrest you (beer breath? whatever their reason), the question is whether you willfully uttered an untruth. It would be incumbent on you (via your lawyer) to present the meaning that you had assumed at the time. If you assumed that the question was, literally, ""have you consumed any amount of alcohol in the last 2 hours?"" and you had a half glass of wine two hours ago, you lied. If you assumed that the question was ""have you consumed enough alcohol that you are now over the legal limit"", then you didn't lie. The interpretation ""any measurable blood alcohol level"" is highly implausible, since one might measure .001% blood alcohol – it's not a crime to have measurable blood alcohol. The officer's intention is to get probably cause, and the detainee's interpretive strategy should be related to the legitimate interests of police officers in detaining drivers – about levels of alcohol consumption that constitute legally-impaired driving."
Is it legal to purposefully contract COVID-19?,"Governments have a significant interest in controlling pathogens and  preventing outbreaks: they are dangerous to dense & unimmunized  populations.   Can a government legally prevent me from intentionally infecting
  myself with a virus? Yes, governments have the broad authority to enact laws.  The US prohibits  and regulates pathogen experimentation (self-infection). There are also rules regarding shipping and export (ITAR).  Furthermore, in the US, there are (FL, NY state) laws that prevent patients from being tested unless the order is given by an authorized health care professional.  Hopefully, you do live in a state that does not have this regulation (AZ). While I do believe in one's right to do as one sees fit with one's own body, there is the counter-argument: there must be limits when it comes to unnecessarily exposing the community to pathogen risk.  I hope that this question is theoretical and that nobody actually believes the immunity supposition without a credible peer-reviewed scientific publication.  Unfortunately we live in an age where misinformation is propagated at novel speed and scale. I wish the OP well.  That being said, I have concerns regarding the underlying assumptions of the question.  While I am comfortable with the OP question, the underlying assumptions give me great pause. IMHO: I hope that no reader will seriously consider amateur experimentation in self-infection in the hope of conferring immunity. Giving a pathogen uncontrolled safe-haven to propagate and possibly infect others seems irresponsible. I doubt that the government cares if any individual manages to puts themselves in an early grave, however, it does care if amateurs create an unnecessary pandemic risk.   I would think that any government would view pathogen experimentation much like nuclear device experimentation, because of the mass casualty risk.  I hope that readers understand the implications of an amateur uncontrolled experiment."
University prohibits professors from testifying,"It’s important to bear in mind that there is a difference between expert witnesses and witnesses of fact: expert witnesses must consent to testify (with or without payment), witnesses of fact can be compelled to testify. It would be 100% illegal for an employer or anyone else to attempt to prevent a witness of fact from testifying under a subpoena. For an expert witness, the person must agree to be an expert and an employer might lawfully and reasonably prohibit them doing so. They might prohibit expert witness work in general as distracting from their core business or they might prohibit it in certain cases where they feel association might damage their brand. Such a prohibition might reasonably extend to the employee moonlighting as an expert witness on their own time. However, such a restriction can’t be applied post-hoc. Once a person has agreed to be an expert they are now an officer of the court and can be compelled to testify. What is a reasonable restriction on an employee’s activities depends on the employment contract, the nature of the employer’s business and the employee’s role. University professors are usually guaranteed academic freedom - the ability to write and say whatever they like within their field irrespective of if it is controversial or offensive. This is often a part of a collective bargaining agreement and/or written into individual contracts. Expert testimony within their field (and they couldn’t be experts outside their field) would fall within this. Further, when the employer is a State actor, such a prohibition might infringe the employee’s first amendment rights. Now, these rights are not unfettered - the FBI can prohibit their agents from discussing cases and the Department of State can prohibit its employees from disclosing diplomatic negotiations. However, such restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny, the government must prove that the law or policy is necessary to achieve a ""compelling state interest"" and is “narrowly tailored”. Restricting opinion on the Constitutionality or otherwise of a particular law doesn’t seem to have either a ""compelling state interest"" or be “narrowly tailored.” Personally, I think the University is on a hiding to nothing."
Receiving a certified letter and the contents is not address to you,"If the envelope had someone else's name and not your name, you should in theory not have opened it, and should instead have marked it ""Not known at this address. Return to Sender."" and handed it back to the postal service to be returned. If you were asked to sign for the letter, ideally you would check that it is not addressed to you (or anyone else now at your residence) and refuse to sign, but it is easy to overlook that at the moment a letter is presented to you. And sometimes certified mail is delivered without obtaining the signature of any resident. If, however, the envelope had your name on it, you were entitled to open it, and are not bound by any confidentiality statements in the cover letter, assuming that you had no previous relationship with the sender. You may well choose to respect them, but you cannot be legally bound unless you accepted such an obligation at some point, usually in a contract of some sort. If you did have a confidential relationship with the sender, then its terms would normally control, whatever they might be. You could prepare an envelope addressed to the sender, enclose the document, and mail it back to the sender. You could optionally add a short cover letter explaining how you received the document. If the envelope was addressed to some other person, this would, I think, be the best thing to do. If the document was addressed to you, this is totally optional, you could legally just discard the document and forget about it, and you can probably legally read it and do whatever you like about the contents. But as the answer by gnasher729 points out, returning it would be the nice thing. As the comment by  Makyen points out, you may wish to retain evidence of what was received. One sided confidentially statements on letters or faxes are not legally effective in the absence of some prior or current relationship or agreement to be bound in confidence."
"Why did CJ Roberts apply the Fourteenth Amendment to Harvard, a private school?","Justice Gorsuch attempts to explain (at p. 20 of his concurrence): In the years following Bakke, this Court hewed to Justice Powell's and Justice Brennan's shared premise that Title VI and the Equal Protection Clause mean the same thing. ... As a result, for over four decades, every case about racial preferences in school admissions under Title VI has turned into a case about the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. A journalist's account on scotusblog also notes that the tests under Title VI and under the 14th amendment have been understood as identical: Private universities like Harvard are not subject to the 14th Amendment, but Title VI applies the same test to private universities that receive federal funds, as Harvard does. See also commentary from a law firm blog in 2022: Harvard, as a private university, is not explicitly regulated by the Fourteenth Amendment. Instead, the case against Harvard relies on Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits any entity receiving federal financial assistance – as Harvard does – from discriminating on the basis of “race, color, or national origin.” The Supreme Court has held that Title VI’s protections match those of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, and thus, the analyses are essentially identical. I read the majority reasons to be a continuance of this conflated meaning. In footnote 2, Chief Justice Roberts is careful to say that the Court is evaluating Harvard's admissions program ""under the standards of the Equal Protection Clause"" (emphasis mine), rather than stating that the Equal Protection Clause applies against Harvard. Later, he does slip back into language that could be read as suggesting the Equal Protection Clause is being applied directly: ""For the reasons provided above, the Harvard and UNC
admissions programs cannot be reconciled with the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause,"" but a better reading is that he is merely recognizing that Title VI imports the same guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause. Justice Gorsuch would prefer to re-introduce the analytical clarity about the source of the constraints."
Are police allowed to be ignorant of the law?,"As I understand, the limited liability that police enjoy, requires
that people bringing civil cases against police must prove that the
police person should have had a reasonable knowledge of the civil
rights that you accuse him of breaking, for the civil case to be
successful. This isn't quite right. The test you are referencing is the one for qualified immunity from civil liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which imposes liability on government officials only for violating a ""well-established"" constitutional right. A rule of law is ""well-established"" when there is controlling case law in that jurisdiction when a factually similar binding precedent exists in that jurisdiction to show that the alleged conduct is unconstitutional. This test is employing the legal fiction that police officers are familiar with all of the binding precedents in the jurisdiction regarding what constitutes a violation of a constitutional right, which is held against officers. Of course, in reality, almost no police officers have that exhaustive a level of understanding of the law. What the test does, however, is to prevent police officers from being held civilly liable for money damages when they take action which, in fact, violates a constitutional right, but which no case law in a factually similar case that was binding precedent established before the incident took place. Thus, police officers are relieved of liability for incidents that they would have to predict that a future court would find violated a constitutional right. This is sometimes phrased as being justified because a reasonable police officer could not have foreseen a new rule of constitutional law or a novel application of an existing rule of constitutional law to a new situation. One of the reasons that the qualified immunity rule is controversial, however, is that courts have the discretion to decide a case on qualified immunity grounds without determining if the underlying action indeed did violate a constitutional right, and this prevents constitutional law from evolving normally over time to applications in new factually novel situations. The key point, however, is that this requirement that a constitutional right be well-established to be enforceable in a civil action is an ""objective"" test in that it is decided without any reference to what the particular individual being sued actually knew about the law in the particular circumstances presented. A police officer who acts without actually knowing the law does so at his or her peril."
"Are there laws restricting who can go into ""employees only"" areas?","Most jurisdictions define trespassing as being immediately trespassing if you are somewhere  Otherwise they require a cycle of confronting you, and warning you off, possibly with explanation of which property you are being warned off from.  So it's trespassing immediately if you knowingly barge past an ""Employees only"" sign.  In the case of a genuine inadvertent whoopsie, it's unlikely the case would go very far.   But if the facts and circumstances make the case that your invasion was intentional, then it is not innocent and those facts and circumstances enter into it.  Without a demarcing sign along an entry path, I think the retailer owes you a warning, unless the facts of the installation make it obvious. So for instance if you got into a tiff with the desk clerk and disagreed that he was out of stock of the latest XBox and barged into the stockroom looking for Xboxen, I would expect your name on a police report.  As a practical thing, police are not punishing crusaders, and if no harm is done, they will simply want to assure you don't do it again.  They hope a thin blue adjudication will suffice, as they are partial to the lowest friction method.  So there is no ""one free trespass"" in law, but there is in practice. Some jurisdictions treat certain activities (on certain types of land) as not trespassing; e.g. hunting or snowmobiling. This forces the signs to enumerate each activity: ""No Hunting Or Trespassing"".  There are also many narrow exceptions in the law. e.g. utility workers to maintain power lines or cut trees.  Some of those are Federal and pre-empt any state laws. "
What does this fuzzy court clerk stamp say? It's from a very old case in 1995 in the state of Washington,FILMED The document was archived onto microfilm. User @Dai used the font Myriad Pro Bold to overlay this onto the image: 
"Could the President, Senate, and a foreign country circumvent the House to pass a law?","Yes. The leading case relevant to the question is Missouri v. Holland, 252 U.S. 416 (1920), in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that a self-executing bird migration treaty could override state law. It is also well established that a treaty may override a previously enacted federal statute. While there might be a requirement that the treaty not be a sham that really doesn't involve another county, or otherwise have an international component, as a practical matter, meeting this requirement is something that would almost always be possible. So, the President and a two-thirds majority of the Senate, in cooperation with a foreign country, by treaty, can accomplish legislative ends with which the House would not agree. As a practical matter, however, the two-thirds majority requirement for passage of a treaty in the Senate, the partisan organization of politics in the U.S., and the correlation of the partisan makeup of the Senate and the House, means that this observation is basically an irrelevant footnote. No treaty that could secure bipartisan support by two-thirds of U.S. Senators, and also be signed by the President, would not be able to be passed in the House. There has never been a time in U.S. history where one political faction has a two-thirds majority in the Senate and another political faction had a majority in the House. As a practical matter, it is almost always easier to pass ordinary legislation approved by majorities in the House and Senate, than it is to pass a self-executing treaty. The only scenario I could image where this might happen would be one in which an ""old guard"" President and Senate are in place, and then one election, some new political movement suddenly nearly sweeps the House and the U.S. Senate seats that are open due to some pivotal historic event, but there hasn't been more than a single Senate election or a Presidential election since that sea change in public opinion, something that very rarely has happened in other countries."
Contractor does work on the wrong house,"united-states This is the classic fact pattern under which the contractor is entitled to an unjust enrichment remedy (and also often, a mechanic's lien remedy), even though there is no breach of contract claim."
"Convicted for murder and ""victim"" found alive","australia Although the alleged victim has not been found, this case from the upi.com archives dated 25/09/1986 is worthy of note (emphasis mine): A woman jailed for murdering her husband had her conviction reversed when a witness testified she saw the man on television -- in a crowd at a cricket match -- three years after he allegedly was killed. The New South Wales Court of Appeal Wednesday overturned the murder conviction of Margaret Burton, saying the case against her relied on a web of circumstantial evidence and that the new evidence provided reasonable doubt of her guilt. Burton, however, still must complete an 8-year sentence for conspiracy to commit murder. She was sentenced to life in prison on Nov. 8, 1984, for the May 1983 murder of her husband. She and Ronald Burke, a close friend, also were sentenced to eight years in jail for conspiracy to murder her husband, Peter Burton. Peter Burton's body never was found. At the appeals court hearing, Judy Edmonds testified she is sure she saw Peter Burton in the crowd at a televised cricket match in January. Edmonds was shown a videotape of part of the cricket match and identified a man in sunglasses as Peter Burton. She said she was a close friend of his. Another witness, Jan Dyson, told the court the man in the videotape bore a remarkable resemblance to Peter Burton. Lawyers for Margaret Burton argued before the appeals court her conviction should be overturned because the prosecution failed to prove Peter Burton was dead. Appeals Court Chief Justice Sir Laurence Street agreed, saying it is not for the court to decide whether or not the person on the videotape is Peter Burton, but it is the court's responsibility to determine how a reasonable jury would have regarded the new evidence."
Is a lawyer allowed to follow a client's instructions to hide evidence?,"""Is a lawyer allowed to follow a client's instructions to hide evidence?"" Probably not. I discuss this in the final section of this answer. About this specific case, the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the lawyer (Ken Murray) had intended to conceal the tapes permenantly or that he was aware of an obligation to disclose them prior to trial. As summarized by Austin Cooper, K.C.: Justice Gravely held that the concealing of the tapes for 17 months until Bernardo’s trial had a tendency to obstruct the course of justice, and therefore the actus reus of the offence was proved. On the issue of whether Mr. Murray willfully intended to obstruct justice, because it was feasible that Mr. Murray could have used the tapes for the defence and may well have believed that he had no obligation to disclose the tapes until the trial, he found the necessary mens rea was not proved. Accordingly, he found him not guilty. I'll first attempt to explain the trial judge's reasons (R. v. Murray, 2000 CanLII 22378 (ON SC)). At the end, I answer your more general questions. Ken Murray was charged with wilfully obstructing or attempting to obstruct the course of justice. The judge applied what is known as the ""tendency test"". He said: Attempting to obstruct justice is construed as the doing of an act which has a tendency to pervert or obstruct the course of justice (the actus reus). ""Wilfully"" then constitutes the mens rea -- that is the act is done for the purpose of obstructing the course of justice He noted: The system functions within the broad principles of the presumption of innocence and the right to silence. The Crown must fully disclose its case. The defence has no reciprocal obligation. In this case, the judge found that Murray had done the actus reus of the offence: On the face of the evidence Murray's action in secreting the critical tapes had the tendency to obstruct the course of justice at several stages of the proceedings. The tapes were put beyond the reach of the police who had unsuccessfully attempted to locate them. Secreting them had the tendency to obstruct the police in their duty to investigate the crimes of Bernardo and Homolka. Further, there was no justification that negated the actus reus. This evidence on the tapes was not privilged; it was not communication between solicitor and client. The judge found that ""once [Murray] had discovered the overwhelming significance of the critical tapes, Murray... was left with but three legally justifiable options"": (a) immediately turn over the tapes to the prosecution, either directly or anonymously; (b) deposit them with the trial judge; or (c) disclose their existence to the prosecution and prepare to do battle to retain them. The Crown had to prove that Murray's intention was to obstruct the course of justice. The judge found that the Crown did not prove this element beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge found that Murray may have not intended to permanently suppress the tapes and that Murray may have believed he had no obligation to disclose the tapes prior to the trial. He had presented several theories regarding the potential usefulness of the tapes to the defence which would have required holding back the tapes for their tactical or ""surprise"" value. Also, the judge noted that the law in this area was confusing.1 While Murray made only a token effort to find out what his obligations were, had he done careful research he might have remained confused. The weight of legal opinion in Ontario is to the effect that lawyers may not conceal material physical evidence of crime, but how this rule applies to particular facts has been the subject of extensive discussion. Lawyers in the United States have been afflicted with the same dilemma. In the materials supplied to me by counsel, there is reference to at least 15 law journal discussions on the issue. Doesn't a lawyer have a responsibility not to defend a specific fact that they know is criminal? No. But they do have an obligation to not lie to the court or to allow their client to lie to the court. This is why Murray knew he had to withdraw from the case when Bernardo was committed to the defence that he had never encountered the victims. To answer your title question, ""Is a lawyer allowed to follow instructions from his client to hide evidence?"", the answer today is ""probably not."" It has even been suggested that if defence counsel is faced with this issue, they should instruct their client: It is evidence that might convict you; if you give it to me, I may have to turn it over to the prosecution. Take it away and keep it in your residence; if you destroy it, you may be guilty of a crime. The Law Society of Ontario's Rules of Professional Conduct now say (Rule 5.1-2A): A lawyer shall not counsel or participate in the concealment, destruction or alteration of incriminating physical evidence or otherwise act so as to obstruct or attempt to obstruct the course of justice. Any lawyer faced with this dilemma should probably do what Mr. Murray eventually did and retain their own lawyer and/or get advice from their law society. 1. While the maxim ""ignorance of the law is no excuse"" generally holds true,  the mens rea of this offence includes an intention to obstruct justice. The judge understood this to invite an inquiry into what Murray believed the law required of him. This approach has been criticized: see Lucinda Vandervort, ""Mistake of Law and Obstruction of Justice: A 'Bad Excuse'... Even for a Lawyer"", 2001."
"In what manner ""prescribed by law"" can a soldier be permitted to stay in a privately owned home without violating the Third Amendment?","The US Third amendment means that if the US ever wants to quarter soldiers in private houses (or other dwellings), without the consent of the owners, it can only do so in time of war, and only in accordance with some law that Congress passes, authorizing such action and providing procedures for it. To the best of my knowledge, Congress has never passed any such law, and so no such ""quartering"" would be permissible, even during wartime. Note that the text of the amendment says ""house"". This provision might be extended to other dwellings, such as apartment buildings, but probably not to any ""privately-owned building"" that is not a residence (that is, was not previously a dwelling). Such non-residences are not protected by the Third Amendment , although the takings clause of the Fifth might apply, as might the Due Process clause, depending on the circumstances. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952) would be relevant in such a case. The amendment was invoked and interpreted in Engblom v. Carey, 677 F.2d 957 (2d Cir. 1982). This is said by Wikipedia to be the first decision at the circuit court level interpreting the amendment or depending on its provisions. It has never been the basis for a US Supreme Court decision In 1979 there was a state-wide strike of NY corrections officers (prison employees). NY National Guard troops were deployed by the state. Staff had been rented apartments as part of their employment agreement. Guard troops were first housed in administrative buildings and school buildings at or near the prison. But after five days striking officer were evicted by the state, and Guard troops were housed in dorms so vacated. Two of the officers sued. The second circuit court held that: What law is being referenced? No such law currently exists. Congress could pass one in the future. During a war can American soldiers commandeer my house? Only if Congress passes such a law, and then only if whatever procedures that are ""prescribed"" by the law Congress passes are followed."""
"In USA, is it possible to end up being called to jury duty even if you have not registered to vote?","Yes, it is possible. The requirements are (1) you are a citizen (the burden is on the prospective juror to pay attention to that requirement) and (2) the court knows that you exist and calls you up for jury duty. Apart from voter registrations, drivers license data is also used (and can be dangerous, because non-citizens can have licenses and may not know that you must be a citizen to serve on a jury). Another source in unemployment benefits lists. The correlation with voter registration is one way of avoiding that problem. In fact, Florida law states that the list of candidates ""shall be taken from the male and female persons at least 18 years of age who are citizens of the United States and legal residents of this state and their respective counties and who possess a driver license or identification card issued by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles"", and does not sanction using voter lists. The Holmes County Supervisor of Elections confirms that only federal courts use voter lists, and state and local courts only use driver / ID card lists."
How to mitigate the risk of getting sued by clients (web dev contracting),"Nothing gives you complete protection.  You can (and should) have artfully drawn contracts with disclaimers and indemnification, but if the counterparties decline to comply with the contracts you may find yourself unable to remedy your liability even if you can prevail in litigation.  Likewise, you can buy insurance to cover these sorts of risks.  Insurers are regulated more tightly, but even they can fail or decide to litigate over payments.  Finally, you can insulate yourself from personal liability by conducting business through a corporation.  But even ""the corporate veil"" is not invincible. It is quite common for a contractor or sole proprietor to use all of the aforementioned countermeasures to business liability.  Consult a licensed attorney to ensure that they are properly implemented."
Can a political party falsely inform its opponent's voters that their voter registrations have been cancelled?,"The conduct described would be a felony. Two men where just convicted of state crimes this week for very similar conduct in Ohio. Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman pleaded guilty to felony
telecommunications fraud yesterday. According to Cleveland.com, the
pair ""placed thousands of robocalls with false information to largely
minority and Democratic voters in Cleveland in the months before the
November 2020 election."" They face up to a year in state prison. (Source) Michigan state law also criminalizes this conduct, which also violates federal law. Other legal consequences that they face as a result of their conduct according to the same source include the following civil and criminal cases: The men have been sued in federal court in New York City and face a
$5.1 million fine levied by the Federal Communications Commission.
Wohl and Burkman are appealing criminal charges filed against them in
Detroit stemming from a similar bogus robocall scheme targeting Black
voters. As this blurb notes, Michigan itself is in the process of prosecuting these men criminally for part of the same pattern of conduct. While it isn't inconceivable that these particular offenders may have some valid grounds for an appeal in the particular Michigan case that they are appealing (e.g. due to irregularities in their particular prosecutions), the validity of the statutes criminalizing this conduct is not seriously subject to question. The First Amendment protects a great deal of intentionally false politically motivated speech about policy and political ideas or more generally why one should vote in a particular way. But, the First Amendment does not protect a large scale organized campaign outright intentional lies about the eligibility to vote of particular voters. This distinction is explored, for example, in a 2018 law review article on political lies and the First Amendment, citing, e.g., Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191, 210 (1992); Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 788 n.9 (1983); Eu v. S.F. Cty. Democratic Ctr. Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 228 (1989) (“The State’s second justification for the ban on party endorsements and statements of opposition is that it is necessary to protect primary voters from confusion and undue influence. Certainly the State has a legitimate interest in fostering an informed electorate.”); Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U.S. 208, 220 (1986); Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U.S. 431, 442 (1970) (describing the state interest in “avoiding confusion, deception, and even frustration of the democratic process at the general election”); Va. State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Va. Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 770 (1976); and Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U.S. 351, 364 (1997). Based upon these cases, taken as a whole, the author of the law review article concludes that: In sum, many intentional lies aimed at undermining election
administration are already unconstitutional under the Fourteenth
Amendment, and if told with discriminatory partisan motives, also
violate the First Amendment. But what about intentional lies told by private actors, along the
lines of the examples provided above (poll workers, campaign
volunteers, and the like)? While such lies might be thought to be less coercive than government
lies, they also pose a serious threat to democracy. Although private
individuals must be guaranteed ample freedom to speak on matters of
public concern, I believe intentional lies meant to undermine the
right to vote may be regulated. The Supreme Court, albeit in another
context, has relaxed First Amendment rights when weighed against the
right to vote. Judicial deference is given to “generally applicable
and evenhanded restrictions that protect the integrity and reliability
of the electoral process itself.” Time and again, the Court, in evaluating various election
administration issues, has affirmed a government interest in avoiding
electoral confusion. If one can prove that someone else orchestrated or conspired in the conduct, such as a political party, it and the party officials involved can have legal responsibility for this conduct as well. One of the darlings of federal prosecutors, the mail and wire fraud statute, for example (the elements of which are set forth here by the U.S. Justice Department) would probably also apply to this fact pattern. This source cites some of the following authorities and recited their holding as follows: United States v. Hanson, 41 F.3d 580, 583 (10th Cir. 1994) (two
elements comprise the crime of wire fraud: (1) a scheme or artifice to
defraud; and (2) use of interstate wire communication to facilitate
that scheme); United States v. Faulkner, 17 F.3d 745, 771 (5th Cir.
1994) (essential elements of wire fraud are: (1) a scheme to defraud
and (2) the use of, or causing the use of, interstate wire
communications to execute the scheme), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 193
(1995); United States v. Cassiere, 4 F.3d 1006 (1st Cir. 1993) (to
prove wire fraud government must show (1) scheme to defraud by means
of false pretenses, (2) defendant's knowing and willful participation
in scheme with intent to defraud, and (3) use of interstate wire
communications in furtherance of scheme); United States v. Maxwell,
920 F.2d 1028, 1035 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (""Wire fraud requires proof of
(1) a scheme to defraud; and (2) the use of an interstate wire
communication to further the scheme.""). The remedy that is not available, however, as a general rule, is to invalidate the election that was swayed by the illegal conduct."
What would happen if qualified immunity is ended across the United States?,"As a legal matter, very little would change, other than the fact that more cases would proceed through the normal stages of civil litigation. Many cases that would have been dismissed at the Rule 12 or Rule 56 stage would instead proceed to discovery or trial. This also means that the body of civil-rights case law would grow considerably. Right now, because courts already know that a right is not ""clearly established"" (the second prong of the QI inquiry), they will often refuse to consider whether an officer's actions were unconstitutional (the first prong of the QI inquiry). This has retarded the development of case law in these areas, but that problem could largely be cured with the end of qualified immunity. The end of qualified immunity wouldn't change a plaintiff's ability to sue officers personally. Even with qualified immunity, plaintiffs can and do sue officers personally. Qualified immunity lets some officers off the hook, but many officers nonetheless remain exposed to liability even after attempting to invoke it. Ending qualified immunity would merely increase -- albeit substantially -- the number of officers who can be held personally liable. That wouldn't mean that the officers would personally be required to carry insurance, though. A state or city could impose that requirement, but generally speaking, there's no such obligation. Instead, their employers typically carry their own insurance policies or are self-insured, and those policies cover claims against the officers working for the employer."
Are U.S. mailboxes federal property?,"The real story is that the articles you link to are logically fallacious. The first hedges its assertions by saying a mailbox is ""effectively considered"" to be federal property.  It cites 18 USC 1705, which it correctly notes ""puts your mailbox under Federal jurisdiction.""  But that's not the same as assuming ownership of it.  The piece also says that you ""effectively lease"" your mailbox to the federal government, which is a somewhat exaggerated way of putting it, but even if we accept it at face value it falls far short of a claim that the mailbox is federal property. The second concludes that mailbox tampering is a federal offense because ""the mailbox belongs to and is controlled by the USPS.""  There is no evidence offered to support the assertion of ownership, and there is of course an alternative explanation for the fact that mailbox tampering is a federal offense, which is that there are laws such as the aforementioned 18 USC 1705 that prohibit it.  These laws, however, say nothing about ownership. The third is ultimately based on the assertion of a letter carrier who said, ""Listen, lady, your friends don’t own these mailboxes. We do.""  The claim was made in explanation of the prohibition against private individuals putting items into a mailbox.  As far as I can see, the article is off the mark in another way: that prohibition has nothing to do with safety and security, but rather with protecting the postal service's revenue: it arises from 18 USC 1725, which explicitly is about avoiding the payment of postage.  In any event, it does not establish ownership. In short, the idea that all mailboxes are federal property is a myth, as implied by the USPS page you link to. To what extent do property owners have control over their own mailbox? To a fairly high extent, but they do need to comply with the relevant law.  They can't, for example, hang a plastic bottle by the roadside for the purpose of receiving their mail. Can they deface or place non-mail in their own mailbox? 18 USC 1705 actually prohibits willful or malicious injury, tearing down, or destruction of a mailbox, not defacing.  So technically, they could, but a prosecution seems highly unlikely.  Under section 1725, placing non-mail in the box is only prohibited to the extent that there is intent to avoid paying postage.  That would be difficult to establish for someone putting something in their own mailbox. Can they tear it down with no intent to replace it? If they're willing to forego mail delivery, yes.  They may be able to arrange to have the mail held for retrieval at the post office.  If they do not, their mail will be returned to the sender as undeliverable.  This arises from the Domestic Mail Manual, which says (in general) that ""customers must provide authorized mail receptacles or door slots"" as a condition of city delivery (I could not find a corresponding requirement for rural delivery, but it must exist somewhere).  The manual also describes requirements for customer mail receptacles."
"Do cats have a ""right to roam"" in the UK?","The statement that cats cannot commit trespass is technically true, but is also a misreading of ss.4 and 4A of the Animals Act. Those sections replace a common-law doctrine called ""cattle trespass"", which was a specific tort (a civil wrong) concerning what happens when my cattle stray onto your land. Both old and new rules apply only to livestock, so not just cows but other kinds of farm animals as well - but not to dogs or cats. Horses are a special case (s.4A). Since cats are not livestock, they cannot be the subject of cattle trespass and are not covered by section 4. Further, since they are animals, they cannot commit the tort of trespass at all. Animals themselves are not liable at law. As the keeper of cows, it would be me who was liable in a case of cattle trespass, not the cow. The point of s.4, and its predecessor in common law, is to make me liable for damage done to your property by my cows, regardless of whether I was negligent in the way I looked after them (it is a ""strict liability""). The mere fact that they've strayed onto your land and done damage is enough. Because cats are not cows, this particular rule does not apply. That does not mean that cats can't be the subject of other torts. In particular, cats could be involved in the tort of nuisance, which covers all sorts of potential scenarios - noise, smells, etc. This has typically happened when there are lots and lots of cats. And under the Animals Act, the keeper of any animal may be liable for damage that it does, including physical injury or damage to property. Section 2 of the Act establishes a statutory distinction between whether I am liable for the damage, or strictly liable. In a scenario where I am strictly liable, you do not have to prove that I was negligent in my management of the animal. Broadly, that applies if the animal belongs to a dangerous species, or is unusually dangerous in itself. (There has been very complex litigation on this point which I am not discussing here.) If my cat is not a real vicious bastard of a cat, but just a regular cat, then I can still be liable for damage that he does: it's just not automatic. Following Rachael Mulheron's Principles of Tort Law (CUP, 2nd ed., 2016), for an action in negligence there are several key points - Proving that D, the owner/keeper of an animal, owed C a duty of care, where C was injured by that animal, has been a straightforward task. The court must be satisfied that a reasonable person in the position of D, the keeper of the animal, would foresee a real risk of injury to C arising from D's particular acts or omissions in dealing with the animal. Otherwise, in the absence of that foreseeability, a reasonable D would have done nothing different in response to the risk posed by his animal. To fall below the standard of reasonable care as a keeper of an animal, D must have failed to do that which a reasonable keeper would have done (to supervise/fence/control, etc, the animal), or have done something which a reasonable keeper would not have done. In damage-by-animals cases, C must prove that, as in the usual negligence action, D's failure to supervise/handle/care for the animals caused C's injury on the balance of probabilities. As in other negligence cases, there are various defences; if you hassled my cat and it scratched you, then that's your fault and not mine. From the material quoted above, we can see that for a normal cat in the UK, where the owner is not doing anything unusual by letting it roam freely outdoors (as is typical for UK cats), it is going to be hard to meet the tests. Things may be different if D knows that C is allergic to cats, or that the cat has been eyeing up C's delicious prize goldfish, or has a bone to pick with D's own cat and is likely to attack her, or something. Most of the big cases under the Animals Act have involved animals who are more likely to cause damage, such as dogs, horses and cows; a cat is only legally different because (1) unlike for dogs, horses and cows, there are no special rules applying to cats, and (2) factually, most cats don't do much harm. To that point, even if D is liable in the way described, C may not get very much out of them by way of damages. Defecation in C's garden is not pleasant, but is probably not worth a lot of money either."
Can someone replicate and freely use anyone's voice using AI?,"Not copyright as such because that is about protecting a 'work' — a voice is not a 'work'. As the court said in one of the following examples, ""A voice is not copyrightable. The sounds are not 'fixed.'"" (You could copyright a roar or a yell — some kind of fixed arrangement of sound(s).) But some jurisdictions have recognised property rights in voices and/or that the voice is protected by the person's 'right of publicity' (the right to control the commercial exploitation of their identity, of which the voice is a part). For example: Bette Wins Ruling In ‘Sound-Alike’ Lawsuit - AP News June 23, 1988 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ A federal appeals court has reinstated a lawsuit
filed by entertainer Bette Midler after an advertising agency
allegedly tried to duplicate her voice and singing style in one of its
ad campaigns. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled Wednesday that
Midler could pursue her suit against the Ford Motor Co. and the Young
& Rubicam advertising agency. The court said certain personal
attributes - such as a voice - can be considered property rights,
protected by state law. ... U.S. District Judge Ferdinand Fernandez said Young & Rubicam acted like ″the average thief″ but dismissed Midler’s suit, saying no law prohibits imitation of a singer’s voice. But the appeals court disagreed. ""A voice is as distinctive and personal as a face,″ the appeals court said. ″When a distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known and is deliberately imitated in order to sell a product, the sellers have appropriated what is not theirs."" judgment in Midler v Ford Another case in the US is Waits v Frito-Lay Inc. The US Court of Appeal found that a radio commercial's imitation of the voice of Tom Waits constituted a civil tort, ""voice misappropriation"". I'm not aware of any cases involving computer synthesis of voices."

Born on a plane,"Skyborn are a known phenomenon. Generally, the kid automatically gets citizenship from his mom (and father) through bloodline, so our skyborn on that plane is likely that citizenship(s). There are cases that can't grant a citizenship that way (among them: Vatican is only granted ex officio) The sky is also treated as an extension of the land below. If the country you fly over has Jus Soli, it grants citizenship to the baby born above it. The USA has Jus Soli in its 14th amendment, our skyborn baby has dual citizenship to whatever country the mom is from. And in case the plane is over unclaimed water - think a nonstop flight Vancouver-Tokyo by Lufthansa - maritime law applies: The airplane is registered somewhere and treated as territory of that land while over international water. Lufthansa is in Germany, so the kid is, on paper, born in Berlin Germany (as that is what Germany prescribes for air- or seaborn). Germany does not use the unrestricted jus soli but the first test is the bloodline to determine what's the kid's citizenship is, unless the kid would have no citizenship through bloodline. So, if any one parent is German, the child is German. jus soli applies mostly to children of someone who has a permanent residence permit for at least 3 years and has been in Germany for the last 8 years: then the kid is (also) German, even if that grants dual citizenship - till the child is 23 and has to choose one of its citizenships. However, if all known parents are stateless or can't grant the kid citizenship through their bloodline (Yes, that happens!), then the kid born on this international flight has the right to become a German citizen - but some rules still apply. Now, which state's office is responsible? That is even more tricky. Technically, OP's kid that is born in Nebraskan Airspace is a Nebraskan, so it should be a Nebraskan birth-certificate. But the general rule in maritime practice would be to file the papers in the next port the ship lands, that would be Maryland if applied to planes. For a german registered ship or plane (my Lufthansa example), the responsible municipality would be Berlin, unless another municipality is responsible. And then, I thank hszmv for this US Addendum: It should be pointed out that in the U.S. state citizenship is based on primary residency and can be changed over time. I've personally been a Maryland citizen, a Florida Citizen, and a Maryland citizen for a second time in my life. Usually state citizenship denotes exclusively where your vote is cast. No state can restrict a U.S. citizen from taking up residence in that state per constitution. So the Nebraska vs. MD distinction is academic only... the kid could move to California for the rest of his life without much fanfare. So, as a result, let's assume the parents of the Skyborn actually live in New York. Then te kid gets registered as a New York Citizen, his place of birth is ""Above Nebraska"" (or the state's equivalent rule) on OP's hypothetical. The couple on the Lufthansa flight could ask to have Berlin (Germany) written into the record, as that is where the interior of all Lufthansa planes is to be considered under the law over international waters."
"Was Alex Jones's attorney handing over phone-record evidence a ""mishap"" or required by law?","Was Alex Jones's attorney handing over phone-record evidence a ""mishap"" or required by law? The discovery phase, which concluded before the trial began, required Alex Jones to provide texts and emails mentioning Sandy Hook (among other things). He did not provide any and testified in writing and in court he could find none. On August 3rd 2022, day seven of the trial, plaintiffs' attorney Mark Bankston claimed he had obtained from Jones's attorneys a digital copy of Jones's cellphone on which there were texts and emails that mentioned Sandy Hook. He said this copy was mistakenly provided to him. Whether accidental or deliberate, this copy or its texts and emails mentioning Sandy Hook were not provided during discovery. Judge Gamble told the jury about the digital copy, ""we don't know whether it was on accident or on purpose... but what we do know is that it wasn't properly turned over when it should have been."" https://youtu.be/qhtz_6JKSh8?t=7658 A video clip of the part of the hearing in question, when Bankston begins asking Jones about the texts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpnSCIak5A8.

Mark Bankston for the plaintiffs, addressing Jones: ""Your attorneys messed up and sent me a digital copy of your entire cellphone, with every text message you sent for the past two years. And, when informed, did not take any steps to identify it as privileged or protected in any way, and as of two days ago it fell free and clear into my possession. And that is how I know you lied to me when you said you didn't have text messages about Sandy Hook."" The above quote begins 5mins into the first clip or this timestamp in the longer clip https://youtu.be/qhtz_6JKSh8?t=6830). After the texts, Bankston asked questions about emails not being turned over... Jones had sworn he didn't even use email. Bankston showed him emails that appeared to be written by Jones. ""I must have dictated them"" said Jones. Judge Gamble told the jury about the digital copy, ""we don't know it was on accident or on purpose, but what we do know is it wasn't properly turned over when it should have been."" https://youtu.be/qhtz_6JKSh8?t=7665 Bankston told journalist Dan Solomon the phone copy was put in a Dropbox the parties were using to exchange materials. Bankston did not believe it was put there deliberately and notified Jones's attorneys. Apparently Jones's attorneys did not respond. Under Texas law they had ten days to assert privilege or say the material was put there by mistake, Rule 193.3(d) - as of August 3rd Bankston was legally free to read and use the material. (There is some gossip online about what was supposedly heard on 'hot mic' between Reynal and Bankston, I haven't heard it myself and have no timestamps or clips. I do think I heard Jones, after leaving the witness box, ask Reynal ""they got my text messages?"") [edit] Incidentally, this isn't the first time that Jones / his attorneys failed to comply with discovery orders in relation to these Sandy Hook cases - a number of sanctions and default judgements have gone against him for that. Indeed this damages phase is the result of the default judgment against him in September 2021 for failing to comply with discovery: ""The Court find that Defendants unreasonably and vexatiously failed to comply with their discovery duties. The Court finds that Defendants' failure to comply with discovery in this case is greatly aggravated by Defendants' consistent pattern of discovery abuse throughout the other similar cases pending before this Court."" [edit 2] On August 4th 2022 Jones's attorneys have filed an emergency motion that seems to settle the issue of whether the provision of all the material was a ""mishap"": they say it was ""inadvertently"" supplied. text of the motion They claim they promptly informed plaintiffs' attorneys about the mistake but the latter used the material anyway in violation of privilege, procedure and the court's protective order. Now Twitter lawyers are arguing about whether the language used by the defence was adequate to engage the rules mentioned above. But this doesn't seem to resolve the issue of why the material demanded for discovery was not supplied for discovery or why Jones testifed he could not find such material. Judge Gamble denied the request for a blanket protective order to seal the record of the text messages and denied the motion for mistrial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKbAmNwbiMk"
"Can you be punished for planning a crime and what constitutes ""planning""?","Can you be punished for planning a crime and what constitutes ""planning""? The intent to commit certain classes of crimes is punishable. That being said, there is a difference between intent and a mere wish. Intent is inferred from statements or circumstances indicating that a person's actions were (or are) devised toward knowingly committing the underlying crime. The Black's Law Dictionary defines intent as ""[D]esign, resolve, or determination with which [a] person acts. [...] [M]ental action at its most advanced point [...]. It is the exercise of intelligent will, the mind being fully aware of the nature and consequences of the act which is about to be done"" (brackets added). By contrast, a wish that goes no further than fantasizing or expressing ""I want to do this"" usually is inconsequential from a legal standpoint. One exception to that relates to promoting offenses such as terrorism, murder, and arguably pedophilia. Even if it is proved that the person making those expressions has no propensity or intent to indulge in the criminal conduct he depicts, the expressions themselves might encourage others to do so. That encouragement makes it more difficult for a government to prevent those crimes from being committed and to identify the perpetrator(s)."
"Is murder in Washington, DC pardonable by the President?","The Department of Justice's Office of the Pardon attorney says yes: Under the Constitution, only federal criminal convictions, such as those adjudicated in the United States District Courts, may be pardoned by the President. In addition, the President's pardon power extends to convictions adjudicated in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and military court-martial proceedings. Like other felonies committed in the District, murder charges are adjudicated by federal prosecutors in the Superior Court, so they would fall within the scope of the presidential pardon power, as interpreted by the DOJ.

"Can ""Right to Repair"" laws (or other laws) require a company to open source their proprietary firmware?","The Right to Repair generally talks about hardware, not firmware or software, and only to the point of restoring ""original"" functionality. For example, RTR would make it prohibited to have Apple require that they fix your phone battery for hundreds of dollars and make it impossible for you, or a third-party shop, to do the repair instead. In Sonos case, RTR would imply that if your speaker blew a fuse (or capacitor, etc), you should have the right to fix that yourself, and they should provide you with reasonable instructions and hardware to do so. That said, if you look at the Sonos OSS references, at least a few of the licenses suggest that you can't release derivatives under more restrictive languages. Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any case law that establishes this would work, and it would be really expensive to try and find out. There's also the problem of Intellectual Property and Copyright that they could try to argue as reasons why they can't release the proprietary bits that make their hardware run. Any other options would be, unfortunately, illegal, in part because of the DMCA. Edit: Looking further into this, I found that there is H.R.4006 - Fair Repair Act, which, if passed, would require manufacturers of some hardware to offer diagnostic tools and public copies of firmware. In addition, there are also actions being taken by iFixit at the Copyright Office to allow an exception to DMCA violations for the purposes of patching firmware. Also, the President of the United States issued an Executive Order that, among other things, instructs the FTC to set rules against anticompetitive repair policies. Much of this has moved forward in just the last year, so it's relatively new to me, but it sounds like an even stronger indicator that Sonos is probably not going to have that defense much longer, unless they totally abandon their old hardware, in which case, it may become legal to hack your own firmware."
Is simple possession of a copyright-infringing item legal in the USA?,"Nothing in Tile 17 of the US code (which is the copyright law) makes it illegal or even actionable to simply posses a single physical object (such as a game or a book) which constitutes a copyright infringement. Criminal copyright infringement is defined in 17 USC 506 and is limited to people who: However, in practice, the US Department of Justice only brings criminal copyright cases when infringement is carried on as a business, on a bulk or mass basis, and only when infringing copies are in fact distributed to the public. In practice the vast majority of copyright enforcement (both in the US and in other countries) is done by private suits by copyright owners or rights-holders. In the US such suits are generally to enforce the rights guaranteed in 17 USC 106. This protects six core rights (summarized): The copyright owner can do any of these or authorize other to do them. Anyone doing any of these without such permission is an infringer unless one of the exceptions or limitations in sections 107 thru 122 applies. There are also the ""moral rights"" specified in section 106A. These apply only to works of visual art in the US, and grant the artist the right to: Note that none of the six rights from sec 106 or the five moral rights from sec 106A covers possession of an infringing copy. One caution: so-called ""first-sale rights"" (from 17 USC 109) do not apply to an infringing copy, and it is infringement to knowingly sell, lend, rent or otherwise distribute an infringing copy. But the purchaser is not an infringer. Also, to play an infringing copy of a game might be a violation of the right to ""publicly perform"" the work, but not if done in private. However, in running a game it is likely that one or more temporary copies would be made. This is lawful if done from a lawful copy, but not if the person does not posses a lawfully-made copy. So playing an infringing copy of a game might well constitute an act of infringement, although a suit over a private act is unlikely."
Can a private company refuse to sell a franchise to someone solely based on being black?,"Can a private company refuse to sell a franchise to someone solely
based on being black? No. Racial discrimination in franchising by a private company in the United States is prohibited by 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and also under many state laws such as Cal. Civil Code §§ 51, 51.8, and is further informed by the definitions of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e. See also, this commentary. 42 U.S.C. § 1981 provides in the pertinent part: All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have
the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce
contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens. . . . [T]he term
‘make and enforce contracts’ includes the making, performance,
modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all
benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual
relationship. Many cases have enforced this protection from racial discrimination in the franchising context. See, e.g., Int’l House of Pancakes, Inc. v. Albarghouthi, No. 04-cv02264-MSK-MEH, 2007 WL 2669117 (D. Colo. Sept. 6, 2007); Elkhatib v. Dunkin’ Donuts, Inc., 493 F.3d 827 (7th Cir. 2007); Harper v. BP Exploration & Oil, Inc., 134 F.3d 371 (6th Cir. 1998); Pointer v. Bldg. Stars Advantage, No. 4:03-cv-01237-HEA, Bus. Franchise Guide (CCH) ¶ 12, 960 (E.D. Mo. Apr. 26, 2004), aff’d, 115 F. App’x 321 (8th Cir. 2004); Home Repair, Inc. v. Paul W. Davis Sys., Inc., No. 98 C 4074, 1998 WL 721099 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 9, 1998) (motion to dismiss); 2000 WL 126905 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 1, 2000) (motion for summary judgment); Smith v. Molly Maid, Inc., 415 F. Supp. 2d 905 (N.D. Ill. 2006). Employment law protections rarely apply to franchise relationships. See Adcock v. Chrysler Corp., 166 F.3d 1290, 1294 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding that because Chrysler did not control day-to-day operations of dealership, dealer would not be considered employee for sex discrimination claim); Mangram v. Gen. Motors Corp., 108 F.3d 61, 63 (4th Cir. 1997) (holding that General Motors dealers are not employees of General Motors and that plaintiff, at best, demonstrated that as a participant in General Motors’ Minority Dealership Development Program he was a trainee for a nonemployment relationship with General Motors for purposes of age discrimination claim). This question was a result of a recent conversation regarding Chick
Filet only selling their franchises to Christians. I thought that was
discriminatory, but was told a private company can do anything they
want because they are privately owned. I find this very hard to
believe is the case in 2021. Can anyone shed some light on this
subject? Not all kinds of discrimination are prohibited by Section 1981 (which was enacted shortly after the adoption of the 14th Amendment in the post-U.S. Civil War context and is the only or primary federal non-discrimination law applicable to franchise contracts), although state law protections are often broader. See Saint Francis Coll. v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U.S. 604, 613 (1987)(holding that § 1981 does not address discrimination claims based on national origin); Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 167 (1976) (noting that § 1981 does not cover discrimination based on gender or religion); Kodish v. United Air Lines, Inc., 628 F.2d 1301, 1303 (10th Cir. 1980) (finding age discrimination claim not addressed by § 1981). In particular, discrimination on the basis of religion in franchising contracts is not prohibited by federal law, although it is prohibited by state law in some states. But a franchisee in operating the franchise business must follow all state and federal non-discrimination laws that apply to public accommodations with respect to their customers, and must follow all state and federal non-discrimination laws that apply to employees with respect to their employees."
Does volunteer photographer own copyright?,"What a lovely question! US Copyright law is clear: the author of a creative work owns the copyright unless it is work for hire. In this instance, the photographer is not doing work for hire so they own the copyright. However, the photographer does not own a copy of the photograph – that is owned by the owner of the camera. The photographer cannot demand that they give him a copy but the parties can agree on such a transfer on whatever terms they like. As the owner of a “physical” copy they can do what they like with that copy but they cannot duplicate it except as fair use or as licensed. They could sell the memory card to whomever they like but the new owner couldn’t copy it either so it would seriously limit publication. Similarly they could move the file provided there was only one copy. Arguably, they could make a print of it providing they deleted the electronic version without copyright violation. Which brings us to who owns the copyright now. The camera owner can argue that the photographer has gifted the copyright to them. This is quite a strong argument as the parties' intentions at the time of arranging the taking of the photograph is that the photographer would have no further interest in it – after all he probably doesn’t want to hang a photo of some strangers on his wall. However, in many jurisdictions, including the united-states, copyright transfers must be in writing. As a fallback position the camera owner can argue there is an implicit license given even if copyright was not transferred. The scope of the license then becomes an issue. It is probably indisputable that the license is perpetual and royalty free. What is arguable is if the license allows commercial exploitation or only personal use. This is where the battle lines would be drawn and I don’t know how it would play out. For example, in Australia, copyright in a photo commissioned “for valuable consideration” for a “private or domestic purpose” vests in the commissioning party, not the photographer; even though this is not work for hire by an employee. For the circumstances you describe, the purpose is “private or domestic” but there is no “valuable consideration” so the photographer owns the copyright in this case. However, if there was an agreement to “pay” the photographer (even one as simple as “I’ll take your family photo if you’ll take mine”) then the person who asked for the photo to be taken owns the copyright."
Is presenting a play showing Military characters in a bad light a crime in the US? Or does the First Admendment prevent this?,"In Schacht vs. United States, 398 U.S. 58 (1970) the US Supreme Court held the final clause of 10 USC 772(f) unconstitutional on just this ground. In that case anti-war protesters rehearsed and performed a skit in which soldiers shot and killed a character dressed as a member of the Vietcong, only to discover and proclaim that the character was a pregnant woman. One of them, Daniel Jay Schacht, was indicted in a United States District Court for violating 18 U.S.C. 702, ... He was tried and convicted by a jury, and on February 29, 1968, he was sentenced to pay a fine of $250 and to serve a six-month prison term, the maximum sentence allowable ... In the opinion by Justice Black, the Court held; This clause on its face simply restricts 772 (f)'s authorization to those dramatic portrayals that do not ""tend to discredit"" the military, but, when this restriction is read together with 18 U.S.C. 702, it becomes clear that Congress has in effect made it a crime for an actor wearing a military uniform to say things during his performance critical of the conduct or policies of the Armed Forces. ... ... it follows that his conviction can be sustained only if he can be punished for speaking out against the role of our Army and our country in Vietnam. Clearly punishment for this reason would be an unconstitutional abridgment of freedom of speech. The final clause of 772 (f), which leaves Americans free to praise the war in Vietnam but can send persons like Schacht to prison for opposing it, cannot survive in a country which has the First Amendment. To preserve the constitutionality of 772 (f) that final clause must be stricken from the section. In United States vs Hamilton (2012) the US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals limited 18 U.S.C. § 702 (wearing a military uniform without authorization), and 18 U.S.C. § 704(a) and (d) (wearing military medals and other insignia  without authorization). Hamilton had, among other actions, appeared at a  Vietnam Veterans’ Recognition Ceremony in the dress Uniform of a Colonel of US Marines, wearing numerous medals and awards including two  Navy  Crosses, four Silver Stars, one Bronze Star, and seven Purple Hearts. He had in fact been medically discharged years earlier with less than 1 year of service, after an accident to his hand, with the rank of Private First Class (PFC).  He had not been awarded any of the medals or decorations that he wore. (He had previously been apprehended on military bases three times wearing the uniforms of a colonel (once) and a lieutenant general (twice), but was not charged on those occasions.) The Fourth Circuit wrote: We observe that the Ninth Circuit applied such a limiting construction to Section 704(a) in United  States  v.  Perelman, holding that the statute created a criminal offense prohibiting the unauthorized wearing of military medals only when the wearer ""has an intent to deceive."" (658 F.3d at 1137-38) In our view, the imposition of a limiting construction  requiring  an  ""intent  to  deceive""  is  appropriate with respect to both Sections 702 and 704(a). ... Accordingly,  we  hold  that  persons violate the insignia statutes if they wear a military uniform without authorization, or wear military medals or imitations of such medals, respectively, only when they do so with the intent to deceive. The Fourth Circuit went on to hold these provisions constitutional when so limited, and to uphold the convictions under them, quoting Schacht is support of this holding."
Can I request a copy of my password hash with GDPR?,"First of all, a password is not personal data. ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person; From GDPR Article 4 (https://gdpr-info.eu) As for password hashes, what do you mean by requesting a copy of yours?

High School forced labor for grades?,"Various elements could be legal, or not. For example, it is legal to require students to do things in order to pass a class. It is legal to require a student to write a program for a course (entirely, or in part). It is legal for a teacher to give a ""group grade"". It is not clear whether it is legal to require the student to assign copyright or license to the teacher / school – it may be legal to require a student to pay for their class, and copyright transfer might be valuable consideration for such a contract (assuming that there is a contractual relation at all as opposed to a statutory mandate – e.g. ""high school""). If this is a public school, you can't make students pay for a mandatory class, therefore you cannot require assignment of copyright. It is very probably illegal for the student to access the educational records of other students, but the app could be developed with dummy data."
Can one be liable for poisoning food one expects to be stolen?,"(I'm taking for granted that the question is about the application of poison to food, and I'm answering the general question about liability for poisoning food expected to be stolen. Whether application of a particular hot sauce meets that assumption is outside the scope of my answer.) The facts right now are: If you poison the food in a situation where a reasonable person would foresee theft and subsequent injury, then you are liable for at least the tort of negligence if the thief is in fact injured. Simply adding a note saying ""don't steal"" doesn't disclose the danger. Do you have a duty of care to other people with access to your food? (That is the remaining element of negligence.) Yes. (See http://premisesliability.uslegal.com/duty-owed-trespassers/). You have a duty to not willfully or wontonly trap or otherwise prepare harm for would-be tresspassers, and I believe that extends to lunchroom thieves. But, the simple answer is don't poison food!"

What would happen if Protagoras v Euathlus were heard in court today?,"What would happen if Protagoras v Euathlus were heard in court today? what would have happened if this case were to be tried in a modern-day courtroom? Generally speaking, Protagoras's position would prevail under contract law.  Protagoras and Euathlus entered a contract in which the exchange of considerations involves tutoring and compensation therefor. Since the agreement nowhere portrays compensation as contingent on Euathlus not declining to exercise as lawyer, the most reasonable inference is that the parties' understanding at the time of the formation of their contract implicitly ruled out that scenario. Or at least that risk, which is under Euathlus's control, was not disclosed to Protagoras. Thus, the contingency cannot be said to be knowingly entered by Protagoras (contract law is premised, inter alia, on all the conditions being entered knowingly and willfully by the parties). The paradox conveys that Euathlus changed his mind ""after been trained"". Even if ruling out Euahtlus's change of mind is viewed as a mistake of both parties which could make their contract voidable, Protagoras would entitled to restitution for the performance of his duties. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts at § 152(2). The condition that compensation be made after Euathlus's first win in court can be interpreted twofold; namely, as: Protagoras's acting as creditor towards Euathlus while the latter obtains funds with which to pay the tutoring; or Protagoras's form of guarantee that the tutoring he provides to Euathlus is effective, since winning a case in court may be taken as evidence (again, if we assume that nowadays courts are ""all integrity and honesty"") of having received competent training. Both interpretations strengthen Protagoras's legal position, as these evidence his commitment to the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, respectively. By contrast, Euathlus only benefited from both standpoints without giving anything in return to Protagoras. Furthermore, Euathlus's eventual decision not to work as lawyer amounts to forfeiting the aforementioned guarantee, since his unilateral decision precludes testing the effectiveness of the tutoring he received. Has thousands of years of legal development created a resolution to the paradox? The Paradox of the Court is more of a philosophical challenge for beginners that stays there and leaves out many (im-)practicalities and legal issues. But an assumption that the Ancient Greeks would not have considered these aspects in a real-life controversy would be naive and oversimplistic, especially if we bear in mind the great intellectual development they achieved. Here I only cited the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, which is frequently cited by U.S. courts deciding contract disputes. But I can assure you that many of these principles as well as issues of impracticalities were essentially (and perhaps similarly) addressed by Aristotle."
I am 16. Can my parents legally transfer my money I have earned from my own job to their account and take it?,"You must confirm with your banking institution that the account you have with them is solely in your name.  There is a very good chance that it is not, which would mean that the account is joint-owned until you reach 18 years old. Ownership of an account implies that one can deposit and withdraw money at will, with no need to justify or rationalize the action. There could be other implications to be had around them just taking the money and not giving it back, but it starts with confirming that the bank account is, as you state, yours and yours alone."
"When a criminal statute is struck down as unconstitutional, what happens to people who were convicted under it?","Generally speaking if it is substantively unconstitutional for the government to punish a certain kind of criminal conduct, then this provides a basis for a ""collateral attack"" on the conviction to set it aside (in a post-conviction motion in state or federal court), even if the criminal defendant serving a sentence has already appealed the conviction directly (i.e. to the court of appeals and all higher appellate court that review that court of appeals) to the fullest extent possible and lost. But this is not self-executing. Someone has to file a court case on behalf of the person incarcerated to make it happen. It does not generally entitle the criminal defendant to compensation for wrongful incarceration or to a return of fines paid, although it would end the authority of the state to incarcerate the individual going forward or the compel that individual to pay the balance of unpaid fines. There might be a right to have the case sealed, but the ruling does not automatically remove the conviction from the criminal record of the defendant. And, getting the case sealed is likely to be harder in the circumstance where all of the sentence for the unconstitutional offense has been fully served. When a past conviction does not meet the standards of current law from a procedural context, in contrast, this may be raised in pending direct appeals, but is rarely something that can be brought up in a post-decision collateral attack on the conviction unless certain other exceptions apply (e.g. sometimes if a collateral attack pending before the decision is still pending at the time of the decision or in certain extraordinary cases involving due process concerns that cast deep doubt on the validity of all convictions obtained by that means), and even in cases where it is set aside, does not pose a double jeopardy bar against a new prosecution for the crime that meets the appropriate procedural standards. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently considering the proper treatment under these rules of its holding that non-unanimous juries were an unconstitutional manner by which to convict someone of a felony, which is a procedural rule, but may fall within the exception that makes the new rule retroactive anyway. For cases on direct review, a new rule for the conduct of criminal
prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or
federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception
for cases in which the new rule constitutes a ‘clear break’ with the
past Justice Harlan's habeas approach was first adopted by a plurality
in Teague v. Lane and then by the Court in Penry v. Lynaugh. Thus,
for collateral review in federal courts of state court criminal
convictions, the general rule is that new rules of constitutional
interpretation—those not 'dictated by precedent existing at the time
the defendant's conviction became final'—will not be applied. However,
[a] new rule applies retroactively in a collateral proceeding only if
(1) the rule is substantive or (2) the rule is a 'watershed rul[e] of
criminal procedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy
of the criminal proceeding. Put another way, a new rule will be
applied in a collateral proceeding only if it places certain kinds of
conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to
prescribe or constitutes a new procedure[ ] without which the
likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished. In
Montgomery v. Louisiana, the Court extended the holding of Teague beyond the context of federal habeas review, such that when a new
substantive rule of constitutional law controls the outcome of a case,
state collateral review courts must give retroactive effect to that
rule in the same manner as federal courts engaging in habeas review. As a result, at least with regard to the first exception, the Court has held that the Teague rule is constitutionally based, as
substantive rules set forth categorical guarantees that place certain
laws and punishments beyond a state’s power, making the resulting
conviction or sentence . . . by definition . . . unlawful. In
contrast, procedural rules are those that are aimed at enhancing the
accuracy of a conviction or sentence by regulating the manner of
determining the defendant’s guilt. As a consequence, with respect to a
defendant who did not receive the benefit of a new procedural rule,
the possibility exists that the underlying conviction or sentence may
still be accurate and the defendant’s continued confinement may still
be lawful under the Constitution. In this vein, the Court has
described a substantive rule as one that alters the range of conduct
that the law punishes, or that prohibits a certain category of
punishment for a class of defendants because of their status or
offense. Under the second exception it is not enough under Teague to
say that a new rule is aimed at improving the accuracy of a trial.
More is required. A rule that qualifies under this exception must not
only improve accuracy, but also alter our understanding of the bedrock
procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding. From here."
Is a debt canceled if the creditor refuses a settlement offer?,"Is there any validity to these claims? No, except maybe in bankruptcy proceedings that involve additional circumstances/factors. A loan is a contract. What you describe is simply a debtor's attempt to replace the contract he incurred with a creditor. As such, the creditor is entitled to decline the settlement offer, thereby leaving the initial contract (in this case, the original conditions of the loan) in force. Generally speaking, declining a new proposal does not invalidate the contract that would have been replaced if the offeree were to accept such proposal."
Is an attorney allowed to turn on their client?,"Andy would be almost immediately disbarred and might also be held in contempt of court. Andy would be disbarred for reasons including his violations of the duty of confidentiality owed by Andy to his client Dave under Rule of Professional Conduct 1.6 in a context like this one. This would be considered an open and shut blatant violation of one of the highest and most serious ethical obligations that an attorney has, and is neck and neck with the rule against stealing money from your clients as a ground for near automatic disbarment. The clarity and severity of the breach of professional ethics by Andy in this regard (and other aspects such as his fiduciary duties to his clients and duty of zealous and diligent advocacy for his client) leaves no ambiguity regarding the appropriate level of discipline. Andy might be held in contempt of court for reasons including knowingly disrupting a court proceeding in which he was or is an attorney of record. He can't quit representing Dave until the court grants his permission to do so. Dave's trial would probably not go forward or his conviction would be set aside. In all likelihood, a trial with a new prosecutor not exposed to the information would be arranged to avoid the taint of the breach of privilege. This would be because providing the prosecutor with inadmissible evidence taints the ability of the prosecutor to proceed untainted by inadmissible evidence and would constitute ineffective assistance of counsel which is one of the grounds for setting aside a conviction for a violation of the 6th Amendment to the US Constitution, which grants the right to effective counsel. what if Dave was openly admitting to having committed the crime, This is utterly irrelevant. Criminal defense lawyers aren't only or mostly for innocent people, and their main job isn't really to get people acquitted of crimes they committed. Instead, a criminal defense lawyer's job is to hold the prosecution to their duties to prove their case, to force the criminal justice system to comply with civil liberties protections, to prevent convictions of excessive charges for the conduct committed, and finally to secure appropriate sentences for their clients (which usually means negotiating a plea bargain). Criminal defense lawyers prevent defendants from being convicted and sentenced in circumstances where they wouldn't have been convicted or sentenced if they weren't ignorant of the legal system (which most criminal defendants are). what if Dave was . . . was boasting about committing more crimes as
soon as Andy gets him off the hook. A vague statement like this does not trigger any right of Dave to take any action differently. It's basically bravado or a statement about his own character in general. What if Dave was openly boasting about acts of terrorism he was about
to commit, etc. If he was about to commit an act of terrorism but was thwarted, Andy needs to keep his mouth shut. If Andy knows that Dave is about to imminently commit a specific terrorist act then this very distinct fact pattern raised different issues and belongs in a separate question. The crime-fraud exception to the duty of confidentiality, and the way that an ethical lawyer can take appropriate action in a way that minimizes harm to the client, all involve considerations very different from those in the main question. Is Andy forced to be a tool/bystander to Dave's
villainy? Is Andy ever allowed to take action against Dave without
consequence? The duty of a lawyer not to use his services to further a crime is also a very distinct fact pattern. But, failing to report imminent unilateral acts by a client in furtherance of a crime or fraud is very different from not using information about a client's past actions or vague future intentions against the client, and is also different from using a lawyer as a tool to commit a crime or fraud. These are three distinct situations. A different analysis applies to each one."
Elder relative unwilling to change will to reflect current wishes,"The executors legal duty is to execute the testator’s intent as detailed in their will. While I have no doubt that you understand the testators verbal wishes as expressed to you on a particular day - how do you know they didn’t change their mind some time after that? As others have said, with the beneficiaries’ agreement you can override the express written wishes but if one or more don’t agree, you will have to follow the will. To do otherwise exposes you to personal liability if a disgruntled beneficiary sues. The will is your shield, you step out from behind it at your peril. Now, the beneficiaries may be perfectly happy with the verbal intent now but … when there is money on the table, they may see it differently. Do yourself a favour, have the difficult conversation and get the will changed or refuse to be the executor."
"Were USA states really this disconnected in 1964, and was bigamy really punished by death?","I'm thirding the ""very plausible"" on the disconnect. Something to keep in mind is that the US is big.  Really big. It's one of the top things people who aren't familiar with the US just don't grasp.  The time to drive from Los Angeles, California to New York City, New York is only about 25 minutes less than the drive from Lisbon, Portugal to Moscow.  The time it takes you to drive through multiple countries in Europe won't even get you out of some of our states. You could dedicate an entire day to your cross country trip just getting between El Paso, Texas and Houston, Texas. While there are a few small states, the end result is that most states are disconnected, in the sense that you mean, just by virtue of distance alone.  The reasons mentioned in the other answers--fiercely independent states with all of these records administered locally, and lack of substantive computer database technology for several more decades--reinforces this.  But physical disconnection is itself a powerful force here, and has long contributed to significant differences in culture and law between states.  Not quite the cultural and legal disparity between, say, Spain and Russia, but enough to be noticeable. For example, Ted Bundy went on a seven state killing spree in the mid 1970's, racking up 20 confirmed and 30 confessed murders, assisted by his knowledge that states rarely ever communicated information about murders and missing persons to each other.  When he was at last arrested for good in Florida, it took a lot of time for authorities to even know who they had on their hands and the severity of his crimes, due to this lack of sharing (and his using a false name; which they figured out was false fairly quickly, but that still didn't tell them his real name). These killings helped to spur states to create better information sharing agreements and cooperation with Federal authorities, but point being: even murder wasn't something states felt was worth keeping other states informed of as late as the 70's."
"What is the purpose of being tried by a ""jury of your peers""?","The U.S. Supreme Court has explained in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 156 (1968): Those who wrote our constitutions knew from history
and experience that it was necessary to protect against
unfounded criminal charges brought to eliminate enemies
and against judges too responsive to the voice of higher
authority. ... Providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant,
biased, or eccentric judge. If the defendant preferred
the common-sense judgment of a jury to the more
tutored but perhaps less sympathetic reaction of the
single judge, he was to have it. This mode of trial ""had been in existence in England for several centuries"" (Duncan v. Louisiana, 145). It was expressed in the Declaration and Bill of Rights of 1689. And Blackstone wrote in his 1765–69 Commentaries (Duncan v. Louisiana, 151): Our law has therefore wisely placed this strong and
two-fold barrier, of a presentment and a trial by
jury, between the liberties of the people and the
prerogative of the crown. It was necessary, for preserving the admirable balance of our constitution,
to vest the executive power of the laws in the
prince: and yet this power might be dangerous and
destructive to that very constitution, if exerted
without check or control, by justices of oyer and
terminer occasionally named by the crown;  who
might then, as in France or Turkey, imprison, dispatch, or exile any man that was obnoxious to the
government, by an instant declaration that such is
their will and pleasure. But the founders of the
English law have, with excellent forecast, contrived
that . . . the truth of every accusation, whether
preferred in the shape of indictment, information, or
appeal, should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his equals and neighbours,
indifferently chosen and superior to all suspicion. Blackstone's Commentaries were well known to the U.S. founders. The Declaration of Independence itself highlights the greivance that the founders had with trial by potentially biased judges: He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. And if there is any doubt that this reasoning was on the mind at the founding, the First Continental Congress in 1774 expressly objected to trials being conducted by judges dependent on the Crown for their salary and resolved that the colonies are entitled to: the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage, according to the course of that law. canada Another answer suggests that this choice is purely a historical accident and that any intentionality behind the decision to enshrine a right to a jury has been left in the past. However, for a comparative perspective, Canada provides an example of a relatively recent deliberate decision to constitutionalize the right to a jury in 1982. In the initial draft of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the right to a jury was omitted. This attracted considerable debate, and Section 11 was amended to include the right to a jury for serious offences. One member even quoted from Blackstone's Commentaries (Charter Debates, January 28, 1981): ""The trial by jury, or the country, per patriam, is also that trial by the peers of every Englishman, which, as the grand bulwark of his liberties, is secured to him by the great charter."" The member goes on to argue that ""the jury is the citizen's ultimate protection against oppressive laws and oppressive enforcement of the law,"" quoting from Sir Patrick Devlin (Charter Debates, January 28, 1981, 47:57), Every jury is a little parliament. The jury sense is the parliamentary sense. I cannot see the one dying and the other surviving. The first object of any tyrant in Whitehall would be to make Parliament truly subservient to his will and the next to overthrow and diminish trial by jury, for no tyrant can afford to leave the subject's freedom in the hands of 12 of his countrymen; so that trial by jury is more than an instrument of justice and more than one wheel of the constitution. It is the lamp that shows that freedom lives. This is not reasoning from centuries past; it is reasoning from 1981."
Is it against the law to deny service based on (young) age?,"I’ve managed to answer my own question. Age discrimination legislation only applies to over 18s: It’s only discrimination if a trader or service provider treats you

"Is it legal for a store to accept payment by debit card but not be able to refund to it, even in event of staff's mistake?","Could the store give the customer credit or must they actual return the money? The store has the legal obligation to return the money if the customer demands to be reimbursed. Section 155(4)(a) of the BC Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act explicitly provides reimbursement ""to a consumer or class of consumers"". The store's unilateral, inflexible decision to give the customer credit in lieu of a reimbursement is in violation of sections 8(3)(a) and 9(1) of the Act. That approach constitutes undue pressure to enter into an additional consumer transaction, more so where management is aware of the issue and refuses to fix it."
First amendment and employment: Can a police department terminate an officer for speech?,"In general, employers in the United States are free to fire you for your speech. The First Amendment does not apply to anyone except the government (other than a narrow set of circumstances where private parties act on behalf of the government or take on government roles, like when private universities employ campus police). If the officer was being fired from a job at a private company, this would not be an interesting question -- the answer would clearly be ""no, there is no First Amendment claim here."" That’s not to say labor laws might not come into play (for instance, federal law prohibits firing an employee for organizing a union, and some states prohibit firing for off-duty political speech); however, labor law protections exist by statute and are not derived from the First Amendment. What makes this interesting is that the government is involved. Unlike private employers, government agencies are bound by the First Amendment. In Pickering v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court held that this does restrict them in their role as employer and that they can't necessarily fire an employee for speech. Pickering imposes a balancing test, where the harm to the employee's First Amendment rights is weighed against the government's interest in efficient operation. Courts have given particular leeway to police departments punishing speech that would undermine public trust and confidence in the department. A police officer expressing racist views, even privately, can seriously hamper the effectiveness of the department if the speech gets linked back to them. For instance, see Pappas v. Giuliani, where the Second Circuit upheld the firing of an NYPD officer for anonymously mailing racist diatribes from home in his off-duty time. Another answer suggests that the main question is a public safety one: whether the officer could be trusted to carry out his duties without bias. But that's not the only legitimate consideration for the government employer. The courts have repeatedly held that public perception of an agency is a legitimate concern, especially when it comes to agencies (like the police) whose job requires maintaining good relations with the community. In Pappas, the officer was assigned as a computer operator who had no contact with the public, but he was still a police officer whose speech had a high potential to undermine NYPD community relations."
Is it illegal to kill honeybees in Oregon or in the USA?,"I believe you are correct. It doesn't seem illegal for a private individual to use a bee pesticide (following label instructions) to remove a beehive from property that you own. There are federal laws regarding the commercial use of pesticides which are regulated under the EPA (not the FDA). People are encouraged to report bees being killed to the EPA from commercial operations. However, if you do have a problem with a honey bee nest on your property I would highly recommend that you contact the local beekeepers association first. Usually they can have somebody out the same day to remove and relocate the nest. Removing and relocating bees is actually not that hard (for a trained individual). Honey bees don't pose a risk unless somebody is allergic, and they are not aggressive.  My neighbor usually has four or five hives on his property, and we see the bees all the time. My kids enjoy watching them climb into flowers or buzz around the garden. They really are a natural resource that should at least be attempted to be preserved if at all possible."
Is it really legal to knowingly lie in public as a public figure?,"In the United States, there's no general law against lying.  The fact that a statement is false doesn't inherently strip it of protection under the first amendment.  Public figures lie to the public all the time.  That's why news companies have fact checkers. It is, however, illegal to defame someone.  If someone makes a false statement of fact (that is, not an opinion) about a person or company, they may be liable for that.  Whether they are liable for that depends on a number of factors, including whether the target is a public figure (see New York Times Co. v. Sullivan), the speaker's knowledge of its falsity, and whether the target was damaged by it. False statements to the public could be part of some sort of fraud, for instance. Pump and dump schemes, for instance, are illegal. Lying under oath (such as when testifying in court) would constitute perjury, which is a crime. There are many other situations in which lying could be a crime (such as lying on your taxes), but these are the main ones I can think of that would be about lying to the public. In this case (I'm unfamiliar with the details of what he said, so I'm just going off your description), I can't immediately think of any reason that could lead to liability.  Mocking and calling something a ""nothing burger"" is pretty clearly an opinion, not a false statement of fact.  I'm not aware of any securities law against saying you don't like something you're actually invested in (though I'm not especially familiar with securities law)."
Is it against the constitution to require restaurants to only serve people with a vaccine certificate in the United States?,"Under the US Constitution, a public health authority could even make vaccination mandatory, and this was done in some historical epidemics. In Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905) the US Supreme court held such mandatory vaccinations to be constitutional. The court wrote: The liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States does not import an absolute right in each person to be at all times, and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint, nor is it an element in such liberty that one person, or a minority of persons residing in any community and enjoying the benefits of its local government, should have power to dominate the majority when supported in their action by the authority of the State. It is within the police power of a State to enact a compulsory vaccination law, and it is for the legislature, and not for the courts, to determine in the first instance whether vaccination is or is not the best mode for the prevention of smallpox and the protection of the public health. The highest court of Massachusetts not having held that the compulsory vaccination law of that State establishes the absolute rule that an adult must be vaccinated even if he is not a fit subject at the time or that vaccination would seriously injure his health or cause his death, this court holds that, as to an adult residing in the community, and a fit subject of vaccination, the statute is not invalid as in derogation of any of the rights of such person under the Fourteenth Amendment. ... persons and property are subjected to all kinds of restraints and burdens, in order to secure the general comfort, health, and prosperity of the State, of the perfect right of the legislature to do which no question ever was, or upon acknowledged general principles ever can be, made so far as natural persons are concerned.
Railroad Co. v. Husen, 95 U. S. 465, 95 U. S. 471;
In Crowley v. Christensen, 137 U. S. 86, 137 U. S. 89, we said:
The possession and enjoyment of all rights are subject to such reasonable conditions as may be deemed by the governing authority of the country essential to the safety, health, peace, good order and morals of the community. Even liberty itself, the greatest of all rights, is not unrestricted license to act according to one's own will. It is only freedom from restraint under conditions essential to the equal enjoyment of the same right by others. It is then liberty regulated by law. ... Whatever may be thought of the expediency of this statute, it cannot be affirmed to be, beyond question, in palpable conflict with the Constitution. Nor, in view of the methods employed to stamp out the disease of smallpox, can anyone confidently assert that the means prescribed by the State to that end has no real or substantial relation to the protection of the public health and the public safety. The above decision was over a vaccination law during a smallpox epidemic, and the background is described in this ""History Stories"" article and in the Wikipedia article about the case Governments have the authority, in general, to pass laws (or impose regulations) that serve ""compelling governmental interests"" and are of general applicability. Such laws are valid even over most constitutional claims, depending on the claim and the detailed facts. Protecting the public health is a compelling governmental interest. Such laws might have to (and normally do) provide exceptions for people with medical reasons why they cannot safely be vaccinated, or with sincere religious objections to vaccination. In such cases alternate measures of protection, such as frequent testing for infection, might be required. Note that existing public health laws generally require wearing shoes and shirts in restaurants, and require restaurants to refuse service to those who do not comply. In Compagnie Francaise de Navigation a Vapeur v. Louisiana Board of Health, 186 U.S. 380 (1902) the US Supreme Court upheld as constitutional an involuntary quarantine law. in Zucht v. King, 260 U.S. 174 (1922) the US Supreme Court upheld as constitutional a public school district's exclusion of unvaccinated students."
Judge Judy specific retaliation: technically ethical?,"If this case was decided before a real judge, rather than Judge Judy, the impertinent party could be held in direct contempt of court (imposed summarily and punishable by penalties similar to a misdemeanor crime), after being given a moment to make a mitigating statement, but should not have have had the case summarily decided by the judge merely on that basis. A judgment imposed on that basis without further findings of fact would ordinarily be reversed on appeal (unless the appeal was from a court not of record, in which case a new trial is held in a new court following every appeal in any case). But, a contempt of court award in that situation would be reviewed for abuse of discretion and it would be a close call as to whether a contempt of court finding would be upheld for that conduct which is close to an abuse of discretion at a minimum. It would depend to some extent on the sanction imposed and a $5000 fine would probably be considered excessive in that context. Usually, however, arbitrators do not have contempt of court powers the way that almost all ordinary judges in the U.S. do. On the other hand, while there are isolated reasons for invalidating an arbitration award, it would be an uphill battle to get an arbitration award overturned on this basis, although not impossible. An arbitration award must usually involve some good faith effort by the arbitrator to resolve the case on the merits even if particular mistakes of law or fact are not reviewable. Indeed, the most common reason that arbitration awards are reversed is the refusal of the arbitrator to consider all relevant evidence. The prevailing party could argue that this was a de facto sanction award rather than a true resolution on the merits and might very well win, but it wouldn't be an ironclad class. Whether it is ethical is another matter that has two answers. At the level of did a judge give someone something that they didn't deserve, the ethical answer may very well be no. But, at the level of formal sanctionable judicial ethics, this would probably violate the duty of a judge to show judicial decorum and respect the process, although it would probably be a very minor offense resulting at most in a public reprimand."
Other use of profile photos: legality fair-use and permissions,"It is one thing to upload the phonebook and associated pictures for use of the owner of the phonebook. It isn't a fair use of the phonebook pictures - and you might not have a license anyway, as some people associate photos with numbers that they don't have a license to associate with anyway. But what if instead of a photo of the person, the first photo someone associated with the person is a photo of something like... crack cocaine, a photo of someone in a very compromising situation, just genitals, or some other thing that is just as tasteless or possibly criminal to share? In that case, your company is possibly committing defamation, and in case sharing or possessing of the image itself is illegal, your company is now the actor and liable. Depending on the content of the picture, distribution of pornographic material (possibly even underage material of that sort) could be up that alley just as much as hate speech through symbols, usage of banned symbols (such as swastikas in Gernamy) and many many others."
Is religious confession legally privileged?,"germany §53 StPO (1) 1. allows clerics to refuse to testify about things they were told during spiritual care. This does not require the setting to be exactly the Catholic sacrament of confession: it would be enough if a troubled person seeks the cleric to talk to because the cleric is a cleric. Sections 2. to 5. list other groups with or without restrictions. Lawyers, notaries, tax advisors, physicians, pharmacists, midwives, drug abuse counselors and similar people, members of parliament, and journalists can refuse to testify about some or all they learned in the course of their protected profession. For many of them, including physicians, the subject can waive the right to secrecy, then they cannot avoid testimony any more. The same applies to professional assistants of these people, e.g. the sexton who allows someone in or the clerk who makes an appointment."
"If an employer owns any work you produce whilst employed, do you have to be un-employed before you can begin a startup?","Your employer does not own your ideas. However, neither do you. Ideas are not something that is protected by intellectual property law. To be IP, you need more than an idea. The most common types are: The normal operation of IP law is that if a person is engaged under a contract of service (e.g. an employment contract) then their employer owns all the IP they make which includes progress towards something that might be IP (e.g. all the work that leads up to a patentable invention). However, if they are engaged under a contract for service (e.g. an independent contractor), then the worker owns the IP. The work the employer owns is generally limited to work in the course of the employment. So if you are a software developer they will generally own all code you write that is useful for their business but won't own the romantic novel you write in your spare time. In either case, the specific contract can override the default assumption. You can certainly use the idea for the app but you can't use anything that is subject to your employer's IP. That means you can't use any code or copy the user interface - it all has to be redeveloped from scratch. You also can’t develop something that would be of use to their business while you are still an employee."
Prove my work is not a trade secret violation,"Prove my work is not a trade secret violation Please don't. It's not your job to prove your innocence. The burden is on them to be specific, explain fully, and prove specific claims about your actions. In other words, don't justify, don't explain, and don't defend yourself to them.  It's actually best you do not say anything to them, and just forward the letter to your legal counsel (Since you're selling software to be used in the medical field, I assume you already have some kind of legal counsel).  For instance, even saying something as innocuous as ""Managing patients, Exams, Bills etc are all public knowledge."" could be used against you. Because it establishes the fact that you've been working on those features with them and that you've been working on those features with your new company (which doesn't necessarily follow, for all they know, you could have purchased a library module from someone else with those exact features).  In other words, even if you were to reply with such an innocuous-sounding statement, you could be saving them months of cross-border discovery and litigation about some of their claims (even if you believed you were being entirely reasonable by defending yourself). But at the same time, don't take what I'm saying to mean that you should lie to them about which features you recently worked on.  When I say that you shouldn't be talking to them. I mean that you should not be talking to them. You shouldn't be engaging with them and you shouldn't be giving them any shred of information whatsoever (implied or otherwise). It's not your job to make their job any easier. Do not reply to them. Don't even acknowledge the receipt of the letter (unless you already did by signing for it, which can't be helped).  Use a legal intermediary. Give the letter to your own legal counsel (whether you signed for the letter, or not) and leave any reply to him or her (assuming he/she thinks this warning letter even warrants a response). And if this former employer gives you a phone call, kindly refer them to your legal counsel without saying another word. "
How can saying a song's name be a copyright violation?,"Such an event would qualify as a transformative work, in which the original art is changed in some way from the more famous version.  It's determined on a whole host of factors, including the possibility for monetary damages, but you are allowed to, under certain conditions, profit off of derivative works.  The question about monetary damages normally hinges on whether people are buy your work, believing that it is the plaintiff's, and that is costing the plantiff money. One notable example is ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, who's music is generally humorous parodies of popular songs.   While there is no legal obligation for him to do such, Weird Al famously gets permission from the original artist of the song because he is a stand up guy and is only doing the parody out of respect, and wants the artist to be in on the joke (Some more famous incidents including Michael Jackson denying his parody of ""Black and White"" despite giving approval to parodies of ""Bad"" and ""Beat it"", a rift between Al and Coolio after the former only got permission to Parody ""Gangsta's Paradise"" from the record company, not Coolio himself (who initially would have said no, but has since admitted he was impressed by Al's rapping), and Lady GaGa, a huge fan of Al, being absolutely mortified that the record company did say No to Al's request to Parody ""Born this Way"" without talking to her about it and called up Al to set the record straight).  Al's just a nice guy, but he doesn't need to do this. The reason that they claim copyright concerns is two fold.  The ""I'd like to tell that... ...but I can't"" is creatively getting around that that they want you to be informed by what works to expect, without giving away specific songs that they want to do.  If they don't want to do the Qween song where they confess to their moms that they killed a guy and are contimplating suicide because everyone does it and it's long, they can still ""name"" the band without giving away that they will be singing about their attraction to women with posteriors so large, they cause a rocky planet to spin. It's also a humor in the vein of acknowledging that they are not the original song writers and most famous singers of the song (citing who is is a great way to get out of the money damage issues, because your making clear that you're not in any way, shape, or form, comparable to the most famous version of the song).  Simpsons did a famous gag where, in a parody of ""The Shining"" they refered to the powers as ""The Shinning"" after Bart almost name drops the original work, prompting Groundskeeper Willie to shut him up with a protest ""Ye want to get sued?!""   Of course, this had not been the first time The Simpsons parodied a Horror Genera work... in fact, its usually their first episode of the Season... but it was mocking the fact that it was a famous story and we all know it. And finally, someone singing a song they didn't write or originally perform.  And infact some of the most famous songs of all time were written by someone, performed by a different person, and finally famously performed by who we attribute the song to.  A great example of this is the sound ""Hound Dog"", which was written by a pair of song writers to be performed by an artist known as ""Big Mama' Bertha"".  It didn't get famous until, as the writers tell the story, it was performed by ""Some new guy named Elvis!""   Disney's musical division famously released two versions of ""Let It Go"" by two different artists at the same time, believing the film version wouldn't be as popular as the pop rendition by a more widely known artist but feeling it would get radio play. Megan Trainer wrote songs for other artists before she became known.  She was frustrated that her songs weren't getting picked up by famous recording artists and decided to just record them herself when they didn't sell. This is called a ""Cover"" and happens all the time.  The reason it is allowed is that music copyrights normally cover the unique vocals of someone singing and musical accompaniment.  Under U.S. Copyright laws, words and prhases cannot be copyrighted so there is no law to stop someone from speaking those words in an artisticly unique way, or using a tune with different words (fun fact, Hum the tune of ""My Country tis of Thee"" and then hum ""God Save the Queen"") or taking the words from one song and singing them to the tune of another (another fun trick:  Sing the first Pokemon Theme song to the tune of The Ballad of Gilligan's Isle).  Or to a bunch of different songs (there's a cool video on Youtube of two guys having a genre sing off:  They sing ""Shape of You"" in the styles of various genres and artists in full."
How to transport a knife that falls under the Weapons Act,"Obviously, there are plenty of kitchen knives over 12 cm in length. A knife that is legal for home use be carried outside the home in an enclosed compartment (verschlossenes Behältnis) which prevents immediate access. So it is forbidden to carry the knife thrust through a belt, or in a jacket pocket, but it can carried in a locked tool box or the like. A shrink-wrapped package also qualifies. To carry it ""unwrapped"" is forbidden, but there are exceptions to that ban which come down to ""reasonable use."" A bread knife would be reasonable if it comes with a loaf of bread and all the other implements for a picnic. It is not reasonable in a nightclub. A number of knife styles or cutting implements are generally forbidden, no matter how they are carried or stored."
"Is it legal to refuse an offer for real estate which is above the asking price, when there are no other offers by the published due date","Yes, this is legal, although further explanation is necessary to understand why and to know what facts would result in a different conclusion. A listing of a property with an offering price is an invitation to make an offer to purchase the property, rather than a true offer in a contract law sense. There is probably fine print at the website where the listing was provided that says so expressly, although this would be the default rule, even if it didn't. The offer is the full written proposed purchase and sale agreement which contains details beyond the price such as deadlines for closing, financing approval outs, inspection and title defect outs, details as to personal property inclusions, etc. Only when the full written purchase and sale agreement is signed by both parties or their authorized representatives is there ordinarily contract formation from offer and acceptance, although it is possible to imagine fact patterns that are exceptions to this general rule (e.g. auction sales, exchanges of detailed emails accepting without manual signatures, etc.). Normally, a purchase and sale contract will also include a tender of earnest money in an amount not specified in the listing, although this term is not legally required. As another answer notes, there is a risk of discrimination liability depending upon the reasons for not accepting the offer made (which is not insubstantial if the seller has any information about the people who are offering to buy the property). This would be largely eliminated, however, if the seller had decided not to sell the property below a given price before having learned anything about the offers that had been made for the property. But this kind of money damages liability, even if possible, would rarely create a specifically enforceable contract to sell the real property. There could conceivably be consumer protection act type liability, although having looked in the places where a statutory imposition of liability is most likely to be, it doesn't appear that this is illegal under those acts. Also, again, this kind of money damages liability, even if possible, would rarely create a specifically enforceable contract to sell the real property. The most obvious consumer protection type suit would be to sue for failure to sell something as advertised, which is normally a deceptive trade practice under the California Civil Code § 1770(a)(9). But, sales of residence are exempt from the deceptive trade practices provisions of the California Civil Code. California Civil Code § 1754. Likewise, this wouldn't be ""bait and switch"" advertising under California Business and Profession Code § 17500, et seq. and the related regulations (in the case of a ""used"" home where the decision is made by a non-dealer home seller), because the seller has no intent to sell substitute goods or services, at a higher price, to someone making an offer. The California Business and Profession Code general provision related to false advertising, unlike the deceptive trade practices provisions of the California Civil Code, does not exclude real estate in general from its scope, and other provisions of that Code actually expressly provides for false advertising liability related to real estate that concerns statements about the real property itself, rather than the price and terms upon which the seller is willing to sell the real property. It also wouldn't be common law fraud, because, as a matter of law, contrary to any logical arguments to the contrary, the price you are willing to sell something for is not a ""fact"" which is actionable for being falsely represented. A statement about a price you are willing to accept is never fraudulent as a matter of law (except when a statute provides otherwise). This exclusion exists to prevent fraud liability from arising out of ordinary price negotiations in commercial transactions."
Can a child be a contract killer?,"canada Child protective services would very likely intervene to place the child in circumstances where they can be better supervised for their own well-being and safety. See generally and for example: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/public-safety/protecting-children and the Child, Family and Community Service Act. Section 15(2) specifically states, ""If the child has killed, assaulted or endangered another person, the police officer must report the circumstances to a director, and, in any other case, may report the circumstances to a director."" After a report to the director, the director must investigate the child's need for protection and can make orders for a plan of care, issue supervision orders, remove the child, and ultimately place them in the custody of another person or in the care of the director."
"If a minor requested a doctor prescribe her birth control, can she demand the doctor not disclose her request to her parents?","united-statestexas In the US, it depends on the consent-to-treat laws of the state. In Washington, under RCW 9.02.100, everybody has a right to reproductive privacy (be it contraceptives or abortions). Under the federal HIPAA privacy rule, the minor requesting contraceptives would therefore be ""the individual"", which means that disclosure to others requires consent from the patient. Given the supremacy clause, that's all she wrote for Washington. The majority of states similarly allow 16 year olds to request contraceptives. Texas Family Code §32.003 spells out the conditions where a minor can consent to their own medical treatment, which does not include the situation you describe, therefore parental consent would be required (which clearly implies parental notification). Furthermore, that law also says (d)  A licensed physician, dentist, or psychologist may, with or
without the consent of a child who is a patient, advise the parents,
managing conservator, or guardian of the child of the treatment given
to or needed by the child. Therefore in Texas there is no prohibition against informing the parent(s). (Note that in the Texas Family Code, ""child"" is a synonym for ""minor"", so this also applies to teenagers, not just small children.) Carey v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U.S. 678 is an important ruling regarding the rights of minors to make their own decisions regarding contraception, but it does not go so far as to declare that minors have a constitutional right to give consent to the requisite medical examination."
Is attempted manslaughter a real crime?,"For example, s270AB of the south-australia Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 says: (1)         Where— (a)         a person attempts to kill another or is a party to an attempt to kill another; and (b)         he would, if the attempt had been successfully carried to completion, have been guilty of manslaughter rather than murder, he shall be guilty of attempted manslaughter. Relevantly in SA, voluntary manslaughter occurs when a victim dies as the result of an offence that would otherwise amount to murder, but the defendant’s liability is reduced because of the presence of mitigating circumstances, such as provocation. So, in circumstances of provocation (say) where the accused shoots at the victim but misses, attempted manslaughter is a possible charge. Most likely this would be charged as attempted murder but downgraded where the defence of provocation was made out."
"In the USA, can treason be protected by the First Amendment?","It might be more helpful to reverse the analogy. Unprotected speech is a box, and everything that doesn't fit inside the box is free speech. The box is small and strangely shaped, and therefore, very few things will fit inside. The government has spent centuries trying to cram things into it, so we have a pretty good idea of what fits and what doesn't: Content-based restrictions on speech have been permitted, as a general matter, only when confined to the few historic and traditional categories of expression long familiar to the bar. Among these categories are: advocacy intended, and likely, to incite imminent lawless action, see Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969); obscenity, see, e.g., Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973); defamation, see, e.g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964); Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323 (1974); speech integral to criminal conduct, see, e.g., Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U.S. 490 (1949); so-called “fighting words,” see Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942); child pornography, see New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982); fraud, see Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748 (1976); true threats, see Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705 (1969); and speech presenting some grave and imminent threat the government has the power to prevent, see Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U.S. 697 (1931), although a restriction under the last category is most difficult to sustain, see New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971). These categories have a historical foundation in the Court's free speech tradition. The vast realm of free speech and thought always protected in our tradition can still thrive, and even be furthered, by adherence to those categories and rules. United States v. Alvarez, 567 U.S. 709, 717–18 (2012). Although I don't know that I've ever seen the Supreme Court acknowledge it explicitly, one of the common threads you'll see in most of these categories is that First Amendment protection begins to weaken when words are spoken with some kind of ill intent and are likely to cause some kind of societal harm. So the Gillars case falls into the ""speech integral to criminal conduct"" category. She appealed her conviction on First Amendment grounds, but the D.C. Circuit affirmed. Although the First Amendment would protect someone who hated the American government and went on the radio to denounce the American government, it does not protect those who commit the act of treason, even if speech is their weapon: There is no question in our mind that words may be an integral part of the commission of the crime if the elements which constitute treason are present; that is, if there is adherence to and the giving of aid and comfort to the enemy by an overt act proved by two witnesses, with intention to betray, though the overt act be committed through speech. ... While the crime is not committed by mere expressions of opinion or criticism, words spoken as part of a program of propaganda warefare, in the course of employment by the enemy in its conduct of war against the United States, to which the accused owes allegiance, may be an integral part of the crime. There is evidence in this case of a course of conduct on behalf of the enemy in the prosecution of its war against the United States. The use of speech to this end, as the evidence permitted the jury to believe, made acts of words. The First Amendment does not protect one from accountability for words as such. Gillars v. United States, 182 F.2d 962, 971 (D.C. Cir. 1950). This is probably one of the least-developed exceptions to First Amendment protection, and therefore one of the hardest to understand. For a deep dive, I'd recommend Eugene Volokh, The ""Speech Integral to Criminal Conduct"" Exception, 101 Cornell L. Rev. 981 (2016)."
Do US presidential pardons include the cancellation of financial punishments?,"Presidential pardons only deal with breaches of Federal law. So, if the punishment is a fine then that penalty is waived. However, if the fine is punishment for breach of state law, the pardon does not touch it - he would need a pardon from the relevant state Governor(s). Anthony Levandowski is not being punished with a fine, he was punished with a jail term. What he owes Google is damages for breach of contract or a tort, both civil matters and almost certainly under California law, not a punishment for an offence. This is not something he can be pardoned for by a President (if under Federal law which is unlikely) or a Governor (if under state law). His actions constituted both an offence against the state, which can be pardoned, and caused damage to another person (Google) which can’t. He owes this money as a debt just as if he had bought something from them or borrowed money from them."
What might be illegal about a company using deceptive phone calls to establish a contract and seeking payments under it?,"Given that this is a UK based company, the most applicable Act would be the Unsolicited Goods and Services Act 1971 A person who, not having reasonable cause to believe there is a right
  to payment, in the course of any trade or business makes a demand for
  payment, or asserts a present or prospective right to payment, for
  what he knows are unsolicited goods sent (after the commencement of
  this Act) to another person with a view to his acquiring them [for the
  purposes of his trade or business], shall be guilty of an offence and
  on summary conviction shall be liable to a fine not exceeding level 4
  on the standard scale. This law specifically refers to  [unsolicited] charges for entries in directories. You also mentioned that they're misrepresenting that a company is already a customer and sending out invoices on that basis. That would be a breach of the Fraud Act 2006 A person is in breach of this section if he dishonestly makes a false
  representation As to their enforceability, that answer is no. If this came before an actual judge, the judge would throw it out in a heartbeat. No agreement was made to provide a service in return for a payment and these companies rely on sending threatening letters via (seeming) third-parties precisely because they wish to avoid that level of scrutiny."
Unscheduled exterminator attempted to enter my unit without notice or invitation,"Not even real roaches are an emergency. The event was foreseeable and scheduleable. According to the terms of your lease, you are entitled to a 2 day warning. From your description, the landlord did not violate the lease, but he came close to it, perhaps to the point that the courts would consider it as good as a breach. In Chicago, §5-12-050 of the municipal code mandates 2-day notice, and the following section says that If the landlord makes an unlawful entry or a lawful entry in an
unreasonable manner or makes repeated unreasonable demands for entry
otherwise lawful, but which have the effect of harassing the tenant,
the tenant may obtain injunctive relief to prevent the recurrence of
the conduct, or terminate the rental agreement pursuant to the notice
provisions of Section 5-12-110(a). In each case, the tenant may
recover an amount equal to not more than one month's rent or twice the
damage sustained by him, whichever is greater."
Can an AI own a company?,"Short Answer No. An AI cannot own a company. Artificial intelligences are not legal persons. The law recognizes human beings and legally recognized entities as persons. It does not recognize AIs or for that matter non-human species as persons except in a handful of jurisdictions that recognize, for example, some select rivers as legal persons (e.g. New Zealand). Approximate Alternatives Something close would be possible, however. It is possible to establish a non-profit corporation without owners, or to establish a non-profit entity that is not a corporation (often called a ""foundation"") that has no owners. These entities are required to have humans who serve on a board of directors. But, the nonprofit entity or foundation could have bylaws that delegate decision making responsibility on all or many matters to an AI, in much the way that decision making responsibility of all or many matters might be delegated to the CEO of a nonprofit corporation. While the AI can't own anything and indeed, to the contrary, would be owned by the entity, the AI's actions could cause the entity to earn income, to acquire and dispose of property, and to participate in lawsuits. And, while most non-profit entities and foundations are designed to have charitable purposes in order to garner tax benefits, there are many kinds of non-profits that exist for non-charitable purposes (e.g. country clubs, stock exchanges, HOAs and political organizations). If an AI was vested with management of most key parts of an entity's operations, that entity had no owners, and its board of directors was relatively docile, this would come reasonably close, in practice, to what an AI owned entity would look like. How The Law Could Be Changed Indeed, one plausible form of organization for the AI would be as a political organization which could be devoted to the purpose of reforming the law to give AIs personhood status. If one U.S. state did so, for example, this would allow all AIs to use that state's law to form entities owned by them, that could operate in any U.S. state, since geographic constraints do not really apply to AIs. And, it doesn't take that much money to lobby a single state to adopt a law if there is no obvious constituency to oppose the adoption of the law. Analogous Historical Precedents There are deep historical precedents for allowing people who were not legally allowed to own property to manage businesses. In the Roman Empire, the practice of having a slave operate a business or venture or transaction as an agent of the slave's owner was well recognized. This was also true, to a much narrower extent and much less frequently, under American chattel slavery. In the medieval and early modern era in Europe and in the post-colonial regimes in the Americas, it was not uncommon in jurisdictions that did nt otherwise recognize the right of a married woman to own property or to be recognized as a legal person in a court to be allowed to manage her husband's affairs on his behalf in his absence as his delegate agent to do so (often for long periods of time, for example, when the husband was away at war, and for entire fiefdoms for which the aristocratic husband was the lord). European law also recognized the concept that when a royal or noble title was inherited by an oldest son due to the death of his father, when the son was just a child, that the mother could serve a regent for the son and manage the affairs of the jurisdiction associated with the son's title, even though the mother was not legally permitted to hold that title in her own right."
Is there a law against signing a contract to do something illegal?,"it's not illegal to sign a contract that demands illegal things, however, such a contract, in general, is called an illegal contract. Contracts that violate public policy never have force in the first place. A contract can't force people to declare lies under oath or demand them to murder someone. Thus, a contract demanding such is illegal. As a result, such a clause would not just be unenforceable, it might void the entire contract wholesale if it is not severable. In the least, any clause demanding illegal acts was null and void ab initio, and never was valid. However, the contract can also be evidence of criminal activity in itself: It manifests the will of two parties to commit an illegal act. That is the core of a conspiracy charge. Conspiracy is illegal and usually a felony."
"In Europe, can I refuse to use Gsuite / Office365 at work?","You probably can't refuse to use such services. The relationship between you and these services is very different when you interact with them as a consumer, versus when these services are provided on behalf of your employer. In the latter case, the service is (or at least should be) bound as a data processor who can only* use your personal data as instructed by the data controller, your employer. Thus, it is your employer who determines for what purposes your data will be used, not the cloud service. Your employer has a legitimate interest in providing a modern and secure productivity suite to its employees, and in requiring you to use such services for efficient communication and collaboration. Of course it would be possible to provide some such services on-premises, but the GDPR doesn't really discriminate between self-hosted and third party services, as long as the third party service is contractually bound as a data processor. To a large degree, this is of course a legal fiction. The cloud services deploy new features all the time, and all that your employer can really do is agree to those changes, including agreeing to new ways for how to process your data. Also, the service provider may act both as a data processor on behalf of your employer for some purposes, but as their own data controller for others. E.g. in Google Workspace (formerly GSuite, formerly Google Apps for Business) Google collects analytics data about how you use their Docs product, and they use it for their own purposes. However, they would only process the document itself as a data processor. This is quite different in the consumer version where Google can use personal data for their own purposes, although within the limits of their privacy policy. Within your work account, you do have some privacy controls, similar to a consumer account. While your employer can set defaults and restrict features, you are not forced to share all data. E.g. in a Google Account, you can “pause” web and app activity (i.e. browsing history) that would otherwise be collected from Chrome browsers while logged in with your work account, or from Android devices that are managed by your employer. This data would potentially be used by Google for Ads, even with a Workspace account (I'm not sure). However, Google Workspace services generally do not feature ads themselves, e.g. the paid Gmail version does not feature ads. The largest real issue with the use of such services by an European employer is the international transfer of data to a non-EU jurisdiction, especially into the U.S. The GDPR offers many alternatives for how such transfers can be protected. In the past, the EU and US had used the Privacy Shield mechanism. However, it was found to be invalid in the 2020 Schrems II ruling, due to concerns about US mass surveillance. Subsequent guidance from supervisory authorities explained that it's not sufficient to use “standard contractual clauses” as an alternative protection, but that additional safeguards have to be implemented, which would effectively deny the personal data to actors in the US. Both Google and Microsoft offer some “data sovereignty” choices that prevent international transfers into the US. However, those have to be configured appropriately by your employer. Thus, instead of asking “can these services be used?” to which the answer is yes, it might be better to ask “is my employer using these services in a compliant manner?”. If you have concerns about such issues, you can contact your employer's data protection officer"
"Is urban exploration legal? Even if so, should I do it?","My general belief is that in the United States entering structures like the ones you've pictured would be considered trespassing regardless of if there is a sign in place or not. This is based on the fact that I'm almost certain that if you become injured while on the premises you could sue the land owner. I believe the trespassing signs are just there to give legal cover to the land owner in case someone does try to sue them. Here are two sources that essentially support my beliefs: General definition: Trespass is defined by the act of knowingly entering another person’s property without permission. More detailed legal definition: § 11.411 Criminal trespass. (a) A person commits an offense if, knowing that he or she is not licensed or privileged to do so, he or she enters or surreptitiously remains in any building or occupied structure. An offense under this subsection is a misdemeanor if it is committed in a dwelling at night. Otherwise it is a petty misdemeanor. As you can see these buildings are clearly owned by someone, and you clearly haven't gotten permission to enter the building. Ergo, you're trespassing. Now if you were talking about ancient Mayan ruins, or an Old West ghost town then this would be more of a gray area, I believe, since those structures have been abandoned for 150+ years. The same goes for structures in National Parks, since a National Park is public land you could make a case that you thought you were allowed to go since you weren't specifically told you can't go (assuming you didn't cross a fence line/no trespassing sign). You should definitely contact a real lawyer though. Now if you do enter then I think the probability that you will be caught and prosecuted would be fairly low. It is your decision if that risk is worth the reward of entering/exploring the structure."
"What remedies can a witness use to satisfy the ""all the truth"" portion of their oath?","""The whole truth"" is part of a formulaic phrase which has been operationalized to mean merely ""don't commit perjury."" A witness simply answers the questions asked and is not permitted to go further. The witness is at the mercy of the lawyer's whims. The witness does not have a right to testify beyond the scope of the question asked. It is improper for a lawyer to cut off a witness when in the middle of providing an answer to the question asked, but those points are for the other side's lawyer and the judge to raise, not the witness. If the answer of a witness to the question asked on cross-examination leaves a false impression, it is up to the other side's lawyer to correct that by asking additional redirect examination questions of the witness in our adversary system. Asking questions that when answered truthfully leave a false impression because the answer presents an incomplete version of the whole story is standard practice in lawyering. This tactic is less effective, however, in jurisdictions like Colorado where judges and juries can also ask their own questions of witnesses once the lawyers are finished asking their questions."
Is there any law that states how far you can dig underground in the United States?,"There is no law on how deep you can dig expressed in those terms. There are rather rigorously enforced regulations of worker safety in mining activities enforced by the Mining Health and Safety Administration (MHSA) which is the mining industry counterpart of OSHA (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration) but with far more resources and a far more aggressive institutional culture. When mining on land for which the mineral rights are owned by the U.S. government (which probably accounts for a majority of land in the American West), mineral leases may limit the purposes for which mining is authorized, which in turn limits the depth to which it mining is authorized and sensible. Similarly, a mine may not impair legally established ground water rights which could exist when someone else owns an underground aquifer. There are two main legal rules in the U.S. regarding the relationship  between surface rights holders and mineral rights owners. In some states, like Wyoming, the land must be restored after mining is over, but there is no duty for the mineral owner to protect or support the surface estate and strip mining is permitted. In other states, like Colorado, the mineral owner must minimize the intrusion on, and structurally support the surface estate (basically by mining in well supported underground tunnels), which requires more expensive mining methods that aren't viable for low value per mass mineral resources like gravel and coal. For the most part, the practical limits flow from mining technology and from a lack of economic incentives to do so. As you get deeper, the temperatures go up and the pressure on the rock you are mining into gets stronger, which makes it harder to mine. Also, beyond a certain depth, your mining equipment must be custom made from expensive materials, since commercial off the shelf mining equipment isn't designed for those conditions. This becomes economically prohibitive if there is no proven deposit of extractible minerals to take at the greater depth that can't be obtained more cheaply from a more easily accessible deposit. Further, the law imposes strict liability for damages caused to others by firms engaged in ultra-hazardous activities, which digging an ultra-deep hole in the ground would be. The deepest mine in the world that is current operating is the Mponeng Gold Mine in South Africa, with a depth that ranges from 3.16km to 3.84km, while the future mining is expected to further deepen the shaft bottom to 4.22km below the surface. The deepest manmade hole in the ground in the world prior to 2008 was the Kola Superdeep Borehole in Russia, which reached 12.262km in 1989, which was the deepest artificial point on Earth in the time and was drilled simply for the purpose of penetrating as deeply into the Earth's crust as possible. It was surpassed in length, but not depth, in 2008 by the 12.289km deep Al Shaheen oil well in Qatar, but that well isn't straight down, so it isn't the deepest penetration in the Earth. As a point of reference, the Earth's crust ranges from 5–70 kilometres in depth and is the outermost layer of the Earth. The thin parts are the oceanic crust, which underlie the ocean basins (5–10 km) and are composed of dense (mafic) iron magnesium silicate igneous rocks, like basalt. The thicker crust is continental crust, which is less dense and composed of (felsic) sodium potassium aluminium silicate rocks, like granite. Below the Earth's crust is its mantle which extends to a depth of 2,890 km. The pressure at the bottom of the mantle is ≈140 GPa. "
London council not responding to calls for nuisance,"You can take action against the shop directly under the tort of nuisance. The available remedies are damages to compensate for interference with your property rights, and injunction to require the defendant to cease the activity which is causing the nuisance. You could also bring a judicial review action against the council if they refuse to investigate the noise. In England, Wales, and Scotland this would be based on Section 79(1)(g) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 which defines ""noise emitted from premises so as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance"" to be a ""statutory nuisance"". Section 79 places an obligation on a local authority to ""take such steps as are reasonably practicable to investigate"" a complaint made by a person living within its area. Section 80(1) requires that ""where a local authority is satisfied that a statutory nuisance exists [it] shall service [an abatement notice]"". Section section 80(4) provides that it is an offence to contravene an abatement notice. Torts and judicial review are complex areas of law and you should seek legal advice if you intend to pursue either of these routes. The limitation period for judicial review is relatively short (3 months per CPR 54.5(1)), so if you are seeking legal advice, you should do so quickly if you have already approached the council."

If the dollars are big enough this gets enforced, Ex-Tyco Chief Is Indicted In Tax Case
By Alex Berenson and Carol Vogel
June 5, 2002
L. Dennis Kozlowski, former chairman and chief executive of Tyco International, was indicted yesterday by a grand jury in Manhattan on charges of evading more than $1 million of sales taxes on six paintings that he bought last fall.
Mr. Kozlowski bought the paintings, which included a Renoir and a Monet, for $13.1 million for his 13-room apartment at 950 Fifth Avenue. To avoid paying New York sales taxes, prosecutors said, he shipped empty crates to Tyco's headquarters in Exeter, N.H., and transported paintings back and forth from New Hampshire to Manhattan. He went to jail."
Could a US state allow non-citizens to vote in presidential elections?,"Yes, states could allow aliens to vote for President. As ohwilleke says, the Constitution gives the states control over who can vote. In fact, for much of our history, many states allowed aliens to vote. To the extent that 18 U.S.C. § 611, which forbids aliens from voting for President, contradicts that power, it is unconstitutional. If 18 U.S.C. § 611 is so obviously unconstitutional, why is it still on the books? Mostly because 18 U.S.C. § 611 is purely symbolic. It literally has had no effect on who can vote in the US. As noted above, throughout the 19th and early 20th century, many states allowed aliens to vote. But with the turn against immigration in the early 20th century, states that had allowed aliens to vote explicitly revoked that privilege. The last state to prohibit aliens from voting was Arkansas, in 1926. Thus, for almost a century, every state has prohibited aliens from voting in state elections, so no voter was affected by the passage of 18 U.S.C. § 611. (For a survey of the history of alien suffrage, see here.) Voting is a state matter: It is widely agreed that the Qualifications Clause, Art I, § 2.1 of the Constitution gives states control over who votes in federal elections, (subject, of course, to other constitutional requirements, such the 15th, 19th and 26th Amendments). The clause says the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature. In other words, anyone who is qualified to vote for the largest branch of the state legislature is qualified to vote for President. (The original text only talked about elections to the House because Senators were chosen by state legislatures, not voters. When this was changed by 17th Amendment, that Amendment repeated this qualification for voters.)(For more extended, but reader friendly, discussion of these issues see here. People sometimes point to the ""Elections Clause,"" Art. I, § 4.1, as giving Congress power over voter qualifications. That clause gives Congress the power to regulate the ""Times, Places and Manners of holding elections."" They read, ""Manners of holding elections” to include the qualifications for voting. This reading of the Elections Clause is inconsistent with several of the sources of constitutional authority Americans typically consult, including the text, the intent of the Founder and precedent. All of these support the “Qualifications Clause” reading of the Constitution. 1) Constitutional Text: Reading the Elections Clause as giving Congress control over voter qualifications, renders the Qualifications Clause almost completely meaningless. Yet everyone agrees the Constitution should be read so that all its parts mean something – no part should be rendered superfluous. 2) Intent of the Founders: When the Founders debated voting qualifications, they were clearly worried that politicians would manipulate the electoral rules to favor them. The Founders believed the Qualifications Clause kept both national and state politicians from stacking the electoral deck. First, by giving the power of deciding who could vote to the states, the Clause prevented national politicians from choosing their own electorate. Secondly, by requiring the states to use the same qualifications for voters in state and national elections, the Clause prevented state politicians from manipulating the rules in national elections. As for the Electoral Clause, in Federalist 60, Hamilton was clear who controlled voter qualifications: “The qualifications of the persons who may choose or be chosen…are unalterable by the [federal] legislature…” 3) Precedent and practice: For most of our history, people acted consistently with Hamilton’s statement. They tolerated a wide variation in who was allowed to vote across states. As noted above, many of those states specifically allowed aliens to vote. (And, starting in 1787 with the passage of the Northwest Ordinance, Congress passed a series of laws allowing aliens to vote in territories.) When Americans did make nationwide changes to voting qualifications, they did so by amending the Constitution, as when they prohibited discrimination in voting by race, sex or age. There are only a handful of Supreme Court decisions involving federal control over voting qualifications. In 1970, in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law changing the voting age to 18. The opinion of the Court, written by Justice Black, relied on the Elections Clause to say that Congress had the power to change voting requirements. None of the other Justices shared Black's views on the Elections Clause. Instead, they agreed with Justice Harlan, who said, “nothing” in the Constitution, “lends itself to the view that voting qualifications in federal elections are to be set by Congress.” (These Justices used the Equal Protection Clause as the basis for federal control over voter qualifications.) Since then, no Justice has followed Justice Black. Instead, they have followed Justice Harlan. For example, in 2013, in Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council Justice Scalia, (in an opinion joined by Breyer, Ginsburg, Kagan, Kennedy, Roberts, and Sotomayor) said, “the Elections Clause empowers Congress to regulate how federal elections are held, but not who may vote in them.” From this evidence, I’d say you were right to be puzzled about the constitutional authority for the IIRIRA. A federal law preventing aliens from voting in federal elections undermines the text of the constitution by rendering the Qualifications Clause superfluous, goes against the clear intent of the Founders, and is inconsistent with 200+ years of history and precedent. It only survives because it has no practical effect on voting in the US. Since this situation seems unlikely to change soon, it seems likely the statute will remain on the books to confuse Americans for the foreseeable future. Edited to add: Could states count alien votes under the IIRIRA? No: Under the IIRIRA, there can't be any alien votes to count! § 611(a)(3) of the IIRIRA says aliens can only vote in an election if they do not have ""an opportunity to vote for a candidate for any one or more of such Federal offices."" You ask whether ""non-vote"" methods of measuring alien's opinions, such as surveys, are legal under the IIRIRA. These clearly violate the purpose of the IIRIRA, which is to prevent aliens' opinions from influencing the outcome of federal elections. But it's not clear they violate the IIRIRA as written. They only violate the IIRIRA if you are willing to apply the ""familiar rule"" that a thing may be within the letter of the statute and yet not within the statute, because not within its spirit nor within the intention of its makers. But in real life, these questions are irrelevant. As a practical matter, they would never come up. If a state really wanted to allow aliens to vote, it would challenge the constitutionality of the IIRIRA. That no state has done this means no state politicians want to be seen advocating for alien voting. The IIRIRA is like the proverbial law ""requiring you to breathe:"" You follow it, not b/c it's the law, but because that's what you were going to do anyway."
Can a racist business owner legally get away with saying he only wants to hire people that 'look white'?,"No. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits an employer from discriminating on the basis of  race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. It is therefore generally forbidden for an employer to refuse to hire someone because they are not white/black/etc. or because they do not look white/black/etc. The law permits exceptions when the employee's religion, sex, or national origin is a bona fide occupational qualifiction, but not when the employee's race or color is a bona fide occupational qualification. The answer to your previous question was wrong because it adopts an ""is black vs. looks black"" distinction that doesn't really work. Discriminating against someone because they ""look black"" is the same thing as discriminating on the basis of color. Even if you were saying someone ""looked black"" because of their hair or facial structure or clothing, you're talking about ""perceived as"" discrimination, which many courts treat as equally impermissible. See, e.g., Perkins v. Lake Cty., 860 F. Supp. 1262, 1278 (N.D. Ohio 1994) (“Objective appearance and employer perception are the basis for discrimination and, in the opinion of this Court, the key factors relevant to enforcing rights granted members of a protected class.”). As far as I know, the question of whether one may discriminate on the basis of race or color in casting decisions is still unresolved, but the courts that have looked at it seem to so far be in agreement that casting directors may make engage in that kind of discrimination because their constitutional rights to create their art as they see fit under the First Amendment overrides their statutory obligation to provide equal employment opportunities under the Civil Rights Act. For example, the issue arose when a black man brought civil-rights claims against ABC for excluding him from auditions for The Bachelor. ABC argued that its casting decisions are an essential component of its expression, and the court agreed: Ultimately, whatever messages The Bachelor and The Bachelorette communicate or are intended to communicate — whether explicitly, implicitly, intentionally, or otherwise — the First Amendment protects the right of the producers of these Shows to craft and control those messages, based on whatever considerations the producers wish to take into account. ... Thus, whether enforcing § 1981 here would frustrate, enhance, or be entirely consistent with the message that The Bachelor and The Bachelorette conveys, the First Amendment protects the producers' right unilaterally to control their own creative content.

Why is it so hard to try Khalid Sheikh Muhammad?,"An answer by @user6726 accurately points out some matters specific to this case, a ""tree level"" view, so to speak. At a ""forest level"", the military commissions system that was first used had to be established from scratch leaving myriad issues of first impression and constitutional validity issues unresolved, unlike ordinary civil courts where these matters are already settled law. Many of these issues were difficult ones because the system was intentionally stacked against the defendants. This was an unexpected result from the perspective of the people who enacted the statutes authorizing military commissions trials, who expected them to be more swift and to be less favorable forums for defendants. But they failed to recognize that all judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings conducted by the U.S. government, even military tribunals, are subject to judicial review under modern U.S. law. Failure to recognize this issue is one of the main reasons that the military commission system produced so few results, while terrorism prosecutions under criminal laws in the ordinary federal trial courts were conducted with minimal difficulty relative to ordinary criminal prosecutions. It also failed to recognize that unlike typical civilian criminal defendants, terrorism suspects are often happy to plea guilty and claim credit for actions that these defendants viewed as heroic and justified. A key substantive issue in this particular prosecution is that important evidence against him was either obtained through torture, or was ""fruit of the poisonous tree"" evidence obtainable only as a result of information obtained through torture, in a manner that would not be admissible in civilian criminal proceedings. Another key mixed procedural and substantive issue was a military commission policy that treated much of the relevant evidence as classified secrets for purposes of national security, which impacts which personnel could be involved and created procedural questions not presented in ordinary courts. The U.S. government could have declassified the relevant information, but chose as a matter of policy to conduct proceedings while the information was still kept as a national security secret (in part, because the U.S. involvement in torture and the low level authority of most of the other military commission defendants was embarrassing to the U.S. government)."
Is it legal for a company to require you to delete your account to unsubscribe from marketing emails?,"No, it's not legal. The General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) apply given that you are in the UK (regardless of where the Data Processor is based).  The UK GDPR is slightly modified due to Brexit, but the same principles apply. The only plausible legal basis for this action would be that you consent to it, and you're entitled to withdraw that consent at any time. Some may claim that Article 6.1(b) applies, i.e. that it's necessary to send marketing email in order to fulfil the contract, but GDPR is clear that bundling such consent into a contract for service simply to permit the data processor additional actions isn't allowed, as I'll demonstrate. UK GDPR requires that consent to use your personal information (in this case, your email address) for the stated purpose be freely given. Consent to use your information for direct marketing is not freely given if it's inseparable from the consent to use it for some other service, as per [recital 43]: Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case, or if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent despite such consent not being necessary for such performance. And Article 7.4 gives this legal effect: When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract. The intent of Article 6.1(b) is that only the processing required for the service you have bought is allowed (e.g. if you supply your address for delivery of stuff you've bought, the data processor can use that address to send you the stuff, but is not allowed to add a contract term that allows them to send you unwanted stuff). Examples of emails that Article 6.1(b) would allow (in my assessment) include things such as notification of upcoming downtime, or a reminder that subscriptions are due, but not unsolicited advertisements for other products.  There's a grey area that's open to interpretation, where adverts are piggybacked onto actual service messages."
What are the limits of religious freedom in the workplace?,"The EEOC web site has much information on this topic including summaries of close cases that have been decided in court. To determine whether allowing or continuing to permit an employee to pray, proselytize, or engage in other forms of religiously oriented expression in the workplace would pose an undue hardship, employers should consider the potential disruption, if any, that will be posed by permitting this expression of religious belief.[196] As explained below, relevant considerations may include the effect such expression has had, or can reasonably be expected to have, if permitted to continue, on co-workers, customers, or business operations. a. Effect on Workplace Rights of Co-Workers Expression can create undue hardship if it disrupts the work of other
  employees or constitutes – or threatens to constitute – unlawful
  harassment.  Since an employer has a duty under Title VII to protect
  employees from religious harassment, it would be an undue hardship to
  accommodate such expression.  As explained in § III-A-2-b of this
  document, religious expression directed toward co-workers might
  constitute harassment in some situations, for example where it is
  facially abusive (i.e., demeans people of other religions), or where,
  even if not abusive, it persists even though the co-workers to whom it
  is directed have made clear that it is unwelcome.  It is necessary to
  make a case-by-case determination regarding whether the effect on
  co-workers actually is an undue hardship.  However, this does not
  require waiting until the alleged harassment has become severe or
  pervasive.[197] As with harassment on any basis, it is permitted and
  advisable for employers to take action to stop alleged harassment
  before it becomes severe or pervasive, because while isolated
  incidents of harassment generally do not violate federal law, a

Can a US citizen be required to provide the authentication key for encrypted data on a confiscated computer?,"If law enforcement is actually requesting an encryption key, talk to a real lawyer. To answer your first question, the answer is ""the government probably can't demand the password, but might be able to demand the data."" Some courts have ruled that the Fifth Amendment can prevent courts from forcing someone to decrypt data for the government, because the act of decrypting the data conveys information (see United States v. Doe from the 11th Circuit). Other courts have ruled that there are situations where that is not the case (US v. Fricosu, In re Boucher). Boucher is particularly interesting because the government first asked for the password itself, and then (when that subpoena was quashed by the magistrate) narrowed its request to the decrypted data on appeal. In the magistrate's opinion, we see Also, the government
concedes that it cannot compel Boucher to disclose the
password to the grand jury because the disclosure would be
testimonial. It is not generically a violation of the Fifth Amendment to compel production of documents (the 11th Circuit, quoting the Supreme Court, considered this a ""settled proposition""). The issue is that the act of producing the documents can be considered testimony -- by producing the documents, the person is showing that they know the documents exist, where they are, how to read them, etc. Possession of the key to decrypt a file links you to that file, because keys are generally kept secret. In the 11th Circuit case, the court found that the government didn't know for a fact that a) Doe could decrypt the files, and b) what files existed on the encrypted drive. In the cases where forced decryption was allowed, the government had seen enough to independently show that the files existed, were authentic, and that the defendant had actual control/possession over them. The 11th Circuit asked for a bit more (the location), based on a standard that is in effect in some circuits but not others. In any event, courts seem to generally consider this to take a court order to force production of anything; the police can't just order you to do it."
Can U.S. states establish state religions?,"No. The Fourteenth Amendment says: nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; The Supreme Court has determined that this clause incorporates much of the Bill of Rights. The logic is mildly tortured, but it's basically that ""due process of law"" means ""due process of a law that is compatible with the fundamental rights of a free society."" This logic is known as ""substantive due process,"" because it reads in to ""due process of law"" requirements about what those laws can do (as opposed to procedural due process, which is about the actual procedures being used). It's pretty settled that the Bill of Rights, after the 14th Amendment, should apply to the states. There's another possible way to get there: the 14th Amendment says ""No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States,"" which Justice Thomas recently thought meant that the Second Amendment applies to the states in a concurring opinion. But as of now, substantive due process is the standard logic for it. Virtually all of the Bill of Rights is incorporated against the states. There are a couple things which aren't (like juries in lawsuits, and grand juries), but the Establisment Clause is incorporated (see Everson v. Board of Education, 330 US 1)."
Would a lifetime gym membership be subject to bankruptcy proceedings?,"Would the court be able to order the gym to transfer said membership
to a creditor? Or perhaps pay out a pro rate lump sum to the creditors
in exchange for canceling said membership? Would it matter if the lifetime purchase is for something more
substantial than a gym membership? I.e. do the rules change if you've
contracted Hilton to provide you a free room in any hotel for the rest
of your life? What happens varies a bit depending upon the kind of bankruptcy. In a Chapter 7, all property and contract rights of the bankrupt debtor vest in the bankruptcy trustee when the bankruptcy petition is filed, by operation of law, with certain exceptions. (Chapters 11, 12 and 13 which are reorganizations are conceptually more complicated and I won't address them at length. But, in a reorganization, the title to the debtor's property doesn't necessary vest in a distinct bankruptcy estate at a single moment in time and instead can continue to be owned by the debtor subject to various bankruptcy related obligations.) Certainly, a right to use a hotel for life, which is very close but not identical to a legal life estate in a time share, would be a bankruptcy estate asset and would be vested in the bankruptcy trustee. The bankruptcy court is fairly limited in how it can adjust the rights of third-parties who are not creditors of the bankrupt, although it is not entirely without any authority to do so. It can invalidate ""ipso facto"" clauses in contracts that are triggered only upon bankruptcy, it can unwind preferential payments and fraudulent transfers made prior to filing for bankruptcy, the trustee can invalidate contracts that a third-party lien creditor could invalidate, they can declare restraints on the transferability of contract and property rights that are invalid under state law invalid, and so on. But, generally speaking, the property rights of a party are what they are defined to be unless a specific exception applies. In some cases, if an asset is not exempt from creditors claims, but is also not transferrable, the bankruptcy court could probably compel the bankrupt debtor to buy that asset back from the bankruptcy estate at fair market value, on some sort of financing terms that made it possible to do so, so that the creditors of the estate are not harmed by the lack of transferability. A fact pattern involving a membership in a Surf Club worth several hundred thousand dollars is explored in 2014 ruling in Feaster v. Surf Club, an adversary proceeding in a debtor-member's Chapter 13 bankruptcy, although it doesn't address all of the issues in this question."
Does this image with a subject containing graffiti in the background infringe on the graffiti artist's copyright?,"You are in effect asking if this is a case of Fair use, an important US-specific legal concept in copyright law. Please review this question for an overview of fair use. See also This statement from the US copyright office Deciding whether a use is a fair use is always a fact-driven, case-by-case, process. No one ever knows for sure if a use is a fair use unless that specific use is challenged in court as infringement, and the fair use defense is raised and sustained or not. Courts evaluate fair use claims on a case-by-case basis, and the outcome of any given case depends on a fact-specific inquiry. This means that there is no formula to ensure that a predetermined percentage or amount of a work—or specific number of words, lines, pages, copies—may be used without permission.   (""More Information on Fair Use"" -US Copyright office) Factors Let's look at the fair-use factors in the case of this photo: Purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes: The use is apparently for clearly commercial purpose. This tends to weigh against fair use, but does not rule it out. Then the is the question of whether the use is transformative. The background image apparently serves its original decorative purpose. Whether making it part of an ad is transformative might be debated. Nature of the copyrighted work: The graffiti is an artistic and creative work, not a work of non-fiction or news reporting or factual information. This also tends to weigh against fair use. Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole: It seems that almost all of the work of graffiti, or at least a significant part of it, is being used. This tends to weigh against fair use to some degree. moreover, the  work of graffiti is quite prominent in the background of the work, which ,means it makes a significant contribution to the final work, which also weighs against fair use. Effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work: If the work of graffiti is currently being marketed, the question does not say so, and i would suppose that it isn't. There could be a potential market: the artist could make photos or prints of the work and market them, for example. Even so, this image probably wouldn't affect such a market much. This factor probably inclines towards fair use, but it is hard to say just how a court would asses it. Case law In Ringgold v. Black Entertainment Television, Inc., 126 F.3d 70 (2d Cir. 1997) A poster of a “church quilt” was used in the background of a television series for 27 seconds. This was held not to be fair use. The court was influenced by the prominence of the poster, its thematic importance for the set decoration of a church, and the fact that it was a conventional practice to license such works for use in television programs. This case seems particularly close to the one in the question. In Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd. 448 F.3d 605 (2d Cir. 2006) posters of Grateful Dead concerts were reproduced in a book. This was held to be fair use. The reduced size of the images, and their appearance in the context of a timeline were considered significant. In Kienitz v. Sconnie Nation LLC, 766 F.3d 756 (7th Cir. 2014) A modified photo of a Wisconsin mayor was reproduced on a Tshirt and used to raise money for an event. the photo was posterized, background removed, text added, and a lime green outline featuring the mayor’s smile remained. The resulting image of the mayor, the court stated, “can’t be copyrighted.” Defendants removed so much of the original that,   as with the Cheshire Cat, only the smile remains.  Defendants started with a low-­resolution version   posted on the City’s website, so much of
  the original’s detail never had a chance to reach  the copy; the original’s background is gone; its   colors and shading are gone; the expression in  Soglin’s eyes can no longer be read; after the   posterization (and reproduction by silk-­screening),
  the effect of the lighting in the original is almost   extinguished. What is left, besides a hint of  Soglin’s smile, is the outline of his face, which   can’t be  copyrighted. (I take this to mean that the elements actually copied do not have enough original content to be a copyrightable wqrk.) Conclusion This is not a clear-cut case, in my view, but the case for fair use does not seem strong to me. Copyright protection of Unauthorized Graffiti A number of comments and some other answers have raised the question of whether graffiti made without the permission of the owner or tenant of the location, and therefore illegally, are entitled to copyright protection. The first thing to say is that there is nothing in 17 USC (the US copyright law) that conditions copyright protection on the legality of the work, or of its publication. Case law on this precise issue is not easy to find, nor does there seem to be much of it. IPWatchDog's ""Preventing a Graffiti Copyright Infringement Lawsuit"" (2018) says: Several high-profile companies, American Apparel, Coach, American Eagle Outfitters and H&M who shot advertisements in public spaces, have found themselves inadvertently in the midst of such legal disputes with street artists. Even though an advertiser may have had permission from the property owners, even though the “artwork” was unsanctioned and unsigned or “tagged,” the graffiti artists have come forward after the ads were already in circulation, identified themselves and sought compensation and damages. It goes on to say that: These cases tend to be settled out of court, because regardless of the merit of an infringement claim, they are costly to defend and the unwarranted negative publicity can injure a company’s reputation. ... Also, from a legal standpoint, the question of whether the copyrights of illegally created street art are valid has not yet been determined – so there would be some element of doubt as to how a litigation would be decided. *The Atlantic's article ""Can Graffiti Be Copyrighted?"" about the case of graffiti artist David Anasagasti's case against American Eagle Outfitters for use of his work (and several other similar suits) quotes  Philippa Loengard, assistant director of Columbia Law School’s Kernochan Center for Law, Media, and the Arts as saying: Given what I know of the case, this is one of the most blatant examples of copyright infringement None of the suits mentioned in the story seem to have resulted in a court decision as yet. In Falkner v. General Motors Company, the trial judge held that the art was not ""part of"" the building and thus the exemption for photos of architectural works under 17 USC 120 does not apply. However it denied plaintiff’s DMCA claim and his claim for punitive damages. The court held that: because the facts in the record tend to establish—if anything—the lack of a relevant connection between the mural and the parking garage, the Court cannot hold as a matter of law that the mural is part of an architectural work under Section 102(a)(8). Thus, it cannot reach the issue of whether Section 120(a) applies to the mural to permit photographs of the mural.  In an article in the  N.Y.U. Journal of IP & Entertainment Law ""Protecting Artistic Vandalism"" author Celia Lerman argues that copyright should protect unauthorized, illegal graffiti art.  This article notes that: Graffiti  pieces  increasingly  attract  the  attention  of  numerous  collectors,  gallery owners, publishers, filmmakers, and journalists. Pieces from famous graffiti artists  have  sold  for  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  in  the  art  market.  Graffiti pieces  have  even  been  given  as  diplomatic  gifts.  Galleries  are  seeing  record  attendance at exhibitions of graffiti works, and publishers have generated a boom of  photographic  books  on  graffiti  and  street  art. (citations omitted) The article notes that Tattooed Walls a book by Peter Rosenstein about NYC Graffiti, reproduced images of many works of graffiti without permisison, the author believed that these were fair use because they were posted in public places. Several artist sued, a settlement was agreed to, and the book was withdrawn from publication. The article mentions a suit against Tony Hawk’s   Pro Skater 2 Official Strategy Guide, by the author of a work of graffiti which was reproduced. The suit was initially dismissed for lack of copyright registration, but the court said that it  “assumed,  without deciding, that the work is copyrightable.” When the suit was refiled after registration, a motion to dismiss was denied, and the parties then settled, so there was no court decision on the merits. Other simialtr cases are mentioned. The article goes on to analyze the law and the purposes that copyright law serves, and give reasons why such works should be protected. But none of this cites an actual case where an illegal graffito has been held protected.  The Falkner case will not produce such a ruling, because the art in that case was authorized, indeed invited, by the building owner."
Can a ® so small as to be reduced to a dot confer any legal protection?,"In united-states trademark law, 15 U.S.C. § 1111 provides that: Notice of registration; display with mark; recovery of profits and damages in infringement suit Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1072 of this title, a registrant of a mark registered in the Patent and Trademark Office, may give notice that his mark is registered by displaying with the mark the words ""Registered in U.S. Patent and Trademark Office"" or ""Reg. U.S. Pat. & Tm. Off."" or the letter R enclosed within a circle, thus ®; and in any suit for infringement under this chapter by such a registrant failing to give such notice of registration, no profits and no damages shall be recovered under the provisions of this chapter unless the defendant had actual notice of the registration. Notice that display of the symbol is optional, the registrant  ""may give notice"" by using the phrase or the ® symbol. But if such notice is not given a significant element of damages in case of an infringement is forfeit unless the infringer had ""actual notice"" of the registration of the mark. Since the purpose is to give notice that a word, symbol, logo or other indication is in fact a registered mark, making the registration so small that it cannot easily be seen might tend to defeat that purpose. If an infringer claimed not to be aware that an indication was a registered mark, and if the notice was displayed or printed in so small a form that this claim was plausible, it might raise an issue in an infringement suit. I have not found any caselaw on the point. ""Finessing the Details of Type: Registered, Trademark, & Copyright Symbols""  by  Ilene Strizver advises that: These symbols are used at so small a size that they should be neutral in appearance, yet clear at the size they will be reproduced at ... when using a ® or a ™ after a word, the size should be adjusted as necessary, independently from the rest of the text, to look clear and legible, yet unobtrusive. Its proportion next to the neighboring word or glyph depends a lot on the final size of each appearance. A general guideline for text is to make these symbols a little smaller than half the x-height. As the type gets larger, the symbols can become proportionately smaller, especially in headlines. However this is a guide for typesetters and graphic designers, and is not legal advice. Several sources indicate that a single use of the R-in-a-circle in connection with a particular mark in any given document or set of packaging is sufficient (as is also mentioned in a comment). If elsewhere in the same web site the logo is displayed in a larger size, with a larger version of the symbol, that would probably offer all the protection needed under US law. This answer is US-centric. Law elsewhere may or may not be similar."
Can I let myself out of a prison if I buy the prison?,"Not legally.  Private prisons are operated under a government mandate (typically via a contract with the government). That said, depending on jurisdiction, there are plenty of scenarios where a prisoner is legally permitted to leave a prison.  This can include work release programs, work details controlled by the prison, to visit sick or ill relatives, as part of a rehabilitation program (e.g., to attend an education program), etc. How much of these forms of release can be manipulated by a private prison likely varies by jurisdiction.  Of course, some of the relevant decision makers may have a preference for keeping the prison owner happy, even if the owner has no direct influence. Mind you, it is probably difficult to get into such a position.  I suspect a prison operator would not be sent to their own prison (and would not want to be; prisoners might attack them).  Similarly, the government would probably block a jailed felon from taking ownership of their own prison."
"Before the 13th Amendment, could people sell themselves into slavery in the USA?","It is hard to prove a negative, but in the British colonies and their successors, I believe that the answer was probably no. Indentured servitude came close to the concept of selling oneself into slavery, although for a fixed term of years.  The 13th Amendment recognizes the possibility that slavery or involuntary servitude could be a punishment for a criminal offense, although I've heard of only a few instances in which permanent slavery was actually a punishment for a criminal offense (see, e.g., one case from 1659 in what is now New Mexico but then was part of Old Mexico, mentioned below). On the other hand, the equivalent of indentured servitude, which was sometimes called slavery, was imposed with some regularity, most often for offenders with African descent, prior to the adoption of the 13th Amendment and into the post-Civil War era, was more often a punishment. And indentured servitude remained a not uncommon punishment and continues to be used, for example, with sentences of hard labor being common in military justice, mandatory prison labor (especially ""chain gangs""), and sentences of useful community service being common in civilian criminal courts, all constituting indentured servitude to some extent.  Both voluntary military service and military conscription are also forms of indentured servitude in economic substance and in their legal effect, but these forms of commitments to involuntary military service are not treated as indentured servitude for purposes of the 13th Amendment. N.B. In this answer I use the term indentured servitude to refer to involuntary service and labor for a fixed period of time, rather than for life, whether this entered into as a voluntary contract or as an involuntary punishment. But, historically, people who I define as indentured servants for the purposes of this answer (especially if this service was imposed as punishment for a crime and the individuals so sentenced were of African or Native American descent(, were often referred to as slaves. The term indentured servant was sometimes limited to voluntarily entered into arrangements, with the term slavery sometimes used for both short term and permanent involuntary labor not entered into voluntarily (in a manner similar to the use of the term mortgage to specify a voluntary security interest in property and the term lien to specify an involuntarily created security interest in property, although this semantic convention is also inconsistent). But, the historical usage is not very consistent anyway, and I understand the word slavery as it is used in the question to be limited to permanent involuntary servitude, rather than temporary involuntary servitude, so I use only a restricted sense of the word slavery in this answer, consistent with the way the word is used in the question. I've also never heard of even a single instance of someone selling themselves into slavery in the U.S., despite being a fairly avid history buff who minored in history in college. Another piece of circumstantial evidence that argues against the existence of a mechanism for selling yourself into slavery is the fact that the U.S. Constitution, all the way back in 1789, already provided for, as a basic function of government, for bankruptcy, and the institution of bankruptcy was one with British law antecedents going back to 1705 (which has a quasi-criminal character but mostly the same effect) that existed in the American colonies as well. Likewise, the U.S. Constitution also prohibited punishments involving a ""corruption of blood"" which held descendants responsible for the acts of their ancestors even if those acts amounted to treason. U.S. Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 3, ¶ 2. Self-enslavement for ""honor"" is very akin to a feudal oath of fealty, which was strongly rejected as part of the Independence movement of the United States including language in the 1789 U.S. Constitution, and it was also an institution that never had much currency in the Americas because many of the early colonies were of a corporate or religious nature, rather than an aristocratic one, unlike many early Spanish colonies. These historical circumstances eliminated the main circumstances motivating historical examples of an institution of submitting oneself to slavery. Another historical fact that strongly argues against there being an institution of selling oneself in slavery was the strongly racialized nature of slavery in British colonies and their successors. Indentured servitude was for white people, slavery was for black people, and there really wasn't much of a cultural or conceptual need for mix up these two models. Doing so would have undermined a cultural axiom of racial supremacy which was important to sustaining slavery as an institution in the United States.  This may also be a reason that there was not a strong institution of enslaving either European descent or Native American prisoners of war in North America, even though some Native Americans were enslaved on a more ad hoc basis by people of European descent. If I recall correctly, early attempts to enslave Native Americans were also not very successful as an economic proposition for the would be slavers, for whatever reasons, further racializing slavery as an institution in North America largely limited to people of African descent. The discussion at the link above illustrates the parameters of the situation: When Europeans arrived as colonists in North America, Native Americans
  changed their practice of slavery dramatically. Native Americans began
  selling war captives to Europeans rather than integrating them into
  their own societies as they had done before. As the demand for labor
  in the West Indies grew with the cultivation of sugar cane, Europeans
  enslaved Native Americans for the Thirteen Colonies, and some were
  exported to the ""sugar islands."" The British settlers, especially
  those in the southern colonies, purchased or captured Native Americans
  to use as forced labor in cultivating tobacco, rice, and indigo.
  Accurate records of the numbers enslaved do not exist. Scholars
  estimate tens of thousands of Native Americans may have been enslaved
  by the Europeans, being sold by Native Americans themselves or
  European men. Slaves became a caste of people who were foreign to the English
  (Native Americans, Africans and their descendants) and non-Christians.
  The Virginia General Assembly defined some terms of slavery in 1705: All servants imported and brought into the Country ... who were not
Christians in their native Country ... shall be accounted and be
slaves. All Negro, mulatto and Indian slaves within this dominion ...
  shall be held to be real estate. If any slave resists his master ...
  correcting such slave, and shall happen to be killed in such
correction ... the master shall be free of all punishment ... as if
such accident never happened. — Virginia General Assembly declaration, 1705. The slave trade of Native Americans lasted only until around 1730. It
  gave rise to a series of devastating wars among the tribes, including
  the Yamasee War. The Indian Wars of the early 18th century, combined
  with the increasing importation of African slaves, effectively ended
  the Native American slave trade by 1750. Colonists found that Native
  American slaves could easily escape, as they knew the country. The
  wars cost the lives of numerous colonial slave traders and disrupted
  their early societies. The remaining Native American groups banded
  together to face the Europeans from a position of strength. Many
  surviving Native American peoples of the southeast strengthened their
  loose coalitions of language groups and joined confederacies such as
  the Choctaw, the Creek, and the Catawba for protection. Native American women were at risk for rape whether they were enslaved
  or not; during the early colonial years, settlers were
  disproportionately male. They turned to Native women for sexual
  relationships. Both Native American and African enslaved women
  suffered rape and sexual harassment by male slaveholders and other
  white men. The exact number of Native Americans who were enslaved is unknown
  because vital statistics and census reports were at best
  infrequent. Andrés Reséndez estimates that between 147,000 and
  340,000 Native Americans were enslaved in North America, excluding
  Mexico. Linford Fisher's estimates 2.5 million to 5.5 million Natives
  enslaved in the entire Americas. Even though records became more
  reliable in the later colonial period, Native American slaves received
  little to no mention, or they were classed with African slaves with no
  distinction. For example, in the case of ""Sarah Chauqum of Rhode
  Island"", her master listed her as mulatto in the bill of sale to
  Edward Robinson, but she won her freedom by asserting her Narragansett
  identity. Little is known about Native Americans that were forced into labor.
  Two myths have complicated the history of Native American slavery:
  that Native Americans were undesirable as servants, and that Native
  Americans were exterminated or pushed out after King Philip's War. The
  precise legal status for some Native Americans is at times difficult
  to establish, as involuntary servitude and slavery were poorly defined
  in 17th-century British America. Some masters asserted ownership over
  the children of Native American servants, seeking to turn them into
  slaves. The historical uniqueness of slavery in America is that
  European settlers drew a rigid line between insiders, ""people like
  themselves who could never be enslaved"", and nonwhite outsiders,
  ""mostly Africans and Native Americans who could be enslaved"". A unique
  feature between natives and colonists was that colonists gradually
  asserted sovereignty over the native inhabitants during the
  seventeenth century, ironically transforming them into subjects with
  collective rights and privileges that Africans could not enjoy. The
  West Indies developed as plantation societies prior to the Chesapeake
  Bay region and had a demand for labor. In the Spanish colonies, the church assigned Spanish surnames to
  Native Americans and recorded them as servants rather than slaves.
  Many members of Native American tribes in the Western United States
  were taken for life as slaves. In some cases, courts served as
  conduits for enslavement of Indians, as evidenced by the enslavement
  of the Hopi man Juan Suñi in 1659 by a court in Santa Fe for theft of
  food and trinkets from the governor's mansion. In the East, Native
  Americans were recorded as slaves. The colonial legislation from Virginia from 1705 quoted above, in particular, argues that Europeans could not generally be enslaved in Virginia, although the distinction was formally religious rather than racial. But, the religious aspect also had a caveat omitted in the quote from the 1705 CE legislation from Virginia above that muddy the waters of religious v. racial or national origin discrimination: all servants imported and brought into the Country... who were not
  christians in their native country, (except... Turks and Moors in
  amity with her majesty, and others that can make due proof of their
  being free in England, or any other christian country, before they
  were shipped...) shall be accounted and be slaves, and such be here
  bought and sold notwithstanding a conversion to christianity
  afterward. Thus, Jews and Muslims and deists (true atheism as opposed to deism from very rare in the Enlightenment era and only became common after Darwin) who were were free ""in England, or in any other christian country, before they were shipped"" were still not considered slaves in Virginia in 1705 CE. And for that purpose free simply meant, not a slave. Thus, Jews from England were considered free in England, even though they did not have full citizenship rights and were subject to de jure discrimination there from 1655 CE when they first returned to England after Jews were expelled from England in 1290 CE (in connection with the religious movements associated with the Crusades), through at least 1829 CE. Most people in Africa during the colonial era in North America, who were Christians, were Ethiopians or Egyptians, neither of whom were a major source of New World slaves.  Also not unrelated is the fact that early attempts to use indentured servants and hired farm hands of European descent in the American Southeast were not very successful because the mortality and disease rates of these servants, especially due to mosquito born diseases to which they had little natural immunity, was so significantly greater than that of African descent slaves who had some natural immunity to these diseases, making white slavery an economically unattractive institution to establish. Periodic rounds of ""moral panic"" related to the nebulous and often not very well grounded fear of white slavery that has recurred throughout U.S. history at regular intervals also argues for the racialized nature of the institution in the U.S. and its predecessor British colonies. In sum, there is very good reason to believe that it was never possible to sell oneself into slavery in the United States or in the British colonies that preceded it, even though it is hard to prove that point definitively. was legally enslaving a free, willing US resident or immigrant legally
  impossible by any means or was this simply something that was not done
  for social or practical reasons? I do not believe that this was expressly provided for by statute, but most law at the time was common law rooted in British case law anyway, which makes distinguishing between something that was ""legally impossible"" and something ""that was not done for social or practical reasons"" harder to distinguish in common law jurisdictions than in civil law jurisdictions based upon continental Europe. I am less confident of the status of this possibility in the case of Dutch or Spanish or French colonies in North America.  I know from historical accounts of French North America that slavery, while it existed, was much less racialized with a significant community of free people of color.  And, all three of those countries had legal systems with their roots in Roman law that was ""received"" by these countries in the early modern era basically when political leaders as the Middle Ages started to fade away, started to use Roman legal treatises to justify their resolutions of disputes without formally adopting this as a positive source of law (the Netherlands is a bit more muddled as it was also a major participant in the home grown institution called the ""law merchant"" devised by merchants serving as arbitrators, especially in disputes between merchants, some of which ended up influencing British common law). Anyway, in these countries, Roman legal sources that recognized the concept of selling yourself into slavery would have been available and could have been considered good law.  Also, because these countries, especially Spain and France, had much less of a vibrant commercial tradition in the early modern period, it is quite likely that the institution of bankruptcy that developed comparatively early in Britain came later there, potentially necessitating a way to settle debts that could not be discharged and which might otherwise burden descendants (many places in continental Europe had descendants liable for the debts of their ancestors into the early modern period). So, if it were ever possible to sell oneself into slavery at all in North American history, in what ultimately became the United States, it probably happened in French North America, former Spanish colonies, or in Dutch Manhattan, with the first two probably much more likely to have occurred than the last one. Even there, however, I cannot think of a single historical or literary account that recognizes even one example of such a transition in personal status. A short account of French slavery law also provides no precedent for anything remotely similar to this practice. This is particularly notable since the French apparently largely borrowed from Dutch and Spanish practice. The possibility of selling oneself into slavery did exist in the legal and cultural circumstances of some Native American tribes in North America, where the institution was less like the chattel slavery of the early English slave traders. As explained at the link above: Many Native American tribes practiced some form of slavery before the
  European introduction of African slavery into North America. Native American groups often enslaved war captives whom they primarily
  used for small-scale labor. Others however would stake themselves in
  gambling situations when they had nothing else which would put them
  into servitude for a short time in some cases for life; captives were
  also sometimes tortured as part of religious rites, and these
  sometimes involved ritual cannibalism. During times of famine some
  Native Americans would also temporarily sell their children to obtain
  food... Several tribes held captives as hostages for payment. Various
  tribes also practiced debt slavery or imposed slavery on tribal
  members who had committed crimes; full tribal status would be restored
  as the enslaved worked off their obligations to the tribal society.
  Obtaining prisoners was also a strong interest for Native American
  warriors as for the qualification of being considered brave this was
  especially an interest of male warriors in various tribes. Other
  slave-owning tribes of North America included Comanche of Texas, the
  Creek of Georgia; the fishing societies, such as the Yurok, who lived
  in Northern California; the Pawnee, and the Klamath. Self-enslavement seems to go hand in hand with slavery not having a strong racial component."

Have draft SCOTUS opinions been leaked before?,"Politico, who published this most recent leak, also has an article about prior SOCTUS leaks.  Most of them were very minor or speculative, along the lines of the following two examples given: In 1972, while Roe was under deliberation, an unbylined Washington Post story detailed the justices’ internal wrangling on that subject. The Post story — which appeared days after the justices ordered a second round of arguments in the case — was attributed to anonymous informed sources and did not quote any draft opinions or internal memoranda, but described them in significant detail. In 1979, ABC News Supreme Court correspondent Tim O’Brien went on air with reports predicting the outcome of two decisions that were days away from release. Chief Justice Warren Burger launched an inquiry into whether anyone at the court had breached protocol, and a Government Printing Office employee involved in setting type for the court’s rulings was transferred to a different division. The staffer denied leaking any information. A Business Insider article attributes the original Roe leak to a memo written by Justice William Douglas. The Politico article continues listing a few other examples of a similar vein, where convenient coincidences suggested someone had an inside line on how the court was leaning: a passionate Senate speech here, an article predicting case decisions there, etc.  When a leak is strongly suspected, the fingers are usually pointed at one or more of the court's clerks. The aforementioned Business Insider article also mentions that a clerk leaked information to Vanity Fair about Bush v. Gore. Politico does mention the following as a more substantive example: The gravest violations of Supreme Court confidentiality came just over a century ago and led to a law clerk being accused of leaking the outcome of cases to Wall Street traders so he and they could turn a quick profit. The Justice Department fingered Ashton Embry, a longtime clerk to Justice Joseph McKenna, with being the source of leaks in business-related cases handed down in 1919 related to a wartime ban on liquor distilling and so-called patents allowing railroads to use particular lands. The case suffered a number of setbacks, including a lack of any insider trading laws at the time and a disappearing witness, and ultimately Embry was never convicted of anything, or even brought to trial. And it ends with an extremely recent example from a few months ago: During oral arguments on a Trump-era immigration policy this February, Justice Stephen Breyer mentioned that red states’ claim of standing to defend the policy was “pretty similar to what we had just allowed” in a case involving who could defend a Kentucky abortion statute. But the high court had not yet ruled in the Kentucky case. It did so eight days later, ruling 8-1, as Breyer and many less-informed others had predicted. A full leak of a decision does not appear to have occurred before now. Leaks that appear to have been based in substantial part on (draft) opinions do appear to have occurred before, just not as a complete document. But insofar as the Embry incident may have resulted in actual and intentional profiteering off of leaked information it stands as a rather serious and consequential breach."
"Is a sign that only says ""POSTED"", nothing else, sufficient to be understood as ""No Trespassing""?","This varies depending on the specific law of the state or locality involved. In New York, the word ""POSTED"", along with the name and address of the owner is sufficient to notify people not to intrude, and anyone ignoring such a sign is technically trespassing (although, in practice, if such a person leaves the property when asked, did no damage, and appeared honestly ignorant, it is likely that no legal action would be taken). In California, as specified by penal code section 553 (quoted in the linked answer) a sign for this purpose must include: the words “trespassing-loitering forbidden by law,” or words describing the use of the property followed by the words “no trespassing.” in letters at least two inches tall, and follow other specifications in the law. The word ""Posted"" is neither required nor sufficient, although the law calls land with such signs ""posted property""."
"If other party notified me that phone conversation is being recorded, do I need to tell them if I am also recording it?","You do need to know the location of both parties. U.S. Federal law (18 USC 2511(2)(d)), which prohibits the interception of wire and electronic communication, states: It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a person not acting under color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication where such person is a party to the communication or where one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception unless such communication is intercepted for the purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State. California Penal Code 632 requires the consent of all parties to a confidential communication in order for the conversation to be recorded.  The statute defines a ""confidential communication"" as follows: The term “confidential communication” includes any communication carried on in circumstances as may reasonably indicate that any party to the communication desires it to be confined to the parties thereto, but excludes a communication made in a public gathering or in any legislative, judicial, executive or administrative proceeding open to the public, or in any other circumstance in which the parties to the communication may reasonably expect that the communication may be overheard or recorded. Once AT&T, or anyone else for that matter, states that the communication is being recorded, it is no longer considered a confidential communication requiring the consent of all parties in order for any party to record it. Part of the California Civil Jury Instructions for this code requires that the plaintiff must prove, among other things, that the plaintiff had a ""reasonable expectation that the conversation was not being overheard or recorded.""

What if you and a restaurant can't agree on who is at fault for a credit card issue?,"As the answer by Paul Johnson says, if you had no criminal intent, there was no crime. As the answer by Dale M says, the prosecution would need to prove that criminal intent along with the other elements of the crime. Offering to make the call to the banks should be evidence that you had no criminal intent. Making the call and getting assurance from the bank should be evidence that you had good reason to think the cards were good, and thus has no criminal intent. That the cards were good subsequently (which could be shown by receipts or statements) would be further evidence to that effect. While such evidence might not strictly be required, it might help if a criminal case were brought, and mention of it might help persuade the authorities not to bring one. Of course, the bill must still be paid, but that is a civil matter where there was no intent to avoid payment."
Would a contract to pay a trillion dollars in damages be valid?,"What you're talking about is a liquidated-damages clause, where the contract explicitly spells out the damages to be awarded in the event of a breach. The law will vary some from state to state, but these clauses are generally enforceable. Some courts limit their use to cases where calculating the damages resulting from the breach would be impossible or impractical. But in the United States, along with all other common law jurisdictions, courts generally agree that if the liquidated-damages clause appears to penalize the breach instead of simply compensating for it, it is not enforceable. See, e.g., Ridgley v. Topa Thrift & Loan Ass'n, 17 Cal.4th 970, 977 (Cal. 1998) (“A liquidated damages clause will generally be considered unreasonable, and hence unenforceable under section 1671(b), if it bears no reasonable relationship to the range of actual damages that the parties could have anticipated would flow from a breach.”) The trillion-dollar damages clause ""bears no reasonable relationship"" to the damages that would actually result from a breach of a software license, so you can safely expect a court to refuse to enforce it, and limit you to whatever damages you could actually prove in court. Even if you were to drastically reduce it to  ""all the money you have, and then some,"" ""all the money you have,"" ""half the money you have,"" or even "" ""1 percent of all the money you have,"" the language still makes clear that the contract is not aimed at compensating for the breach, but rather penalizing the breaching party. In the end, what you're talking about isn't going to work, because contract law is generally less concerned with penalizing people than with making them whole."
US: Is there any subject that it is unlawful to teach in schools?,"A teacher could not instruct students in how to build explosives for use in Federal crimes: It shall be unlawful for any person to teach or demonstrate the making or use of an explosive, a destructive device, or a weapon of mass destruction [...] with the intent that the teaching, demonstration, or information be used for, or in furtherance of, an activity that constitutes a Federal crime of violence (source) This Federal statute creates a law preventing the teaching (in any context, including schools) of bombmaking for the purpose of committing a federal crime. So ""bombmaking"" is one subject that cannot be taught, although I don't think that there have been any prosecutions of regular K12 teachers under this law."
Are homeless people protected by antidiscrimination laws?,"Anti-discrimination laws apply to certain protected classes only. Homelessness (real or assumed) is not one of them, so it is perfectly legal to bar such people from your premises. It is also perfectly legal to bar people with red hair (assuming this is not indirect discrimination against certain racial groups). Nobody is required to serve everybody who comes in; what you are not allowed to do is ban women, homosexuals or other groups set out in the applicable statutes."
How are Trump's actions against NFL protesters not a violation of Constitutional rights?,"The comments have already pointed out that the President of the United States is still a citizen, and all of the rights of a citizen are still protected for them.  Additionally, the Administration is allowed to take policy positions which are antagonistic to a person or group's cause, even if that group is practicing their rights to express their views legally.  To give a different example, the President and his administration may denounce the position of a group of Neo-Nazis marching legally.  So, any argument that the President is acting in an official capacity while making antagonistic comments also probably fails, as the Administration is allowed to take a position on any issue they deem worth taking a stand on.   As noted in another answer and in comments, the applicable laws appear to be 18 U.S. Code § 227, which provides for punishment of government officials who attempt to influence employment decisions through official acts for political purposes, and 42 U.S. Code § 1983, which provides for civil action when a person deprives, or causes the deprivation of, another person's rights under color of law.   18 U.S. Code § 227 likely does not apply for two reasons a decision or action on a ""question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy""; that question or matter must involve a formal exercise of governmental power, and must also be something specific and focused that is ""pending"" or ""may by law be brought"" before a public official 42 U.S. Code § 1983 might apply if the official statements were found to be acting under color of law, but I think the statements made so far will fail to meet the qualifications for this statute.  Blair v. Bethel School District gives three qualifications for conduct that would allow recovery under this statute: (1) he engaged in constitutionally protected activity;
  (2) as a result, he was subjected to adverse action by the defendant that would chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in the protected activity; and
  (3) there was a substantial causal relationship between the constitutionally protected activity and the adverse action. The President's and Administration's official speech appears to fail the second criteria.  First, it is questionable whether it qualifies as an ""Adverse Action"" - in Blair, as well as Hartman v. Moore and Gibson v. United States, the adverse action against the Plaintiff caused actual damage or indignity.  However, even if we assume the official speech qualifies as an adverse action for the purposes of the statute, it still appears to be permissible for effectively the same reasons as the first and third arguments presented in the decision: First, the adverse action Blair complains of was a rather minor indignity, and de minimis deprivations of benefits and privileges on account of one's speech do not give rise to a First Amendment claim. The actual effect of the Administration's speech has a minimal direct effect on the players it speaks against.  The decision further states: The most familiar adverse actions are “exercise[s] of governmental power” that are “regulatory, proscriptive, or compulsory in nature” and have the effect of punishing someone for his or her speech Official speech by the Administration is not ""regulatory, proscriptive, or compulsory in nature.""  While this is not a complete definition for ""adverse action,"" it gives a sense of severity, which official speech does not appear to meet. Additionally, the President's right to speech, and the Administration's authority and need to make official speech as directed by the President is a competing interest in this case, as was the interest of the Board in Blair: Third, it is significant that Blair isn't the only party in this case whose interests implicate First Amendment concerns. To the contrary, we assume all of the Board members have a protected interest in speaking out and voting their conscience... The decision does note that: The point isn't that the vote against Blair was protected speech simply because it was expressive. Almost all retaliatory actions can be said to be expressive, including those that are manifestly unconstitutional.  But, while Blair certainly had a First Amendment right to criticize Seigel and vote against his retention as superintendent, his fellow Board members had the corresponding right to replace Blair with someone who, in their view, represented the majority view of the Board. Similarly, it's probable that a court would find that the President's right to speech and their Administration's corresponding authority to speech against the players' right to protest is equally weighted or even weightier, such that stifling the official speech is as bad or worse than the alleged chilling effect of the speech. Some examples of things that clearly would fall afoul of 42 U.S. Code § 1983 would be the President or the Administration misappropriating funds to use to pay NFL teams not to hire players who kneel during the national anthem, or signing an Executive Order preventing players who kneel during the national anthem from playing - in both cases, they are taking actions which fall outside the powers of their office, which would qualify as acts made under color of law and clearly chill the players' First Amendment rights."
Can a landowner charge a dead person for renting property in the U.S.?,"A person's contractual rights and obligations remain valid past their death, so if the landlord dies, their heirs cannot then kick out the tenant, and likewise if the tenant dies, their estate still is liable for unpaid past and future rent. That means for example that the person cannot be evicted, the landlord cannot take their property or enter without permission save for the standard emergency conditions. The tenant (or their estate) remains liable for rent until the lease terminates. If the lease has a clause to the effect that the lease terminate at the end of the month when notice of death is given, that defines when the tenancy ends and therefore when rent isn't due – relevant to a yearly lease, and the question of whether the estate would be on the hook for a full year of rent (it also depends on whether subletting is allowed)."
"Legal basis of statement by British Food Standards Agency that companies may label as ""sunflower oil"" what is not sunflower oil?","What statutory or prerogative authority is the FSA exercising when it allows such false labelling? As other answers have noted, they have executive discretion to ""turn a blind eye"" to what would normally be a violation of food safety laws and just decide that, right now, their government-mandated priorities are better served by not enforcing that particular letter of the law in these particular circumstances. In theory, someone could probably challenge that decision and take them to court over it, claiming that they were derelict in their duties or not acting impartially and in the public interest.  However, in this case they'd probably have a pretty good defense against and such claims, both due to having explicit authority to make such decisions in emergencies (as also noted in other answers), and also because the decision itself seems pretty fair (it applies to all producers using sunflower oil in their products) and justified by the circumstances (more on that below). What public good is supposed to be being served here? It is stated that allowing items to be labelled ""sunflower oil"" that contain no sunflower oil ""[maintains] the supply of certain food products"", but this is nonsensical because replacing a product with another product does not maintain its supply, regardless of whether the replacement product is labelled accurately or falsely. Labelling the replacement as being the product it replaced appears to maintain its supply, but it doesn't actually maintain its supply. That is fact rather than opinion. You seem to be assuming that this advice by the FAS is about allowing someone to sell bottles of ""sunflower oil"" that actually contain rapeseed oil.  It's not. It's not even really about products like crisps (potato chips, for those not in the UK) or pesto sauce or margarine that might contain sunflower oil as a major ingredient.  For those products, the news page you linked indicates there are separate rules that apparently require, at a minimum, applying a sticker to notify consumers about the substitution: ""where sunflower oil is a key ingredient, such as crisps, retailers will imprint information on substitute oil onto existing labels."" However, think about all the other foodstuffs sold in stores that might include sunflower oil as a minor ingredient, like, say, granola, mustard sauce, instant noodles, mashed potato powder, microwave popcorn, frozen pizza, bolognese pasta sauce or just plain white bread. (If you're wondering where the random list of products above comes from, I just looked quickly around in my kitchen for products that had sunflower oil, rapeseed oil or some other neutral vegetable oil listed as a minor ingredient.  There are surprisingly many.) I assume you would agree that all of these products would still be substantially the same product regardless of which kind of vegetable oil was used in them. The companies making all those products, and many others besides, typically order their product packaging in bulk, often from overseas, getting a new shipment of boxes or wrappers or labels maybe every few months or years.  And of course those will all have the ingredients list printed on them, as mandated by law.  If they want to change the ingredients, that means they have to send a new design to the company that makes the packaging and wait however many days or weeks or months it takes for the packaging company to make and ship the new packaging with the updated ingredients list to them. Normally that's not much of a problem, because normally food manufacturers don't tend to change ingredients in a hurry.  Usually they'd plan such changes months in advance, order the new packaging well ahead of time and probably use up all of the old packaging they have in stock before actually making the switch so that they don't have to throw it away. (Companies that do need to frequently switch ingredients, e.g. due to seasonal or unpredictable availability, usually plan for that in advance e.g. by making their labels generic enough to accommodate the change or, where that's not allowed, finding workarounds like indicating the exact type or origin of the ingredients in codes that are stamped on the packaging late in the manufacturing process.  That's why you occasionally see stuff in ingredients lists like ""vegetable oils (rapeseed, sunflower or soybean)"" or ""produced in EU and non-EU countries"" or ""see last letter of expiration code for country of origin: A = Spain, B = Morocco, C = Israel, D = China"".) In this particular case, however, a lot of companies that had been using sunflower oil in their products, and expected it to remain easily available, were caught short when the war in Ukraine broke out and the price of sunflower oil suddenly went way up, as companies selling the oil realized that there probably wouldn't be much sunflower oil exported from Ukraine this year. At that point, the companies that had been using sunflower oil as a generic cooking oil in their products would normally have a limited number of options, none of them particularly good (for either the companies or consumers): Keep using sunflower oil at whatever cost and transfer the increased cost to consumer prices.  (To make things worse, the more companies do this, the higher the price of sunflower oil will rise, as they're basically competing for a limited supply.) Switch to a different type of oil and order new packaging ASAP, hoping that it will arrive before your existing stock of sunflower oil runs out.  (This might take longer than usual, since presumably other companies are also in the same situation, so the packaging makers are probably swamped with sudden orders.  Also, your stock of old packaging is now useless, and you might have to throw it out.) Order the new packaging immediately and pay extra for expedited delivery.  Again, you'd be competing with lots of other companies who also really want to be the first to get their new packaging, so premiums for fast delivery are likely to be high if you can get it at all.  All of that extra cost will also likely transfer into consumer prices. Use the existing packaging but apply stickers with updated ingredients lists on top of the old ones.  That's not nearly as easy and cheap as it sounds, not only because you still have to get the stickers printed (and the printing companies are probably also swamped with orders), but also because you'll have to apply them to every single box or bag or carton, likely by hand.  That's a lot of expensive manual labor that will, again, likely increase consumer prices. Just halt production until you can get new, updated packaging (or more sunflower oil at a reasonable price).  That's probably the worst option for both the manufacturers and the consumers, since it results in lots of lost income for the manufacturers and product shortages for the consumers.  Still, if all the other options are even more expensive, some manufacturers might be forced to do this. The exceptional decision by the FAS to selectively enforce the food labeling requirements in this particular case basically offers these food manufacturers one more option: switch to an alternative type of oil now, but keep using the old packaging until you can replace it. Practically speaking that's probably the best outcome for almost everyone.  There's really very little difference between sunflower and rapeseed oil — both are neutral, mostly flavorless vegetable oils suitable for generic cooking purposes — and most people probably can't really tell them apart, especially not when they're used as minor ingredients among many others. Of course, there may still be people who really don't like the taste of rapeseed oil (assuming they can taste it) or are allergic to it (which, as the news article you linked notes, is very rare) or have some ethical or religious objection to consuming it (not that I'm aware of any, but I'm sure someone out there has one).  Hence the news release, so that those people who might be affected by the substitution can find about it in advance."
What are the legal ramifications of a legally dead person turning up alive?,"What kind of procedures would be necessary to undo the legal death?
What happens to his property (note: the reanimated character is a
young man with no written will)? If he's a renter, how long will it
take for his landlord to push all his stuff out and welcome a new
tenant? How much paperwork does he have to fill out? If the person is on the autopsy table, while he may have technically been legally dead, the person's death certificate has probably not even been issued yet, since normally an autopsy is done, in part, to determine a cause of death for purposes of preparing a death certificate. Normally, an autopsy is only prepared when the cause of death is uncertain or needs to be documented for legal reasons (e.g. an accidental or potentially criminal death or one that is just unexplained), and the need for one postpones the preparation of a death certificate. If the cause of death is self-evident and there is no indication of foul play, an autopsy isn't done and the preparation of a death certificate proceeds more quickly. In other words, while he may be ""legally"" dead (defined as discontinuation of the function of certain bodily processes like brain activity and heartbeat and breathing), he very likely isn't yet ""bureaucratically"" dead. You can be ""legally"" dead days before anyone even discovers that you have died, with the time of your death determined only retroactively, but that doesn't have any practical effect until someone discovers it and it makes its way through the bureaucratic and court process. It takes a few days after a death for a probate proceeding to establish death, heirship and the validity of any will (many states have a 120 hour minimum waiting period after a date of death and most autopsies are within 72 hours). Even if a probate proceeding had been commenced, a simple affidavit or notice that someone was not, in fact, dead would cause the case to be summarily dismissed and it is unlikely that much would have happened in the court process since then. With older people, one of the fastest agencies to act is the Social Security Administration discontinuing benefits. But a younger person wouldn't have gotten those to start with, so that wouldn't be a factor. Life insurance companies normally won't pay until a final post-autopsy death certificate with cause of death is in place (so they can look for fraud in the life insurance application relative to the cause of death stated). It would be very usual for a landlord to take action sooner than the month after learning of the death, and often the estate will keep in a lease in force much longer. Next of kin may have removed some valuables prior to any official declaration, and while most people would promptly return them upon learning of the ""mistake"", a few items might not be recovered. The final death certificate would probably never be prepared. A preliminary death certificate might be quashed as erroneous and not filed with the Vital Statistics Department of the State Department of Health, by the preparing party, through a simple, oral, in office instruction to the person in the coroner's office who handles those filings. Since there isn't a formal judicial declaration of death or a final death certificate, simply informing an agency or person that received a preliminary notice that it was in error, perhaps by letter or email, would suffice. Even if a final death certificate had just issued, the person who filed it could probably fill out a simple correction form so soon (probably just a matter of hours) after it was filed. It wouldn't be that disruptive. The messy cases are when there has been a legal declaration of death and then months of actions have been taken in reliance on the determination that someone is dead."
"Why was nine-pin bowling illegal in most states, unlike ten-pin bowling?","Nine-pin bowling was the violent video game of its age - the people who were in power didn’t like it, didn’t like the type of people who played it, linked it with vice - like gambling and laziness - and, therefore, banned it. It’s a perennial that older people, who tend to be the ones in power, despair over the dissipation of youth and the disintegration of society that will inevitably result. Or rich people, who also are the ones in power, despairing over the recreational activities of working-class people. It’s probable that there was gambling involved - people will bet on anything, and this was a game of skill and chance, a perfect vehicle for gambling. The games and gambling would not have been regulated, so there would almost surely be some criminals who got involved. However, the biggest driver was taking this grain of truth and then blowing it out of all proportion. As other answers have pointed out, the laws usually did not specify the number of pins. Eventually, the moral panic declined, and the laws were repealed. However, times had changed, and the 10-pin form of the game is what came back backed by larger commercial interests rather than the artisan style of 9-pins. 10-pin bowling uses much bigger alleys with gutters and is suitable for mechanisation. a 9-pin alley can fit in a relatively small room, and standing the pins back up again is not much more demanding than pulling pool balls out of pockets. It's not unusual that after government suppression is lifted, things come back different to the way they were before the suppression started. For example, prohibition fundamentally changed how Americans drank - before, men in saloons drank; after, it was an activity of all genders at home and in bars and restaurants. There was also proportionally more wine and spirits drunk compared to beer because these drinks are more alcohol-dense, so bootleggers got more alcohol per gallon smuggled, so they became relatively cheaper."
Government's standing in criminal trials,"So what relevance if any does standing have in criminal trials? E.g.,
are there any examples of criminal cases/charges dismissed for lack of
standing, by which I mean that the court decided the government lacked
standing? Let's restrict the discussion to federal proceedings, for
the sake of not making this too broad. Almost none. Conceptually, this is because a violation of a sovereign's criminal laws is an injury-in-fact to a legally protected interest of a sovereign in not having its own criminal laws violated. The violation of the law itself is the injury. Where standing type considerations apply they are usually described as jurisdiction. A sovereign, be it a state or the federal government can enforce its own criminal laws, but not another sovereign's criminal laws except by extradition. For example, a state prosecutor can't enforce a federal immigration crime in state court, nor can a state prosecutor file federal or state charges in a federal court. Likewise, a federal prosecutor can't bring federal or state charges in a state court, and a federal prosecutor can't bring state criminal charges (unless adopted by reference as part of federal law) in federal court. Criminal justice in Indian territory which is handled by the federal courts by federal prosecutors in felony cases, are a special case conceptualized either as a ""contract service"" relationship or as evidence that Indian tribes are not fully sovereign. The extraterritorial application of criminal laws is likewise usually considered a question of jurisdiction rather than standing. Sometimes the federal government passes a law incorporating some state criminal laws by reference as federal criminal laws in federally controlled territory, but that is an issue of substantive law, not standing. A handful of states allow private criminal prosecutions for select minor offenses, rather than being exclusively brought by the government (mostly on the East Coast). In those cases, standing is an issue, just as it is in civil cases. Only victims can bring private criminal prosecutions, where they are allowed, and only in cases where they are the victim."
Why don't courts punish time-wasting tactics?,"I haven't reviewed the filings, but I can tell you that it's perfectly routine for lawyers to describe the other side's position as ""plainly without merit,"" with no regard for the actual merits. The lawyer's job is to make his client look good, in court and in public; the existence of this question shows that he's doing a good job at least on the latter half of that equation. But in truth, it's such a generic thing to say that no lawyer who hears it will actually think it means anything. In all likelihood, the filing is like most others, in that it makes a good case on some points and a bad case on others, and the opposing lawyer's job is to argue that all of them are bad. In the rarer case that a filing is actually ""plainly without merit,"" courts can and sometimes do impose penalties under Rule 11, which allows for sanctions against parties and attorneys who make factual assertions that are not supported by reality or arguments that are not supported by the law."
"In a state with the common law definition of theft, can you force a store to take cash by ""pretending"" to steal?","This is a good example of the life of the law being experience and not reason. While there is a logical argument that this isn't theft, in reality, this conduct would universally be considered an open and shut case of shoplifting and anyone who tried this would surely be convicted of a crime with consequences far more severe than creating a tort debt for conversion of the property. Also, you do intend to permanently deprive the store of its property. The fact that you intend to remedy that by paying for it doesn't change that. You aren't borrowing the property with an intent of returning it."
"Pretending to be from the ""Freedom to Breathe Agency"": impersonating an officer?","The clause you highlighted has an ""or"" in front of it: ""..., or in such pretended character..."".  It's only one alternative.  Demanding or obtaining money, etc, is sufficient to violate the statute but not necessary. Looking at the previous clause, it is still a violation if the pretender merely ""acts as such"", which I suppose is what people allege this person is doing.  She can be guilty without having demanded or obtained anything, so the question about whether it's a ""thing of value"" is moot. As to the ""nonexistent agency"" issue: a useful source for information about how federal criminal laws are interpreted and enforced is the Justice Department's Criminal Resource Manual.  (The link may be a past version; they seem to have reorganized their documents and I can't find a version not marked as ""archived"", but I think the information is still valuable.)  18 USC 912 is discussed in sections 1469-1477 of that version.  Section 1474 examines the meaning of the ""acts as such"" element, and includes this note: It is not necessary that the act be one which the pretended officer would have authority to perform if he were in fact the officer he represents himself to be. Lamar v. United States, 240 U.S. 60 (1916); United States v. Hamilton, 276 F.2d at 98. Nor is it necessary that there be in fact such an officer as the defendant pretends to be. Caruso v. United States, 414 F.2d 225, 227 (5th Cir. 1969). Caruso in particular was a case in which the defendant, as part of a scam, claimed to be the Administrator of a Veterans Hospital.  He was convicted, and appealed on the basis that the government had not proved that the office of administrator existed. (Just as in this case, the government certainly could not prove that the Freedom to Breathe Agency existed, since it does not.)  The Fifth Circuit found that his point had ""no merit"" and, citing Brafford v. United States (6 Cir. 1919, 259 F. 511, 513), that it was ""immaterial whether or not there was any government officer or employee with the precise title [the defendant] assumed"". I realize that claiming to be a nonexistent officer is not exactly the same thing as claiming to represent a nonexistent agency, but I would expect that courts would treat it the same."
What offence if any is committed by guessing a combination entry lock on a door?,"None, if the intention is merely trespassing, unlike burglary which requires intent to steal, commit criminal damage, or inflict grevious bodily harm or if the building is a protected site - neither of which isn't evident from the question. Note, for both offences, the actus reus is entry - there is no requirement for any form of ""breaking"" Further to ohwilleke's comment, unless the lock is damaged or destroyed etc, then there is no offence of criminal damage"
How can Edward Snowden be denied a jury trial?,"The trial at issue is a civil trial over the publication of his book Permanent Record and the non-disclosure agreement that he signed connected to his employment, see the DoJ announcement, which also notes that this is separate from a future espionage trial. The remedy sought involves no imprisonment. In the US, the constitutional right to a jury trial applies to criminal cases. See the Arpaio case, where cases involving imprisonment of less than 6 months are not subject to the jury trial requirement. The right to a jury trial in civil cases is much more complicated and fact-specific, see this answer. Not yet in evidence is the question of whether his employment agreement included a waiver of jury trial w.r.t. non-disclosure, but one should assume that the government anticipated the scenario that a person would breach the NDA. ......"
Must the interrogation stop when the right to counsel has been invoked?,"Yes, for the jurisdiction specified in the tag In the United States, questioning must stop as soon as the accused assserts his or her right to counsel.  It's been upheld by subsequent precedent, but the origin is in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 474 (1966): If the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation
must cease until an attorney is present. At that time, the individual
must have an opportunity to confer with the attorney and to have him
present during any subsequent questioning. If the individual cannot
obtain an attorney and he indicates that he wants one before speaking
to police, they must respect his decision to remain silent."
What is the legal basis for terminating contracts with Russian residents?,"In england-and-wales, aside from the contractual issues, this is also a potential breach of the Equality Act 2010, the Human Rights Act 1998, and/or the European Convention on Human Rights (on which the HRA is based and which the UK is still a signatory to i.e. not to be confused with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights). Per section 4 and 9(1)(b) of the Equality Act 2010, being Russian is a protected characteristic. Sections 13(1) and 19(1) define direct discrimination as ""A person (A) discriminates against another (B) if, because of a protected characteristic, A treats B less favourably than A treats or would treat others"" and indirect discrimination as ""A person (A) discriminates against another (B) if A applies to B a provision, criterion or practice which is discriminatory in relation to a relevant protected characteristic of B's."" Being discriminatory isn't by itself sufficient to break the law. For that the discrimination needs to be unlawful. Terminating a service based on nationality is unlawful discrimination pursuant to section 29(2) which provides; ""A service-provider (A) must not, in providing the service, discriminate against a person (B) [...] by terminating the provision of the service to B [...]"". Any clause in a contract which purports to allow the service provider to terminate in a way which constitutes unlawful disrimination is unenforceable pursuant to Section 142(1) which provides; ""A term of a contract is unenforceable against a person in so far as it constitutes, promotes or provides for treatment of that or another person that is of a description prohibited by this Act."". To reinforce this point, section 144(1) provides that you cannot contract out of the Equality Act 2020 (i.e. you cannot agree that the Act won't apply; such a clause is unenforceable). The most relevant exception comes from Section 196 and paragraph 1 of Schedule 23 which has the effect that the service provider doesn't unlawfully discriminate if the terminatation is done in pursuance of legislation or arrangements made or conditions imposed by a government minister. It's also hypothetically possible to find an exception based on national security based on section 192 which provides; ""a person does not contravene this Act only by doing, for the purpose of safeguarding national security, anything it is proportionate to do for that purpose"". It's hard to see how a blanket policy of terminating all Russian customers could be a proportionate response to an issue of national security. I could see this provision being useful if a specific customer was known to be a national security threat and only they were being terminated. What this means in practice is that terminating based on Russian nationality is likely to be unlawful discrimination unless it is done to comply with the law or a government decision. Thus, terminating a contract with Roman Abramovich might be lawful if done in pursuance of government sanctions against him, but blindly terminating all Russian customers is probably unlawful unless sanctions are in force which cover the specific service or sector. Finding a law which permits the discriminatory termination isn't necessarily the end of the story. The HRA is a ""constitutional"" Act which theoretically means that Parliament shouldn't pass any other Act which contravenes the HRA (albeit the principal of Parliamentary sovereignty means that in practice it can; this is because we don't have a separate category of Acts which can sit above other Acts). The HRA has the effect of importing most of the ECHR into domestic law. Article 14 of the ECHR provides (emphasis added): The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention
shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex,
race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national
or social origin, association with a national minority, property,
birth or other status. This means that if Parliament passes an Act which purports to permit discriminatory termination of a contract for a service which falls within scope for any of the Convention rights, the Act will breach the ECHR. An example of this might be terminating a contract for the provision of housing which could be within scope for Article 8 (right to family life and home). The courts have over the years been quite creative in making scenarios fit within the Convention rights, which were drafted in very broad and non-specific terms. The HRA and ECHR also contain exceptions e.g. Article 15 of the ECHR which has the effect of allowing contraventions of Convention rights ""in time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation [...] to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation"". If an Act contravenes the HRA in a way which is ambiguous enough to permit for different possible interpretations, then Section 3 provides that the courts must interpret in the way which is compatible with the ECHR. Failing that, the High Court and upper courts can make a ""declaration of incompatibility"" under Section 4(2). Per Section 4(6), this does not carry any legal force, but in accordance with constitutional principles the government is then supposed to amend the law to be compatible. Ultimately, if a claimant has exhausted all legal remedies within the domestic jurisdiction, they can bring a claim to the European Court of Human Rights. There have been many media articles recently describing all sorts of situations in which Russians are being penalised simply for being Russian. I do suspect that many of these will breach the Equality Act and that we will be seeing many cases being argued and possibly won in the courts. Perhaps more shockingly, the government recently hinted that it may even target law firms which represent Russian clients trying to launch legal challenges, which to me seems a clear breach of Article 6 of the ECHR (right to a fair trial). The correct approach in my view would be for the government to focus on making sure its sanctions are legally watertight rather than trying to prevent them being challenged."
Does copyright law protect a translation of an ancient work from being translated into a third language?,"While the original Greek is public domain, the English translation is a new literary work with its own copyright running for 70 years after the author(s) death(s). The French translation of the English work would require the permission of the author(s). A French translation of the original Greek wouldn't. This assumes that the translation was not simply mechanical; like running it through Google translate. A purely mechanical translation lacks the originality required to create a literary work - an English translation obtained algorithmically is a copy; just like a zip file is a copy."
Can a user sell my software (MIT license) without modification?,"Yes.  The license itself is really just one sentence long, and states explicitly that this is allowed. Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the ""Software""), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software."
Why does the First Amendment apply to states?,"The Fourteenth Amendment generally requires the states to recognize the same individual rights that the Bill of Rights requires Congress to recognize. In Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652 (1925), the Supreme Court recognized that this includes the First Amendment right to free speech: For present purposes, we may and do assume that freedom of speech and of the press which are protected by the First Amendment from abridgment by Congress are among the fundamental personal rights and ""liberties"" protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the States. We do not regard the incidental statement in Prudential Ins. Co. v. Cheek, 259 U. S. 530, 259 U. S. 543, that the Fourteenth Amendment imposes no restrictions on the States concerning freedom of speech, as determinative of this question. There is some debate as to exactly which language in the Fourteenth Amendment makes this happen -- probably the due-process clause, maybe the privileges and immunities clause -- but there isn't any real debate as to the outcome. The executive branch is likewise unable to enforce speech restrictions because all its programs are authorized and funded by Congress. There has been some argument in line with your proposed reading to the contrary, but the courts consistently enforce the First Amendment against the executive branch and even against themselves."
"Is there any legal mechanism for a citizen without resources, to be able to sue the state for infringing his/her constitutional rights?","In the US, there are a number of non-government organizations which take on such cases, such as the ACLU or the Institute for Justice; individual law firms may also take such cases pro bono. There is no automatic right to free representation in case a constitutional issue is alleged, so if IJ doesn't like your case they won't take it. These are private organizations: there is no general government agency that one can call on, other than the Public Defender's office in case you are charged with a crime and can't afford legal defense. (A constitutional issue may arise in a case that a PD might handle, but you can't e.g. call on the public defender to sue the government for infringing your 2nd Amendment rights.) A state attorney general could file suit against the US government over a constitutional issue, as Washington's AG did in the case of the Trump travel executive order, where the underlying issues were constitutional. An individual might inspire a state AG to take on an issue, but the AG would be representing the interests of the state, broadly, and not individual interests."
"What's stopping someone from saying ""I don't remember""?","You can't prove a negative, so they can't be convicted of perjury for lying about whether they remember; Yes, they can.  The government can convict the witness of perjury by proving that they did remember.  This may be difficult, but it's not impossible. Now you may say that we can't ever prove with certainty what a person did or didn't remember.  But the legal standard isn't certainty, it's beyond a reasonable doubt.  So a jury is allowed to draw a reasonable inference about whether they remembered, based on evidence of their outward behavior and other circumstances. As an extreme example, suppose Alice was overheard chatting freely about topic X an hour before the trial, but when asked about topic X on the stand, said she didn't remember.  When presented with evidence of her earlier conversation, a jury could reasonably infer that she was lying about not remembering.  Is it possible that she truly had a memory lapse in the intervening hour?  Sure, anything is possible.  Is it reasonable to believe that she did?  Probably not. The US Department of Justice's Criminal Resource Manual has this to say on the subject: Witnesses who claim not to remember, rather than deny a fact, may be prosecuted for perjury. However, the government must prove both that the witness at one time knew the fact and that the witness must have remembered it at the time he or she testified. United States v. Chen, 933 F.2d 793, 795 (9th Cir. 1991). If the dates of the transaction and testimony are sufficiently close, memory may be inferred. Instances in which the witness remembered other events that occurred at the same time or earlier than the event in question, or mentioned the event either immediately before or after his testimony, would be probative of the witness's memory at the time of the testimony. The two witness rule does not apply to prosecutions based on false memory lapses, and circumstantial evidence is sufficient, since there is no direct evidence possible concerning what the defendant actually believed. Gebhard v. United States, 422 F.2d 281, 287 (9th Cir. 1970). There's a similar issue in all laws that deal with a person's knowledge or intent.  Suppose Alice hits Bob with a stick and he dies.  To convict Alice of murder, it must be proved that by hitting Bob, she intended to kill him.  Can we ever really know what was in her heart?  Maybe not, but if there is evidence that shortly beforehand, she told someone that she was going to kill Bob, it would be a reasonable inference that this was her intention."
"If police come to my house with a warrant for my arrest, can they break in?","It depends on the type of warrant. Failure to pay a fine is not necessarily an arrestable offence.  The Police Scotland Warrants Standard Operating Procedure (710 kB PDF) states: 5.3 Whilst there is no legislative requirement for Officers to physically possess the warrant to force entry / effect arrest, it
  would be considered best practice if a forced entry is anticipated.
  There may be instances where this is not practically possible to
  obtain the warrant in time or it may be geographically challenging to
  do so. Possession of a scanned copy of the warrant would be good
  practice on such occasions, again where the circumstances permit. and 5.5.1 By virtue of Section 135 Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 an apprehension warrant implies authority, where it is necessary
  for its execution, to break open shut and lock fast places. Entry into
  any house or building, therefore, may be affected by any constable in
  order to execute the warrant in accordance with its terms and only as
  a last resort. and 5.6.1 An Extract Conviction/Means Enquiry Warrant (back fine warrant) is issued by the Clerk of Court when an accused person fails
  to pay the fine imposed within the period allowed for payment. This
  extract is a sufficient warrant for the apprehension of the accused,
  but unlike an ordinary warrant of arrest, it does not authorise a
  constable to break open doors in order to affect arrest. Sheriff officers are not police - they are closer to what in England and some parts of the USA would be termed bailiffs, used for civil recovery of debts etc. "
Is buying counterfeit goods illegal?,"If the buyer wanted the watch for purely personal reasons, would they be committing any crime? NO The offences are at s.92 of the Trade Marks Act 1994 and all relate to either selling, or possessing as part of a business, such goods with... a view to gain for himself or another, or with intent to cause loss to another, and without the consent of the proprietor"
Is customer entitled to the same car tested in the test drive or in the ad?,"As described, this may be a form of illegal bait-and-switch advertising, but not breach of contract. The contract states the specific vehicle to be sold, which does not match the test-driven car. If the dealer had listed the better car's VIN in the contract but supplied a different car, that would be breach of contract. Whether it is illegal advertisement depends on the representations and disclaimers made by the dealer. To the extent that the dealer supplied indications that there was a difference between the test model and the purchase model, or to the extent that the customer should have known that the test car had features not found in the specific model that the customer believed he was buying and paying for, the dealer was being non-deceptive. To the extent that the dealer holds that selling model X instead of model Y is an ""honest mistake"" on their part, the dealer was being deceptive (or, was plainly in breach of contract). It's hard to see what ""honest mistake"" the dealer might have made, but perhaps the mistake was ""not being clearer to the customer that they had test-driven a fancier model, not the one that they were actually buying"". The customer's attorney could pursue this matter and either get the better car, or get a better financial deal, but it really hinges on who said / wrote what (and has a more believable story about what was said)."
If I've been prosecuted for a crime by another country can the US prosecute me for the same crime afterwards?,"You can be prosecuted for the crime in the U.S., both at the federal level and at the U.S. state level (or both), completely without regard to what happened in the criminal justice process elsewhere. This is true in all of the scenarios you pose, for any offense, and with or without an extradition treaty (of course, unless the treaty had some anomalous provision to the contrary or deprived the U.S. of jurisdiction by statute rather than constitutionally of this crime). The U.S. Supreme Court determined in Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82 (1985) that the double jeopardy clause of the U.S. Constitution is applied separately with regard to each sovereign involved and that each state and the federal government count as separate sovereigns. In the pertinent part, it states: The dual sovereignty doctrine is founded on the common law conception
of crime as an offense against the sovereignty of the government. When
a defendant in a single act violates the ""peace and dignity"" of two
sovereigns by breaking the laws of each, he has committed two distinct
""offences."" United States v. Lanza, 260 U. S. 377, 260 U. S. 382
(1922). As the Court explained in Moore v. Illinois, 14 How. 13, 55 U.
S. 19 (1852), ""[a]n offence, in its legal signification, means the
transgression of a law."" Consequently, when the same act transgresses
the laws of two sovereigns, ""it cannot be truly averred that the offender has been twice punished for the same offence, but only that by one act he has committed two offences, for each of which he is justly punishable.""
Id. at 55 U. S. 20. In practice, the U.S. Justice Department and most state and local prosecutors are disinclined to prosecute a crime that has already been handled by another jurisdiction and often have official, but non-binding, policies to that effect. In part, this is because an acquittal in one jurisdiction makes it likely that it is a weak case, while a conviction in one jurisdiction often constitutes sufficient punishment. There could be an issue under the 8th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (cruel and unusual punishment) over whether a punishment imposed in a U.S. conviction for a crime needs to consider the already severe punishment imposed in another jurisdiction for the same crime in order to prevent the cumulative punishment from being cruel and unusual. But, I am not aware of authoritative case law that resolves that constitutional question. Certainly, evidence of a prior punishment for the same offense could be presented at a sentencing hearing following a conviction in mitigation of the punishment that should be imposed. Indeed, in some states time served pursuant to a conviction for the same crime in another jurisdiction might statutorily count as ""time served"" for which the defendant is legally entitled to credit at sentencing."
What is the penalty for a bad-acting juror?,"united-states This will vary somewhat by jurisdiction. But in  most US states: If the  authorities can trace these stories back to Bob (and they will put some effort into tracing them) Bob may well be found guilty of criminal contempt of court, fined, and sentenced to a short period in jail. He may also lose the right to be on a jury in future. If this comes out, Bob could be convicted of soliciting a bribe, and if the scheme went forward, of both accepting a bribe, and jury tampering (or either, depending on the evidence). These are serious crimes, and Bob might well spend several years in prison. It is not unlawful to be a nutcase. The judge could order Bob removed from the jury if his disruptions were serious enough. If Bob actually violated th explicit instructions issued by the judge, he might be convicted of contempt, as in case 1, but this is rather less likely. A comment adds the scenario: This is an instance of ""jury nullification"".   Bob is within his legal rights, and cannot be punished, nor removed from the jury. Bob can try to convince the other jurors that the law is unjust, or that the possible penalties are too severe for what the accused did, or of some other reason not to convict. If they agree, and acquit the accused, the acquittal stands, however contrary to the letter of the law. If they do not agree, there is a mistrial because of a hung jury. The prosecution may (but need not) retry the accused."
If a request for personal data is made under the GDPR rights but the requestor refuses to give ID for verification what should the company do?,"If the data controller has “reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request”, then “the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject” (Art 12(6) GDPR). Until the data subject provides this information, the request is paused. But what are reasonable doubts, and what additional information can the controller request? The GDPR itself provides no clear guidelines, though general principles apply – the additional information must be necessary, adequate, and proportionate for the identity conformation purpose. The controller's obligation to comply with access requests must be balanced with the controller's obligation to ensure the security of data by rejecting invalid requests. Just accepting any request without any verification would also be a breach of the GDPR. For example: (These examples were made up by me and are not official, but read on.) The EDPB has issued draft guidelines on the right of access 01/2022, which also discuss the issue of additional information for identity verification in sections 3.2 and 3.3. In particular, paragraphs 73-78 talk about IDs: 73. It should be emphasised that using a copy of an identity document as a part of the authentication process creates a risk for the security of personal data and may lead to unauthorised or unlawful processing, and as such it should be considered inappropriate, unless it is strictly necessary, suitable, and in line with national law. […] it is also important to note that identification by means of an identity card does not necessarily help in the online context (e.g. with the use of pseudonyms) […]. 75. In any case, information on the ID that is not necessary for confirming the identity of the data subject, […] may be blackened or hidden by the data subject before submitting it to the controller, except where
national legislation requires a full unredacted copy of the identity card (see para. 77 below). […] 76. […] Example: The user Ms. Y has created an account in the online store, providing her e-mail and username. Subsequently, the account owner asks the controller for information whether it processes their personal data, and if so, asks for access to them within the scope indicated in Art. 15. The controller requests the ID of the person making request to confirm her identity. The controller's action in this case is disproportionate and leads to unnecessary data collection. […] Example: A bank customer, Mr. Y,, plans to get a consumer credit. For this purpose, Mr. Y goes to a bank branch to obtain information, including his personal data, necessary for the assessment of his creditworthiness. To verify the data subject’s identity, the consultant asks for notarised certification of his identity to be able to provide him with the required information. The controller should not require notarised confirmation of identity, unless it is strictly necessary, suitable and in line with the national law […]. Such practice exposes the requesting persons to additional costs and imposes an excessive burden on the data subjects, hampering the exercise of their right of access. 77. Without prejudice to the above general principles, under certain circumstances, verification on the basis of an ID may be a justified and proportionate measure, for example for entities processing special categories of personal data or undertaking data processing which may pose a risk for data subject (e.g. medical or health information). However, at the same time, it should be borne in mind that certain national provisions provide for restrictions on the processing of data contained in public documents,
including documents confirming the identity of a person (also on the basis of Art. 87 GDPR). Restrictions on the processing of data from these documents may relate in particular to the scanning or photocopying of ID cards or processing of official personal identification numbers. To summarize: controllers can request IDs only in comparatively niche scenarios, and must then take additional safeguards to protect the sensitive document (e.g. instructing the data subject to redact parts of the ID, not making copies, and immediately deleting the ID after successful verification). A lot here comes down to national laws, which may explicitly require or forbid use of the ID in this context. The EDPB guidelines are not binding or normative, especially since this guidance is still in the public consultation phase. However, the guidelines present an overall consensus of the national data protection authorities in the EU, and the guidelines are regularly cited by courts. In practice, many controllers do ask for disproportionate amounts of data. Sometimes this seems to be an attempt to discourage data subject requests, which would clearly be non-compliant. In some cases, this is due to a narrow interpretation of “reasonable doubts” in which they try to eliminate any doubt about the identity. If the data subject and data controller cannot agree on a suitable identity verification process, then the data subject can: It is worth noting that the data controller is responsible for being able to demonstrate compliance (Art 5(2) accountability principle), such as demonstrating the apparent reasonable doubts to a supervisory authority or to a court. When the controller requests ID, the controller has the burden of proof to show that this is compliant."
What happens if the US Supreme Court ties 4-4?,"In the case of a 4-4 tie, the decision from the lower court is left as-is, and the opinion sets no precedent that would bind other circuits. The opinions in tied cases are generally very short, simply stating that the court was equally divided. For example, in Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Omega, S. A. 
562 U.S. ___ (2010), Justice Kagan recused herself due to prior involvement with the case when she was with the Justice Department. The court split 4-4. This was the entirety of the per curiam opinion: Per Curiam. The judgment is affirmed by an equally divided Court. Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. In another example, Reagan v. Abourezk, 484 U.S. 1 (1987), the court  tied 3-3 (quorum is six). There was a vacancy due to the retirement of Justice Powell; Justices Blackmun and Scalia recused themselves. Edward A. Hartnett, in Ties in the Supreme Court of the United States, gives a historical account of this practice. This is a practice established by the court itself, not by direction of Congress, but Congress has ""presupposed the existence of the rule of affirmance by an equally divided court"". Hartnett points to 28 U.S. Code § 2109. That section relates to quorum, but notes that if the court fails to achieve quorum: [...] the court shall enter its order affirming the judgment of the court from which the case was brought for review with the same effect as upon affirmance by an equally divided court. The situation is not so clear for Original Jurisdiction Deadlocks. In these cases, there is no lower court ruling to affirm. There have been only two original jurisdiction deadlocks. Michael Coenen summarizes: First, in the nineteenth century case of Virginia v. West Virginia,
   Chief Justice Chase announced that the Justices were “equally divided on the demurrer, and equally divided also upon the order which should be made in consequence of that division.” As a result, the matter stood unresolved for nearly three years. Second, in the twentieth-century disbarment action of In re Isserman, the Court split evenly on the question of disbarment but ordered disbarment anyway. One year later, the Court changed its mind and overruled its prior decision. The court has a few internal things they can do to avoid ties. They could delay issuing an opinion on a case and ask for re-argument by the parties in front of the eventual nine-justice court. They could revisit the case in conference and get votes to shift around based on a more narrow or procedural ruling. In both of these situations, we wouldn't necessarily know that there was an internal deadlock."
Why is Star Wars a copyright issue but a MLB team is not? [duplicate],"From the mention of a MLB shirt, I am going to assume the OP is located in the united-states. Anything with a modicum of creative input is by default copyrighted. This includes both film shots from movies and logos of sports organizations. ""Modicum of creative input"" is known as the threshold of originality. That legal doctrine is in force in the US, but not in other jurisdictions - for instance, the UK uses ""sweat of the brow"" where creativity is not needed to obtain copyright protection. A still shot from a film set almost surely passes the threshold of originality. However, some logos do not. For instance, the Pittsburgh Pirates logo is a two-dimensional letter P - somewhat stylized, but not that much. It is arguably below the threshold of copyright protection. On the other hand, the Red Socks logos (which is, well, two red socks) is almost surely copyrighted. Let us assume that the logo or imagery present on the OP's photo shirt was indeed copyrighted. Does that make the photo a copyright violation? It might be the case that having the artwork on the shirt as an incidental part of the photograph makes it OK. In the US, such incidental use could be covered by fair use, but as always, it’s a delicate balancing act. A professional photograph taken for political advertisement is going to be held to a higher standard than a blurry photo from your aunt’s Facebook gallery. Dmitry Grigoryev says in comments that walking around with a Star Wars shirt could be construed as distributing (via public display) a copyrighted work. However, ""putting it on and walking around"" is an essential function of a shirt. Absent terms to the contrary, whoever sells a shirt with a copyrighted design grants an implied license to the shirt-wearer to move about with that shirt. [EDIT: see Mayken’s comment, that’s a statutory exception to copyright.] The scope of such implied licenses can be unclear, though, and it could arguably not extend to promotional photographs for political advertisements. Note a recent case in Germany (link to judgement, in German) where it was held that a hotel posting online pictures of its rooms, including a wallpaper design, violated the copyright of the designer. I am not familiar enough with German copyright law to determine if an appeal of that lower-court decision would have any chance of success, but I think that ruling is reasonable within the general principles of EU copyright law. (Whether it is morally acceptable is of course another thing entirely.) It is also possible that the photographer or another PR staff member would rather have the politician associated with baseball than with Star Wars for image reasons, and copyright is only a pretext for that. Or that they (mistakenly) thought that the baseball shirt design was not copyrighted."
Am I obligated to decrypt lots of data for GDPR requests?,"It is the data controller's responsibility to respond to data subject requests. If you provide a B2B service, you are most likely a data processor who only acts on the controller's behalf, on the controller's explicit instruction. This will depend on your contract with the controllers, your customers (see Art 28). Typically a processor would merely forward any data subject requests to the controller. Only if you are contractually obligated to serve data subject requests would it be possible for you to respond directly. If a processor were to fulfil a data subject request on their own initiative, that would arguably be a GDPR violation. However, the processor has to assist their controller with compliance per Art 28(3)(e), e.g. by implementing an admin interface through which the controller can service GDPR requests. The core issue here is that controllers and processors have slightly different obligations in order to be GDPR compliant. Controllers owe compliance to the data subjects, but processors only act on the controller's behalf and owe compliance to their controllers – they have no direct relationship with data subjects. Assuming you were a controller, then yes, I would assume you would have to decrypt any data that you are able to decrypt in order to fulfil a data subject request. Access requests can only be denied if: A request is not automatically excessive just because it will require substantial CPU time, this exception is more often triggered when data subjects request the same data very frequently (e.g. every week). You are not required to provide or search data that you don't have access to (e.g. E2E encrypted data). Your use of per-field encryption is a very strong security measure (depending on how keys are managed). But GDPR is not about achieving maximum technical data protection, but merely requires appropriate safety measures (see GDPR Chapter 4, especially Art 32). Asymmetric encryption of small fields within a database is unlikely to be appropriate, taking into account the cost of processing and the data subject's ability to exercise their rights. A different security measure to ensure that every business only sees the correct data would be through testing and code review of your SQL queries, and full disk encryption of the server storing the database. In practice, asymmetric encryption is most often just used to encrypt a symmetric key, which is then used for the actual data. But which measures are appropriate also depends on the risk to data subjects – your approach could make sense for very sensitive data. Art 14 does not play a role here. It is about transparency of processing: that you need to (a) notify the data subject that you're processing their data, if feasible, and that you (b) provide information about this processing, usually in form of a privacy policy. Art 14 is the pendant to Art 13, which applies when data is obtained directly from the data subject. The Art 15 right to access and the Art 20 right to data portability are distinct from the right to be informed. In any case, it is the controller's responsibility to fulfil these rights."
A car catches fire in a carpark. The resulting fire spreads destroying the entire carpark. Who is liable?,"In General The insurer is never primarily liable for anything. Someone who may or may not have insurance is responsible. A person harmed can't sue somebody else's insurance company (except in the rare case where the insurance company's insured is responsible but dies before the lawsuit is filed and their probate estate is insolvent or the claim is barred for some reason like a deadline to file claims in the probate estate, vis-a-vis the probate estate). A party who is legally negligent, reckless, or intentionally at fault (or a party that made a defective product when the defect caused the fire) is liable for the harm foreseeably caused by the fire. In theory, the car park could have a contract with people who use it that guarantees to reimburse owners of cars parked there for any damage to their vehicles, regardless of fault, but the commercial reality is that this is never actually done. Car park operators routinely disclaim any liability for harm to the vehicles in the car park to the full extent allowed by law. If a person who is potentially responsible has (or multiple persons who are potentially legally responsible have) liability insurance, and that person or those persons did not intentionally cause the fire, then their insurance companies are responsible for paying for the potentially responsible person's lawyer and for the responsible person's liability, up to the amount of the policy limits on that liability insurance policy. Once the policy limits of the insurance, if any, are exhausted, the damages are a debt of the legally responsible person. Liability insurance companies are not responsible for harms intentionally caused by their insureds, which is usually also a crime committed by their insureds. In the case in the linked news report, no intentional wrongdoing was suspected. The facts of the question provide no insight into the core question of whether anyone did something that made them legally at fault, or whether the harm caused by the wrongful act making them at fault was a foreseeably caused of the harm. This is the primary thing one needs to know who is responsible for the damages. If no one is legally at fault (e.g., if a meteor fell from the sky and caused the fire in a way that no reasonable precaution could have prevented), then the owners of the cars and of the structure, respectively, must deal with the harm to their own property. If the property owners have insured their property, their insurance policies will cover the damages suffered up to the extent of the policy limits of that property insurance policy. Also, generally speaking, property insurance on the cars (so called ""comprehensive"" as opposed to ""liability only"" car insurance policies), will pay for the damages to the insured vehicle immediately, and then will recover what they had to pay to the insured on the insured's claim in what is called a ""subrogation"" lawsuit against the party legally responsible for the incident, if any, if the insurance company decides that it makes economic sense to do so (which it might if it insured multiple vehicles upon which it had to pay claims in the same fire, which in all likelihood, it did). At this very general, ""forest level"" of the analysis, it doesn't matter much which place's law apply to the dispute. All common law and civil law countries in the world would be the same to this extent. But the question of who would have legal responsibility and to what extent would depend upon whose law applied. As a comment to the question by user71659 notes, there are far more people who could be potentially legally responsible than just the car park owner and the car owners in question, such as: In the linked example case, the article suggested that the car park didn't have a sprinkler system installed that might have limited the extent of the damages caused, especially to vehicles other than the original vehicle that caught fire. If the car park did have any legal responsibility, the mostly likely theory to impose it would be that it was legally negligent in failing to install a sprinkler system to prevent a fire from spreading. The linked article is thin on details, however, of what caused the initial fire or why it spread so greatly. What Differs Between Legal Systems? In general, civil law countries (i.e. countries with legal systems modeled on those of continental Europe) tend to impose liability more readily, but are stingier in the amount of damages awarded for personal injuries arising from an incident like this one. In general, common law countries (i.e. countries with legal systems modeled on those of England) tend to impose liability somewhat less often in close cases, but, particularly in the U.S., are more generous in the amount of damages awarded if there are personal injuries and there is not just property damage. Another important question, which would vary from one legal jurisdiction to another, is the extent to which the car park may (and actually has by the actions it has taken) waive liability for damage to the cars that might arise as an owner of the premises or from the ""bailment"" (i.e. from the car owner's entrustment of the car to the custody and possession of the car park). In some places, this liability isn't signifiant in the first place or is easily waived. In other places, an operator of a car park has heightened responsibility compared to a random stranger that is not easily waived. Still, even then, the car park would almost never have legal responsibility without some kind of wrongful conduct or blameworthy negligence on its part. Another important issue in the linked case in which it appears that the car park was owned by a governmental airport authority or municipality of some kind, rather than a private non-governmental property owner, is the extent to which the status of the car park as a government entity would limit its liability, limit the damages that can be awarded against it if it is at fault, or would impose procedural requirements upon someone trying to seek damages from the owner of the car park. The way this issue is handled differs greatly from one jurisdiction to another (with common law countries, generally speaking, usually providing more limitations on governmental liability than civil law countries do). Where there is only property damage, the amount of damages awarded is similar between the two main kinds of legal systems, although there may be nuanced details between individual countries or sub-national jurisdictions within countries on fine points like the interest rate that applies to judgments that aren't immediately paid in full. The other big difference between legal jurisdictions when it comes to a remedy, is that in this fact pattern, in the U.S., the persons bringing lawsuits would not usually be entitled to their attorney fees if they prevailed, while their attorney fees would be recoverable if they prevailed, at least to some extent, in most non-U.S. legal systems in both civil law and common law legal systems."
Is there a law in the UK that makes possession of specific publications illegal?,"""Is there really any law that makes it illegal to own copies of a publication?"" I couldn't find exact confirmation of which law Rahman was prosecuted under, but an article from 2012 describes it as ""possessing an article for a terrorist purpose"". A BBC article from 2007 uses the same phrase, with regard to ""Section 57 of the Terrorism Act"", which appears to refer to the Terrorism Act 2000: 57 Possession for terrorist purposes. (1)A person commits an offence if he possesses an article in
  circumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that his
  possession is for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation
  or instigation of an act of terrorism. (2)It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under this
  section to prove that his possession of the article was not for a
  purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of
  an act of terrorism. (3)In proceedings for an offence under this section, if it is proved
  that an article— (a)was on any premises at the same time as the accused, or (b)was on premises of which the accused was the occupier or which he
  habitually used otherwise than as a member of the public, the court may assume that the accused possessed the article, unless he
  proves that he did not know of its presence on the premises or that he
  had no control over it. (4)A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable— (a)on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not
  exceeding 15 years,* to a fine or to both, or (b)on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six
  months, to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum or to both. *Interestingly, the maximum term of imprisonment appears to have originally been 10 years, but was increased in 2006. That law's not specific to publications, but in an attempt to answer your question more fully there does seem to be at least one law that ""makes it illegal to own copies of a publication"": the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, for example, renders possession of 'extreme pornography' illegal, and the definitions do not require (to reference your footnote) that the materials ""imply an illegal act took place"". Rather, the materials are illegal because (to quote a government consultation, via the Wikipedia page linked above) such material may encourage or reinforce interest in violent and aberrant sexual activity to the detriment of society as a whole That may or may not bother you from a freedom of speech point of view, but it leads me nicely onto a discussion of the underlying ethics/morality/rights debate that you impled in your question: ""We punish thoughtcrime, these days?"" As far as I understand, Rahman was in physical possession of the magazine. So no – not ""thoughtcrime"". Merely thinking about the magazine – or believing the views expressed in its contents – would not, of itself, be illegal. Indeed, as the article points out in its description of main case under discussion (i.e. the ""Three Musketeers"" case, not Rahman's prior conviction), the prosecution described as the defendants’ “hateful beliefs” – but the judge, Mr Justice Globe, told them they could not convict based on “mindset evidence” alone. However, like hate speech (speech, not thought), or conspiracy to commit a crime (which is what the men in the Three Musketeers case were being charged with), saying (or writing) certain things is, quite reasonably, illegal, if the intent of those words is incitement to commit a crime. Restrictions on free speech exist everywhere, and any (political) debate around it generally centres less on an absolute right to free speech, and more on where the line should be drawn. Even in the US – which tends to draw the line at the permissive end of the spectrum – speech intended solely to cause damage is not immune from reproach. The classic example is ""[falsely] shouting fire in a crowded theater"": The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic. [...] The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger  Similarly, the publication of a magazine, the sole purpose of which is to (inspire or facilitate) damage, can be illegal. It would then seem  reasonable for supplying that magazine to others to be illegal. Possession with a clear intent to supply (like with drugs) would also, reasonably, be illegal. And if drug possession, with no intent to supply, can be illegal, then why not possession of illegal material, even if there's no intent to supply? I make no attempt here to justify (nor even to outline fully) the exact details of English law when it comes to these matters; however, there's an important distinction between freedom of speech (with regard to which nearly everyone accepts some restriction or regulation) and freedom of thought or conscience. To the best of my knowledge, there's no law (in Britain) that restricts either of those."
"Is lying to get ""gardening leave"" fraud?","Yes, that would be fraud. From the Fraud Act 2006: 2: Fraud by false representation 1) A person is in breach of this section if he— (a) dishonestly makes a false representation, and (b) intends, by making the representation— (i) to make a gain for himself [...] By saying that you had got a position with a competitor you would be dishonestly (i.e. you knew it was a lie) making a false representation. Your purpose was to obtain gardening leave, which is a gain for yourself."
What is the state of intellectual property when the owner goes bankrupt?,"A bankrupt company's assets are transferred to its creditors.  This includes intangible assets such as trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property. Whoever ends up with the rights to the game can continue to market and distribute it, or use legal means to prevent others from doing so."
Bright-line or Litmus Test for Sedition?,"There are several treason and sedition crimes in federal law all of which are defined by statute. Treason offenses pertain to acts in furtherance of a foreign country or sometimes more specifically a foreign country with which the United States is at war (which is the legal definition of an ""enemy""). These include Sections 2381, 2382, some of the subsections of 2386, 2388, 2389 and 2390. They are: 18 USC § 2381. Treason (""Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000;  and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States."") 18 USC § 2382. Misprision of treason (i.e. failure to report knowledge of someone else's treason to an appropriate government official). 18 USC § 2386. Registration of certain organizations (the guts of this offense's treason component are found in part B(1) which provides that: ""The following organizations shall be required to register with the Attorney General: Every organization subject to foreign control which engages in political activity; . . . [and] Every organization subject to foreign control which engages in civilian military activity"") 18 USC § 2388. Activities affecting armed forces during war 18 USC § 2389. Recruiting for service against United States 18 USC § 2390. Enlistment to serve against United States None of these are implicated by the question. Sedition offenses pertain to acts to overthrow or interfere with the government that do not have a clear nexus with a foreign country.These include Sections 2383, 2384, 2385, some of the subsections of 2386, and 2387. They are: 18 USC § 2383. Rebellion or insurrection (see below) 18 USC § 2384. Seditious conspiracy (see below) 18 USC § 2385. Advocating overthrow of Government Whoever knowingly or willfully advocates, abets, advises, or teaches
the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or
destroying the government of the United States or the government of
any State, Territory, District or Possession thereof, or the
government of any political subdivision therein, by force or violence,
or by the assassination of any officer of any such government;  or Whoever, with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any such
government, prints, publishes, edits, issues, circulates, sells,
distributes, or publicly displays any written or printed matter
advocating, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability,
or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the
United States by force or violence, or attempts to do so;  or Whoever organizes or helps or attempts to organize any society, group,
or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow
or destruction of any such government by force or violence;  or
becomes or is a member of, or affiliates with, any such society,
group, or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof-- Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty
years, or both, and shall be ineligible for employment by the United
States or any department or agency thereof, for the five years next
following his conviction. If two or more persons conspire to commit any offense named in this
section, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more
than twenty years, or both, and shall be ineligible for employment by
the United States or any department or agency thereof, for the five
years next following his conviction. As used in this section, the terms “organizes” and “organize”, with
respect to any society, group, or assembly of persons, include the
recruiting of new members, the forming of new units, and the
regrouping or expansion of existing clubs, classes, and other units of
such society, group, or assembly of persons. 18 USC § 2386. Registration of certain organizations (the guts of this offense are found in part B(1) which provides that: ""The following organizations shall be required to register with the Attorney General: . . . . Every organization which engages both in civilian military activity and in political activity; . . .  and Every organization, the purpose or aim of which, or one of the purposes or aims of which, is the establishment, control, conduct, seizure, or overthrow of a government or subdivision thereof by the use of force, violence, military measures, or threats of any one or more of the foregoing."") 18 USC § 2387. Activities affecting armed forces generally (in the pertinent part: ""Whoever, with intent to interfere with, impair, or influence the loyalty, morale, or discipline of the military or naval forces of the United States: (1)  advises, counsels, urges, or in any manner causes or attempts to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty by any member of the military or naval forces of the United States;  or (2)  distributes or attempts to distribute any written or printed matter which advises, counsels, or urges insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty by any member of the military or naval forces of the United States-- Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both, and shall be ineligible for employment by the United States or any department or agency thereof, for the five years next following his conviction."") But the sedition offenses potentially pertinent to the question are Sections 2383 and 2384. They are as follows (emphasis added) 18 USC § 2383. Rebellion or insurrection Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or
insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws
thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this
title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both;  and shall be
incapable of holding any office under the United States. And also (line breaks and line numbers inserted editorially for ease of reading and discussion purposes): 18 USC §2384—Seditious Conspiracy (1) If two or more persons (2) in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States, (3) conspire (4) to overthrow, put down,  or to destroy by force the Government of the
United States, or to levy war against them, (5) or to oppose by force the authority thereof, (6) or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of
the United States, (7) or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United
States contrary to the authority thereof, (8) they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than
twenty years, or both. Lines (1), (2) and (3) are elements of the offense which must be established beyond a reasonable doubt by the prosecution in a criminal trial. In addition one of the four elements (4), (5), (6) or (7) must be established beyond a reasonable doubt by the prosecution in a criminal trial. Elements (6) and (7) are particularly relevant to the question here. The meaning of the words used in those elements is further defined in case law interpreting the statute in connection with the preparation of a jury instruction applying this statute to the facts presented at trial in a case (as well as lots of more general instructions on how a jury makes factual determinations). Only elements of the offense upon which some evidence has been presented by the prosecution are included in jury instructions. But the definitions in a jury instruction which is operationally the law in any particular case doesn't get a whole lot more specific than the statutory language quoted above. Ultimately, any vagueness in that language has to be resolved unanimously by the jury (or by a judge in a trial to the court). If these elements are established, the maximum punishment of (8) is authorized. The discretion of the sentencing judge to impose a sentence is not nearly as unfettered as it appears due to general provisions of Title 18 of the United States Code related to the exercise of sentencing discretion by a judge which incorporate by reference the federal sentencing guidelines adopted by an appointed federal government commission. These guidelines are advisory, rather than mandatory, but still have real effect. A judge has to calculated the guideline sentence, then articulate based upon judicial findings of fact any reason for deviating from the guideline sentencing range, and if this process is not followed, or if the findings of fact made aren't supported by the trial court record or don't support the conclusion reached, the sentence can be reversed for an abuse of discretion when the guideline sentence isn't followed, even if the maximum sentence authorized by this statute is not exceeded."
"In the USA, do parents have the right to control their children's possessions?","The fundamental question is whether children can own property: they clearly can. See Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure (I improved the link so it can be more easily read). As a general rule any property acquired by the child in any way except
  by its own labor or services belongs to the child, and not to the
  parent McClosky v. Cyphert, 3 Casey (27 Pa.) 220 The right of an infant to be the owner of property is as clear and as
  well protected as that of a person who has arrived at full age. When
  anything is given to an infant to be held by him in his own right, he
  has the title to it, and the parent, guardian or master has in law no
  more right to take it (for any purpose beyond safekeeping) than a
  stranger. Wheeler v. R. Co., 31 Kan. 640, 3 P. 297, 300: As a matter of law a minor may own property the same as any other
  person. He may obtain it by inheritance, by gift, or by purchase; and
  there is nothing in the law that would prevent even a father from
  giving property to his minor child. A father may also so emancipate
  his minor child as to entitle him to receive his own wages. It is
  probably true that where a minor child lives with his father, and is
  supported by him, all things given to the child in the way of support,
  such as clothing, for instance, would still belong to the father and
  not to the child. But things given by the father to the child, not in
  the way of support, but with the understanding that they should become
  the property of the child, would, undoubtedly, become the property of
  the child. Banks v. Conant, 14 Allen 497, the father has no title to the property of the child, nor is the capacity or
  right of the latter to take property or receive money by grant, gift
  or otherwise, except as a compensation for services, in any degree
  qualified or limited during minority. Whatever therefore an infant
  acquires which does not come to him as a compensation for services
  rendered, belongs absolutely to him, and his father cannot interpose
  any claim to it, either as against the child, or as against third
  persons who claim title or possession from or under the infant. However, a parent does have the right to prevent their child from using or acquiring a computer, car (also prohibited statutorily in Washington), television, cell phone; they can also prevent a child from spending their savings. Parents do retain their property right in things that they give to their children for general support and maintenance, such as a pair of shoes, or books.  There can also be specific statutes such as the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (Washington version) which partially recognize this right, making it easy for a person to transfer property to a minor, where the property is in the care of a custodian, but not owned by the custodian."
In the US are you allowed to impose restriction on the government when they want to enter your house without a warrant?,"They must comply with your restrictions, via the principle that consent can be withdrawn. One relevant Supreme Court case is Walter v. US 447 US 649, which declares that When  an  official search  is properly  authorized—whether  by
consent  or  by  the  issuance of  a  valid  warrant—the  scope  of
the  search  is  limited  by  the terms of its authorization Likewise in Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U.S. 248, A suspect may, of course, delimit as he chooses the scope of the
search to which he consents. In US v. Williams, No. 16-3547, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 21304 (3d Cir.), the court elaborated that a consensual search satisfies  the  mandates  of  the  Constitution
only  if  conducted within the boundaries of the consent given.  This
recognition establishes  that  it  is  the subject  of  a  consensual
search  who decides the terms of the search. and furthermore, That a   party   may terminate a   search   by withdrawing his
consent is a corollary of the recognition that the  subject  of  a
consensual  search  determines  the  parameters of that search. Bear in mind that you have to be crystal clear on any limits on the scope of a search. If this is more of a business call (the electrical inspector) and not a search, they don't have any special powers to enter your house. If the inspector enters your basement study without permission, that is trespassing, but you can't sue him because of that unless there was actual damage done. You can complain to his superior."
