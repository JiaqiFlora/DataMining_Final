Why did Hitler attack the Soviet Union when he was still busy fighting the United Kingdom?,"I'm not sure there is any direct evidence that it was strategically a bad idea. Strategically it made sense to attack the Soviet Union while they were weak and unprepared for war. Hitler knew that as he made progress on the Western front that Stalin grew more and more nervous every day about the growing power of Nazi Germany. What must be remembered is that Hitler almost won the war with the Soviet Union.  Hitler felt the army was not moving fast enough towards Moscow. If Hitler's commanders had done what Hitler had wanted, which was rush as fast to Moscow as possible, then it is possible the Soviet Union would have fallen without time to prepare a massive infantry army. Germany's army was also not prepared for fighting in cold weather. It was not expected that the Soviet Union was even close to capable of fighting back. The Soviet Union's army was in shambles throughout the entire war. It was ill-equipped and all it had to offer was quantity over quality. The combination of the cold, unexpected resistance and the amount of time it was taking to get to Moscow because of cold weather and resistance was setting back Germany. The whole strategy was to get in and occupy Moscow and take the leadership. It took about six months for the Germans to get nearly to the gates of Moscow, when the tide finally started to turn at Stalingrad. Hitler most importantly underestimated the sheer will of the the country to defend itself no matter how much the cost in blood. The Soviet Union lost a whopping 13.5% of its population to the war. So in short, strategically a lot of it made sense at the time. The operation was blundered because the blitzkrieg was not fast enough, the underestimation of the kind of force the Soviet Union could pull together and an underestimation of the cold winter. The plan was also delayed because of setbacks in the Balkans and helping the Italians out where they had failed. It's hard to find actual strategic proof of what was going on through Hitler's mind and his advisors to take on this risky operation. We do know however that these had been a part of Hitler's plans for years. In my opinion, it was probably thought at the time the odds were in Nazi Germany's favor. In all reality, the Germans had a pretty good chance of winning the war within six months, perhaps if just a few variables had changed they might have actually pulled it off. If they could have gotten there a month earlier, they probably would have won. Also Great Britain was absolutely in no position to put up any kind of resistance except for the occasional bombing run, which was producing much larger losses than they could keep up with equipment wise. Also Stalin and Hitler were not real allies, they only had a non-aggression pact, and both were not exactly known to be trustworthy. Stalin was also at many times gullible and Hitler took advantage of this diplomatically. Even when warned that Germany was going to invade, Stalin dismissed his advisers.   Taking in all these factors, the thought probably never occurred to Hitler and his officers that the Soviet Union would ever be able to launch any kind of counter attack. It took quite some time and the United States to intervene for the Soviet Union to really begin its successful counter-offensive. Edit:
I just today found some great and rare recordings of Hitler actually talking about his exact thoughts on the invasion of the Soviet Union.  I can think of no better source of information to answer this subjective question other than the words of the man himself.  This recording is a truly incredible piece of historical record. Hitler Speaking Normally (YouTube): The Hitler-Mannerheim conversation Edit 2 Here is a link to an English translation transcript of that recorded conversation between Adolf Hitler and President Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim of Finland. Transcript of the Hitler - Mannerheim Conversation In this translation Hitler describes his absolute disbelief of how well armed the Soviet Union was at the beginning of the war.  Hitler describes how German tanks were not well equipped for winter fighting.  He also describes what he calls the weakness of Italy, where the Germans helped them in North Africa and in Greece and Albania. Directly quoting Hitler on his fear of an early war with Russia and the loss of valuable petroleum wells in Romania. This all naturally was inevitable, you see. I had a conversation with
  Molotov [Soviet Minister] at that time, and it was absolutely certain
  that Molotov departed with the decision to begin a war, and I
  dismissed the decision to begin a war, and I dismissed him with the
  decision to - impossible, to forestall him. There was - this was the
  only - because the demands that man brought up were clearly aimed to
  rule, Europe in the end. (Practically whispering here.) Then I have
  him - not publicly...(fades out). Already in the fall of 1940 we continuously faced the question, uh:
  shall we, consider a break up [in relations with the USSR]? At that
  time, I advised the Finnish government, to - negotiate and, to gain
  time and, to act dilatory in this matter - because I always feared -
  that Russia suddenly would attack Romania in the late fall - and
  occupy the petroleum wells, and we would have not been ready in the
  late fall of 1940. If Russia indeed had taken Romanian petroleum
  wells, than Germany would have been lost. It would have required -
  just 60 Russian divisions to handle that matter. In Romania we had of course - at that time - no major units. The
  Romanian government had turned to us only recently - and what we did
  have there was laughable. They only had to occupy the petroleum wells.
  Of course, with our weapons I could not start a, war in September or
  October. That was out of the question. Naturally, the transfer to the
  east wasn't that far advanced yet. Of course, the units first had to
  reconsolidate in the west. First the armaments had to be taken care of
  because we too had - yes, we also had losses in our campaign in the
  west. It would have been impossible to attack - before the spring of
  19, 41. And if the Russians at that time - in the fall of 1940 - had
  occupied Romania - taken the petroleum wells, then we would have been,
  helpless in 1941. -Adolf Hitler Another Voice In Background: Without petroleum..."
When did people decide that all caps means the writer is shouting?,"The tradition of all caps denoting shouting arose from typesetting of printed publications. The 6 September 1958 Bookseller: The Organ of the Book Trade says: It [a 16 page list of books] picks out titles in red, and speaks moderately with large-size upper and lower-case letters rather than shouting with all caps. The effect is pleasing to anybody in a contemplative mood. And more than a century before that, in ""The Dutchman Who Had the  Small Pox"" in the 17 April 1856 Yorkville [South Carolina] Enquirer and many other newspapers: This time he shouted it out in capital letters Likewise, ""The Sore Grievance of John Wellspanked"" in 6 May 1871 The Shamrock says: ""TWELVE shillings and SEVEN pence?"" roared my aunt in the biggest capital letters Similarly, ""Imaginary London"" in the June 1873 Belgravia says: '...Here, cab, cab, CAB!' The last monosyllable was a yell to which only capital letters can give due impression Even more clearly, the 1880 The Standard speaker and elocutionist has a section of the book titled: SHOUTING STYLE This will be seldom needed throughout an entire piece, but wherever the words imply calling, or commanding, it will be in keeping with the words to employ it. As examples note the following selections marked in CAPITAL letters as the appropriate place for shouting emphasis. The 1880 book then goes on for pages with examples from literature of all caps being used for shouting. However, the earliest indication of a standard that I have found so far is from the 1852 Singing for Schools and Congregations: A Grammar of Vocal Music: It is proposed that-
CAPITAL LETTERS, in printing, or double lines under the word in writing, should distinguish words to be sung louder Another clear example is from the 1860 Elementary books for Catholic schools, explaining how to read stories with italics and all caps: when you come to a word printed in this way [italics], you must read it more distinctly than the other words. ...And began to scream out as loud as he could,| ""HELP!HELP!HELP!"" Observe these last three words: they are printed in capital letters letters because they are very important.  The man cried, ""help!"" very loudly."
Did the ancients or other pre-industrial civilisations engage in unsustainable practices?,"Most ancient agricultural practices deplete soil to some degree, but are just fine when population does not exceed certain limits. There are some examples of ancient cultures exhausting natural resources available to them - Pitcairn Island Polynesians, Ancient Puebloans (Anasazi). It's the cause of the semi-nomadic way of life of many early societies - your herds graze the grass into oblivion, you move to another patch to return back when the grass grows back in; or you deplete the soil by overplanting, you move to another spot of land and start over, and so on. But there's an important distinction to be made. Early societies were naturally regulated just as animal population are - by food resources. When food grows scarce, hunger strikes, and humans either start fighting for what's left, reducing population to more manageable levels, or migrate to not yet depleted lands - only cases of actual extinction are from island civilizations which cannot readily move. Meanwhile, globally environment stays balanced, and depleted spots are replenished from outside - slowly healing the damage. Modern humanity has no place to move - all land is already claimed by someone, so we have to make do with what resources we have - and consequently affects the world at global scale, which earlier cultures were incapable of. Sustainability is not about return to pre-industrial way of life - it is unsustainable at modern population levels. It is about preserving the environment in human-habitable state - both by taking less from nature and by increasing effectiveness of usage of what we do need to take."
Why was France granted an equal status among victors of World War II?,"Before answering, just to take issue with the premise of the question. Yes, France received a permanent seat on the Security Council, not to mention her own occupation zones in Germany and Austria. But France was not accorded a status anything like the ""Big Three"" in most other respects. From May 1943 De Gaulle was operating independently from French territory in Algiers but he was consistently slighted and ignored by the British and Americans. He was especially wounded by the practice of the American authorities coming and going as they pleased in Algeria without even a nod to French sovereignty and, later, when he was left in the dark about D-Day. The French were either excluded or allowed only minor roles at the Casablanca, Yalta and Potsdam conferences. However it shouldn't be surprising that in certain respects (Security Council, occupation zone in Germany etc) France's status as a nation of the first rank was soon restored. For one thing, De Gaulle, impressively and consistently, had worked for almost nothing else but the preservation and rebuilding of the status of France since founding the Free French in 1940. He certainly valued that task higher than shortening the war or aiding his allies which was why he so maddened the Americans and British. But it did earn their grudging admiration (or at least Churchill's) and, crucially, it meant that no one in 1945 could doubt that France was an independent power and not merely liberated territory with a government installed and directed by the Americans. Secondly De Gaulle had diligently courted Stalin between 1943 and 1945 and, while they had nothing like a friendship or alliance, it meant that Moscow wasn't unwilling to accommodate the French at the top table (especially if they could be used against the Americans, see above). And also remember that the statesmen reshaping the world after 1945 weren't operating in a historical vacuum. Their perceptions of the relative significance of nations would have been altered, certainly, but not wholly revised. France after all had had one of the largest armies and air forces in the world in 1939, and the fourth largest navy.  Even after the war France remained second only to Britain in terms of imperial possessions. Her soft power (though in decline) remained substantial throughout the 20th century. The role and importance of the French language throughout Europe shouldn't be underestimated. Finally it would be a mistake not to recognise that in 1945 the British and Americans needed a friendly continental land power that to take a lead in policing post-war Europe and the only conceivable candidate was France. Britain didn't see herself as a continental power and - prior to the Marshall Plan and Truman Doctrine - there was no guarantee the Americans were going to hang around."
Do historians agree that most wars are caused by religion?,"The idea that ""most wars are caused by religion"" is trivially false. From what I can see, this is a rhetoric rooted in a critique of theism, rather than serious historical analysis. Even a casual survey of history shows most wars had little to nothing to do with religious differences - according to quasi-original research on Wikipedia, only 6.98% of known conflicts were religious. To my knowledge, there has been no formal polling of academics on the subject. Nonetheless, we may infer a prevailing opinion of historians from their research. While existing works only examine the modern period, they all point to the same conclusion: Territory, not religion, is the most common cause of war. 
Territorial disputes is the leading cause of war throughout the centuries. Source: Holsti, Kalevi J. Peace and War: Armed Conflicts and International Order, 1648-1989. Cambridge University Press, 1991. (Although the works cited below are time-limited, there is no obvious reason to believe the underlying patterns of wars would be significantly different in the pre-modern world. Even the Muslim Conquests or the Christian Crusades were isolated and punctuated by many non-religious conflicts. The European Wars of Religion were a historical aberration, not the norm.) First, let's consider the analysis of modern wars by Evan Luard. He divided post-1400 history into five periods and noted that the primary causes of war shifted over time. To briefly summarise, his findings were: However, other historians have noted that: [W]hile Luard declines to nominate territory as the dominant factor throughout the centuries, nevertheless, territorial issues keep cropping up in his analysis - in connection with issues of succession, dynastic disputes, or state creation. Thus, Luard probably underestimates the importance of territorial issues in fomenting wars. Cashman, Greg. What Causes War?: an introduction to theories of international conflict. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2013. Luard's analysis is evaluative rather than qualitative. For the latter, consider the survey by Kalevi Holsti in 1991. He divided the post-Westphalia history of conflict into five periods and attempted to classify their causes into rather narrow categories. The results were as follows:  As you can see,  ""Territorial issues"" are the only ones that have been among the dominant issues in each of the periods [1648-1714, 1715-1814, 1815-1914, 1914-41, and 1945-89]. In four of the five periods, more wars have involved territorial issues than any other kind of issue, exceeded only in 1815-1914 by the ""maintain the integrity of state/empire"" issue, which is an issue obviously related to territorial concerns. Vasquez, John A. The War Puzzle Revisited. Cambridge University Press, 2009. In contrast, as you can see from the table, religion began at only 6% and has steadily declined since then. This is dwarfed by the number of wars over control of land or resources, even in our current period when territorial conflicts are at a historical low. As the following table demonstrates that territorial disputes constitute the vast majority of all wars since Westphalia: 
Source: Vasquez, John A. The War Puzzle Revisited. Cambridge University Press, 2009. Of course, Holsti's analysis began only after the European Wars of Religion, identified by Luard as the same period religious differences were a leading cause of war. Nonetheless, the fact that religion all but disappeared as a cause for war in the centuries since is strong prima facie evidence against the claim that it could have caused ""most wars"". Fundamentally speaking, wars are nearly always driven by some kind of self-interest. Land, historically near synonymous with wealth, was of prime interest to most polities. Consequently - without discounting the genuine effects faith may have on true believers - religious (as well as ideological, nationalistic, etc) reasons are just as likely a source of legitimacy for using force, as it is a motivation in and of itself."
How do historians and linguists know how to pronounce the names from non-phonetic scripts?,"By comparisons with known languages. Let's take the example of Egyptian hieroglyphs. It is well known that the ancient Egyptian script was decoded thanks to the Rosetta Stone, which recorded an identical passage in Ancient Greek, Demotic, and hieroglyphs. The ancient Egyptian language, and hieroglyphs, were thus deciphered through comparison with the relatively well understood Greek. Naturally, in this process, scholars identified Greek names and the corresponding hieroglyphs. While the pronunciation of normal words no doubt varied wildly between different languages, names are generally transcribed into foreign languages phonetically. Thus Ptolemy Epiphanes (from the aforementioned Rosetta) written in Egyptian hieroglyphs would, presumably, be pronounced similarly to Ptolemy written in Greek. 
The phonetics of hieroglyph names correspond to names known from other languages. If the language survives to the modern day, even if only with another script, it can provide valuable pronunciation hints for partially translated hieroglyphs. This was how the great Jean-François Champollion identified the names Ramesses and Thutmose at Abu Simbel, by leveraging his knowledge of Coptic - the final descendant of the old Egyptian language. He noticed a cartouche containing the hieroglyph for sun (still ra in Coptic), an unknown glyph, and then s repeated twice. 
Hieroglyphs for ""Ramses"". The double s at the end had been identified earlier (see Ptolemaios above). Champollion then intuited it's the name of the Pharaoh upon realising that the sun glyph is pronounced ra as in Coptic Pronouncing Sumerian is a much harder challenge. It effectively died out four thousand years ago, and went fully extinct by the 1st century AD. And as a language isolate Sumerian has no known descendant or even any related languages. Fortunately, Sumerian was an extremely influential language in its time and heavily affected Akkadian, which replaced it and adopted the same cuneiform script. This became key with the discovery of the Behistun Inscription - the Rosetta stone of cuneiforms. It contains cuneiform inscriptions in Old Persian, Akkadian, and Elamite. Old Persian had been partially cracked prior to this mostly in the form of place and royal names, but with the new find Sir Henry Rawlinson was able to fully decipher it in 1849. Then, starting with the names found in the Persian version, Reverend Edward Hincks and later others then deciphered the Akkadian version. As mentioned earlier, Sumerian had an immense influence on Akkadian, including numerous loan words. With the decipherment of the Akkadian cuneiform, we now know how the language was written. Moreover, while Akkadian itself have gone extinct, as a Semitic language it has many living relatives. It thus became possible to reconstruct the original language of Sumer. Needless to say, the reconstructed pronunciations of Sumerian are far from certain. For example, King Ur-Nammu was previously thought to be Ur-Engur or Ur-Gur. His son, Shulgi, likewise was misread as Dungi, and grandson Amar-Sin used to be Bur-Sin. This is a bit of a side note, but a somewhat similar problem was present in Chinese. Even though the language is far from dead and the writing stayed static, the pronunciation of Chinese characters have changed drastically over the millennia. Pronunciation guides were created starting with the Qieyun in AD 601. However, that still leaves a gap of over a millennium with Old Chinese, not to mention the oracle bone script from which it was derived. Unlike a phonetic/alphabetic script, these changes are impossible to trace from the script alone. In fact, Chinese scholars did not even notice the pronunciations have changed. The first realisation came from Chen Di in the late Ming Dynasty, who realised that the apparent lack of rhyming in ancient poems, such as those from the Classic of Poetry, was actually because the sounds had shifted in the intervening millennia. In this case, Chen had a huge corpus of ancient texts available and understood the meaning of each character well. He was thus able to begin reconstructing Old Chinese pronunciations by systematically mapping which words rhymed with what."
"Why, in ancient battles, did being encircled mean defeat?","While the tactical factor (not being able to move units around) is important, the main issue is one of soldiers panicking. Remember that it does not matter what the numbers are actually; your soldiers cannot see the lines in the map and are victims of the fog of war. Soldiers in the battlefield do not get to see a nice map showing the position of the units, how thin the enemy lines are and how many of each side are still fighting. Specifically in the classic massed infantry fights, all that they can see is lots of people around them; particularly you do not see how many lines of enemies are before you even if you are in the front line of your army. Now, you are doing your part, advancing forward, with your back and your sides protected by your fellow soldiers, so you can concentrate on using your weapon and shield in the front. Life is good. Suddenly you hear a commotion at your back. The soldiers behind you move forward, pressing against you. You do not know exactly what is happening, but it is something very worrisome. Then word spreads that the enemy is attacking at your back. You do not know exactly what is happening. Maybe you are not completely encircled and there are still gaps left for you to flee. You know that if the other soldiers try to flee and you stay put you will be slaughtered, because nobody will be defending your back. But maybe – just maybe – if you start fleeing right now you will get an opportunity to make it home. And you fear that all the soldiers around your are thinking the same; maybe the rout has already started and you are just missing your opportunity. If you are in front of the enemy, you do not want to be the one holding the line while everybody behind you is fleeing, leaving you undefended. You move back. If the soldier behind you does not move, you push with your back, until he leaves you a space to retreat to or everyone is so tightly packed that you cannot move. So, at some time, the soldiers panic, they stop trying to fight and only think about fleeing, about finding a gap that the enemy still has not closed; the army just stops being an army and the rout happens.  You do not ever need the army to be surrounded, routs happen all the time when the soldiers of one side figured (rightly or not) that they were going to lose. Typically, most of the casualties of the battle would happen as the rout developed."
Did China ever consider a phonetic writing system?,"There were at least a couple of alphabetic script attempts developed for Chinese. However, none of them really caught on. There are significant barriers for adoption of any kind of phonetic writing scheme for Chinese. The main issue is that the mostly-logographic system China uses has historically been covering up for the fact that quite a few Chinese ""dialects"" are not mutually-intelligible (eg: Cantonese, Suzhounese, Sichuanese)1. IOW, they are really separate languages. On top of that, large swaths of the country are inhabited by people who even the Chinese will admit don't speak Chinese.  You obviously can't write a single document for several completely different languages using a phonetic-based writing system, without having to translate everything you write into every one of the different languages. Not only is that a crazy amount of work, it would erect brand new cultural barriers between all the various languages. Its possible the entire popular concept of ""China"" as a culturally unified unit could fall apart. This is why they've been forced to stick to logographs. However, there have been some (non-ethnic Chinese) Chinese rulers who had an even more expansive agenda. The Yuan (Mongol) dynasty at its height controlled China, Mongolia, Manchuria, Tibet, and Taiwan. There was a desire by the ruling Mongolians to have a single script that could be used for all their domains, and since the existing Mongolian script wasn't even great for Mongolian, at around 1269 they commissioned a Tibetan monk by the name of Drogön Chögyal Phagpa to develop a more suitable script. What he came up with was an alphabetic system that tied the letter glyphs together by syllable2. For a while it was the official script used across the Mongolian domains (regardless of language). However, the Mongol (Yuan) dynasty was quite brief, less than 100 years, and the following native Chinese dynasty understandably wasn't fond enough of this foriegn-imposed script to keep with it. It continued in use for a while in other countries, but not China.3 There was also Nüshu. This was a fully phonetic syllabary, which means it only needed about 120 glyphs (with a further 500ish logographs borrowed from Hanzi). The story of Nüshu is probably the best example a historian could ask for of the problems posed by trying to promote a phonetic writing system in China. It was regional (as it would have to be, covering only one dialect). In this case, the dialect it covered was Tuhua, which is of course mutually unintelligible with any of the major Chinese dialects, and is spoken only in the border regions of three neighboring south China provinces. Obviously the script wouldn't be of much use outside those areas, as its ""installed base"" of Tuhua works wouldn't be intelligible outside those areas. The script was so low status compared to Hanzi that it was used almost exclusively by women and its history wasn't really recorded. But we know it is at least as old as the 13th Century, and probably no older than the 10th. Its usage seems to have fallen off drastically once women were allowed the level of education required to learn Hanzi. According to Wikipedia, the last proficient user died in 2004.4 There are several transcription systems used to translate Chinese into other existing writing systems, like the Latin and Cyrillic character systems. However those appear to be mostly used for the benefit of those who don't speak Chinese, or for those who don't have easy access to native Chinese keyboards, displays, and whatnot. 1 - This would be roughly equivalent to a single government conquering all of Europe and declaring that its (mostly Indo-European speaking) residents actually speak the ""European"" language, German is the official dialect, and English, Dutch, French, Spanish, Russian, etc. are all just regional dialects of European. 2 - Sort of like Korea's Hangul. There has been some discussion about if this is a coincidence or not. 3 - Korea's Hangul actually had a very similar historical trajectory, for similar reasons. Its ease of use actually made it unfashionable, its use was actively attacked, and it wasn't until the 20th Century that its status improved and it became the preferred script."
Were there women who were against giving women the right to vote?,"Strange at it may seem, there was a movement called ""anti-suffragism"" in the U.S. and U.K. composed mainly of women. Their numbers were small, since this posture would have been ""counterintuitive."" The Americans were composed mainly of ""conservative"" women who liked the division of duties and society between ""domestic"" (for women), and ""outside,"" for men. On the other side were radicals like Emma Goldman, who favored ""anarchism,"" instead of working within the system, through suffrage."
Why did Native Americans die from European diseases while Europeans didn't catch serious diseases from the New World?,"Europeans were introduced to at least one important disease from the Americas (syphilis), but far more Old World pathogens were introduced to the Americas than vice versa. There are several reasons for this imbalance. European agriculturalists lived in closer proximity to disease vectors than did most Native Americans. A number of important diseases started with pigs, fowl, and so on before making the leap to humans. The Americas had fewer large mammals than did Eurasia, and so there were fewer candidates for domestication. Accordingly, American agricultural communities picked up fewer diseases than did Eurasian agricultural communities. Europeans were part of a much larger human community than the Native Americans. Europeans had already been exposed to Chinese pathogens from at least the 6th century AD. The high volume of trade in the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean over the next millennium meant that Eurasia was, from the perspective of many pathogens, a single community. Diseases like the plague could travel from Asia to Europe more easily than a pathogen could travel up and down the Americas. This is in part because the East-West axis had more similar climatic conditions than the North-South axis. Eurasian trade also involved sailing vessels, which carried rodents. Rodents were some of the nastiest disease vectors, and plagues often originated in port towns because of these stowaways. For all of these reasons, 15th-century Europeans (and their ancestors) had experienced a wider variety of germs than had their American counterparts. Population densities were much greater in Eurasia, and there were more Eurasian cities than American cities. Cities were unhealthy places where diseases could remain ""endemic"" in the human or rodent population. By some estimates, a disease like measles can only be sustained in cities with a population over 500,000. In the Americas, only Tenochtitlan approached this. American pathogens might die out due to lack of ""reservoirs."" For example, there was at least one plague of American origins that killed from 7-17 million Mexicans in the 16th century. After killing 80% of the native population, the disease simply disappeared. We actually have very little idea what this disease was, or if it could appear again. The long history of epidemics, plus the presence of disease reservoirs in European urban communities, did mean that natural selection on disease resistance was a larger factor in Europe than in the Americas. Europeans had better immunity to most communicable pathogens than Americans (see @MasonWheeler's excellent answer), which also made them ""better"" disease vectors. Of course, Eurasia was not the only Old World disease reservoir: African pathogens like that responsible for yellow fever were able to establish themselves in the American tropics. In these cases, it was the African slaves who had acquired  resistance to the disease. While Europeans may have suffered from African pathogens along with the native Americans, these still go into the ledgers as Old World diseases, and they just make the imbalance of the Columbian Exchange all the worse. All of this can be read about in more detail in Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel. Also, read the comment thread here, where @Himarm and @Odysseus in particular make some good points pushing back against my answer."
Why bother attacking castles at all? Why not go around?,"Armies go around castles all the time, but what usually happens is that the castle is placed under siege. This is done at least with the intention of keeping the defenders in, and hopefully taking the castle via attrition, bombardment, sapping or treachery. The need to siege the castle is important; if you ignore the castle and march on, this leaves the rear of your army - and worse, your supply line - highly vulnerable to attack by the defenders sallying forth. There are few examples of this happening because ignoring castles without besieging them is a huge tactical blunder. So why have castles if the attacker can just siege them? Because sieges are very expensive to do. Manning a perimeter is obviously going to take more manpower than manning an isolated strongpoint - the Art of War quotes a tenfold requirement in men, which although not a hard rule, gives you some idea of the scope of the problem. Also it is very likely that this siege is being done in enemy territory, giving the defenders an interior lines advantage. Also, castles tend to be well-stocked with supplies, so that even without resupply, they can often last months, sometimes even years. Take a look at this list of sieges; there are many examples of ones lasting more than one year. With the defenders able to maintain such a huge logistical advantage for a very long time, how can you not see how awesome castles are? This is also why castles are sometimes assaulted, despite the huge tactical disadvantage: the attackers simply cannot afford to tie up so much of their forces in a siege, or continue supplying them through enemy territory for so long. Ignoring the defenders risks the rest of the army coming under attack at their weakest positions. Hannibal's invasion of Italy during the Second Punic War shows some of these dynamics at play:"
"On 1941 Dec 7, could Japan have targeted the Panama Canal instead of Pearl Harbor in a surprise attack?","So I want to know, did the Japanese Navy have the ability to destroy it in a surprise attack, let's say on 1941 Dec 7? I'm asking if the Japanese Navy had the ability. I'm not asking if it was a viable strategy or sound war plan. Well, you're getting both. :) Evaluating it as a war plan is WAY more interesting. To keep this away from a ""what if"" answer, I'll lay out the problem in more detail in comparison to the already audacious Pearl Harbor attack, and its knock-on effects even if successful. First, let's have a good look at the fleet which attacked Pearl Harbor. It wasn't just a few carriers, it was ALL their fleet carriers. And they needed a large support fleet of battleships, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, tankers, and supply vessels. This will become very important because of the range involved. The submarines were for long range scouting and screening. The destroyers for short range and anti-submarine work. Their surface protection was paltry against the US fleet. Tokyo to Pearl Harbor is about a 7500 nmi round trip... in a straight line. The Japanese took a circumlocutious route, avoiding shipping lanes, to avoid detection on the way out and back. All in all it took them 28 days. Tokyo to Panama is twice the distance and twice the time. As we'll see it's likely 20,000 nmi to avoid detection and over two months in transit. Just getting there will be a serious challenge. Twice the time in transit means twice the chance of detection. It means twice the chance of someone screwing up and sending a radio message. It gets worse. Let's start by looking at the shipping lanes at the time.  On their way to Pearl Harbor, the fleet took a northern route weathering rough winter seas to avoid major shipping lanes. They kept radio silence for two weeks and had a screen of thirty submarines.  But getting from Tokyo to Panama requires crossing sea lanes, there's no way around it. The fleet certainly won't risk traveling between Hawaii and the US West Coast. It must move through the island-dotted Central Pacific where it's at risk of being spotted by any number of merchant ships moving between the Americas and Asia. I've estimated the distance using the Great Circle Distance going from Tokyo, Japan -> Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands -> Pape'ete, French Polynesia -> Panama City, Panama at nearly 10,000 nmi one way. So 20,000 nmi round trip. Plus zig-zagging to avoid submarines on the return. The vessels in that fleet have ranges from 5000 nmi (destroyers) to 10,000 nmi (some of the carriers, and both battleships) to 15,000 nmi (submarines). With a round trip of at least 20,000 nmi due to the Central Pacific route, that means refueling at sea. A lot. Fortunately the IJN knew how to refuel even in heavy seas, something the US thought only they could do, but it's always a risky proposition. They did it for the Pearl Harbor attack, but to get to Panama means twice the number of refuelings, twice the risk, and twice the number of oilers. And they had to do it all in radio silence lest they be detected. Unfortunately Japan was so sorely pressed for oilers they impressed merchant ships for the role. All 8 tankers for the Pearl Harbor fleet were impressed merchant ships. To get to Panama they need to find 8 more or leave half the fleet at home. Since the canal locks are a smaller target than the sprawling naval base and fleet at Pearl Harbor, it's possible they would leave half the fleet at home. Perhaps the two shorter ranged Zuihō class carriers making them available for other strikes at the start of the war. Our fleet has, somehow, safely arrived undetected and is now a few hundred miles from the Panama Canal. Now what? The US was already well aware that the Canal was a target and had significantly beefed up their defenses, even against air attack... but it was incomplete on Dec 7th. For defense against surface attack, the Canal was defended by heavy coastal defense batteries that would give a Kongō class battlecruiser a seriously hard time. So no surface attack was likely. As at Pearl Harbor, it would be from the air. The Pacific end of the Canal had an SCR-271 radar set, the same at Pearl Harbor and the Philippines. While it successfully detected Japanese air attacks on Pearl Harbor and the Philippines, it was so poorly understood and poorly integrated into the air defense that the detection was ignored. There's no reason to believe it wouldn't also happen in Panama.  For air defense, Panama had 24 Pursuit planes, mostly P-36 Hawks and P-40 Warhawks. These are the same aircraft as Pearl Harbor, and both inferior to the Japanese Zero. As at Pearl Harbor, they'd probably get caught on the ground. They also had various anti-aircraft guns, definitely the 37mm Gun M1, but it was deemed inadequate. Only two detectors were installed and in operation in the Panama Canal Department. The harbor defenses had less than one complete manning detail available. The anti-aircraft artillery had insufficient personnel to man the armament being installed in the Canal Zone and only enough ammunition for one minute of fire per gun for the 37-mm. guns. There were no barrage balloons. There's no reason to believe the Panama Canal defenders would fare any better than Pearl Harbor. With surprise, superior aircraft, and in larger quantity the Japanese would have total air superiority. With their large quantity of strike aircraft and skill at dive bombing it's a near certainty that both locks would be hit and disabled. They could even be torpedoed. The planners of the I-400 attack estimated this would put the locks out of operation for six months. A team of three shipping engineers studied the documents and concluded that the locks at Miraflores on the Pacific side were the most vulnerable to aerial bombing, but the Gatun locks on the Atlantic side offered a chance of causing greater damage, since it would be harder to halt any outflow of water. They estimated the Canal would be unusable for at least six months following a successful attack on the locks. But this doesn't cut off shipping between the East and West coasts. It does mean they have to go around South America adding thousands of miles and weeks to the trip. This also doesn't cut off supply between the East and West coasts, the US has an extensive rail system to draw on. Or... (Technically that's the entire dam, not just the concrete spillway dam... just forgive me this bit of hyperbole.) Gatun Dam holds back the Chagres River creating Gatun Lake which ships transit going from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It's a very tempting target to do longer term damage to the canal. Could a Japanese carrier air strike breech the dam? No. It's not like in the movies... unless that movie is Dambusters. Damaging a dam is really hard. Bombing a dam is even harder. Why? Looks easy. Just look at that huge target!  The problem is if you just drop a bomb on a hard surface, like the armor of a ship or a concrete dam or the ground, most of the explosion simply reflects into the air. The Allies found this much to their annoyance trying to damage the much smaller U-Boat Submarine Pens. To do more than chip at it you have two options. First is to penetrate deeply before exploding. Then the force of the explosion is fully transmitted to the surrounding concrete. The Allies developed bombs like the 5400 kg, 6.4 meter long Tallboy. Cast from a single piece of high tensile steel, it had to be dropped from 5.5 km to allow it to reach terminal velocity and penetrate 5 m of concrete delivering 2400 kg of extremely potent Torpex explosive. The Japanese had nothing like this in Dec 1941, nor could a carrier bomber carry it. The closest bomb they had was the 800 kg Number 80 designed to take out small bunkers. It was capable of penetrating 0.4 m of concrete, not even enough to bury the 2.8 m long bomb, and delivered 380 kg of Shimose Powder. A B5N torpedo bomber could carry one. But a dam wall is practically vertical, so the bomb would hit it at a high angle and just skip off. The second way is to press the bomb against the dam underwater and then explode it. Water is incompressible and so the explosive shock will translate to the concrete. The trick is to get it right up against the dam, otherwise that same incompressible water will shield the dam from the blast. This is why depth charges had a ""kill range"" measured in meters. This is further complicated by the presence of torpedo nets (I'm not 100% sure the dam was covered with torpedo nets, but the locks were) which will also stop a bomb or torpedo moving through the water towards the dam. WWII bombing techniques, even dive bombing stationary target, was not accurate enough. This was solved, after much work, for Operation Chastise aka the Dambusters raid. It used a special spinning, bouncing depth charge called Upkeep that could skip across the water, hit the dam, roll down it, and explode at the bottom right up against the dam.  The Japanese had no such bomb, didn't have the aircraft to carry it, and didn't have the expertise to develop it. Upkeep weighed 4000 kg and delivered 3000 kg of Torpex. Japanese carrier based bombers were limited to 800kg. Japanese overlooked anti-submarine warfare, much to their great loss, and their depth charges stank. The available Type 1 Number 25 air dropped depth-charge carried just 140 kg of explosive. Torpedoes were an option, if there were no torpedo nets. Not the dam itself, but the metal gates at the top used to control the water were vulnerable. During the Korean War, Hwacheon Dam was attacked by bombs and torpedoes disabling the gates. This won't produce a catastrophic failure, but it will make the gates inoperable and might flood the lake causing additional problems and more things to fix. The IJN kicked the hornet's nest. Now they need to get home. If they're smart they refueled just before the attack, but now they're over 8000 nmi from home and will need to refuel at least once, probably twice, slowing them down and making them vulnerable. After Pearl Harbor they left a shattered US Pacific fleet behind them, but still the US Navy searched. After Panama they have the intact and superior US Pacific fleet in front of them. And the US admirals are drooling at the opportunity they've been handed. When faced with a fleet of roughly equal power to their own, a commander will try to attack it piecemeal. During WWI both Britain and Germany tried to trick the other into splitting their fleet so each piece could be overwhelmed. The Japanese, looking to repeat the success of Tsushima, had Kantai Kessen which would whittle the US fleet down with submarines and air attacks as it raced to defend the Philippines. Now the Japanese navy had split itself. Its carriers, with an inadequate surface screen, were 8000 miles away from the rest of their fleet and busy kicking off the rest of the Pacific war. They'd be slowed by their merchant oilers and their need to conserve fuel for the long journey home. They'd been at sea for a month possibly needing repair. The bulk of the US fleet would wait while US submarines, destroyers, and long range maritime patrol aircraft searched for the returning Japanese fleet. And the Japanese would have no choice but to run this gauntlet. Once found, it would be their turn to be whittled down. The primary target for these attacks would be not the warships, but the oilers. So far away from home, the US knew they would need to refuel. Attacking the slow, vulnerable oilers would leave the Japanese fleet low on fuel. They'd have to slow, reduce their zig-zagging, and take a more direct and predictable route home giving the US more opportunities to attack. The US Pacific Fleet would serve to block their path. Finally, with the Japanese fleet harried, damaged, low on fuel, and reduced, the intact US Pacific Fleet of 9 battleships, 20 cruisers, 3 aircraft carriers, and dozens of destroyers would attack and destroy the cream of the Japanese Navy. Hell no. This is what the Japanese had left ready to fight on Dec 7, 1941. And this is what the US Pacific Fleet had. With the Canal knocked out it would slow, but not stop, the flood of ships from the Atlantic including 3 battleships, 2 fleet carriers, and any number of cruisers. With the Japanese Navy taking on both the US and British navies, this would be sufficient to defend the Philippines leaving the US with a base deep in Japanese territory. The Pacific War would go down something more like expected in War Plan Orange."
When did the allies find out about the killing of Jews during WW2,"Information regarding mass murders of Jews began to reach the Allied leadership soon after the invasion of the Soviet Union in late June 1941. The volume of those reports increased with time. This was some six months before the Wannsee Conference and the formalisation of the Nazi's ""Final Solution to the Jewish Problem"". I'm not aware that this information was made public at that time. On 17 December 1942, the British Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden,  issued a proclamation on behalf of the ""United Nations"", condemning the ""extermination"" of the Jewish people in Europe and declared that they would punish the perpetrators. From that point, the general public were aware that the Nazis were murdering Jewish populations in the countries that they had invaded, but I don't think anyone really understood the the true horror until the camps were liberated by Allied forces. Anthony Eden's full statement and the House of Commons debate can be read on Hansard."
Did Adolf Hitler ever address the fact that his own appearance was almost an exact opposite of what he considered the ideal Aryan appearance?,"For once that was an ideal. And a goal. To be 'restored'. By racial breeding and struggle. And it was readily apparent to really everyone that not every German was blonde. That said, Hitler himself was not a ""perfect example"", but he also wasn't the complete opposite of that concept either, as he had blue eyes:  And was also with 175cm quite average in height (Goebbels was only 165 and  the average height of German males born around 1890 was 168.6cm):   Left: 1935, left-to-right, Werner von Fritsch, Werner von Blomberg, that man; via src / Right: Hochverratsprozeß gegen die Teilnehmer am Münchener Putsch vom 9. Nov. 1923; München 1924 Furthermore the equation Germans=Aryans is not what was proclaimed to be the case in the first place: To which race do Europe’s peoples belong? The peoples of Europe do not belong to a particular race, but are rather a racial mixture. Our German people is comprised primarily of six races. And what are they? The Nordic, the Pfalzish (fälische), the Western (westliche) the East Baltic (ostbaltische), the Ostic (ostische), and the Dinarish (dinarische) races. The German people is, along with the English, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, the most racially pure of the European peoples. With regards to the purity of language, the Scandinavian peoples are in first place. Werner May, Deutscher National-Katechismus 2nd edition (Breslau: Verlag von Heinrich Handel, 1934), pp22–26. — Quoted here: The German National Catechism) And within this 'system' Hitler may be grouped into x% Nordic, y% Dinaric or Ostisch (alpine) and some other colours. That is Southern branch Aryan mainly, not pure, not ideal, but OK (p121). And bein' a Führer should clearly indicate that the Nordic component is, well, ""dominant""? His academic lackeys, like Ernst Günther Gründel (Die Sendung der jungen Generation. Versuch einer umfassenden revolutionären Sinndeutung der Krise, 1932, p293) or Gerhard Mackenroth (jstor) come to a similar conclusion: The great drummer, creator and organizer of the movement, Adolf Hitler, could be a Nordic-Eastern-Dinaric mixture (not purely Dinaric, as opponents have claimed)"". — (Gründel, my translation) And of course, if 'needed', that system was flexible enough to dismiss the 'science' altogether and allow the adage being ascribed to Göring: ""Who is Aryan/Jew is what I decide!"" Q Did they ever address this? Sometimes they did.
During his table-talks Hitler is said to have mentioned that for example among ancient Germans it was known that already among the Goths they were known to have non-blondes as well. The man allegedly said this: Wir alle leiden am Siechtum des gemischten, verdorbenen Blutes. Wie können wir uns reinigen und sühnen? … Das ewige Leben, daß der Gral verleiht, gilt nur den wirklich Reinen, Adligen!"" (src) __Translation:
We all suffer from the infirmity of mixed, corrupt blood. How can we purify and atone for ourselves? … The eternal life which the Grail bestows is only for the truly pure, nobles! The director of the ""Institute for Knowledge of the Human Kind"" (his own private invention) wrote like a theoretical mathematician: Den Gedanken, daß Hitler ein Ausländer ist und von der gegnerischen Presse jahrelang als Ausländer beschrieben und in gemeinst verfälschten Bildern gezeigt wurde, möchte ich somit restlos beseitigt haben. Hitler ist blond, hat rosige Haut, ist also rein (arisch-) germanischer Natur, und alle anderen Verbreitungen über sein Aussehen und seine Persönlichkeit hat die schwarze und rote Presse in die Volksseele gesät, was ich hiermit
richtiggestellt haben möchte. __Translation:
The idea that Hitler was a foreigner and that for years the opposing press had described him as a foreigner and shown him in meanly falsified pictures, I would like to have thus completely eliminated. Hitler is blonde, has rosy skin, is thus pure (Aryan) Germanic in nature, and all other propaganda about his appearance and personality has been sown into the soul of the people by the black and red press, which I would like to have corrected here. — Tobias Ronge: ""Das Bild des Herrschers in Malerei und Grafik des Nationalsozialismus: eine Untersuchung zur Ikonografie von Führer- und Funktionärsbildern im Dritten Reich"", LIT: Münster, 2010, p242. See, that was easy.
Problem solved by scientist. More general information on the 'exact' definitions (they are all incongruent and convoluted, with competing theories that cannot be reconciled) a nazi centric starting point would be Hans F. K. Günther who wrote Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes. Q Did anyone else ever bring it up or point a finger about it? Others did that offensively. A well known political whisper joke during the 1930s was ""Wie sieht ein echter Arier aus? –– Blond wie Hitler, groß wie Goebbels und schlank wie Göring und keusch wie Röhm! What does the ideal Aryan look like? –– Blond like Hitler, tall like Goebbels, slim like Göring and chaste like Röhm. This German joke was then picked up for propaganda by ""others"":  (src) /
 (src) Found by @njuffa: A slightly different version of the joke was used in the American short film ""Don't Be A Sucker"" from 1943 That his enemies within his own party have started the rumours might not surprise anyone who expects severe infighting in a still tiny political club of disenfranchised haters in 1921. But these allegations of outright Jewish descent for Hitler himself didn't bother the man until his nephew wrote about that rumor to him in a letter in 1930. Hans Frank was tasked by him immediately to evaluate that allegation and came up empty handed. But in 1942 Himmler took up that line, failing likewise, as one of Hitler's grandfathers is just unknown. In the meantime the propaganda abroad picked up the existence of a Jewish gravestone in Bucharest with the name of ""Adolf Hittler"" on it, drawing far ranging conclusions of dubious quality. While waiting for his trial in Nuremberg Hans Frank then completed his earlier task by constructing the ""Frankenberger These"" which is now often repeated but on so shaky grounds that it can be dismissed altogether, and this is done routinely by historians now. But interestingly, the revisionist historian Werner Maser claimed in his biography of Hitler 1967 to also dismiss the just mentioned thesis but that he had solved the mystery nonetheless: Hitler was not descended from Jews. He was rather the product of a particularly dense inbreeding.
— Der Spiegel, 24.07.1967: ""Dichte Inzucht"", linked above If you trust this magazine, at all: Only once – it was already in the year 1919 – did Adolf Hitler slip out of a remark which shows that he considered valuable what the NS ideology later declared reprehensible: Inbreeding. At that time he explained how ""the Jew in general preserved his race and its peculiarity more sharply than many of the peoples among whom he lived"" – ""by inbreeding thousands of years old, often carried out in the closest circles"". Inbreeding was indeed an idea that he could certainly relate to. Wolfgang Zdral: ""Die Hitlers. Die unbekannte Familie des Führers"", Campus: Frankfurt, New York, 2005. (Journalist extending the slightly dubious work of Maser.) Tiny commentary: it seems that quite some care has to be taken in balancing the description of internal discrepancies and logical pitfalls  of racial theories versus using this information to just say that ""Hitler was no Aryan himself"". The latter is a captive of these theories and somewhat resembling an accusation towards nazis that 'they weren't racist enough'."
Why did the Confederacy think they could win the American Civil War?,"Militarily, the south did not need to win the war by invading and defeating the north. Their belief was that they just had to hold on to what they had, hence their largely defensive strategy. Despite a marked numerical inferiority, the south believed (correctly, at least in the early stages) it had better leaders and better soldiers.  Davis boasted that Southerners were “a military people . . . We are
  not less military because we have had no great standing armies. But
  perhaps we are the only people in the world where gentlemen go to a
  military academy who do not intend to follow the profession of arms.” This gave the South an unusually large percentage of its male population with basic military skills and training. Source: Donald Stoker, The Grand Design Strategy and the US Civil War At the same time, newspaper editorials such as this one from Southern Banner in Athens, Georgia (May 8, 1861) provided a steady flow of propaganda to boost southerners' sense of military and moral superiority: The soldiers being raised for our subjugation, with a few exceptions,
  are composed of the lowest class of ""roughs,"" thieves, pickpockets,
  &c. Confidence was not lacking at the outset of the war, but not everyone was blind to what would be needed. For example,in Texas, West Point graduate Colonel R. T. P. Allen observed the actions of the first Texans to volunteer for Dixie’s
  cause. They believed in neither discipline nor drill and had no real
  knowledge of warfare. They thought valor and devotion would win the
  war. Allen knew better. Source: Kenneth W. Howell (ed), The Seventh Star of the Confederacy: Texas during the Civil War Consider also, as at least some military figures in the south must have done, that It was an accepted military axiom of the nineteenth century — a lesson
  ascertained in part from the American War of Independence — that when
  a large, organized body of people was determined to break away from a
  state, there was little that could be done to prevent it. Source: Sexton This was clearly expressed, for example, in the Georgia Telegraph (Nov 15, 1861). Even after it became evident early in the war that, among other things, the South was severely disadvantaged at sea and that the Union’s  heavy armaments may prove too much for our feebler ordnance and scanty
  munitions the belief was that the Confederacy would prevail. Referring to the American War of Independence, the article argued that Great Britain ...marched her troops from Massachusetts to Georgia – she penetrated our
  whole interior with her legions, and yet failed to subjugate America.
  What folly, then, is the talk of subjugation by an enemy able only to
  penetrate here and there the mere outer cuticle of this great
  Confederacy. Combined with this was a deeply held belief by many that the Confederate cause was right and must thus prevail, as typified by this April 13, 1861 item in the Wilmington Daily Herald of North Carolina For well we are assured, that the southern spirit can never be humbled
  - never subdued - never conquered while present existing southern principle maintains its identity... Source: Rare & Early Newspapers Religious figures played an important part too, with God on the side of the south. Even the spirit of Thermopylae was invoked: Let our spirit be loftier than that of the pagan Greek, and we can
  succeed in making every pass a Thermopylæ, every strait a Salamis, and
  every plain a Marathon. We can conquer, and we must....under God, we
  shall not fail. If we are true to Him, and true to ourselves, a
  glorious future is before us. We occupy a sublime position. The eyes
  of the world are upon us; we are a spectacle to God, to angels, and to
  men. Source: Rev. J. H. Thornwell, Our Danger and Our Duty (1862) Allied with the above was their belief in  the power of “King Cotton” and its allure to the European powers.
  Davis and his advisors regarded the fiber’s pull as so strong that
  they could almost assume British and French recognition. Source: Stoker The term 'King Cotton' appears to have first been used in David Christy's Cotton is king. Published in 1855, this book proved to be very influential in promoting the belief that the south had the economic power to get its way. By 1860, it appears that the South was responsible for two thirds of the entire
  world exports of cotton Diplomacy and economic pressure were to play decisive roles in the southern strategy: The chance that the Confederacy had, leaders in Richmond believed,
  rested in the power of cotton to compel European statesmen and financiers to side with their cause. The key commodity of the
  nineteenth-century Atlantic economy, Southern cotton fueled the
  textile industries of Europe and sustained an estimated twenty percent
  of the British population. With this trump card in their hand,
  Confederate leaders were convinced that they could dictate Civil War
  diplomacy. Cotton, Southern statesmen held, could be a bargaining chip
  employed to induce British recognition of the Confederacy. With this
  accomplished, the commodity could reassume its traditional role as a
  source of foreign exchange that would provide the Confederacy with the
  credit needed to obtain war supplies abroad. Source: Jay Sexton, Debtor Diplomacy: Finance and American Foreign Relations in the Civil War Era 1837–1873  ""This cartoon was created just before the start of the Civil War, but it demonstrates the Confederate states’ economic ideology. The south believed that Great Britain and France would bow down to them because those nations would need cotton for their industry, and therefore would turn their backs on the north for fear of hurting their own economies"". Source: Dartmouth College Library The south had great confidence in its economy, in part because of “decades of expanding production”. More recently, the Panic of 1857 had meant the South, profiting from the steady exportation of the staple,
  largely escaped the financial crisis that enveloped the North.
  Southerners saw their avoidance of the panic as a triumph of an
  economy that was based on agriculture and trade rather than on finance
  and speculation. As DeBow’s Review, the voice of the commercial South,
  declared in 1857, ‘‘the wealth of the South is permanent and real,
  that of the North fugitive and fictitious.’’ Source: Sexton Confederate President Jefferson Davis believed that once recognition had been achieved, economic and military support would follow, thus guaranteeing
  Confederate independence. Moreover, Davis believed that British
  recognition alone would discourage the North from prosecuting the war,
  and that the Union would withdraw from the fight from a fear of
  British intervention. Source: Stoker The southern strategy was at times not without realistic hope for The Palmerston cabinet twice considered intervening in the Civil War,
  most likely by joining France in extending an offer of mediation to
  the warring sides. Though not an outright recognition of the
  Confederacy’s independence, mediation was a policy favorable to the
  South as it would seek peace—which, given the success of Confederate
  armies at the time, would almost certainly result in the separation of
  the North and South. Source: Sexton No less a statesman than William Gladstone, in a speech in October 1862, went so far as to say: There is no doubt that Jefferson Davis and other leaders of the South
  have made an army; they are making, it appears, a navy; and they have
  made what is more than either—they have made a nation. Source: Sexton Ultimately, though, southern hopes were sunk by, among other things (especially the way the south mishandled its cotton), the British middle and working classes’ intense dislike of slavery, and the Emancipation proclamation (1st Jan 1863) was perhaps the final nail in the coffin of southern hopes for British and French intervention. A final point... Not all southerners necessarily thought they would end up on the winning side. Many fought simply for what they thought was right without assuming that they would win. For example, one Confederate soldier's reason for enlisting was: If we are conquered we will be driven penniless and dishonored from
  the land of our birth.... As I have often said I had rather fall in
  this cause than to live to see my country dismantled of its glory and
  independence—for of its honor it cannot be deprived. Sam Houston in Texas was perhaps the most notable southerner who felt the south could not win: He said that the Union Navy would blockade the southern coasts and
  starve Dixie’s people. The Union would take New Orleans and then split
  the Confederacy in a related move by taking complete control of the
  Mississippi River. Cotton would not be king, he said, because the
  masses in Europe remained most prejudiced against slavery.... ...But secessionists would not listen to such sober analysis. Instead, on
  the day of the referendum, February 23, 1861, an overwhelming majority
  of 46,153 voters favored secession while only 13,020 opposed. Source: Howell (ed) Other source:"
Why are Germans referred to so differently in different languages?,"The Wikipedia article on this is quite detailed. In short, Germany was never conquered by the Roman Empire, so several tribes maintained their identity as well as the Germanic language. On top of that, you have Germany's central location, out of all those factors the different names emerged based on mostly 5 different origins. Deutsch - from the Germanic language, this is what Germans call themselves as well as most other Germanic languages (English being a notable exception). The Tysk of the Norse language also stems from this. That's also valid for Italian, as ""tedesco"" is derived from Þiudiskaz (of the people), the same root word of ""Deutsch"". Curiously, Italians then call the country ""Germania"", following instead the etymology in the next point. German - from the Latin Germania, this is what Germans were called in the roman empire and thus it's pretty widespread. As this is the name the English used as well, it disseminated through English colonialism to many other languages. English also has the word Dutch, which was originally used to describe Germans, but nowadays only refers to residents of The Netherlands. Allemagne - from the Alamanni tribe in what is today southwestern Germany. As people in the time between the collapse of the Roman empire and the creation of the Carolingian empire (ca. 500-800) mostly came in contact with one of the many Germanic tribes some names for Germany were derived from that one tribe. This term is mostly used in the regions south and west of Germany, i.e. France and Iberia, probably through the Moors it spread towards Arabia as well. Also of note is, that there is a Latin word for the tribe, which explains how it could survive in the Latin languages spoken in western Europe. Saksa - from the Saxon tribe in northern Germany (on a modern map of Germany, they lived in Schleswig-Holstein, the northern part of Niedersachsen and the western part of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern). Same explanation as above. This mostly applies to states around the Baltic, as the Saxons had a lot of contact with tribes in this area.. Nemet - The protoslavic word for foreigner forms the final category and defines the name of Germany in many eastern European languages, their tribes came into contact with Germanic ones and the name stuck. Another theory would be, that it's named after the Nemets tribe, which I think is unlikely, due to the geography between Slavic tribes and the Nemets. The Slavs lived in eastern Germany, while the Nemets were one the westernmost Germanic tribes. For France, this is very different. Germany remained splintered into many small states until 1871. France on the other hand was essentially formed from nothing early in the middle ages, the term Francia, later becoming France was simply natural, the name for the original inhabitants of France, the Gaul, is nowhere to be found. While Germany consisted of dozens of small states loosely arranged in the Holy Roman Empire, so the identities of the regions inhabitants from ancient times remained intact, whereas France essentially didn't exist until the beginning of the middle ages."
Why did archery not make a comeback when armor was phased out in the 18th century?,"Yes, a trained archer can probably put more effective shots on an unarmored target than a trained musketman of the 18th century.  The problem is that word trained. Consider that most nations in the 18th century did not have a standing army.  Men were called up, served their time, and left.  That means you either need to use skills they already have (in WWII this would be things like being able to drive and maintain a car) or you have to train them quickly only to have them disperse next year. It takes a long time to train and equip an effective archer.  Unfortunately I don't have a citation on how long, but to get an idea there was King Edward III's decree in 1363 ""that every man in the same country, if he be able-bodied, shall, upon holidays, make use, in his games, of bows and arrows... and so learn and practise archery"" so the King would have a population of trained archers to draw on whenever needed. Archery is a skill which degrades if not practiced, both mentally and physically.  Archery requires a lot of strength to draw the bow and hold it steady to aim, on the order of 100 pounds of pull.  It is physically demanding to simply do it once, much less 60 times over the course of a battle. Archery requires not only aiming at the target, but calculating the elevation and wind drift of the light, arcing arrow.  A bullet, in contrast, flies relatively straight at the ranges battles were fought in the 18th century, 100 to 200 meters. Good bows were expensive and time consuming to make, four years, not to mention the arrows, and each had their own unique characteristics requiring a bow to be matched with a bowman.  Muskets were relatively cheap by the 18th century and could be made to such a standard to be considered a general issue item.  There was no need for a musketman to practice with a particular musket. In contrast, it is relatively easy to teach someone to load, (sort of) aim and fire a musket.  The key to their effectiveness is standardization.  There's no strength requirement, anybody can load and fire a musket effectively.  With the advent of paper cartridges the amount of powder used, and thus the characteristics of the shot, became more standard.  Because musket balls fly relatively flat compared to arrows, you can point in the general direction of the mass of charging troops and fire.  The order was not ""aim"" it was ""level"". Volley fire is the main innovation which made muskets so devastating.  Three rows of musketmen, the front rank kneeing, firing all at once in the general direction of a charging mass of troops, could demoralize and break up a charge.  If the enemy did not break, musketeers acted as a wall of pikemen with their bayonets. The further innovation of volley fire by rank, one rank advances to the front and fires while the other two reload, meant a sustained volley of fire could be kept up even with slow to reload muskets.  The movie Zulu has an excellent depiction of this tactic. What about crossbows?  They share many of the same advantages of early muskets over archers.  They're easier to train than archers, cheap to produce, aren't unique per weapon, and don't demand as much strength.  Compared to early firearms they were accurate, quick to reload, and had equal or better range. You asked about 18th century muskets, for example the Brown Bess used by the British army.  By that point muskets had advanced to be superior to crossbows.  Even with special devices to aid reloading, ""a skilled arbalestier could loose two bolts per minute"" while a skilled musketeer could do four doubling their firepower.  Muskets have the additional advantage of their long length and bayonet doubling as polearms allowing musketmen to defend themselves hand to hand, crossbows do not.  Crossbows have the same problems of aiming as an arrow.  A bolt flies at about 40m/s, while a musket ball will do 400m/s.  The flatter trajectory of a musket makes them considerably easier to aim: point and shoot. A heavy crossbow with characteristics of range and stopping power similar to an 18th century musket is as heavy and bulky as a musket.  Crossbow bolts are much bulkier and fragile than powder and ball.  Finally, a musketeer with a bayonet has an effective polearm making them useful in hand to hand combat, while a crossbowman would have to carry a second, large, heavy primary weapon to be effective as a group. In terms of range, crossbows and longbows did have an advantage at 200 to 300 meters vs 100 to 200 meters for the Brown Bess.  Once that gap is closed, muskets have all the advantages of weight of fire.  The range advantage of bows is further reduced by the obscuring smoke from black powder (just because your army is using bows doesn't mean the enemy is). The final nail in the coffin for bolts and arrows is stopping power.  While a musket ball, bolt and arrow all weigh roughly the same (about 30 grams) a musket ball flies at ten times the speed.  Kinetic energy is the square of the velocity giving a musket ball 100 times the energy of an arrow or bolt.  An arrow strikes with roughly 50 ft-lbs of force while a musket ball hits at 1000 ft-lbs of force.  This assures each hit with a musket ball will knock a soldier out of the fight increasing the effective firepower of the musket. But what about the repeating crossbow aka Chu-ko-nu?  Yes, it could fire 10 bolts per minute.  However, the range and accuracy were extremely poor.  The repeating crossbow is a necessarily lighter weapon than a regular crossbow firing lighter bolts.  They had an effective range of only 80 meters (compared to over 200 for a musket).  The bolts thrown were lighter which means less accuracy.  For this reason it was used in massed formations, like muskets, but this could not make up for its appallingly short range and lack of stopping power. Large scale combat is primarily about breaking your opponent's morale.  Prior to the 20th century, the primary means for getting people to throw themselves in harms way in a controllable fashion was to organize them into large groups, drill them so it's second nature, and advance in tight formation for mutual defense, concentration of firepower and mutual support.  The question is how fast you can effectively throw ammunition into the enemy's tight formations in order to kill or wound as many men as possible as quickly as possible to break their morale and run.  Beyond specialist roles such as sniping, considerations such as long range fire and stealth do not apply, nor does the talent of the individual soldier."
Why was Poland spared from the Black Death?,"Poland wasn't actually ""spared"", it was merely less affected than the rest of Europe. That graphic is incorrect (or rather, incomplete), since a substantial number of both Poland and Milan's population did in fact die of the plague. Their death rates were only ""low"" in comparison to the rest of Europe - if it happened today, it would be horrifying to us. Poland lost about a quarter of its population to the plague (...) Milan's death rate was less than 15%, probably the lowest in Italy save a few Alpine villages.  - Gottfried, Robert S. Black Death. New York: The Free Press, 1983. Nonetheless, it is true that Poland did survive the Black Death relatively unscathed. In addition to Poland's relatively sparse population, a key factor is that King Casimir the Great wisely quarantined the Polish borders. By holding the plague off at the borders, the disease's impact on Poland was softened. During Kazimierz's reign, the Black Death, a pandemic infection, swept across Europe, killing millions. But Poland established quarantines at its borders, and the plague skirted Poland almost entirely.  - Zuchora-Walske, Christine, Poland, North Mankato: ABDO Publishing, 2013. The quarantine's effectiveness was further enhanced by Poland's relative isolation. While heavily hit regions such as the Mediterranean coast were densely interlinked with trade, the same was generally not true of Poland. When the Black Death arrived, this isolation helped insulate the Poles from the plague. [M]uch larger areas, such as central Poland ... locations 'off the beaten trail' and not along the more popular trade routes were more likely to be on the lookout for ill travelers, 'foreigners', or perhaps not even be visited by outsiders at all. We believe that it was the exclusion of medieval traders and pilgrims that would significantly account for the lightly-affected Medieval Black Death regions  - Welford, Mark, and Brian H. Bossak. ""Revisiting the Medieval Black Death of 1347–1351: Spatiotemporal Dynamics Suggestive of an Alternate Causation."" Geography Compass 4.6 (2010): 561-575.  Additionally, it has often been claimed that that Poland fared better due to having fewer rats. Two popular explanations offered for this theory is that Poland had more cats, or alternatively less food for rats. The absence of plague in Bohemia and Poland is commonly explained by the rats' avoidance of these areas due to the unavailability of food the rodents found palatable.  - Cantor, Norman F. In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World It Made. Simon and Schuster, 2001.  It is, however, more likely that the local climate was simply less conductive to the plague's spread. "
"Has a sovereign Communist government ever run, and conceded loss, on a fair election?","The Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova came to power in the 2001 Moldovan parliamentary election but went into opposition after the July 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election despite being by far the largest single party. Although the Soviet-era Communist Party of Moldova was banned in 1991, the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova was legally recognized in 1994. Its presidential candidate came third in the 1996 presidential elections. In the March 1998 Parliamentary election, the party won 40 of the 101 seats and became the largest party in parliament. Despite this, it did not come to power as other parties allied to form the government. In the February 2001 elections, Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova won almost 50% of the vote which gave it 71 seats, a clear parliamentary majority which enabled it to form a government. Although it lost 15 seats in the 2005 election, the communists remained the governing party. Although the communists increased their vote and number of seats in the April 2009 election, it did not have enough seats in parliament to elect a new president. Consequently, parliamentary elections were held again in July 2009. The communists lost their majority, falling to 48 of the 101 seats, and went into opposition, with the other parties forming a coalition government. Other source: D. J.

Why China was able to unify and not Europe?,"China (or at least its core) had a central, unifying culture built around philosophers such as Confucius and Lao-tse that was attractive to people over a wide land area. Also, the Chinese written language was developed from pictograms that represented ""words,"" which although pronounced differently in different locations, could have the same meaning over wide land areas.  This core culture was widely admired, which is to say that people on the ""edges"" of ""China"" were often open to assimilation or sinicization. And the country was fortunate that when conquered, it was by more ""backward"" (but fiercer) people such as the Mongols and Manchus who were glad to adopt Chinese culture, and also impose it on conquered people. In Europe (at the risk of oversimplifying), there were three main cultural linguistic groups, Latin, Germanic and Slav, of roughly equal power and influence. While the balance of power shifted back and forth over the centuries, no one group became dominant. And often, they could not impose their culture over smaller subgroups that got in their way. In theory, Latin might have fulfilled the function of a common language like Chinese, but (apart from modified forms such as French, Spanish or Italian, in most of the former Roman territories), it never took hold over the common people in the rest of Europe. Nor was there a common culture in most of Europe, at least until the time of the Enlightenment. "
Why didn't Imperial Japan attack the Soviet Union during World War 2?,"We have to delve into two spheres to address this question, the political and the military. Militarily, the Japanese fought a series of border skirmishes with the Soviet Union at Khalkhin Gol (located along the Manchurian - Mongolian border, Mongolia then being a ""People's Republic"" and puppet of the Soviet Union) through early summer to early autumn 1939, with the main battle happening on August 20th-31st. Georgy Zhukov (who later went on to lead large formations in Europe, but then a Corps Commander) launched a coordinated combined arms attack which stunned the patently inferior Japanese, leading to a prompt ceasefire and cessation of hostilities on September 15, 1939. Politically, the Japanese military cadres were always divided along two opposed doctrines: the Northern Expansion Doctrine (in which the Japanese Empire would expand north into Siberia) and the Southern Expansion Doctrine (in which the Japanese Empire would instead focus on South-East Asia and the greater Pacific) favored by the Army and Navy respectively. The thorough paddling that the Imperial Japanese Army and the Kwantung Army received at Khalkhin Gol discredited the Northern Expansion Doctrine. There are indications that the Japanese would have struck the Soviet Union had Operation Typhoon succeeded and Moscow taken by the Germans, but this obviously never materialized. What a difference 50km can make!"
What is the origin of 3 meals a day?,"In ""Millennium From Religion to Revolution: How Civilization
Has Changed Over a Thousand Years""*, Mortimer explains the origin of 3 meals a day:  As for mealtimes, few people in northern Europe ate breakfast in 1501.
  The medieval two-meal rhythm of the day persisted: dinner was at about
  11 a.m. and supper at about 5 p.m. But as more people moved into
  towns, and made their living by working long hours for other townsmen,
  the time at which they could have supper was pushed back into the
  evening. This meant that dinner, the main meal of the day, had to be
  eaten a couple of hours later and became lunch. It followed that you
  had to eat an early meal, breakfast, in order to get through to
  lunchtime. School also helped bring about this change, for more and
  more boys went to school, and the long lessons required that they eat
  breakfast. Hence breakfast was ubiquitous in towns by 1600. Mortimer concludes:  By 1600 most people followed a routine that you will probably
  recognise. They washed their face and hands and cleaned their teeth
  when they got up in the morning. They had breakfast and went to school
  or work for about eight o’clock. They ate lunch around midday, and
  came home and ate supper with metal knives and spoons off plates,
  warming themselves at a fireplace. As for hunter-gatherer, James Woodburn writes in Egalitarian Societies : neither !Kung nor Hadza usually place much emphasis on formal meal
  times. A great deal of food is eaten informally throughout the day.[...]
  Marshall records that 'Meat is not habitually cooked and eaten as a
  family meal among the !Kung . . . The men, women, and children may
  cook their pieces when and as they wish, often roasting bits in the
  coals and hot ashes and eating them alone at odd times' *The book was also printed under the title ""Human Race: 10 Centuries of Change on Earth"""
Did medieval scholars believe the Earth was round?,"Lyon's theory is rather flawed. First of all, the Etymologiae was written in the 7th century. Just because one paragraph from one chapter in the book might possibly be construed as implying a flat earth, does not mean serious scholars for the next 1,000 years all believe the earth to be flat. Without direct evidence of medieval scholars calling the Earth flat, one cannot possibly extrapolate a single book's alleged errors to an entire continent. The existence of Newton's extremely influential work does not prove 21st century physicists 400 years later are unaware of relativity. Secondly, it's not clear that Etymologiae actually says the Earth is flat, mistranslation or otherwise. This is what it says: Orbis a rotunditate circuli dictus, quia sicut rota est; unde brevis etiam rotella orbiculus appellatur. Vndique enim Oceanus circumfluens eius in circulo ambit fines. Divisus est autem trifarie: e quibus una pars Asia, altera Europa, tertia Africa nuncupatur. The globe (orbis) derives its name from the roundness of the circle, because it resembles a wheel; hence a small wheel is called a ‘small disk’ (orbiculus).1 Indeed, the Ocean that flows around it on all sides encompasses its furthest reaches in a circle. It is divided into three parts, one of which is called Asia, the second Europe, the third Africa. Barney, Stephen A., et al. The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville. Cambridge University Press, 2006. Textually, this is ambiguous at most, so the the other argument from proponents of the flat earth myth is the accompanying illustration: 
Page from the Etymologiae. Source: Wikipedia This argument is however easily dismissed. Pick up any atlas or world map today - modern detail and projection are vastly superior, but it's still flat! This is merely the inevitable result of attempting to represent a 3D globe on a 2D surface. It does not mean either mapmaker or the reader actually think the Earth is flat. Finally, Isidore of Seville left more than just the Etymologiae. In fact, according to the late Italian professor Umberto Eco: Isidore of Seville (who was surely not a model of scientific precision) calculates at a certain point that the equator was eighty thousand stadii in length. Eco, Umberto. Serendipities: Language and Lunacy. Columbia University Press, 1998. This is not particularly accurate, though not that bad considering Christopher Columbus's later example. However, the mere fact that he tried calculate the equator proves that not even Isidore thought the Earth was flat. Last but not the least, we know for a fact that it is the consensus of medieval scholars that the Earth is indeed spherical. If we examine the work of even early-medieval writers, particularly in Europe, we find that with few exceptions they held a spherical-earth theory . . . From the seventh to the fourteenth century, every important medieval thinker concerned about the natural world stated more or less explicitly that the world was a globe, and many of them incorporated Ptolemy's astronomy and Aristotle's physics in ttheir work. Numbers, Ronald L., and Kostas Kampourakis, eds. Newton's Apple and other Myths about Science. Harvard University Press, 2015. For example, in the 5th century Augustine of Hippo wrote of the antipodes in his hugely influential The City of God that: [A]lthough it be supposed or scientifically demonstrated that the world is of a round and spherical form, yet it does not follow that the other side of the earth is bare of water; nor even, though it be bare, does it immediately follow that it is peopled. Schaff, Philip. NPNF1-02. St. Augustine's City of God and Christian Doctrine. CCEL, 1890. Notice how St Augustine has no qualms with the Earth being ""scientifically demonstrated"" to be spherical. All of his arguments in this chapter were merely that the other side of the sphere was not populated. In any case, St Augustine was more explicit in the lesser known The Literal Meaning of Genesis: Although water still covered all the earth, there was nothing to prevent the massive watery sphere from having day on one side by the presence of light, and on the other side, night by the absence of light. Thus, in the evening, darkness would pass to that side from which light would be turning to the other. Genesi Ad Litteram. Paulist Press, 1982."
Why were old fortifications shaped like stars and not like circles?,"Star forts or bastion forts are designed to enable enfilade (or flanking) fire: shooting on the line of attackers from the side, significantly increasing firing efficiency of the defender. Flanking fire allows guns placed in the side wall of the bastion (protected from direct fire from attackers) to safely and effectively shoot at an entire line of attackers (enfilade them) as they are closing to the neighboring bastion. Flanking fire is very effective, because if you miss one attacker, you hit the next one. Check the enfilade link for images.  Here the red arrows show direction of the flanking fire from the guns placed in the protected side walls (""flanks"", #3) of the bastions (#1 and #2). More details about the placement of guns in bastion's flank side is in this image of bastion with caponier. Guns in ""face"" walls (#4) would be much more exposed to enemy's fire. The star fort has no ""dead zones"", where an attacker can hide from flanking fire, like a round turret allows. The star design for bastions was first introduced in Italy in the 15th century, and later perfected by Vauban - in the Citadell of Lille and others. Wikipedia has more nice images and a history of the approach. Other answers mentioned an inability to fire from above, but that is not the main reason for the star design: its goal is to enable flanking fire. And yes, star shaped bastions do not allow to fire on attackers from above, but that is not necessary (and would be dangerous for defenders), because the walls are subject to more effective flanking fire from the side walls (protected from direct fire of attackers) of neighboring bastions. Of course Vauban also designed a way how to attack such star fortress, by digging 3 lines of parallel trenches connected by zigzag trenches to avoid enfilading fire down the trench line, with 3rd parallel coming close to the attacked fort's glacis (outer edge of the fortifications).  Images are from Wikimedia/Wikipedia."
Why didn't Germany blockade the Strait of Gibraltar during WW2?,"...but if the Strait is guarded such that they can't get them without braving an enfilading strafe of torpedoes, then it wouldn't do much good even if they knew where they are. From this comment by the OP, and others like it, it seems they don't appreciate the tactical limitations and vulnerabilities of a WWII submarine. I'll address that. While WWII submarines can be devastating to unescorted (or, earlier in the war, even escorted) merchant ships, they are extremely vulnerable to even small warships. First thing to realize is WWII submarines aren't really submarines like modern submarines are. They are first and foremost surface ships. They spend most of their time on the surface where they can see (relying on lookouts with binoculars), move quickly, and use relatively cheap and plentiful deck gun ammunition to sink vulnerable merchant ships. It wasn't until the revolutionary Type XXI, completed at the war's very end, that the submarine would be able to spend the majority of its time under water. Underwater a WWII submarine is very slow, has very limited battery power (a few hours at any kind of speed), limited breathing time, and must fire relatively short ranged (1000-5000 meters effective range), slow (20-40 knots), unguided, expensive torpedoes which are in limited supply and slow to reload. A Type VII submarine had only 14 torpedoes and just 6 tubes (4 bow, 2 stern). Once they were fired it could take an hour to reload. Hitting a slow, unaware, leisurely zig-zagging merchant ship was tricky enough and it usually took all 4 bow torpedoes to guarantee a hit. Hitting a fast, wildly maneuvering warship aware of your presence is almost impossible. A German Type VII submarine, their most plentiful, could do 18 knots on the surface, but just 8 underwater. Surfaced, they had a range of 8500 miles, underwater just 80 miles... at a leisurely 4 knots. While submerged a target had to almost run them over to allow a torpedo attack, they could not chase them down. While they carried an 88mm deck gun with 220 rounds of ammunition, this is a peashooter compared to what even the smallest destroyer carries. With a single gun, an unstable platform from which to shoot it (ie. the submarine rolls a lot), inferior range-finding gear, slow speed, and no armor... to be caught on the surface by even a well-armed merchantman was suicide. This was exploited by Q-Ships, armed merchantmen made to look like juicy deck gun targets. If they stay deep they're safer, but also blind relying only on hydrophones (underwater microphones) to detect ships. If they want to use their periscope they must come up to periscope depth, shallow enough so their periscope can reach the surface. It's a tricky process to hold a WWII submarine at periscope depth. Come up a few feet and your scope is sticking up high out of the water and easy to be spotted. Come down a few feet and you can't see anything. The view isn't very good, being at the surface of the ocean and through a series of lenses. Which brings us to the most underappreciated part of anti-submarine warfare (ASW): airplanes. We like to think of objects underwater as being effectively invisible, but from a high vantage point, like an airplane, a 200 foot long submarine can be seen quite easily at periscope depth. If an airplane spots a submarine on the surface it can be attacked with guns and bombs. At periscope depth it can be depth charged. To avoid attack, the submarine must dive deep to get away. Even if the airplane doesn't get the submarine, the submarine is now slow, blind, and losing battery power. With it's long loiter time, an ASW aircraft could hold a submarine down until a warship arrives to hunt it down with sonar. With all that in mind, what happens when the German navy attempts to blockade the Strait of Gibraltar with submarines augmented with e-boats, destroyers and other light surface ships. To give it the best chance of succeeding, let's set it in the late summer of 1940 at the height of the Battle of Britain. The RAF is overstretched, the US hasn't entered the war, and ASW aircraft don't have radar capable of detecting submarine periscopes. The German navy at this point is in bad shape. Never anything like a match for the Royal Navy, the war had started a few years too soon and naval production schedules were thrown into chaos. They had just taken a mauling in the otherwise wildly successful invasion of Norway losing many small ships. At this point Germany only had 9 destroyers. They started the war with only 21, had since lost 12, and had only since commissioned one. They wouldn't last long with the major Royal Navy base of Gibraltar right there. It's unlikely Germany would risk its remaining overworked 9 destroyers on such a risky mission as blockading the Strait. The Germans had E-boats, small, fast, expendable torpedo boats, and in some quantity. And, like a submarine, they were also extremely vulnerable to any real warship. Their short range precludes them from being used in this operation. Spain is staunchly neutral, and the south of France and Morocco are Vichy French territory who can still deny the Germans from using their ports. While smaller ships have a hope of dodging the Royal Navy, larger surface vessels would be target practice. No German capital ship would risk staying in one area long enough for the RN to find them. So no support from the German surface navy. What about submarines? At this point in the war, the Germans had only commissioned 25 Type VII submarines of which only 13 remained. Their larger, ocean-going Type IX was too precious to be used in such an operation. At this point they had commissioned 11 but only 4 were left. It wasn't until 1941 that production would ramp up into the hundreds we think about when we think about the U-Boat war, but by then they were losing their technological edge. This pitifully small number of capable submarines meant not only would the blockade be difficult to maintain, but submarines would have to be taken from the then very successful Battle of the Atlantic probably never to return. Already, even in the summer of 1940, U-Boats were taking very heavy loses. And this was while mostly avoiding the Royal Navy. You're proposing they take them head on. Let's see what happens. A submarine operating in the Strait of Gibraltar has all sorts of problems. It's a death trap. A submarine's single advantage and defense is stealth. This can be in not being detectable, but it's also not knowing where it's going to show up next. The enemy has to spread their ASW resources very thin looking for you. If German submarines try to blockade the Strait you know where you look and can concentrate your search in a small and restricted area. Only about 10 miles separates Africa from Europe. If detected there's nowhere to go. Being right next to a heavily fortified and extremely valuable British naval base means retaliation will be immediate and heavy. A submarine that doesn't want to be detected in the Strait has a fighting chance... if they're moving into the Mediterranean west to east with the currents. The mixing salinity between the Atlantic and Mediterranean made underwater detection difficult, and the currents could be used to transit the Strait silently. It was still a very, very dangerous transit. Out of 62 U-Boats which made the trip from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, 9 were sunk and 10 turned back. None returned. But our submarines are on the attack, and a submarine running deep cannot see or attack. Our submarines have to spend their nights on the surface charging batteries and hunting, and their days either submerged avoiding aircraft and saving battery power, or hunting at periscope depth, but also vulnerable to ASW aircraft. Stuck in a narrow box of ocean, they're easy pickings for ASW aircraft and ships who can patrol over the area again and again and again until they've hunted them all down. In addition to ASW hunters, any merchant ships transiting the Strait can be formed into convoys and protected by heavy ASW escort. Since the submarines are bunched up in the Strait, the same ASW fleet can protect all convoys moving through the gap. Submarines would not be allowed unescorted targets. Attacking an escorted convoy would be suicide. Even with surprise, even with a wolf pack, avenging ASW aircraft and ships are never far away at Gibraltar. Every attack would pinpoint the submarines' position, and at 8 knots submerged they can't get far before an ASW vessel or aircraft shows up to search. As for larger Royal Navy ships which might be worth the risk, they will either avoid the Strait until it is cleared, or be heavily escorted and moving at high speed. Capital ships have little place in an ASW fight except to be targets. To sum up why they didn't try this... An attempt by the Germans to blockade the Strait would be a dream come true for the British. It would draw the entire German submarine fleet away from their very hard pressed Atlantic merchant convoys, and into a fixed area where they can be hunted and destroyed by a relatively small number of cheap, short-ranged ASW warships and aircraft. For an appreciation of the troubles of a WWII submarine, I recommend the famous fictional but quite accurate German submarine movie Das Boot. They even have to transit the Strait. I would also highly recommend the historical book One Of Our Submarines, the account of British WWII submarine captain Edward Young. This is an accurate, detailed, and very well written biographical account of submarine life and tactics. He also has to deal with straits, and without the luxury of deep water. Avoid the dreadful and wildly inaccurate movie U-571."
Did the ancient Greeks ever climb Mt. Olympus?,"The answer is probably Yes, some Greeks had visited the peak around 2900 meters above the sea level. Average people who are fit can easily do it, at least from one side. But it's important to realize that they didn't expect to meet gods there. According to the Greek teaching, the divine and human spheres only overlapped but they were not identical. One could ""feel gods"" at the peak but not really see them. Moreover, the peak of Mt Olympus wasn't the only one where gods were said to ""live"". For example, the river Achelous was both the ""body of flowing water"" and god named Achelous, the boss of all other rivers etc. Achelous was thought to be as real and as anthropomorphic as Heracles or anyone else – Achelous actually appears on a painting along with Heracles. And Greeks could surely see the whole river of the same name. But they didn't expect to meet the god near the river. The reality wasn't ""identical"" to the divine entities in their religious legends. It was just an incomplete projection of it. This type of thinking with the ""layers that are hidden from human senses"" may also be seen e.g. in Plato's allegory of the cave."
How would a 16-year-old girl from Cleopatra's era curse?,"Alexandria is sometimes called the New York of the ancient world. That means you might very well use almost any ancient old-world language you like, as the people were incredibly diverse. But the History of Alexandria shows a few 'preferred choices': Ethnic divisions
  The early Ptolemies were careful to maintain the distinction of its population's three largest ethnicities: Greek, Jewish, and Egyptian. (At first, Egyptians were probably the plurality of residents, while the Jewish community remained small. Slavery, a normal institution in Greece, was likely present but details about its extent and about the identity of slaves are unknown.) Alexandrian Greeks placed an emphasis on Hellenistic culture, in part to exclude and subjugate non-Greeks.
  The law in Alexandria was based on Greek—especially Attic—law. There were two institutions in Alexandria devoted to the preservation and study of Greek culture, which helped to exclude non-Greeks. In literature, non-Greek texts entered the library only once they had been translated into Greek. Notably, there were few references to Egypt or native Egyptians in Alexandrian poetry; one of the few references to native Egyptians presents them as ""muggers."" There were ostentatious religious processions in the streets that displayed the wealth and power of the Ptolemies, but also celebrated and affirmed Greekness. These processions were used to shout Greek superiority over any non-Greeks that were watching, thereby widening the divide between cultures.
  From this division arose much of the later turbulence, which began to manifest itself under the rule of Ptolemy Philopater (221–204 BC). The reign of Ptolemy VIII Physcon from 144–116 BC was marked by purges and civil warfare (including the expulsion of intellectuals such as Apollodorus of Athens), as well as intrigues associated with the king's wives and sons.
  Alexandria was also home to the largest Jewish community in the ancient world. The Septuagint, a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible (the Torah and other writings), was produced there. Jews occupied two of the city's five quarters and worshipped at synagogues. That means the most likely languages are by far not only Egyptian but also the wonderful Greek language, especially for the upper strata of society. This would also include the Jews, who were largely hellenised. But then from liturgical sources they would surely have also some curse and swear words derived from biblical Hebrew. As for the Greek curses, swears, and insults, you find that Aristophanes offers us plenty of Greek insults. Lots of them deal with feces, especially eating or shitting on others. Plenty deal with sex. Because Greeks compounded we have a lot of these that very directly translate into English, such as ""koprophagos"", ""shit-eater"" and ""metrokoites"", ""mother-fucker"", ""kunops"", ""bitch (literally female dog)-face"" or just ""kun"" or ""kuna"", ""bitch"" applied equally to men and women. The most common curse to a god is ""ma Dia"", ""by Zeus"", but you can find most gods' names in the accusative after ""ma"" for this like ""ma Heran"" or ""ma Apollona"".

  ΣΠΟΔΗΡΙΛΑΥΡΑ: **** eater [σποδή (καταβροχθίζω) + λαύρα (απόπατος)]
  ΧΑΛΚΙΔΙΤΙΣ: a very cheap whore, one that will do it for a copper    This would lead to many examples on the net. The main research term to use is Aischrology:  Aiskhrología and the related verb aiskhrologéo refer to ‘shameful’ and/or ‘offensive’ language. Aischrology is a speech act which belongs to the vulgar register and causes offense by intentionally breaching norms of acceptable speech behavior. Although it is often equated with obscene language, aischrology also includes profane language.
  Mark Janse: “Aischrology.” in: Georgios Giannakis (Ed): ""Encyclopedia of Ancient Greek Language and Linguistics"", Brill: Leiden, 2014. p76–86. (online) The ancient researcher Pollux on the subject, mainly differentiates: In a later entry from the Onomasticon, however, Pollux links the aischrologia wordgroup with the exercise of kakologia, loidoria, blasphêmia, etc.: here, by contrast, the dominant connotations seem to be those of socially dangerous abuse, insult, wrangling, and so forth, including the antagonisms of political invective. (Onom.8.80)
  (Halliwell, p 118.) A wonderful book on the subject would be Melissa Mohr: ""Holy Sh*t. A Brief History of Swearing"", Oxford University Press: Oxford, New York, 2013. It only starts in Roman times, but then Cleopatra is right at the line when Alexandria also became Roman. If you insist on the girl being Egyptian and using that ancient language to curse, you still have plenty to choose from: The first two recorded instances of what may be regarded as swearing come from Ancient Egypt. One of these is found on a stela, an upright stone slab with a commemorative inscription, dating back to the era of Ramses III, pharaoh between 1198 and 1166 BC.
  The stela may be found in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. The inscription was written for a small tribe – probably named the Shamin – living in or close to the Dakhla oasis in present-day Egypt (cf. Janssen 1968: 165–72).
  The inscription informs us that a certain local official named Harentbia donates a daily offering of five loaves in favour of his dead father. The offering is said to be ‘everlasting’ and promises that the official in charge of its execution will enjoy the protection of the god Amon-Re. It also describes the punishment that will be meted out to those who fail to follow the instructions: the person who fails in this respect ‘shall fall to the sword of Amon-Re’ and in addition ‘a donkey shall copulate with him, he shall copulate with a donkey, his wife shall copulate with his children’. What makes the inscription interesting to students of swearing is the way the threat of retribution is worded. Sexual threats of the same nature involving a donkey turn up in numerous other legal documents and inscriptions from the same era. Donkey-based threats of this kind had apparently become formulaic and were used as a standardized ingredient in legal texts of the era (cf. Tyldesley 2001: 163). Amazingly, it – or something like it – is apparently still used as a standard curse in today’s Kurdish, that is more than 3000 years later than its first known appearance (cf. Demirbag-Sten 2005: 219). Magnus Ljung: ""Swearing: A Cross-Cultural Linguistic Study"", PalgraveMacmillan: Basingstoke, 2011, p 45.

"Why does the United States keep using ""old"" date representations and imperial system, while being in the minority?","The Status of the Metric in the United States
Strictly speaking, the US has been ""metric"" since the Mendenhall Order, issued in 1893. The inch is defined as exactly 2.54 centimeters, the pound (mass) is exactly 0.45359237 kilograms, the pound force is exactly 4.4482216152605 newtons, and so on. The conversion factors have changed a bit since 1893, but that there are defined conversion factors has not. That said, there's a lot more to ""going metric"" than having some conversion factors hidden underneath the hood. There's a whole lot more to ""going metric"" than changing our speed limits and highway signs. Printing 453.6 grams in small print after a bold 1 pound on a can of peas is not ""going metric"", nor is exchanging the order of those units on that can of peas. Printing the size as 453.6 grams in bold and 1 pound in small, parenthesized print also is not ""going metric."" ""Going metric"" means changing the size of that can of peas to 500 grams or 400 grams and printing the customary units (which will now be oddball numbers) in parentheses. It means changing the size of wires from American Wire Gauge to the metric wire standard, changing the sizes and pitches of screws and bolts from nice even fractions of an inch to nice even fractions of a centimeter. ""Going metric"" means changing the manufacturing base, from bottom to top. European Measurement Systems in the 19th Century
No answer has yet mentioned the chaos of measurement systems in Europe prior to the French Revolution. Different countries each had their own system of units, or worse. Oftentimes, towns separated by a day's ride had their own systems of units. It was chaos, and it was that chaos that the French Revolution tried to address. There were no standards prior to the French revolution. Continental European countries addressed this chaos by switching to metric units. Metrication in western continental Europe was largely complete by 1876.  Other countries addressed that chaos in less draconian ways. Industrialization in the United Kingdom mandated having a consistent set of units. The UK Parliament did consider converting to metric units, but eventually instead standardized the informal units used in slightly different ways across the British isles in the Weights and Measures Act of 1824. This act cemented the use of imperial units in the UK until 1965. It was this standardization that formed the basis for the goofy units still used in the US (and informally, still used in the UK). World Wars
No answer has yet mentioned the importance of centuries of war in Europe, culminating in the two World Wars. The two world wars wiped out the manufacturing base throughout most of continental Europe (and also Russia, Japan and China). They had to rebuild. The only system of measurements that made a lick of sense as the basis for that rebuilding was the metric system. Continental Europe was already metric. They weren't going to switch to the goofy British units. It took those countries devastated by World War II twenty years to recover from the horrors of that war. The countries whose manufacturing base were not devastated? That would be the Commonwealth nations and the US. Manufacturing capabilities in continental Europe were bombed to oblivion during those wars, particularly during WWII. At the same time, the Commonwealth nations and the US underwent a huge build-up of their manufacturing base. This build-up was done using imperial units. There was a lot to lose in the Commonwealth and in the US by converting to metric. The Commonwealth countries were amongst the last to officially ""go metric"". The US? Not yet, but that too will come to pass. The UK was the first of the Commonwealth nations to ""go metric,"" and that only started to happen in 1965. By that time, 20 years after WWII, continental Europe had rebuilt their manufacturing base. Continental consumers liked having their cans of peas and all kinds of other consumer products expressed in metric units, and continental manufacturers liked having their screws, bolts, and all kinds of other industrial products expressed in metric units. UK manufacturers found themselves in the untenable position of maintaining two production lines, one based on imperial units for a small domestic market and another based on metric units for a potentially much larger export market across the Channel. The impetus for the British conversion to metric was largely industry-driven. The British people were steadfast against going metric; some holdouts still are. Metrication in the United States
The US is a special case. No bomb were dropped on US cities, railway depots, or manufacturing plants during WWII. A large number of American soldiers did die in that war, but the US manufacturing base escaped the war unscathed. To the contrary! The US instead built up a massive manufacturing base during WWII. It was this build-up that resulted in the US being the world power after WWII. This build-up is also why the US has not yet ""gone metric."" Unlike Great Britain, the US has a huge domestic market. Being attractive to that huge domestic market was key to survival for a US-based company for much of the post-WWII era. Exports? They were a nice add-on to the bottom line. Besides, for the first twenty years after WWII, what else were those outsiders going to buy other than American products? Europe and Asia had no manufacturing base. They bought American made products. 
That calculus is changing. Just as it made no sense for UK-based manufacturers to have two production lines 50 years ago, it makes no sense for many US-based manufacturers to have two production lines now. If you own a recently built automobile, it will be metric through and through, It doesn't matter whether than car was built in Mexico, Canada, Europe, Asia, or Detroit. The US automotive industry has ""gone metric."" That the US automotive industry has indeed ""gone metric"" will ripple throughout the US manufacturing base. This plus other aspects of globalization will eventually end the use of customary units in the US. The US will convert to metric units for the same reason the UK did: Those archaic customary unit make no sense from an industrial perspective."
"Why is the consensus that WW2 started on September 1, 1939 and not July 7, 1937?","Actually, good arguments can be put forward for both dates as the the 'start' of World War 2.  In fact a number of other dates have also been suggested for the 'start' of World War 2, including: One can even argue that the Second World War was simply a continuation of the First World War that had formally ended with the Treaty of Versailles in 1919! However, it is generally accepted that the German invasion of Poland marked the date when the war became a truly global World War.  That act drew the European powers and their global empires into the war.  Those empires included states on every inhabited continent, making the war 'global'.  From that date, a 'world war' would continue until the war ended with Japan’s surrender in September 1945."
How did people distinguish slaves from free people in Ancient Rome?,"Well,  I suppose  it's a matter of means plus motivation.  If you're educated - read/speak Greek and Latin etc - then you'd be valuable,  and only the psychopathic master would mistreat a valuable peice of property. And you'd need money to get away - some slaves were relatively wealthy,  but stealing from your master would be dangerous,  the penalties could be horrendous.  Then,  if you got to this new town, how would you live? If you were educated,  even if  a slave,  you'd consider manual work beneath you - and,  of course,  slavery has the effect of reducing the value of free labour, why pay someone when you can own them? He (it would be far more difficult for a woman) could become a schoolmaster,  but that was no sinecure in the Roman world, living in a cramped tenement, always looking over your shoulder in case you were discovered. You're right,  very few slaves actually wore collars, although badges have been found with inscriptions like ""1belong to M Julius Horrendus,  if you find me,  send me back.""  - which seems a bit daft,  as presumably, if they were just badges, they could be removed! And - I'm no expert,  but suspect there was a cultural aspect here - if you were a slave, then it was because the gods had made you one.  Interestingly, the Senate grappled with this problem,  there was a move - sorry, can't give a date - to decree that all slaves had to wear distinctive dress. It was abandoned out of fear that,  if the slaves realised how numerous they were,  they'd rise in rebellion.  So, for the educated slave,  without a psychopath for a master,  engaged in teaching the children or dealing with his master's business affairs, it was probably better to wait and hope he would be able to buy or be given his freedom, rather than risk being caught,  flogged or worse, and sent to the salt mines!  As I said before,  there could be genuine affection between masters and slaves - much  the way 19th century servants in the UK felt about ""Miss Alice""  or ""Master George"".  During the US civil War, a slave boy was sent to join the Confederate Army with the young master. His master was killed,  the slave buried him,  wrote a letter to his parents - then high-tailed it to the Unionists to fight for freedom!  If you haven't, you might like to read Plautus' play,  ""The Prisoners"", which gives a very interesting insight into slave/master relationships. "
Did Bill Gates steal the GUI concept from Steve Jobs?,"Microsoft ""stole"" the GUI in roughly the same way that every scriptwriter has ""stolen"" their movies from Shakespeare. Ideas are important, but implementation is everything. I'll start by saying I haven't seen the movie, so I don't know what it claims. However, I didn't see it because I lived through most of it as a home computing enthusiast, so I already knew the subject material. The GUI was initially developed as one of many innovative new research projects at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center1. Silicon Valley being a small place back then, Steve Jobs got himself a tour one day, and just flat out fell in love with their GUI. I had three or four people (at Apple) who kept bugging that I get my
  rear over to Xerox PARC and see what they are doing. And, so I finally
  did. I went over there. And they were very kind. They showed me what
  they are working on. And they showed me really three things. But I was
  so blinded by the first one that I didn’t even really see the other
  two. One of the things they showed me was object oriented programming
  – they showed me that but I didn’t even see that. The other one they
  showed me was a networked computer system…I didn’t even see
  that. I was so blinded by the first thing they showed me, which was
  the graphical user interface. I thought it was the best thing I’d ever
  seen in my life. Now remember it was very flawed. What we saw was
  incomplete, they’d done a bunch of things wrong. But we didn’t know
  that at the time but still thought they had the germ of the idea was
  there and they’d done it very well. And within – you know – ten
  minutes it was obvious to me that all computers would work like this
  some day. It was obvious. You could argue about how many years it
  would take. You could argue about who the winners and losers might be.
  You could’t argue about the inevitability, it was so obvious. After this visit, Jobs essentially bought himself access to the technology from Xerox by giving the company Apple stock (over the strenuous objections of some of the PARC staff). Some would argue this was a ""steal"", but in software you really have to use that term with irony quotes. Ideas are a dime a dozen; its implementation that counts, and Apple knew how to implement it for home users where Xerox was simply incapable of that. Even Apple had to weather one commercially-failed implementation (the Lisa), before their Macintosh took off. After the Mac came out, the power of the GUI idea was pretty obvious to everyone. Within a year Commodore and the IBM platform, and a year later Atari all had computers with GUI Operating Systems. So technically there was really nothing unique about what Microsoft did, other than perhaps the scale. However, Apple did have cause to feel extra sore with Microsoft, as they let the company in on the concept early as part of a deal to provide software for the Mac's release. This culminated in a famous operating system ""look and feel"" copyright lawsuit, which Apple (quite rightly) lost2. 1 - The word ""PARC"" has nearly mystical significance to those of us who were computing enthusiasts at the time, like you are talking about Bethlehem or Medina to a religious person. 2 - Xerox proceeded to sue Apple for the same thing, on the reasonable theory that if copying such a thing was actually actionable, then they were the actual aggrieved party."
"Why did North America economically prosper, and maintain stable government and South/Central America didn't?","T.E.D.'s answer is very good, and points to the most important issue: the difference between colonisation methods in North America vs Latin America. There are a few missing nexus that I feel could be explored in more depth, though. But, first, as this is a question with very important political and ideological consequences, I also think it is necessary to dispell some (first-world-o-centric) fantasies about it, because those fantasies are widespread and noxious. So I will adress first what are not the causes of the differences between what went on North and South of Rio Grande, and only then proceed to a more encompassing explanation of the divide, which should show the actual place, if any, of the fantastic factors in the real order of things. There is a strong tendency to anachronically read modern contents into mediaeval forms. One such misreading is that of the role and meaning of mediaeval parliaments. Those were not democratic institutions, and were probably instruments of feudal reaction rather than of democratic progress. Some comments pointed to the fact that the Spanish Cortes were older than English Parliament; this fact - and its omission by those proposing a difference between a supposedly democratic mediaeval England and a despotic Spain - shows that this was not an actual factor; if there were differences in the internal workings of England, compared to Spain, they must rely elsewhere, not in the existence of a parliament - at least, not in the existence of a parliament as an early step in the path to democracy. But the Cortes predating Parliament are far from being the only evidence that democracy in metropoles had little to do with the difference in prosperity and political stability North or South of Rio Grande. Absolutism was only toppled in England by the Civil war and the two 17th century revolutions. But it was toppled earlier in two other places in Europe, namely Switzerland and Netherlands. And while Switzerland, being landlocked, had not its own colonial enterprises, the Netherlands were quite a major player in the colonial game. And albeit being socially much more similar to England than to Spain (and arguably even more far apart from Spain), Dutch colonisation mostly resulted in hellholes similar if not even worse than Spanish or Portuguese colonies. Plus we can see that the same metropolis delivered very different results, if we compare New England to Jamaica (or even to Georgia), Quebec to Haiti, or Peru to Uruguay or Costa Rica. And, last but not least, we must at least suspect that the early development of democracy, industry, and capitalism in England, as compared with Spain, may very well not be an independent variable. Was the belated development of democracy in Spain and Portugal a cause of the lack of prosperity of their American colonies, or is it, the other way round, a consequence of their colonial enterprise? Somewhat relatedly, Other myth is that the work (and/or family) ethics of Protestantism (or more specifically Calvinism) would have resulted in more orderly and progressive societies than those that could be built under the hegemony of Catholicism. Again, the Netherlands are the counter-example that shows that this is not possible; while England was only very partially Calvinist (with a State Church that mixed elements of Catholicism and Calvinism, and a strong Catholic minority, the Netherlands were quite the Calvinist country, which didn't help Surinam or Java too much. And, of course, albeit the many flaws of Catholicism, it is certainly not an ideology that promotes idleness or debauchery. So, if work or family ethics have to do with differences between North and South (and I do think they do), such work or family ethics must be related to something else besides the religion of colonists. Then we need address the apparent opposite of these social or political explanations. If not in the internal workings of European metropoles, could the key to the problem be in geographical factors? Then there is the myth of the intractability of tropical climate, as put in a previous answer: difficulty of colonizing areas in tropical/subtropical climates vs. colonizing temperate areas That this is clearly not the case can be easily shown by the fact that Latin America was colonised a century before North America. Moreso, far from an inferno of tropical diseases, the whole ""new world"" was an epidemiological paradise. None of the main epidemic killers - malaria, smallpox, plague, cholera - were even known in the Americas: they were all brought from Europe, in which, the temperate climate of the area nonwhitstanding, they had been killing millions of people for hundreds of years. The plague alone, during its 1348 outburst, killed about one third to one half of the European population of the time. Those diseases may have originated in the tropics, and they certainly were eradicated later in the tropics than in temperate areas (where they were by the way defeated in the 19th century, by no means in the 16th), but to imagine that climate provides an effective barrier against their spread North of the Tropic of Cancer is false, and very contrary to historical evidence. Plus, latitude is not the only factor in determining climate; altitude also counts and makes the climate of most of the western parts of Souther America, as well as Mexico, quite cool and even chilly - but neither Mexico nor the Andes correspond to any pockets of prosperity or political stability. So climate played an important role in the differencen between North and South America, but not by making South America a hostile place for European colonists. The opposite, as will be argued below, is true. Now we need to have a look at the internal workings of the colonies themselves, rather that those of the metropoles. The issue of slavery comes to mind. One other possible explanation is the institution of slavery, which was overwhelming in Brazil and the Caribbean, and that must account for at least part of the differences between North and South America. One problem with this is that slavery's geographical distribution doesn't really fit the divide between North and South. It was not present in the Andean region, which remains among the poorest subregions of Southern America, and was conspicuously present in English America's southernmost parts. That slavery does hamper prosperity and political stability is quite demonstrated by the fact that the regions of the United States where it was widespread remain the poorest parts of the country, and by the fact that the most important political upheaval in the independent United States was a Civil War intimately linked to the ""peculiar institution"". But in the absence of other factors, the dividing line between prosperity and misery would be different, and more similar to a meridian than to a parallel, separating Brazil, the Guyanas and the Caribbean, and American Old South from the western part of both South and North America. So now we are prepared to give a more positive answer. Without necessarily ignoring the internal workings of the metropoles and their colonies, or geographical factors such as climate, we need to look at the specific relation between metropolis and colony, for there is the main difference, and the factor that can illuminate the aspects discussed above, and put them into their due place within the complex mechanism that generated two rich first world countries, one of them a global power, North of the Rio Grande, and a score of poor and very poor third world countries South of it. That is, we must now take a look at what is called The problem with any explanation that seeks to root the differences between Latin America and Anglo-America at the differences between England, on one hand, and Spain and Portugal, on the other, is that never mind how powerful and despotic the latter may have been, it was clearly physically impossible for them to exercise any kind of power over their American possessions directly from their metropolitan sieges. They needed rely on the loyalty of a layer of local merchants and landlords, and that layer would need to be allowed some latitude at making revenue from the colonies, so that the metropolis could profit either. That meant a great deal of local self-government, expressed in the cabildos and senados da câmara (which by they way constituted a direct continuation of the longstanding municipalist tradition in the Iberic peninsula - the absolutist monarchies of Portugal and Spain were never unstructured despotisms from above, but rooted firmly on the grounds of the landed aristocracy and the estamento mercantil). This pact was the only way that the metropolis could exert real power in the colonies. But it rested on the possibility of extracting a great economic surplus in the Americas, and that possibility, in turn, was a function of the availability of commodities that were scarce or of difficult production in Europe. And those were to be either precious metals or tropical agricultural products. Spain found that quickly, in the fabulous mines of Mexico and the Andes; Portugal had to build that by putting up a local agriculture and manufacture of sugar (in which it was followed by all Caribbean colonial powers, England, Netherlands, France, and Spain itself). But either gold/silver/platinum mining or sugar (or cotton, tobacco, etc.) plantations demanded large properties, not small farms, and so the social structure of South and Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean - including the non-Iberic settlements - has been extremely inegalitarian from its start. This fitted well with the necessity of relying on a local social layer for political support for the respective Crowns. Huge properties were granted to loyalists and in turn granted their loyalty. This allowed Portugal and Spain to acquire immense wealth from their colonies, and this wealth in turn helped consolidate the power of their kings, the absolutism of their regimes, and the backwardness of their own social structure. North America didn't offer England (or the Netherlands, or France) any similar possibilities. Precious metals were only discovered there in significant amounts after independence, and, being of temperate climate, the region couldn't, with the exception of the Old South, base an agriculture that produced goods that weren't easily produced in Europe itself. Animal extraction of fur was insufficient for a significant extraction of surplus, and unsustainable in the long run. And so North America was seen either as a direct territorial expansion of the mainland, or as place to send undesirables. And the ""undesirables"" of England or France were very different from the ""undesirables"" of Portugal or Spain. The latter never had significant presence of Protestantism, and expelled or forcibly converted their Jews before the colonial effort. But England and France were internally torn apart by religious dissidence, and America offered a exhaust valve for this problem. And this helps to put Reformation's role in the issue in perspective. It is not that the work or family ethics of protestantism was transported into North America, but that internal religious strife provided England and France with populations that were willing to try the luck in a new world - and also had ""good"" family and work ethics. In less religiously diverse Spain and Portugal, the population available for overseas adventures was much less family-oriented: marginalised populations, adventurers, ""second sons"" of the nobility. As a result, Portuguese and Spanish colonists didn't come here in families, but as individual lone males. Similarly, this puts the ""democracy"" argument in its correct place. Late mediaeval/early modern England was not more ""democratic"" than Spain; but a displaced population of religious dissidents owning small farms and being basically egalitarian, with little social stratification, could, and probably needed, to build correspondingly democratic local self-government. Conversely, while the English Parliament was not a democratic institution, it was a strong institution, that prevented England from developing a strong absolutism, comparable to that of Portugal, Spain, or France. This in turn made the English Crown much less able to control and subdue its American dependencies than Portugal or Spain. When, much later, under George III, England found the resolve to try and impose unto its American colonies rules similar to those that Portugal and Spain had been imposing to their dependencies, they were unable to do it, and instead provoked the independence of the whole region. This puts also the slavery piece of the puzzle into its place: while the peculiar institution certainly acted as a strong brake to the development of societies it affected, its role was subordinate to the relation between metropolis and colony. Where the metropolis could impose a strict colonial pact, slavery imposed itself, as an easy expedient to muster huge numbers of workers subordinate to a small number of masters loyal to the crown. Where fore other reasons it was impossible to instate slavery, but the social structure was nonetheless extremely inequal - as in the Andes, where other forms of forced labour, more similar to serfdom, were the norm - its absence was not enough to avoid the underdevelopment of the region. Where slavery predominated but wasn't tied to a strict colonial pact, as in the Southern United States, its presence was insufficient to stop the development of a local ruling class relatively independent of the metropolitan centre. When later it became a hindrance to the capitalist development of the North, it was destroyed through war. And so we can also deal with the role of climate. Far from obsting the colonisation of South America, its tropical climate made it easier, and more profitable, providing the relevant European powers with a foreign base to produce foreign goods, which could find excellent prices in Europe. It provided South and Central America with an economy that was complementary to Europe's. That immediate prosperity, unfortunately, was not a boon, but a disgrace to the regions aflicted by it, because it originated a social layer of large proprietors, entrenched in privilege and willing to subordinate their countries to foreign rule as long as that rule preserved their privileges. Conversely, where the temperate climate matched with a metropolis that could or needed get rid of significant numbers of population, colonies with a more democratic structure and more loose ties to the metropolitan centre developed. Where temperate climate didn't match this, as in Uruguay, Chile and Argentina, the local structures were similar to those in the tropical area, though much more sparsely populated (Uruguay is about the same size of the the Brazilian southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul, and albeit an intensive drive on immigration to increase its population in the late 19th century, it still has a population corresponding to a third of that of Rio Grande do Sul). The apparent prosperity of Uruguay and Argentina in the early 19th century was correspondingly delusional, resting, as the economy of all of South America, on the export of primary products - in their case, meat. In contrast, where the tropical climate, exceptionally, wasn't coupled with the rise of a colonial compradora elite, as in the case of Costa Rica, a less inequal and more stable society arised, and probably was unsuccesful at the development of a local independent capitalism due to its small size, rather than by climate or the other problems that plague Latin America. Finally, no account of Latin America's problems is complete without referencing what axsvl77 exposes in his answer: active foreign intervention directly intended to hamper development. While this cannot be an original cause of lack of prosperity, since it evidently relies on the disparity in prosperity first place, it reinforces the problem - and is a direct and important cause of political instability, from the military interventions in Nicaragua, Cuba, Dominican Republic, to the more subdued and concealed support for internal coups as in Chile, Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Venezuela, etc. Such support for undemocratic forces by the most important democracy in the world isn't peculiar to Latin America, though: the same apparently irrational behaviour is repeated, in aggravated forms, in the Middle East. And it cannot be blamed on ignorance alone: where the United States were serious about helping their allies, as in Japan and South Korea, they knew better than relying on the military, the landed oligarchies, or the clergy, and instead pressed for land reforms, limitation of the military role in society, and secularism."
What is the first recorded dog name?,"A hunting dog (tesem) named Akbaru is depicted in the tomb of the Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Khufu (died c. 2566 BC).

  Pointed Ears"", which would fit the description of the Tesem.2 According to Reisner, Abuwtiyuw's breed was the ""greyhound or slugi (called tsm in Egyptian)."" Other dog names also survive from Ancient Egypt, though online sources do not give dates for the following: We even know many ancient Egyptian dog’s names from leather collars as
  well as stelae and reliefs. They included names such as Brave One,
  Reliable, Good Herdsman, North-Wind, Antelope and even “Useless”.
  Other names come from the dogs color, such as Black, while still other
  dogs were given numbers for names, such as “the Fifth”. In Ancient Egypt, dogs commonly bore the same names as humans, while some had theophoric names (names which included the name of a god). Dogs, particularly the hunting dog or greyhound, played an intimate part in
  the daily life of the kings and nobles of all periods in ancient
  Egypt. Source: Reisner In Ancient Greece, dog naming was common. The Greek writer Xenophon, in Cynegeticus ('On Hunting', late 5th / early 4th century BC) gives a list of dog names he thought suitable: Give the hounds short names, so as to be able to call to them easily.
  The following are the right sort: Psyche, Thymus, Porpax, Styrax,
  Lonchê, Lochus, Phrura, Phylax, Taxis, Xiphon, Phonax, Phlegon, Alcê,
  Teuchon, Hyleus, Medas, Porthon, Sperchon, Orgê, Bremon, Hybris,
  Thallon, Rhomê, Antheus, Hebe, Getheus, Chara, Leusson, Augo, Polys,
  Bia, Stichon, Spudê, Bryas, Oenas, Sterrus, Craugê, Caenon, Tyrbas,
  Sthenon, Aether, Actis, Aechmê, Noes, Gnomê, Stibon, Hormê. The meanings of some of these names are explained in a footnote: The names are significant of the colour, strength, spirit, sagacity or
  behaviour of the hounds. Hebe and Psyche are still in the list of
  bitches' names, and modern equivalents of several of the other names
  are in use, e.g., Lance (Lonchê), Sentinel (Phylax), Ecstasy (Chara),
  Blueskin (Oenas), Crafty (Medas), Hasty (Sperchon), Vigorous
  (Thallon), Impetus (Hormê), Counsellor (Noes), Bustler (dog) or Hasty
  (bitch); cf. Sperchon. For Πολύς we should probably read Πολεύς,
  “Rover.” Given that dogs were domesticated many thousands of years before even the Fourth Dynasty in Egypt, it is quite likely that dogs were being given names before any of the ones mentioned above. However, there do not appear to be any older known names for non-mythical dogs than those from Ancient Egypt. In mythology, NKCampbell mentioned Panhu in a comment; Panhu was supposedly the dog of the Emperor Ku (possibly reigned c. 2436 BC to c. 2366 BC though some classify Ku as semi-historical). In legend, Panhu killed an enemy general and married Ku's daughter. Another mythical dog is Sharvara (meaning 'variegated or spotted') from Hinduism (mentioned in the Vedas) and belonging to Yama, the lord of death and of justice. This mythical dog was one of two which ""guarded the gates of the netherworld."" (All emphasis is mine)"
Why do western monotheistic religions seem to be so full of conflict over dogma?,"A very astute observation.  If you compare linguistic maps to sectarian maps (McEvedy's Penguin Atlas series are great for this), you'll notice something else: they have a distinct tendency to align. After the Roman Empire split into Greek and Roman halves, the Empire's Christian religion split that way as well. When German tribes started converting en-masse, they tended to prefer Arianisim*. When Persians split from the (otherwise mostly Arab) Caliphate, they embraced Shia. When the Berber-speaking areas of western North Africa split from the Caliphate, they also (for a while) embraced Shia. Really the best way to look at religious schisms is as a combination of cultural and political schisms. If one person embraces a non-orthodox belief, that's likely just randomly their personal conviction. However, if a coherent group of people does it, that's obviously no longer random. There's clearly a reason for that. Schisms offer multiple benefits: Likewise, if you are so far away from the centers of orthodox power that political control is no issue, and cultural influence is actually weaker than you'd like, you'd be far better off sticking to the orthodox belief system to help increase your ties. This is why once the European Dark Ages set in Arianisim was quietly dropped, and places like South East Asia and Timbuktoo were never heavily Shia. * - No, not Aryanism. Arianisim was a sect named after ""Arius"", who had a non-standard view of the Christian trinity."
Why did the British scuttle the u-boats surrendered after WWII?,"SHORT ANSWER The short answer is that this was considered by the British to be the simplest and most economical way of disposing of the German U-boat fleet. The decision to sink the U-boats rather than salvage or divide them up among the ‘Big Three’ (the UK, the US, the Soviet Union) was part of the Potsdam Agreement (August 1945). It was agreed that the Royal Navy would be responsible for what became known as Operation Deadlight. DETAILED ANSWER Lead-up to the surrender A week before the German surrender on May 8th, 1945, the U-boat fleet numbered around 470 vessels, most of which were either training vessels or not combat-ready. This was the only substantial element of the German armed forces remaining. With virtually no support available from the surface fleet, and with ports rapidly being overrun by Allied forces, from May 1st U-boat captains began to scuttle their boats rather than surrender them. Thus, by the time of Germany’s formal surrender on May 8th, over 200 (estimates vary) had been scuttled by their commanders, mostly in or near the ports of northern Germany. The Surrender Most of the remaining U-boats surrendered and gathered at locations in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Some, though, could not be moved (too damaged or still under construction). Others were in the Pacific, of which six were taken over by the Japanese Navy. When the Japanese surrendered, these were all scuttled by the American, British and Dutch navies. The decision to sink Sinking was the final decision arrived at in Potsdam, but it appears that Stalin - initially at least - wanted the Soviet share of the German Navy to be kept afloat. Although the minutes taken by each of the Allies at the 1st meeting of the Potsdam conference are slightly different, the Soviets seemed intent on not sinking their share. On the fleet, the American minutes read: ""Stalin said, let’s divide it. If Mr Churchill wishes, he can sink his
  share”. Churchill, though, was insistent that surface ships and U-boats should be dealt with separately, and the Americans concurred. On July 18th, less than ten days before he lost the British General Election to Clement Attlee, Churchill met with Truman. His notes on that meeting state: I made it clear that the case of the U-Boats must be considered
  separately, as they were nasty things to have knocking about in large
  numbers. He seemed to agree. Churchill's concern relating to U-boats were long-standing and also extended to U-boat pens, as witnessed by this excerpt from a message he wrote to his chief military assistant, General Hastings Ismay, dated 23 June 44 (more than a year before Potsdam): I am concerned to hear that the War Office have circulated a report
  which raises doubt whether we shall be able to destroy the U-boat and
  E-boat pens in occupied Europe before handing over the ports to the
  Allied Governments. Source: Winston Churchill, The Second World War, vol. 6 By the 3rd meeting at Potsdam, the Soviet position seemed to have shifted as they agreed to sinking ""a large proportion"" of the U-boats, but the number to be kept was in dispute; the Soviets wanted 30 for each of the 3 allied powers (total 90), the Americans and the British would only agree to 10 (total 30). Again, the Soviets gave way on this point (probably in exchange for concessions elsewhere) and agreed to the Anglo-American figure (by this time Churchill was out of power but Attlee pursued the same policy). 
Despite the Anglo-American insistence on Stalin getting only 10 U-boats, the Soviets salvaged some from ports they overran. They also salvaged and repaired this U-9 series II-B which their air force had sunk in the Black Sea in August 1944. It proved unreliable and was scrapped in December 1946. Image source The French navy was given six u-boats which were put into service despite being mostly obsolete diesel models. Other countries (including Norway, Sweden and, later, West Germany) salvaged some U-boats from ports. Two U-boats which had fled to Argentina were handed over to the US where they were scrapped, while one boat which had been interned was used by the Spanish navy until 1970. A detailed guide to the fate of U-boats can be found here.

In Britain, it wasn't long before various 'interested' parties started raising questions as to the fate of the German fleet (which the Allies kept secret for fear that the Germans might scuttle their ships). According to The Fate of the U-Boats which Surrendered - Sink or Scrap? by Derek Waller, Several Members of Parliament, including the MP for the Loch Ryan area
  in south west Scotland, some businessmen and a number of individuals
  raised questions, some of them directly with the First Lord of the
  Admiralty, and some of them in Parliament itself. They were all
  however met with the standard and bland Government response that: ""the
  arrangements for the use and disposal of the surrendered German fleet
  had been agreed in principle at the Potsdam Conference, and a joint
  statement by the three Governments setting out the details would be
  issued in due course."" In effect, ""The answer to the question of sinking versus scrapping was...never formally either debated or answered."" but Waller goes on to quote an admiralty paper written on November 30th which was prepared ""in anticipation that it [scrapping versus sinking] might become an issue which attracted the interest of the Press"".  1.""The reason why surplus German U-Boats are being sunk rather than scrapped is primarily because it was expressly agreed at Potsdam
  between the three Governments that they should be sunk. It is not
  possible to say what considerations influenced our Allies in making
  this agreement because the decision was reached without discussion of
  the merits of the two alternative courses of sinking or scrapping."" 2.""The reason which led the United Kingdom Government to join in this decision was that the sinking of surplus boats would plainly be
  the
  simplest and most convenient course. If the U-Boats were not to be
  sunk, they would have to be divided equally between the three Powers
  for scrapping. This would have involved complicated and expensive
  operations for the removal of the U-Boats from the United Kingdom.
  Moreover, it would have increased the manpower commitment for the
  maintenance of the boats, a burden which would have fallen almost
  entirely upon the United Kingdom."" 3.""Although U-Boats have some scrap value, this is extremely small compared with the large tonnage in United Kingdom ports already laid
  up awaiting scrapping. At a rough estimate, there is upwards of a
  million tons of British warships and auxiliary war vessels, including
  27 submarines, available for scrapping, whereas the British third
  share of surplus U-Boats would equal slightly less than 20,000 tons.
  There is already several years of work for the ship-breakers."" 4.""Submarines contain a higher proportion of non-ferrous metals than surface vessels. The Admiralty is, however, advised that
  non-ferrous
  scrap is not at present wanted so badly as other types, so that with
  ship-breaking capacity at a premium, submarines would in this country
  almost certainly have to take a second place in ship-breaking
  programmes."" 5.""Accordingly there can be little question that, taken by and large, the sinking of the German U-Boats is not only the simplest but
  most
  economical course for their disposal.""  ""A mass of surrendered German U-boats at their mooring at Lisahally, Northern Ireland. There are nine of the 21 class (1600 tons carrying 23 torpedoes), four of the 9 class (500 tons) and thirty nine of the 7 class (also 500 tons), a total of fifty two U-boats."" Text and image source: Imperial War Museum The sinking of the U-boats at a pre-determined location did not turn out to be as simple as perhaps the British had expected. Many were in bad shape and some sank before they arrived at the sinking location. The weather also made operations difficult. Of the U-boats sunk by the Royal Navy, 36 were used as aircraft targets.  Other weaponry Of the German surface fleet, little remained at the end of the war. In the last week, Pocket battleship ""LUTZOW"" at Swinemunde and heavy cruiser ""ADMIRAL
  HIPPER"" and light cruiser ""EMDEN"" at Kiel, all badly damaged in April
  bombing raids, were scuttled in the first week of May. When Germany
  surrendered, just three cruisers survived. ""Prinz Eugen"" was used in
  A-bomb trials in the Pacific; ""Leipzig"" scuttled in the North Sea in
  1946 loaded with poison gas munitions; and ""Nurnberg"" ceded to Russia.
  A dozen or so big destroyers also remained afloat. Other weaponry was mostly scrapped; equipment (including allied) was often sent to a “strip-out yard” where reusable parts might be extracted before the rest was either shipped on or sold for scrap.

Did medieval stores have names?,"Short Answer For the most part, we have little evidence for the naming of shops, especially before the Late Middle Ages in Europe. Visual evidence suggests that almost all shops did not publicly display a name but some did display an object representing their trade. A surviving example of a shop name from England is La Corner Schoppe, while in Italy at least a merchant might use his family name. In China, medicine shop names were common in the 10th and 11th centuries at least, examples including Infant Malnutrition Medicine Shop and Ugly Granny Medicine Shop. Details Our evidence for medieval Europe is patchy. David Garrioch, in the article House names, shop signs and social organization in Western European cities, 1500-1900 (Urban History Vol. 21, No. 1 (April 1994), writes: The history of shop signs reaches back at least to Roman times. In
  northern Europe, however, the earliest traces seem to date from the
  thirteenth century, although it is possible that they were in use
  before then. By the sixteenth century both signs and names seem to
  have been numerous all over Europe, and the evidence suggests that
  their numbers continued to increase in most cities until the
  eighteenth century. In a footnote, Garrioch cites evidence from Adolphe Berty (1855). He found two in Paris from 1206 and 1212. He argued that they were
  probably more numerous than the records suggest, but he adds that
  there was no doubt less need for them in the less crowded outer areas
  than in the city centre In a study of one part of Paris by Berty published 5 years later the earliest sign found...dates from the 1340s and the house-lists for
  this part of Paris in 1280 do not contain any. For London, the oldest shop sign with a name found is from 1278, according to the BBC article La Corner Schoppe: the funny origins of shop names: The earliest recorded shop name is La Corner Schoppe [sic]. The name was
  found in a document written in 1278 in Westminster, London. However
  there were numerous Corner Shops throughout the 1200s onwards, but
  most would have taken the name of the building. The orginal source for 'La Corner Schoppe' (actually 'la Cornereschoppe') is the Calendar of Wills Proved and Enrolled in the Court of Husting, London: Part 1, 1258-1358 (ANNO 7 EDWARD I) Readings in Medieval History, Volume II has primary source material on a Florentine merchant, Stagio, who used his own name for his shop, but it's not clear if this was displayed or not. The history of signboards: from the earliest times to the present day is a dated source (1867) quite detailed: ...signs were of but little use. A few objects, typical of the trade
  carried on, would suffice; a knife for the cutler, a stocking for
  the hosier, a hand for the glover, a pair of scissors for the tailor,
  a bunch of grapes for the vintner, fully answered public
  requirements. But as luxury increased, and the number of houses or
  shops dealing in the same article multiplied, something more was
  wanted. Particular trades continued to be confined to particular
  streets ; the desideratum  then was, to give to each shop a name or
  token by which it might be mentioned in conversation, so that it
  could be recommended, and customers sent to it. Reading was still a
  scarce acquirement; consequently, to write up the owner's name would
  have been of little use. Looking at images of medieval art seems to confirm the above. Most shops have no sign of any kind, but a few have objects - see, for example, and the images below.  Siena, 1300s.  ""Pontifical de Sens, France, XIVe siècle"". Source: BnF, previously posted by LangLangC in his answer to another question. The webpage Merchants’ Stalls & Shops has links to more images from various European cities. The only sign with writing is this ""Hand-colored 19th-century woodcut reproduction of a medieval illustration"", but even here none of the other establishments visible seem to have any signage (there's a better image here). There are also a number of illustrations of shops (salt, cheese, butcher's shops) in the Tacuinum Sanitatis but none appear to have names displayed.  Selling salt in a shop, miniature from Tacuinum sanitatis, end of 14th century. Source: habsburger.net Without saying so explicitly, it seems that medicine shops in 10th & 11th century China had shop signs. A Social History of Medieval China gives numerous examples of shops with names (including the imaginatively named Ugly Granny Medicine Shop), but doesn't actually directly say they had names on signs."
Did Russian winter seriously contribute to German defeat on the Eastern Front in WWII?,"I have not lived in Berlin or Moscow, but I have lived in Toronto and (very close to) Val d'Or. The winter temperatures for these two locations closely match Berlin and Moscow: I can absolutely assure you that if you were to wear in Val d'Or, for more than 60-90 minutes, clothing quite suitable for winter in Toronto you will freeze.  If you have not stood outside in a 40 kph wind and -25C temperatures, you have no idea what cold really means. Your eyebrows freeze first, from the humidity in your exhalations. Then the (absolutely required) scarf covering your face and nose freezes solid, as you desperately turn away from the wind and huddle with your classmates like a herd of sheep, taking turns on the outside and inside of the pack. Then your mitts start to freeze from blowing on them to keep your finger warm. Don't even think of wearing gloves - that way lies frost-bitten and amputated fingers. If you have them, you wear two pairs of woollen mitts because one pair is insufficient. You pull your isolated thumb into the main body of the mitt before it can go numb from the cold. And that's just in the 15 or so minutes, protected from the wind by the school building, from drop-off time until the bell rings to admit everyone into the school. No pretence of taking off boots and jackets is even made for another 10 minutes or so, giving everyone a chance to warm up first. Yes, absolutely - ten degrees Celsius is more than enough to make a vast difference, in both cold-weather survivibility and performance. And yes - licking the flagpole will absolutely freeze your tongue to it. Touching the flagpole with your hand will freeze the two together if you are not really quick pulling your hand off - I have seen it, and it is not pretty. If you come from a temperate climate, know that through most of Canada, every public parking spot requires these so that engine block-heaters can be plugged in in winter. If you forget, for more than 3-4 hours, there is no way your car engine will start until properly warmed up. It is even worse for diesel engines, which cannot be turned off at all in such cold weather except when inside.  A firsthand account from here We reduced sentry duty to one hour, then to thirty minutes, and finally to fifteen minutes. The cold was, quite simply, a killer; we were all in danger of freezing to death. Another comment, from Sandy Woodward on the approaching winter of the Falklands war: I thought then, for the first time, about the arrival of General Winter. If he had been here ten days ago, he would not have been much help to the Args, dug in on the heights with no chance of their High Command getting their air forces into the skies. But I think he would’ve finished us."
"How accurate or supported is Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs, and Steel""?","The book is well written and well explained; Jared Diamond actually takes real pain to explain that his theories are not implacable and must not be taken as a 100% reliable blueprint for predicting success or failure of any civilization (even if we could actually define what ""failure"" means for a civilization). The book, though, attracted criticism because it seems to relate indirectly to notions of geographical determinism that were used in German Geopolitik and incorporated in the Nazi ideology. That's a knee jerk reflex; Diamond's book links in no way geography to notions of human races, and its themes do not really apply to industrialized societies. In that sense, the guns, germs and steel culminate in the great showdown of the Columbian Exchange; afterwards, worldwide transportation of people, goods, ideas, and (of course) germs tends to nullify the geographical-induced effects that Diamond expands upon. For instance, there now is cattle in America, and I can eat oranges in winter (I live in Canada...). Some points developed in Diamond's book are still open to lively debate; while they do not invalidate the whole book's thesis, they are worth mentioning. For instance, after some discussion, Diamond confidently asserts that there was no human being in America before about 12000 BC; this is the ""short chronology"" of the settlement of the Americas and Diamond uses it as an argument to support the overkill hypothesis, by which most big animals in America were hunted to death in a short time by human hunters, of which animals had not evolved to be wary. In Diamond's book, overkill implies no suitable large animal for domestication and food production, and therefore no evolution of germs by transfer from cattle to humans. On that question of the settlement of America and of overkill, Charles Mann's 1491, another well known and well written book, takes a different path. I encourage you to read both books, so as to get more viewpoints and then think for yourself. Generally speaking, this is how you should read all books: not as collections of Revealed Truths, but as food for personal thought."
"What were paper airplanes called before there were real airplanes? (i.e. untethered winged flyers, not kites or balloons)","They were called paper darts in the 19th century, as evidenced in this article, which contains many detailed references going back as far as 1864, and many illustrations In fact, it appears that they continued to be called ""paper darts"" until the mid-20th century, when the terminology switched largely because airplanes had come to more closely resemble them.  Early airplanes looked nothing like paper darts. I should add that the terminological tide may have turned definitively when The Great International Paper Airplane Book appeared in 1967.  It contained complex and fancy paper airplane designs (including a paper helicopter), and the authors used ""paper dart"" as a term of opprobrium for the familiar, boring design that every child learns.

Why were ships-of-the line not supposed to open fire on frigates during fleet actions?,"In age-of-sail fleet actions, the primary use of frigates (and smaller vessels) was to relay messages (usually in the form of flag signals) between the flagships and the rest of the fleet. They usually set themselves some distance from the main 'line' of battle where they could see and be seen by the ships of the line. A secondary purpose was to act as tugs and rescue vessels for the ships of the line when they were dismasted or even sinking during or after the battle. In the case of a sinking or burning vessel, it was not unknown for frigates to act to save the sailors regardless of whose side they were on (as they were then considered non-combatants). As well as saving their own ships, it was also possible for them to take possession of enemy prizes when their ships of the line were unable to do so. Given these roles, it's not surprising that the unwritten rule of not firing on the smaller ships arose. It was a great benefit for both sides to have ongoing signalling through the battle and, likewise, useful for both sides to have a source of rescue available if needed. It should be noted that throughout the Napoleonic Wars (which edged towards total warfare), as frigates had grown considerably larger and more powerful, observance of this rule was starting to wane considerably. As frigates came to be seen as players rather than onlookers in a fleet engagement, the old conventions surrounding their immunity also broke down; indeed by the 1790s it was already a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.

How much smaller were medieval farm animals in England than today?,"I think both sources copied Early European History by Hutton Webster, published about a century ago. The underlying claim is true: Medieval animals were much smaller than today's. However, it is obvious that ""a calf"" is not a meaningful unit of comparison. The historical weight of livestock is mainly determined from archaeological studies as well as records of butchery transactions, and reveal significantly smaller farm animals than today's. See for instance the following figures: [A]round the year 1000, an adult pig weighed around 70-80 kg, a sheep 20 to 30 kg, and a cow or ox 200 to 250 kg . . . In comparison, at the beginning of the twentieth century, an ox weighed in the region of 650 kg, a sheep from 50-150 kg, and a pig from 100-200 kg. Comet, Georges. ""Technology and agricultural expansion in the middle ages: the example of France north of the Loire."" Astill, Grenville G., and John Langdon, eds. Medieval farming and technology: The impact of agricultural change in Northwest Europe. Brill, 1997. These are from Charavines in France, but English animals would have been similar in size. Based on remains, cattle at York were estimated to be between 220 - 270 kg, for instance.1 Of course, the weight of animals did not stay constant throughout the whole of the Middle Ages. They were even smaller during the earliest centuries,2 and seemed to have gradually became larger close to the Early Modern period.3 In any case, height differences are much less dramatic than weight. Medieval cattle were half the weight of industrial revolution ones, but only 20% shorter.4 Hence, compared to ~150cm for cattle and ~75cm for sheep, depending on the species, today: At Hamwih . . . cattle apparently had a mean shoulder height of 115cm. The sheep were small with a shoulder height of 62 cm. Steane, John. The Archaeology of Medieval England and Wales. Vol. 47. Routledge, 2014. That said, only two ounces for the fleece of the sheep is quite an understatement. The average weight of sheep fleeces per animal on the Winchester manors from 1300 to 1324 was 1.5 lb.

Seasonal variations aside, differences in fleece weight were mainly region dependent. A particularly poor area was East Anglia, and especially from the pastures of Breckland.5 Yet, even in Breckland the worst yield was still about ~1 lb, or 16 ounces:

Why bother to attack in trench warfare?,"Why bother to launch an attack? First thing is to realize that strategic trench warfare in the Great War was not planned. It's something that happened to prevent being strategically outflanked. While trenches were used in individual battles prior, nothing like a deadlock on this scale had been seen nor even seriously considered before. Nor had the lethality of heavy machine guns, heavy artillery, and breech-loading magazine-fed rifles been accounted for. Prior to the Great War, warfare was about small, professionally trained armies marching around the countryside in an attempt to trick the other side from accepting battle at a place of your choosing. The prior Franco-Prussian War of 1871 was fought with 500,000 men on each side compared to the tens of millions in the Great War. Battles would last a day or two and be sharp, decisive conflicts with one side holding the field and the other retreating. The largest battle of the war at Gravelotte lasted just one day. Warfare was still mostly a matter of keeping your forces acting as a unit, answering commands, and not running away. Victory came from taking the initiative, and crushing the enemy's morale. Waiting for your enemy to attack you gave them the initiative which would mean defeat. The army leadership was not ready for a continent-spanning trench line bristling with machine guns and high explosives. They lacked the training and tactics to deal with it. And we've never seen its like since. A single, continuous, fully manned line is too costly and too brittle for the pace of modern warfare. The Great War taught the armies of the world how to assault a line, and it also taught defenders how to be flexible rather than be rigid lest they be outflanked and bypassed. For example, Finland's Mannerheim Line was really a series of mutually supporting bunkers, dugouts, and trenches. If an attacker overruns any one position, they will take fire from multiple supporting positions. If multiple positions are overrun, the defenders fall back to another line. If you're France and their allies, it's because you want the Germans out of France. The Germans aren't just going to just go away. In any other situation you'd bypass a strong enemy position and cut off their supply. This avoids fighting the enemy where they're strong and forces them to come out to attack you. But the continuous line of trenches in the Great War made this tactical mobility impossible. If you're the Germans it's a bit more complicated. At the beginning of the war they faced the nightmare scenario of being pulled into a two-front war with France on one side and Russia on the other, something which previous German leaders had sought to avoid. Their initial plan, the Schlieffen Plan, was to knock France out of the war before Russia could fully mobilize and threaten Germany; mobilization in those days took weeks or months. Then they'd rush their forces from France to meet the Russians. It didn't work out that way. The Schlieffen Plan failed at First Marne and all hope of outflanking the Allied lines was lost in the Race To The Sea. When the Russians attacked East Prussia and Galicia Germany still had the bulk of its armies fully engaged deep in French territory. At this point the Germans were sitting pretty on the Western Front. If they wanted, the Germans could have defended their captured French territory until they could negotiate beneficial terms with France. Meanwhile they'd spend their offensive energy fighting the Russians. This would be the same basic plan, just reversed: hold off France on French territory, knock out Russia, then send troops west to defeat France. Add to this that the Russians were now deep in German territory. And in many cases the Germans did. Germans on the Western Front generally considered themselves there to stay: they were sitting on captured French territory and didn't need to go anywhere. German trenches were relatively lavish affairs. In contrast, the Allies always recognized that they could not simply defend. They discouraged improving the living conditions in the trenches because they were always considered temporary; they didn't want the troops to get to comfortable. Of course this lead to poor sanitation, demoralization, bad food, disease, and death. This might have been a sound change in strategy, especially since the Eastern Front offered more options for traditional warfare focusing on mobility rather than attrition. But the Germans never fully adopted this strategy. A lack of strong leadership at the top can be blamed for this, Kaiser Wilhelm II was a mediocre leader at best. He had a strong bias against and rivalry with the British, wanting to challenge their world spanning empire. But also the belief that France was the ""real enemy"" and the Russians should be negotiated with. Rather than look at the military reality, they looked at it politically. Instead they fought on both fronts simultaneously, see-sawing between fronts, strategies, and crises. Once the Russians were ejected from Germany in August 1914, the Germans focused on Russia in 1915 until they forced a great retreat. Rather than press their advantage, they went back to the ""real enemy"", France. His chief of staff Erich von Falkenhayn held the belief that France was the traditional enemy of Germany, and that Germany and Russia had no real quarrel. This was the Germany political strategy prior to Wilhelm: keep Russia an ally to counter France. After the Western Front bogged down, Falkenhayn continued to believe they should defeat France militarily and negotiate with the Russians. In contrast Hindenburg and Ludendorff advocated attacking east. But Falkenhayn held the Kaiser's trust. Falkenhayn's big strategy was to attack at Verdun in 1916. He originally pitched this not as a breakthrough attack, nor the battle of attrition it turned into, but as a way to force the French to counter attack against strong German positions. Falkenhayn intended to swiftly capture the strong positions at Verdun, then sit back as the French threw themselves at him. He figured Verdun was so important to the French they must attack, and that the Allies must make additional spoiling attacks to try to distract the Germans. This would drain Allied reserves from the rest of the front, thinning the lines for a German attack elsewhere. So in that sense, he was attacking at Verdun to force the enemy to attack him. It didn't work out that way. The Germans failed to take Verdun. The Allies failed to thin their lines to reinforce it. It turned into a meat grinder. Rather than realizing his strategy had failed and halting his attack, Falkenhayn now claimed Verdun was always a battle of attrition and continued attacking. Always with this hope that the Allies would be bled white. He was replaced as chief of staff by Hindenburg. Russia was eventually defeated in 1918. It did result in the Germans refocusing on France, though leaving far too many troops to garrison their conquered Russian territory. But by then it was too late. Germany and her allies had been bled white. US troops were arriving to bolster the Allies. When the German Spring Offensive hit the western front in 1918 they did so with new ""stormtrooper"" tactics. The Germans used fire-and-movement to break the stalemate and finally got their breakthrough. But they no longer had the manpower to exploit it."
"Why exactly did telegraphs have to use ""STOP"" instead of a period and ""QUOTE"" instead of a quotation mark? (Or special codes.)","A 1928 booklet on HOW TO WRITE TELEGRAMS PROPERLY has this to say concerning the use of STOP (emphasis mine): If it seems impossible to convey your meaning clearly without the use
  of punctuation, use may be made of the celebrated word ""stop,"" which
  is known the world over as the official telegraphic or cable word for
  ""period."" This word ""stop"" may have perplexed you the first time you encountered
  it in a message. Use of this word in telegraphic communications was
  greatly increased during the World War, when the Government employed
  it widely as a precaution against having messages garbled or
  misunderstood, as a result of the misplacement or emission of the tiny
  dot or period. Officials felt that the vital orders of the Government must be
  definite and clear cut, and they therefore used not only the word
  ""stop,"" to indicate a period, but also adopted the practice of
  spelling out ""comma,"" ""colon,"" and ""semi-colon."" The word ""query""
  often was used to indicate a question mark. Of all these, however,
  ""stop"" has come into most widespread use, and vaudeville artists and
  columnists have employed it with humorous effect, certain that the
  public would understand the allusion in connection with telegrams. It
  is interesting to note, too, that although the word is obviously
  English it has come into general use In all languages that are used in
  telegraphing or cabling. ""Stop"" is of course never necessary at the end of a message. So the goal was clarity of the message. Since there seems to still be some question about why the actual word STOP is being used, we can look at the Wikipedia article on Full Stop for more information: The word period was used as a name for what printers often called the
  ""full point"" or the punctuation mark that was a dot on the baseline
  and used in several situations. The phrase full stop was only used to
  refer to the punctuation mark when it was used to terminate a
  sentence. Again, clarity.  A period had several uses, but the Full Stop is the proper term for the item terminating a sentence. No errors or misunderstandings, STOP meant the end of the sentence. "
Why didn't France and the UK invade Germany in September 1939?,"The Phoney War (Sitzkrieg, Drôle de Guerre, etc.) seems destined to remain one of the great mysteries of history. It is difficult to comprehend now, after the fact, how such an astonishing combination of missed opportunities, wishful thinking, and indecisiveness on the part of not just one, but two great powers, could have carried on for more than half a year. The seventh episode of the 1998 documentary series Sworn to Secrecy: Secrets of War is devoted to Sitzkrieg: The Phoney War, and a good introduction. The period is also the subject of numerous books and papers— not to mention various conspiracy theories, and certain narratives of Western betrayal, especially in Poland. Full coverage is not possible in the space of an answer here, but this excerpt from William Shirer's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich covers most the popular theories: [D]efeatism [among] the French… the memories of how France had been bled white in the First World War… the realization by mid-September that the Polish armies were so badly defeated that the Germans would soon be able to move superior forces to the west… the fear of German superiority in arms and in the air. Indeed, the French government had insisted from the start that the British Air Force should not bomb targets in Germany for fear of reprisal on French factories. Fundamentally the answer to the question of why France did not attack Germany in September was probably best stated by Churchill. ""This battle,"" he wrote,"" had been lost some years before."" … The price of those sorry Allied failures to act had now to be paid, though it seems to have beeen thought in Paris and London that payment might somehow be evaded by inaction. I will provide a bit more detail on three factors: 1. Unpreparedness The British and French governments held Hitler to be a bully, willing to instigate border skirmishes and bark rhetoric, but not start a full-scale war over Poland. In fact, Lord Halifax, the British Foreign Minister, believed that Hitler was about to back down; on August 31, hours before the outbreak of war, he said he had seen in Hitler “the first view of the beaten fox.” So much for that. Both Britain and France had been re-arming in anticipation of future conflict, and the French had begun to mobilize their army as early as August 26, but the process was incomplete. French commanders reported that they would not have sufficient resources to mount an offensive until 1941–42, and even if that was an exaggeration, other papers have argued that early in the war, the British and French believed time was on their side because it would give them time to coordinate and mobilize the full strengths of their overseas empires. The calculation was not to defend Poland in the short term, but to defeat Germany in the long term. The British forces were inadequate for mounting a full-scale offensive. The air force was concerned about bombing, because it lacked the means to stop retaliatory raids; the navy could not operate freely in the Baltic Sea; the British Expeditionary Force was quite small compared to the French army. And even the last would take took several weeks to cross the Channel, by which time Poland was already doomed. Still, Germany had deployed most of its forces in the east, and at the Nuremburg trials, their generals testified that had France and Britain taken action early in September, the course of the war would have changed and Germany might well have been defeated. 2. Misunderstanding of modern warfare According to William Shirer's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, France was bound  under treaty with Poland to attack Germany within three days of the order to mobilize, and to launch a major offensive within fifteen. Gen. Gamelin was not a timid general, but he believed that any attack required an artillery barrage, and made his offensive and defensive plans according. The French army waited in the field while fixed artillery could be brought out from storage, shipped to the front, and assembled, and wanted for planes and tanks. A direct attack on Germany in the north was not possible without violating the neutrality of Belgium and the Netherlands; in the south, the French army did invade the Saarland on September 7 to fulfill France's treaty obligation, but did not advance far into Germany, stopping short of the Siegfried Line fortifications. And shortly thereafter, the Supreme War Council decided not to proceed with invasion, and ordered the army to retreat back behind the Maginot Line. 3. Fear of wider war and hope for a peaceful settlement And why would the Supreme War Council do that? The horror of World War I was very much in the minds of European leaders. Fear and wishful thinking led them to hold out for what now seems like a foolish amount of time. At the outbreak of war, Germany was allied with the Soviet Union, something that became clear when Soviet forces joined the invasion two weeks later. Chamberlain and Daladier did not want to risk angering Stalin and widening the war. They might have been able to send forces to reinforce Poland from the Mediterranean, but were not yet at war with Italy, and did not want to risk provoking Mussolini. At the same time, Hitler was intimating with diplomats that Poland would at last appease him. On September 19 he declared in a speech that he had no war aims against Britain or France, and on the 28th Germany and the Soviet Union issued a statement that the matter of Poland having been ""settled"" (through their conquest and partition), there was no further cause for war. And the British were in contact with disaffected Germany military officers, hoping they would influence or overthrow Hitler. It did not come to pass."
What drugs were used in England during the High Middle Ages?,"English meadows and forests are and were full of psychoactive substances. They were used. Quite creatively. Partially isolated, on their own. But also in what psychiatrists call polytoxicomania. In what aficionados call synergistic combinations. This answer defines 'drugs' as mind-altering substances. The psychoactives do not need to be on the level of effectiveness of Oktoberfest inebriation or Leary-like tuning out. An altered state of mind is all that is needed, as that scale doesn't start at injected fentanyl-speedball while smoking crack. Such all-out – between entheogenic or even destructive – experiences are all possible with the listed substances, but they work also in smaller doses. Beer contained for example Rhododendron tomentosum or Hyoscyamus, Belladonna or Mandrake. And most abundantly it was drunk in the form of gruit: Gruit was and is a combination of herbs, commonly including sweet gale (Myrica gale), mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris), yarrow (Achillea millefolium), ground ivy (Glechoma hederacea), horehound (Marrubium vulgare), and Calluna heather (Calluna vulgaris). Gruit varied somewhat, each gruit producer including different herbs to produce unique flavors and effects. Other adjunct herbs include juniper berries, ginger, caraway seed, aniseed, nutmeg, cinnamon, mint… If it contained the classic rhododendron, it had mainly ledol, if it had bog myrtle it offered a lot of pleasant essential oils. Those were until recently described as ""extremely poisonous"", ""causing headaches and nausea"". But recently it was described as anticancer, antioxidant, antimicrobial etc (eg M. Nakata, T. Myoda, Y. Wakita et al.: Volatile components of essential oil from cultivated Myrica gale var. tomentosa and its antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. In: Journal of Oleo Science. 62, 9, 2013.) And alcohol is not the only psychoactive ingredient today, as you might as well throw in some hemp, (a drug in use long there before any European would know that this part of Asia would be called 'Europe') — or like it was done in Bohemia and Bavaria: hops! Unlike modern beers that are flavored with flowers of the hop plant, the Eberdingen-Hochdorf brew probably contained spices such as mugwort, carrot seeds or henbane, in Stika’s opinion. Beer makers are known to have used these additives by medieval times. Excavations at the Celtic site have yielded a few seeds of henbane, a plant that also makes beer more intoxicating. In that sense the purity 'law' for beer from Bavaria can be seen as a double sided sword. Most gruit components improve taste and effect, being more on the stimulating side, while hops has a profound downer effect. One call it the first consumer protection law for quality control, others see  an early form of prohibition at work: alcohol and stimulant combination can more easily fuel rebellion and outrage, while sleepy hops beer consumers make very good subjects. More inspiration on that found in ""Of Hony. A collection of Mediaeval brewing recipes for mead, metheglin, braggot, hippocras &c. — including how to process honey — from the 1600’s and earlier."" by Mistress Elska á Fjárfelli (Susan Verberg, 6/2018.) Example recipes: 4 Strong claret for the house [?].

If deficient in sugar, take a potel of honey. Especially for medieval mead, the intense bitter wormwood Artemisia absinthium and its thujone make for an actually pleasant tasting drink. To name a few candidates more, from recent folk tradition, albeit in Romania: Folklore sources have a rich representation of the use of native  flora or imported vegetal products for various purposes, hence the classification of herbs as “medicinal”, “mythological”, “inspirational”, “magic”, etc.
The mandrake has a central role in therapeutic and psychotropic representations, and has been regarded as an epitome of miraculous plants, with numerous mystical and magic powers. It has been known and used as an aphrodisiac and for the dilation of the pupils (large and bright eyes, a standard of beauty in the medieval times, hence the name of belladona), anaesthetic, antidepressant, but also knowing the toxic potential of an overdose – a state of ecstatic frenzy (see the maenads – priestesses of Bacchus), and erotic hallucinations (due to the parasympathomimetic substances: hyoscyamine, atropine, scopolamine). In the folk Romanian medicine, we also found other potentially psychoactive plants: bay laurel, jimson weed or devil’s trumpet (Datura stramonium), valerian (Valeriana officinalis), corn poppy, aconite or monkshood (Aconitum tauricum), the Herb of Grace (Gratiola officinalis), ergot (Claviceps purpurea), henbane (Hyoscyamus niger), motherwort (Leonurus cardiaca), white bryony (Bryonia alba), cowbane (Cicuta virosa), harmal (Peganum harmala) (contains the alkaloid harmaline, a MAOI, similar with telepathine from Ayahuasca), known as early as the Getae-Dacian’s times 1. Confusingly, but based on a clinical similitude, most of these plants were described under the generic name of mandrake, a ritual and healing archetype of the ethnobotanical research. — Gabriel Gorun & George Cristian Curcă & Sorin Hostiuc & Octavian Buda: ""“Legal highs” in Romania: historical and present facts"", Rom J Leg Med 19 73–76 [2011] DOI: 10.4323/rjlm.2011.73 (PDF) All these weeds and herbs and leaves and roots and seeds and barks and mushrooms were pressed into pills, most famously in 'oriental happy pills'. Functionally these are equivalent to ma'jun or electuary. These were also applied as suppositories or topically in so called flying ointments, delivering the good stuff transdermally. Since these work best on thin parts of skin or even mucous membranes, that method gave rise to what the perversely minded religious people imagined as witches rubbing that onto a broom, to… well, ride on it into the sky. Stuff like hemp or frankincense was also burned in numerous combinations. Catholic mass really gets you into different mood than a Protestant meeting that merely tells you to work harder. In fact all ancient religions are closely linked to psychoactive drug use, as evidenced by written accounts and archaeological record. The entire Christmas business is another such occasion when copious amounts of cinnamon, nutmeg, saffron, pepper etc were consumed in amounts that even after long caravan travel wouldn't have lost that much of their pungency, but retained some of their mood lifting or even hallucinogenic aspects. Cookies get you a bit high, and not solely from sugar. A note on these exotic spices and their alleged price: saffron is the most expensive of them all. It tastes quite lousy and makes the dough or rice a bit of a nice yellow colour. If it weren't for the psychoactive effects nobody would bother to pick up these tiny stamps from small flowers. Children are of small enough weight to get 'situations' with it, but it works on adults as well. That said, nutmeg is unique for its nice concentration of psychoactive oils. But they are also found in for example parsley. As we now think often of 'drugs' as isolated substances having a profound effect, this is neither helpful for describing pre-modern drug use, nor the effects of combined consumption. How much nutmeg anyone consumes is less relevant than how much eugenol is within a persons system and how effectively is it transformed in the liver, how long can it act on neuronal target sites, before it's metabolised. All of these steps can be influenced by co-administration of other foods, drinks and drugs. From balancing out side effects to dramatically increasing them, the range of possibilities is huge. The works of ethnopharmacologists summarise these practises, even if they rarely focus on middle age Europe.

But just like traditional Chinese medicine, the old European pharmacopeia includes stones, metals, and animal products. And not all of them are hokum. While some unfounded legend might surround European bufo toads' secretions usage of for example metallic arsenic in the form of hidrach widely gathered in Europe since ancient times is documented for medical and recreational use in Europe until the 1930s. One very notable historic reference supports the first ethnographic evidence of an early ""smoking culture"" in temperate Eurasia (Sherratt 1995). This indication concerning Cannabis comes from Herodotus (c. 446 B.C.), in which he describes the post-funeral purification ritual of Scythians on the Pontic steppes: ""On a framework of three sticks meeting at the top, they stretch pieces of woolen cloth, taking care to get the joins as perfect as they can, and inside this little tent they put a dish with red-hot stones on it. Then they take some hemp seed, creep into the tent, and throw the seeds on the hot stones. — M. D. Merlin: ""Archaeological Evidence for the Tradition of Psychoactive Plant Use in the Old World "", Economic Botany, Vol. 57, No. 3 (Autumn, 2003), pp. 295–323 This was different in the past: during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance the unique sensorial qualities of saffron were employed socially to encode the dried stemma of the crocus sativus L. as an object of conspicuous consumption reserved for the wealthy. Newly discovered sources demonstrate that the perception of saffron was a complex phenomenon that builds on the sensorials but surpasses them: as a tonic, mood elevator, antidepressant, and  hallucinogenic drug saffron could be used to achieve various altered perceptions ranging from heightened sensitivity to states of trance. — Volker Schier: ""Probing the Mystery of the Use of Saffron in Medieval Nunneries"", The Senses and Society, 5:1, 57–72, 2010. Quite notable in this regard is the pharmacological oeuvre of Hildegard von Bingen, a nun. She described substances and recipes as well as their (mind altering) qualities in quite some detail. Nutmeg lifts the mood in certain doses, makes you funny in higher ones, and quite stupid in the long run… To modern readers, some of these descriptions in her work might read a bit strange, as they are based on and described according to humoral theory. But her hands-on experience with many substances is evident nonetheless. She is not only known for being a mystic and building her knowledge on ancient Greek and Latin authors, but also a documented sufferer of migraines – and consequently self-medication. Nutmeg [nux muscata] has great warmth and good temperament in its strength. If a person eats nutmeg, it opens the heart and purifies the senses and brings a good disposition. Take some nutmeg, an equal weight of cinnamon, and a little cloves. Grind these to a power, add a similar amount of whole wheat flour and a little water, and make a paste from this. Then eat it often. It will calm all the bitterness of heart and mind, open the heart and clouded senses, and make the mind joyful. It will purify the senses and diminish all the noxious humors; it will contribute good liquid to the blood and make one strong. Belladonna [dolo] has coldness in it. It holds weariness and sluggishness in its coldness. In the earth and place where it grows, diabolic influence has some part and union in its craft. It is harmful for a person to eat or drink it because it agitates the spirit, just as if the person were dead. Nevertheless, if the skin and flesh are perforated with great and piercing ulcers, let the person take a little goose fat and as much deer and goat tallow as he or she can get. Add a little bit—just as a single drop from a pen—of belladonna juice. Mix all this together and make an ointment. — Bruce W. Hozeski (transl): ""Hildegard’s  Healing  Plants – from her medieval classic Physica"", Beacon Press: Boston, 2001. The nutmeg mix is now part of a classic recipe for cookies, albeit in much lower dose then what went around in monasteries at the time… Note though, that the tried and proven psychedelic effects of all of these ingredients might actually be more like micro-dosing in many cases, as we seldom have exact measurements for the actual amounts used. And for some of these, the 'therapeutic window' is small. Not everything is as harmless as cannabis. (Hildegard's take on it) For one, there might have been quite a few high-class psychedelic mushroom poisonings, suffered by people trying out something new they found in the woods. On the other hand eating false wheat or if in wet summers rye get infested with Claviceps purpurea a lot of people will have experienced ergot poisoning. In other words, suffered from an LSD experience they didn't want, with added cramps and other physical discomfort and worse. Europeans apparently kept the knowledge to use this medically, for example to induce abortions, but seemingly lost the ability to separate the hallucinogens from the pure poison, a feat the Greeks once mastered for rituals. In one Late Old English magico-medical text written at sometime in the late tenth or early eleventh century AD the following recipe is found: ‘A sleep-drink: radish, hemlock, wormwood, henbane; pound all the plants; place in ale; let stand one night; give it to be drunk.’ This evidence, though very late, tends to show that rather than using henbane for its potential psychedelic effects, as some have suggested in the case of the Scottish find, it was used in beer as part of traditional medical lore; however, without providing proper quantities such a recipe could easily turn into a fatal drink rather than a simple sleep potion. — Max Nelson: ""The Barbarian's Beverage: A History of Beer in Ancient Europe"", Routledge: London, New York, 2005. (PDF) A most interesting aspect of old plants is that some of them we think we know – and find harmless. But they may be not: A typical one, dated 800 AD, from the Benedictine monastery at Monte Cassino in southern Italy, used a mixture of opium, henbane, mulberry juice, lettuce, hemlock, mandragora, and ivy. There is no evidence to suggest that similar recipes existed in the British Isles at that time. However, in 1992, an extensive study succeeded in identifying a large number of similar recipes in late medieval (12th–15th century) English manuscripts. All identified the anaesthetic, a drink, by the name dwale. A typical manuscript (fig 1), translated into modern English, reads: “How to make a drink that men call dwale to make a man sleep whilst men cut him: take three spoonfuls of the gall [bile] of a barrow swine [boar] for a man, and for a woman of a gilt [sow], three spoonfuls of hemlock juice, three spoonfuls of wild neep [bryony], three spoonfuls of lettuce, three spoonfuls of pape [opium], three spoonfuls of henbane, and three spoonfuls of eysyl [vinegar], and mix them all together and boil them a little and put them in a glass vessel well stopped and put thereof three spoonfuls into a potel of good wine and mix it well together. In addition to alcohol, the ingredients in dwale are, in order of their listing, bile, hemlock, bryony, lettuce, opium, henbane, and vinegar. — Anthony J Carter: ""Dwale: an anaesthetic from old England"", BMJ 1999;319:1623–6 That lettuce part reads quite intriguing? Healthy leafy greens – for anaesthetics? Even ordinary modern lettuce is known to contain substances that makes males impotent and kills sexual desire in both sexes. But in this case, it is even worse – or better? – than that. The wild form of lettuce is a whole different beast than the lust killer on modern sandwiches. Lactuca virosa was grown, harvested, processed and used just like opium. Only slowly loosing ground when real opium – imported, as unstable weather in Northern Europe isn't ideal for stable and predictable alkaloid content –  became cheaply accessible. — John M.

The most comprehensive English language survey of the archeological evidence for Cannabis early history in Europe is by Godwin (1967b). Dörfler (1990) provides a more recent German language overview of both macro-fossil and pollen evidence for the early distribution and diffusion of Cannabis in Europe. Bartley et al. (1976) shows Cannabis pollen from the Durham lowlands that comprise 19% of the total pollen count in a continuous curve from 1730 to 852 BP. Birks (1965) shows a Cannabis occurrence from Cheshire Moss dating to ca. 1350 BP. Peglar (1993) studied the vegetational history around Diss Mere on the eastern English coast and revealed an almost continuous Cannabis pollen curve for the area from ca. 1100-150 BP. Using a pollen percentage diagram, she showed the almost mirror-like occurrence of hemp with cultivated rye, flax, barley, and mustard (Brassica) as well as the near omnipresence of plantain and nettle (Urtica). Historical records show the area was the center of the hemp industry in England. Pursehouse (1961) noted that 15% of all sown areas in the Waveney valley supported hemp, and her study correlates with this information nicely. Her diagram showed a very rich pollen assemblage, and there are good records of the flora and climatic conditions around the area, but her study had some potential weaknesses. First, the sediments she studied were calcareous, which can skew carbon-14 dating (Peglar 1993), making pollen-influx diagrams and rates of palynological change impossible to accurately document. Secondly, she admitted that sedimentation rates for the area may also show marked changes, and local disturbances are likely to have re-deposited pollen grains in the study site.  — Michael P. Fleming & Robert C. Clarke: ""Physical evidence for the antiquity of Cannabis sativa L."" Anglo-Saxons brought their hemp culture with them to England. Definitively  written evidence for psychoactivity comes from around 1200, but overall Europeans who wrote were drunks, primarily:  Nonetheless, until the 20th century there is a paucity of European written references to cannabis’s psychoactive properties, perhaps due to the popularity of beer and wine (Mikuriya 1969). — Barney Warf: ""High Points: An Historical Geography Of Cannabis"", Geographical Review 104 (4): 414–438, October 2014. In summary we can conclude that it is indeed very likely that almost everybody tried and then used almost everything that agreed with him/her. On the scholarly level we find written records detailing a large portion of known inebriation substances, so the theoretical and scientific framework would have been available. From archaeological finds we see indicators of seeds, pollen, tars and other residues that also indicate widespread knowledge and use of old, traditional and newly introduced drugs. What we lack is a continuous tradition that would reliably show the oral wisdom of folk medicine or drug culture. Equally problematic is the lack of concrete measurements in recipes and sometimes difficult to trace 'active ingredients' as correct and unambiguous identification was and is sometimes difficult. It is for example unclear why the bog bilberry Vaccinium uliginosum is commonly called the 'inebriating' or 'drunken berry' in Germany, as neither inebriation after consumption nor druglike substances in it could be found (the accusation of 'folk etymology corrupting translation from Latin ruscus is not convincing on the one hand and even if true opens up a multitude of mixups in identifications). For the whole of 'England' and the entirety of 'high middle ages' it is also not very likely to paint a really detailed and complete picture. While we might infer a lot from what was there, what was known what was available, we cannot infer with certainty whether everyone was more or less intoxicated all the time. Local fashions might have differed quite a lot: one village in effect preferring beer with henbane alkaloids, another one next to it liking more the datura belladonna mix as 'our thing'."
"Why, in the US, is Japanese brutality ignored compared with the Nazi brutality in WW2?","Perhaps this is a generational thing? As a Gen-X'er, I grew up hearing about things like the Bataan Death March, The Rape of Nanking, and how in general the Japanese didn't feel like adhering to the Geneva Conventions, (as dramatized in Bridge over the River Kwai, among other movies and books). When I was a kid we also had lots more Pacific Theater veterans still running around, and they had a distinct tendency to be less than forgiving where their former opponents were concerned. As for this being a public school history education, that's kind of a sore subject. In the USA, K-12 textbooks have to get approved by state boards. Often these bodies are filled with idealogues who only signed up for this otherwise dull task because they have specific things they want taught (regardless of what the facts may be). Thus grade K-12 History textbooks tend to have flat out wrong things forced into them. Uncomfortable subjects (like the intense class warfare of the 19th Century) get ignored altogether. The best I can say about the result is that teachers typically make it so dull that at least kids don't learn most of the wrong stuff being taught."
"Is there any evidence to support the claim that the United States was ""suckered into WW1"" by Zionists, made by Benjamin Freedman in his 1961 speech?","Is there any evidence to support the claims made by Benjamin Freedman in his 1961 speech? No.  The United states entered the First World War in response to the exposure of the proposed military alliance between Germany and Mexico in the Zimmerman telegram, and Germany's stated intention to resume unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic.  Of course, in 1961, people had much less access to information than they do now.   In fact, the only truly shocking thing about these claims is that anyone still believes them in the 21st century, when we have such easy access to the information and resources needed to disprove his assertions! Is there any evidence for the claim that the Balfour Declaration was  a kind of 'receipt' for services rendered? No.  In fact, the correspondence leading up to the issue of the Balfour declaration has been in the public domain since the 1930s.  That correspondence shows that the question of the future of Palestine had absolutely not been settled when the United States entered the war on 6 April 1917. Let's deal with the subsidiary claim first.  Were the Germans 'shocked' when they found out about Balfour Declaration at Versailles?  Is it possible that the Germans really had ""no knowledge until Versailles""? If they really were shocked, it was presumably about how appallingly bad their intelligence gathering must have been.   The Balfour Declaration was issued in November 1917. It was addressed to to Lord Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland.  The British were then so determined to keep the document secret that they published it in The Times newspaper on 9 November 1917:  Click to enlarge EDIT 12 May 2019 A comment by @jamesqf below asks a very good question:  Why should the Germans have cared about the Balfour declaration? The answer is simple. In 1917 Palestine was still an active front in the war.  The Battle of Jerusalem was also being fought in November 1917. German intelligence would have been very interested in any and all intelligence relating to Palestine at that time.  At the most basic level, a division in Palestine was one that couldn't be on the Western Front.  That sort of thing really matters in a war of attrition! Germany was also just as aware as the British of the propaganda value of the declaration for Zionist groups around the world.  Indeed, Chaim Weizmann's autobiography, Trial And Error, refers to negotiations between Zionist groups the German government in late 1916 (p185). The idea that the Germans were shocked when they found out about the declaration at Versailles is simply not credible. The correspondence leading to the Balfour Declaration has been in the public domain for decades (UK National Archives reference CO 733/347/7).  Not only that, but the correspondence relating to the proposed publication of that correspondence is also in the public domain (UK National Archives reference CO 733/248/19) (bureaucracy can sometimes be the best friend of historians). In addition, some Foreign Office correspondence relating to Palestine in the period     1916-1918 is also available from the UK National Archives (reference FO 800/176).  This is part of the digital microfilm records collection which is currently free to download. Given past Russian treatment of its Jewish population, it is perhaps unsurprising that many Jewish communities around the world viewed the Triple Entente with suspicion.  It is also unsurprising that the allies recognised the importance of the Jewish lobby - particularly in the United States, but also elsewhere. Of course, Russia was not the only country to have persecuted its Jewish population, and a letter in FO 800/176 makes the explicit point that Romania (another member of the Allied Powers): ""... has never carried out the provisions of the Treaty of Berlin of 1878 in regard to her Jews. Perhaps public opinion prevents her from doing so."" Wikipedia page on the Treaty of Berlin (1878) In early 1916, the Jewish 'aspirations' for Palestine, had been presented by Lucien Wolf as follows: ""Great Britain and France, in the event of Palestine at the conclusion of war coming within the sphere of influence, to take account of the historical interests of the Jewish community in that country.  The enjoyment of equal political rights with the rest of the population, of civil and religious liberty, of such municipal privileges as may be essential in towns and colonies inhabited by Jews and of reasonable facilities for colonization and emigration to be secured for the Jewish population"" At the same time, the British government was looking to get assurances from Russia, ""... for the proper treatment of Jews in Russia. But explicitly asked the question: ""Could or would Russia keep any promises that she might make for the betterment of the Jews in Russia and what could England and France do to keep her to her engagements?"" So, there is no doubt that the Balfour Declaration was the end product of a long process attempting to encourage Jewish communities around the world to support the allies. The problem for Mr Freedman's assertion, is that it is clear from the documents that Britain and France had by no means agreed a future position on Palestine when the United States entered the war on 6 April 1917. Letters dated 16 April 1917 and 22 April 1917 in FO 800/176 show that no decision had yet been made about whether Palestine should be a protectorate of Britain or France (or even the United States), never mind the future of the region. The letter of 22nd April states:  ""... Lloyd George's view seems to be that we shall be in Palestine by conquest and shall remain and that the French will have to accept our Protectorate; and - which is quite true - that we are the only people fit to rule a mixed population of Mahomedans, Jews, Roman Catholics and all religions ..."" So Mr Freedman would appear to be completely wrong about the nature of the Balfour Declaration. Since the individual who posted the comments (and, apparently, Benjamin Freedman!) seems unfamiliar with the Zimmerman telegram, and its importance to the entry of the United States into World War One, it is perhaps worth presenting a summary of the salient facts here. In January 1917, the German Foreign Office sent a secret diplomatic telegram proposing a military alliance between Germany and Mexico.  The telegram was intercepted and deciphered by British intelligence.  The British then sent copies to President Wilson.    Click to enlarge Decrypt: We intend to begin on the first of February unrestricted submarine warfare. We shall endeavor in spite of this to keep the United States of America neutral. In the event of this not succeeding, we make Mexico a proposal of alliance on the following basis: make war together, make peace together, generous financial support and an understanding on our part that Mexico is to reconquer the lost territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. The settlement in detail is left to you. You will inform the President of the above most secretly as soon as the outbreak of war with the United States of America is certain, and add the suggestion that he should, on his own initiative, invite Japan to immediate adherence and at the same time mediate between Japan and ourselves. Please call the President's attention to the fact that the ruthless employment of our submarines now offers the prospect of compelling England in a few months to make peace.
  Signed, ZIMMERMANN President Wilson revealed the existence of the telegram to the press on 28 February 1917 and the press published the story the following day, 1 March 1917. At this point, many Americans thought the telegram might be a British forgery, but on 3 March, the German Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmermann publicly admitted the telegram was genuine.  The reasons for this have been dealt with in another question here on History:SE. As you might expect, this caused outrage in America.  Furthermore, Germany's stated intention to resume unrestricted submarine warfare brought back memories of the sinking of the RMS Lusitania in 1915.  The result was a groundswell of popular opinion in favour of America declaring war against the German Empire on the side of the allies.   (That is not to say that there weren't still many who still opposed the war.  Both sides wrote to their senators and congressmen to express their opinions - see below) Moving on to the cited source, which is a speech given by Benjamin Freedman in 1961.  Wikipedia describes Mr Freedman as: ... an American businessman, Holocaust denier,and vocal anti-Zionist. So my expectations were fairly low to begin with.   There is nothing in that speech to challenge Wikipedia's description of Mr Freedman, and even though my expectations were low, his speech failed to meet them.  Indeed, when it comes to historical veracity, that speech managed to plumb unexpected depths. Among other nonsense, Mr Freedman claims that: ""... [the United States] were suckered into -- that war merely so that the Zionists of the world could obtain Palestine.   Now, that is something that the people  in the United States have never been told. They never knew why we went into World War One."" going on to claim that: ""... the newspapers had been all pro-German..."" but ""the Jews"" somehow persuaded all the American news media to change how they wrote about Germany in response to a deal over Palestine, and ""... shortly after that, Mr. Wilson declared war on Germany."" He claims that the Balfour Declaration was a form of 'receipt' saying: ""The receipt took the form of a letter, and it was worded in very cryptic language so that the world at large wouldn't know what it was all about.""  He then states that at the Paris Peace Conference: ""... they produced, for the first time to the knowledge of the Germans, this Balfour Declaration.   So the Germans, for the first time realized, “Oh, that was the game!  That's why the United States came into the war.”  And the Germans for the first time realized that they were defeated, they suffered this terrific reparation that was slapped onto them, because the Zionists wanted Palestine and they were determined to get it at any cost."" Conspicuously absent from Mr Freedman's speech is any mention of the Zimmerman telegram, or the German resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic in early 1917, but perhaps that is not surprising! So, let's deal with those points in turn. Was the Balfour Declaration written in very cryptic language so that the world at large wouldn't know what it was all about? No.  We have the text and it is hardly what most English speakers would call 'cryptic'.  German intelligence had fluent English speakers on their staff (much as British intelligence employed fluent German speakers). We can probably assume that more of his audience in 1961 had never heard of the Balfour Declaration, and that fewer still had read it.  However, in the 21st century we have the advantage of the Internet so we can check (and the actual text can be read in The Times article above). Did the German delegation really see the Balfour Declaration for the first time at the Paris Peace Conference? It seems highly unlikely, given that it had been published in a newspaper.  The idea that German intelligence had failed to notice the announcement frankly beggars belief! Did Woodrow Wilson declare war on Germany? No. Under article 1, section 8, of the United States Constitution, it is the United States Congress which retains the authority to declare war, not the President. In fact, Woodrow Wilson asked that a Special Session of Congress be convened to declare war on the German Empire.  That session convened and debated the President's request and the issues surrounding that request, before formally declaring war on 6 April 1917. So, the big question.  Was the United States ""suckered"" into the First World War so that ""the Zionists of the world could obtain Palestine""? Well, no.   As we saw above, the key reasons were the exposure of the proposed military alliance between Germany and Mexico in the Zimmerman telegram, and Germany's stated intention to resume unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic.  But do we have to rely on secondary sources like history books or tertiary sources like Wikipedia to confirm this?  Can't we go to the original records and check the primary sources. In fact we can.  The records have been released to the public and many are available online. So, if we are to discover the reasons why the United States actually declared war on Germany, the obvious place to look would be the records of that debate. The record of that Special Session, which ran from 5 March 1917 to 16 March 16 1917 can be found in the Congressional Record, Volume 55, Part 1 (March 5, 1917 to April 24, 1917).  Copies can be downloaded in PDF form from the US Government Publishing Office, archive.org, and several other sites, but be aware that the file sizes are very large - especially if you are working from a mobile device. The records include a lot of administrative detail which is not particularly relevant to the central matters for which the Special Session was convened, but the business of government still had to be dealt with. After that, a number of representations to Congress are included.  Many, especially from German-American and pacifist groups, were opposed to American involvement in what they describe as a 'European war'.  Many more were in favour of the United States declaring war on the German Empire, and it is fascinating to read about the wide variety of people who had written to express an opinion. Almost nobody who has ever read anything about the events leading up to America declaring war on Germany will be surprised to discover that the two issues that dominated the debate were the Zimmerman telegram, and Germany's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic.   I shall quote just one example to illustrate the point.   Republican Senator Lawrence Y. Sherman from Illinois was no fan of Democrat President Woodrow Wilson.  During the debate he remarked: ""[President Wilson] said other nations had a right to spill as much blood as they pleased, and that it was no concern of ours. He called for absolute neutrality. The destruction of the Lusitania, the policy of unrestricted submarine frightfulness, created in his bosom no horror; it shocked no sensibility; it caused no proclamation, no convening of Congress in special session, or attack upon the rules of the Senate. He viewed it with indifference and dismissed it without apology or regret."" and yet he expressed his willingness to vote in favour of a declaration of war on the German Empire.  He gave his reasons as follows: ""Two things have decided me on that course. One is the danger zone created by an arbitrary decree at Berlin some time ago, in which the open sea was withdrawn as a way of commerce for the neutral world. The open sea has been made a theatre of war involuntarily to peaceful nations. so that no ship, belligerent or neutral, can navigate it. I regard it as indefensible, as utterly without right as to neutrals in either peace or war. It is destructive of our maritime rights. Again, the admitted effort of Zimmermann, in charge of foreign affairs for the German Imperial Government, who has undertaken to involve Japan and Mexico against us, is an indication of deliberate hostile intent. Whether it would have come to any practical end or not, we need not inquire to-day. It is sufficient that it is admitted that this was done, and I regard that alone as an act of war against us. It justifies us in the passage of such a bill;"" The text of the resolution was a follows: WHEREAS, The Imperial German Government has committed repeated acts of war against the Government and the people of the United States of America; therefore, be it Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the state of war between the United States and the Imperial German Government, which has thus been thrust upon the United States, is hereby formally declared; and That the President be, and he is hereby, authorized and directed to employ the entire naval and military forces of the United States and the resources of the Government to carry on war against the Imperial German Government; and to bring the conflict to a successful termination all the resources of the country are hereby pledged by the Congress of the United States. On 4 April 1917, the Senate voted on the resolution. it passed with 82 votes in favour and 6 votes against. The resolution came before the House of Representatives on 6 April 1917, with 373 votes in favour and 50 votes against. "
Why did Canada not join the American Revolution?,"Short Answer: The Canadiens were tired of war and content with British rule. Long Answer: Twenty-some years before the American Revolution (1754), which was just before the Seven Years War, this is what the map of British Colonies looked like:

Only a few areas of modern-day Canada were British then: Nova-Scotia, Labrador-Newfoundland, and around James' Bay & Hudson's Bay. Quebec extended south to below Niagara falls. The 13 American Colonies were centered around New-York City:
 1.) Geographic Separation caused the English speaking British colonies north of Maine to be culturally distinct from the 13 American Colonies. The people of Nova Scotia were half New Englanders and half Germans, Highlanders, Ulstermen and Yorkshiremen. Nova Scotia wished to remain neutral. British Naval power and a British Garrison at Halifax prevented any serious American attempt at invasion. In 1777 Nova-Scotian outposts came under attack from New England privateers seeking plunder. That caused even former New-Englanders to form militias and defend their homes. Soon thereafter the New Light religious movement (Great Awakening) started by Henry Alline of Rhode Island swept through New England and Nova Scotia turning attention away from politics. 2.) Acceptance of British Rule: When New France fell in 1760, the defeated armies, French officials, some seigneurs, and some merchants returned to France. British credit, currency, and markets such as London was what mattered--not Paris or America. The British successfully implemented representative government in Quebec through respecting the religious freedoms of Catholics and recognizing the political value of the Catholic Church, which was backed by a dutiful French populace that contrasted sharply with the restive 13 American colonies. 3.) The Quebec Act of 1774 satisfied Quebec and angered the American colonies. It allowed English criminal law to exist in parallel with French civil law and the entrenched seigneurial system. Quebec even had a (legal) mandatory tithe to the Catholic Church, which only concerned Catholics. The Quebec Act also expanded the province of Quebec to include Labrador in the East and extended the Western boundary to the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers all the way north to Rupert's Land. This expansion had the obvious intent of funneling the fur-trading areas serviced through the St. Lawrence into the jurisdiction of Quebec. The land was mainly Indian territory (where the Indians were allied with the French) that was exploitable for the fur trade without endangering Indian land rights and risking war. American colonists desired to settle these native lands, and therefore listed the Quebec Act as one of the ""Insufferable Acts."" Furthermore, the accommodations given to Catholic religious practice angered and frightened the fiercely anti-Catholic Americans, who often viewed the Anglican British as in league with Catholics. In fact, the Dominion of New England ended, and the New England colonies separated administratively again, after the Anglican royal governor was overthrown amid rumors that the governor was planning to take over the area in the name of the Pope. 4.) Cultural and Religious Isolation: Quebec was the largest British colony in what is now Canada. The language barrier combined with the foreign religion of French Quebec and the history of hostilities from the Seven Years War caused Americans to view the people of Quebec as foes. 5.) Patriot attacks on Canadiens solidified opposition to the American revolution. American Patriot generals Richard Montgomery and Benedit Arnold Attacked Quebec in an attempt to seize Canada from British control (1775). They took Montreal and laid siege (ultimately unsuccessfully) to Quebec City, where British regulars and a few Canadien militia defended. The Americans were ill-supplied but stayed till spring, when the British navy sailed up the St. Lawrence. It also became true that in the wartime alliance reached in 1778
between France and the young American republic, neither partner really
wanted to see the other established at Quebec, preferring to have it
left to Britain rather than that either of the two new ""friends""
should hold it. 6.) Economic Interests: The merchants of British North-America benefited from the influx of British troops (and money) which powered the offense south from Quebec. The Canadians also profited from access to the tariff-protected British markets, which far larger New England competitors had forfeited through the act of war. The fur market in particular began to thrive in Canada. The British Navy on the Atlantic and by British military power in the interior both guarded the fur trade. Businessmen came to recognize that their economic stake in the
imperial system far outweighed any political discontent over the
Quebec Act -- and that Act, after all had re-attached the valuable
southwest fur domains to Canada. Hence the merchants' sense of
commitment increased with the flow of trade on into the 1780s; as they
saw that their St. Lawrence commercial realm was tied both to Britain
and to Canada's own growth westward. Factors of geography and business
interest in effect were shaping the prime leaders of Montreal into
British imperialists and Canadian economic nationalists combined. 7.) Many Loyalists moved to Canada to support the British cause. . Conclusion: pardon the quotes As for the mass of French Canadians in the province (of Quebec), they
began to follow their seigneurial and clerical elites into their own
commitment to the British side. Naturally the Canadiens still put
their distinct community concerns and heritage first; yet they also
concluded that the Americans should not be welcomed, but kept outside.
The self-proclaimed republican ""liberators"" had simply turned out to
be the same old enemies, les Bostonnais, the Puritans of New England:
stabling horses in Catholic churches during their invasion, paying in
worthless paper money for crops and supplies seized from habitant
farms. The Canadiens did not learn to love their British conquerors as
a result -- why should they? -- but did grow to believe that they were
better off with them. For the provisions of the Quebec Act had
guaranteed French Canada's own special rights and character under
British rule: guarantees which the Americans certainly would not have
given. Instead angry American outcries had greeted the Act because of
the very grants it had made to the ""French Papists"". Thus for
different but historically sound reasons, neither the Francophone and
Anglophone communities of Quebec province took to the American path of
revolution. They stayed within the remaining British empire -- above
all, to avoid being swallowed up in another emerging empire, that of
the United States. Addendum: St. Johns, PEI, and Newfoundland The little neighbouring Atlantic province, the Island of St. John, was
hardly likely to affect the course of empires. It certainly continued
in British keeping -- although an American privateer raid on
Charlottetown in 1775 carried the acting governor and two officials
off to General Washington, who did not want them, and sent them home.
The big island of Newfoundland also suffered, and more harshly, from
American privateering ravages. But here British garrisons and naval
squadrons still blocked any real threat to imperial control. In any
case, the war years brought the island flourishing times in its
essential cod fishery, particularly for residents, since many of the
visiting overseas fishermen had been drafted into the Royal Navy. Thus
Newfoundland, too, stayed surely within Britain's American empire. Great Lake Indians At the other, western end of empire, war spread through the inland
forests below the Great Lakes, from the Iroquois country to the Ohio
and Michigan wilderness. In the upper reaches of New York province,
patriot rebel forces contended fiercely with units raised from
loyal-minded settlers in the area. But further, the Six Nations
Iroquois and their traditional homelands were heavily involved. The
Tuscaroras and Oneidas largely sided with the Americans. The rest of
the Six Nations, and especially the Mohawks, supported the British;
for here old bonds of alliance held strong. They had been well forged
under Sir William Johnson as Indian Superintendent till his death in
1774, to be maintained thereafter by his son and heir, Sir John
Johnson, later to become Superintendent in his own right. For the most in-depth discussion of this topic I could find see this Canadian Heritage Book (free), which is the source of the quotes and much of the content in this answer."
Cultural understanding of Penelope's suitors,"Xenia is a concept that represented the relationship between guests and hosts in Ancient Greece, and is a recurring theme in the Odyssey, Iliad, and other Greek works. Essentially, Penelope was fulfilling the expected cultural role of a generous host, whereas the suitors were breaking their role as courteous guests. For adhering to that culture's expectation of hospitality, Penelope and her family were rewarded, and for breaking the customs the suitors were justly punished. Owners/caretakers of a home were expected to be hospitable to any guests or travelers that might show up at their door, offering them food and drink, a bath, and even gifts when they finally leave. It was the duty of a host to take care of guests, because the guest could be a god in disguise who would reward or punish the host's behavior. In the Odyssey, Penelope/Telemachus were fulfilling this custom as expected, such as offering the suitors endless food and drink and Telemachus being courteous to the disguised Athena. As guests of a house, travelers were expected to be courteous to the hosts, offer a gift if possible, and not be a burden. The suitors clearly broke every part of this custom, and as punishment they were killed by Odysseus upon his return. The host-guest relationship, and why you shouldn't abuse it, is demonstrated several times in the Odyssey: the cyclops Polyphemus was far from hospitable to Odysseus and his men, so none of the gods (except Polyphemus' father, Poseidon) cared when Odysseus broke his role as a courteous guest by blinding Polyphemus. Circe was turning guests into animals, so Hermes helped Odysseus confront her, showing that not even gods were above being hospitable to guests."
Where is the bloodiest square mile on Earth?,"The square mile around the Colosseum in Rome seems a likely candidate for most deaths using conventional weapons. Within a mile of the Colosseum were the Circus Maximus and the Roman Forum where there were also thousands of deaths. As most of these deaths occurred during the Roman Republic and Empire, the most commonly used weapons would have been knives/daggers, swords and spears, but many were also strangled or killed by animals. The Roman Forum was where thousands of captives, criminals and even Roman soldiers were executed, especially before the Colosseum was built. In 206 BC, for example, 4000 or 4500 soldiers of a rebellious legion were executed there. Nearby were the Mamertine Prison where prisoners were either strangled or left to starve to death, and the Tarpeian Rock where people were executed by being thrown off the edge (though I'm not sure if the latter is within a square mile of the other locations). The Circus Maximus, dating back to at least the 6th century BC was also the scene of thousands of deaths and executions, especially before the Colosseum became the main arena for gladiator fights. Julius Caesar upped the scale of gladiator fights long before the Colosseum was built and, according to Pliny the Elder, Caligula (died 41 AD) had 20,000 gladiators (but perhaps we should make this 10,000 as Pliny was known to exaggerate).  It was most famous for the thousands of chariot races held there over the centuries until the 6th century AD: one chariot racer, Gaius Appuleius Diocles, took part in 4,257 races over 24 years, but he was an exception as most racers had very short careers due the high death rate. For the Colosseum, coming up with a definite number is impossible, but we can at least begin to make an estimate based on the pieces of evidence we have. For gladiators, Keith Hopkins and Mary Beard in The Colosseum estimate 2,000 per year (with big fluctuations) for Rome and base this on one in six gladiators dying in combat in the arena. The estimate of one in six is in turn based on evidence from Pompeii; as there is also evidence from Campania that sometimes half were killed, one in six seems fairly conservative. This gives 710,000 gladiator deaths in Rome over the 355 year period the Colosseum was used for such fights. Many of these deaths would have been criminals forced to fight as gladiators (often in large groups) rather than highly trained professionals going one on one. As the Colosseum was by some distance the biggest, most important and most used venue in Rome, it is highly likely that most of these deaths occurred there (Wiki lists only two other arenas in Rome during the time of the Colosseum, one of which was for training). These deaths occurred both in major events and ones which have not been recorded in any detail by history. For an example of the former, the Emperor Trajan, to celebrate his conquest of Dacia (roughly modern
  Roumania), gave games in AD 108-9 lasting 123 days in which 9,138
  gladiators fought To the above we must add executions and spectacles using slaves and criminals. The latter did not always involve deaths, but reenactments were a popular way of dispatching hundreds of condemned men at a time. For executions, it is impossible to give a definite number but sometimes several thousand captives, runaway slaves and criminals were executed during an event. Thus, the estimates given by various sites of a total (gladiators + executions/spectacles) of 400,000 to 700,000 people killed in the Colosseum do not seem unreasonable. The large majority of these would have been criminals, captives and condemned slaves rather than trained gladiators.  Source:The Colosseum in Rome To the above must be added the numerous deaths in ancient Rome from the city being sacked several times, and that political upheavals/purges (e.g. Sulla's proscriptions) and riots also led to large numbers of deaths. Unfortunately, establishing how many of these were in a specific area is, of course, impossible. Finally, we need to consider the number of homicides in an area (within one square mile of the Colosseum) that has been populated for at least 2,200 years but, again, it is impossible to give a number (though the homicide rate in ancient times in nearby, densely populated Suburra was reckoned to be very high). The Colosseum itself occupies just 6 acres out of the 640 acres in a square mile. Even if there have been square miles with more deaths by conventional weapons, it is unlikely that these 6 acres can be surpassed anywhere in the world. The scale of the carnage was such that disposing of the bodies (human and animal) was a major logistical problem. If the scale of these deaths is hard to believe, never mind comprehend, consider the following from Keith Hopkins, formerly Professor of Ancient History at the University of Cambridge: Rome was a cruel society. Brutality was built into its culture in
  private life, as well as in public shows. The tone was set by military
  discipline and by slavery. The state had no legal monopoly of capital
  punishment until the second century AD. Before then, a master could
  crucify his slaves publicly if he wished. Seneca recorded from his own
  observations the various ways in which crucifixions were carried out,
  in order to increase pain. At private dinner-parties, rich Romans
  regularly presented two or three pairs of gladiators: 'when they have
  finished dining and are filled with drink', wrote a critic in the time
  of Augustus, 'they call in the gladiators. As soon as one has his
  throat cut, the diners applaud with delight'. It is worth stressing
  that we are dealing here not with individual sadistic
  psycho-pathology, but with a deep cultural difference. Roman
  commitment to cruelty presents us with a cultural gap which it is
  difficult to cross. Although animals are definitely not within the scope of the question, it seems appropriate to at least mention that the killing of beasts was on a scale most likely unprecedented in history. Such was the Roman thirst for animals to kill in the arena that numerous species disappeared from North Africa. Note: one answer on Quora gives 3,120,000 people killed in the Colosseum, but this is based on a misinterpretation of Hopkins & Beard's calculations. Other sources: Gregory S.

Why weren't Indians converted en masse to Islam or Christianity?,"First, the easier part on Christianity. As the other reply says, the British were (mostly) unwilling to convert Indians in order to avoid inflaming local religious sentiments. In fact, the British were so cautious on this that they would probably even tolerated the practices of sati and child marriage had some Indian reformers (such as Ram Mohan Roy) not goaded them into stopping it. However, the regions where the Portuguese had power (sometimes before the British), such as Goa have substantial number of Christians. As for conversion to Islam, the question is more difficult. Almost 90% of India was occupied by the Islamic rulers at some point or another, many of them intolerant of other religions, and it is difficult to say why much of India remained unconverted. One reason that many historians cite is Hinduism's rigid caste hierarchy, which created a social structure that was difficult to dismantle."

Which culture used no personal names?,"This would seem to be a piece of folklore. Anthropologists have not found a single society which does not use
  personal names in some form; they are a human universal. However, the
  forms that these names take and the ways in which they are bestowed
  and used vary between cultures. Source: Abstract from Ellen S. Bramwell, 'Personal Names and Anthropology'. In Carole Hough (ed.), 'The Oxford Handbook of Names and Naming' (2016) William Bright (1928-2006), formerly a linguist at the University of California and then  at the University of Colorado, also covered this in a 2003 article What IS a Name? Reflections on Onomastics: There is a piece of folklore current among anthropologists regarding
  the question of whether personal names exist in all societies. So far
  I have not been able to trace this to a printed source, but it is
  somewhat as follows: Somewhere in the world there is a society where
  people live in very small, isolated communities. In such a community,
  people have no personal names; i.e., individuals have no name which
  other people use to refer specifically to them. Instead, they are
  referred to by descriptive expressions, e.g., ‘the blacksmith’ or ‘the
  man who lives by the stream’. A woman will be referred to as, e.g.,
  ‘the blacksmith’s wife’. Children will be referred to by expressions
  such as ‘the blacksmith’s elder daughter’; when this daughter gets
  married, she may be referred to as, e.g., ‘the wife of the man who
  lives by the stream’. He concludes that no such society exists, that any anthropologist who might have reported such a community was misled
  by the operation of taboos on uttering personal names. I suggest, in
  fact, that the use of personal names, having varying levels of
  descriptiveness, is a sociolinguistic universal of the human species. Bright points out that  in non-literate societies, where names remain unwritten, there is
  greater variety in naming customs (cf. the anthropological studies in
  Tooker 1984). A child may be given a “real” name at birth, but this
  may be kept a secret throughout life. Elsewhere, such a “real” name
  may be publicly known, but not used for everyday purposes; most of the
  time, a nickname—perhaps descriptive, e.g., Shorty—may be used. A
  person may be called by different names at different periods of life,
  or by different people under changing conditions. Use of certain names
  under particular circumstances may be forbidden by religious taboo; or
  then again, such names may be replaced by descriptive nicknames.
  Because of these factors, it may be difficult for the outside
  investigator of such a society to determine what a person’s “real”
  name is, or even what name is commonly used in the community; taboos
  are likely to be especially strict when one is talking to outsiders. An Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS) article Aboriginal families in Australia (1995) by Professor Colin Bourke and Eleanor Bourke illustrates how confusing the issue of names can be: In many Aboriginal societies personal names were rarely used. People
  were addressed by kinship terms. Some were referred to as being
  someone else's son or daughter. In such societies personal names were
  seen as being part of that person and were used with discretion. This
  was often manifested by a deceased person's personal name being
  removed from that language for some considerable time. Most languages
  had a word meaning 'no name' which was used to refer to those persons
  who had the same name as a recently deceased person. Also, Wulf Schieffenhövel's article Reactions to cultural change (1997) in the journal Civilisations relates the problems the author encountered with the Eipo in the Highlands of West-New Guinea: Each of them also seemed to answer my question: «An si?», what's
  your name? It was only later when I had mastered the first steps into
  this highly structured language, that I realized what these names
  meant: Na-si-gumnye, Na-si-walwal, Na-si-urang, «I-the-one-who-has-no-name», «My-name-I-don't-know', «I-am-somebody-else». To give away one's dibe si, the «real name»,
  exposes oneself to possible harm. Other studies from other regions of the world also show the importance and sometimes confusing (to outsiders) use of names: the Ilongot in the Philippines (where people ""acquire and lose"" names during their lifetime), the Kadayan in Brunei and Malaysia, societies in Central Brazil, and the Mohawk people. These studies illustrate the ""diversity of the processes involved in naming and using names"". Stephen Wilson, in The Means of Naming: A Social and Cultural History of Personal Naming in Western Europe (UCL Press, 1998), outlines just how important names have always been in societies, even though (as he notes elsewhere) historical documents have often not recorded them. In all societies...and more so in complex ones, a single individual is
  known by a variety of names depending on the role he or she is playing
  and the milieu of reference. So there will be one name used by close
  relatives of origin, another by spouses and lovers, another by
  children, another by friends, another in public, another at work, and
  so on. Again, names here serve as a kind of social map, placing
  individuals in the broader multi-dimensional landscape. Wilson's primary area of study was Western Europe, but he also cites Gregory Bateson's work, Naven (1936), on the Iatmul of New Guinea to show how important names are to both individuals and societies: Every spell, every song…contains lists of names. The utterances of
  shamans are couched in terms of names… Marriages are often arranged in
  order to gain names. Reincarnation and succession are based upon the
  naming system. Land tenure is based on clan membership and clan
  membership is vouched for by names. To summarize, all societies use personal names, but Names are given to people at different stages of life; they change or
  remain constant; they contain different elements; they connect with
  relatives or tribes or they do not; they are used freely or they are
  kept secret. Source: Ellen S. Bramwell, 'Personal Names and Anthropology'. In Carole Hough (ed), 'The Oxford Handbook of Names and Naming' (2016) (All emphasis is mine)"
When did bombs actually look like this?,"Early hand grenades looked like that: The word ""grenade"" originated in the Glorious Revolution (1688), where cricket ball-sized iron spheres packed with gunpowder and fitted with slow-burning wicks were first used against the Jacobites in the battles of Killiecrankie and Glen Shiel 
(Specimen made from glass, French, ca. 1740)"
Why Were Madagascar and New Zealand Discovered So Late?,"By and large new uninhabited landmasses were discovered in one of three ways: So let's look at #1. Here's what the coastlines looked like at the end of the last glaciation:  Notice that while Australia is still not connected to Eurasia, it comes damn close. Also (if you squint a bit) there are all sorts of convenient island chains in between the two. Also notice that the distance between Madagascar and Mozambique is almost unchanged, as is the distance from Australia to New Zealand, and those distances are far greater. The navigation techniques employed by hunter-gatherers are generally not designed to work far out of sight of land. A boat that is good for coastal fishing and/or transport is a far cry from something one could entrust their life to in the open ocean. Ocean navigation itself requires a whole suite of specialized techniques (including math) that really can't be developed in societies lacking the stratification and specialization afforded to farming societies. So given that the distance to the horizon is about 5KM (3 miles), in the absence of convenient mountains, any body more that about 10KM from the coast is going to take some luck to bump into. The further off, the more luck needed. Madagascar is 419km across the Mozambique channel at its closest point. Even if Mount Everest happened to be on the other side of that channel, it would not be visible to a sailor within sight of the African side. New Zealand is ten times that distance from Australia. There's pretty much no way a breeding colony of humans is going to just randomly bump into that. So this means both landmasses were in wait of a farming society to discover them. Enter the Austronesians. They had a agricultural package of domesticated crops and livestock that allowed for job specialization, and used it to create a specialized class/guild of navigators in their society. These folks developed and passed on the open-ocean sailing techniques that allowed their society to discover and populate a third of the globe. Of course discoveries of nearby islands brought the opportunity for more discoveries, so this process took some time to finish populating the entire Pacific. New Zealand wasn't hit upon until about the 13th Century.  Native Australians of course were physically closer (but still not close!). However, being hunter-gatherers, they simply did not have the means to bridge that gap. Now, how about Madagascar, you might ask? After all, there were farmers in Africa pretty much as early as there were farmers anywhere on earth! Shouldn't it have been discovered earlier by African farmers, and not had to wait for Austronesians to find it? The problem there was the initial farming package in North Africa was temperate climate crops. These don't grow very well south of the Sahara. A different tropical crop package was developed there, relying on millet and sorghum. This didn't happen until about 2000 BC directly south of the Sahara in West Africa, and it took a large amount of time for these farmers to displace the hunter gatherers in their march across the continent, and then south. They didn't reach Mozambique until 1-2,000 years ago, and by then the Austronesians were either already living in Madagascar, or nearly there."
Did ancient peoples ever hide their treasure behind puzzles?,"One man's lock is another man's puzzle. Combination locks have been used since at least ancient Rome. Whether the lock uses numbers or letters (or other symbols), the combination to be entered may be set based on a riddle or some other piece of knowledge as a mnemonic. The lock is meant to be solved at some future time by someone who has the correct knowledge. The intention of the one who put the lock on was most likely that it only be ""solved"" by authorized persons, but to a thief it is a puzzle to crack. Lockpicking is as old as locks themselves, and while mechanical solutions are probable--it is likely the codes were sometimes cracked as well. "
"Is it true that ""All spicy food is from Latin America""?","While it is true that most hot spices originated in the Americas, spicy food was evident in most ancient civilizations and originated from many different regions of the world. There is both physical and literary evidence for the use spices and spicy food dating back to antiquity in Asia and Europe, as well as the Americas. The Cambridge World History of Food, vol. 1 lists numerous examples, among which are Grains of Paradise, a hot spice related to cardamom (date uncertain, origin: West Africa), Ginger (2nd millennium BC, origin: SE Asia), and Pepper (origin: prehistoric India). Then there is also Long Pepper, a hotter version of pepper (prehistoric, origin: India) and Cubeb (or Java pepper) originating in Java and Sumatra.

Why were Navajo code talkers used during WW2?,"In WW2 we didn't have digital computers. We didn't even have transistors. Even vacuum tubes were state-of-the-art. If you wanted to do cryptography on the battlefield, you used something like this Enigma machine.  Basically a fancy typewriter, it did all its encryption with gears and wires. If you wanted to send a message your radio operator had to check your code book for the daily key. Then come up with a key prefix. Then you either wrote down the message or dictated it to them. They typed it in and wrote down the result one letter at a time. Then they got out their radio and sent it via Morse code, probably the fastest part of the whole procedure. Though flawed, it was pretty good cryptography for the time and took an enormous effort to crack. This is all fine if you're a division commander safely behind the lines in your command vehicle, but if you're a platoon leader on the front lines getting shot at, lugging around an oversized typewriter is a bit slow and cumbersome. Not to mention a radio operator and precious code books that you don't want falling into the hands of the enemy. Even having a radio was a luxury in WWII. If you were in the US army, and you were really lucky, you might get one of these...  ...an SCR-536 ""handie talkie"" radio! State of the art with FIVE vacuum tubes! But you probably got an SCR-300 ""walkie talkie"" which was literally a backpack.  While it was capable of sending Morse code, operators obviously preferred voice. If you thought encrypting Morse code with a typewriter was bulky, slow and impractical, if you wanted to do voice communications you used this.  Say hello to SIGSALY! Weighing in at a mere 50 tons and using just 30kW of power. SIGSALY essentially added and then subtracted pseudo-random noise from the conversation using vinyl records as a one-time pad. A set of those records had to be distributed to all users worldwide. With all that in mind, finding some guys who speak a language your enemy doesn't understand makes a lot more sense. It wasn't just Navajo who were code talkers. Cherokee, Choctaw, Lakota, Comanche... even Basque was used. Any language it was unlikely the enemy knew or even had books for. Even Pig Latin could be effective at confusing a non-native English speaker trying to make out a message over a crackly radio. While this was security-through-obscurity, that worked a lot better back in WWII. Tactical radios had a very short range, a few miles, so it was unlikely anyone in range knew the language and it's not like they could order a Navajo-Japanese dictionary on Amazon. Since it was voice, and recording equipment was bulky and expensive, it was very unlikely anyone in range could record it for later analysis. Even if they did, it was used to transmit tactical information; by the time it was decoded it would be useless. One of the myths about the Code Talkers, at least the Navajo, was that, at the time, they had no written language and thus you couldn't learn it without a native. This was not true. Instead, the written language began as various transcriptions either to provide information to US military scouts, or more often for missionaries. In 1917 a Bible was published, God Bîzad, which featured a transcribed alphabet, basic pronunciation guide, and basic word examples. In the 1930s and 40s the Bureau of Indian Affairs developed a unified written language. By 1943 you could get a dictionary and grammar guide, The Navajo Language. You could even get a typewriter with Navajo characters and a newspaper, Ádahooníłígíí."
Has an individual ever purchased an entire country?,"In 1699, Johann Adam Andreas von Liechtenstein bought Schellenberg and in 1712 the county of Vaduz. The county was operating under feudal principles, thus perhaps might not be considered a country in the modern meaning, but comes close. Schellenberg and Vaduz have been united in 1718, got the status of Fürstentum and were renamed to Liechtenstein, the name it holds since then."
Why was Africa colonized last of the continents in the Age of Discovery?,"In fact during the Age of Discovery, Africa had been the principal objective. It really begins with Prince Henry the Navigator, a son of the King of Portugal who had an intense fascination with Africa.  In particular he was taken with the legend of Prester John, said to be a descendant of one of the Three Magi who presided over a magical land with marvels such as the Fountain of Youth.  Prince Henry believed Prester John's kingdom to lay in Africa, somewhere around Ethiopia.  He felt if the Portuguese could find a sea route around the Muslims they could find this fantastic land.  Plus, he wanted to know where the African gold was coming from, and find a way to stop pirate attacks against Portugal. Henry's passion led him to gather together some of the leading mapmakers and to seek out innovative ship designs and navigation techniques, with the objective of developing the technology of exploration for purposes of sea travel along the West African coast.  He sponsored expeditions to nearby islands and down the coast until they achieved a route around the Sahara Desert.  This enabled the establishment of a mercantile trade in slaves and gold. Building on these discoveries, the Portuguese pressed on to East Africa and eventually India, and established a strong monopoly over the trade routes they established. Spain also wanted in on the action, but the monopolies over the African routes didn't give them many options, until Columbus and his crazy ideas came along. Columbus was from Genoa in North Italy but since childhood had been bouncing around the Mediterranean and Atlantic on various trading expeditions, eventually getting involved in some of the West African Portuguese trading.  During this time he had been self-educating with whatever books he could find.  He came up with some rather novel (and wrong) ideas including a misunderstanding of the exact size of the Earth.  Like so many engineering errors, it was a units error:  He used the shorter Roman mile instead of the Arabic mile, resulting in a circumference of 30,200 km rather than 40,000 km.  He further estimated Asia as much larger than in actuality, and believed in the existence of the mythical land of Antilla with its Seven Cities. So, due to compounding of various misconceptions and errors, Columbus underestimated the distance from the Canaries to Japan as 3,700 km, rather than the true distance of 19,600 km (or 12,000 km if North America didn't exist).  He applied to the Portuguese king, but his experts correctly rejected his estimations as too low.  Plus, the Portuguese had just discovered an eastern route to Asia thanks to Bartolomeu Dias, so what did they need Columbus' far-fetched ideas.  The Spanish monarchs, looking for some sort of advantage in the European trade struggles but also doubting his calculations, weren't so picky.  And thus America was discovered.  Fortunately Columbus understood how the Trade Winds worked or he'd have never returned. Spain had an advantage of a surplus of experienced soldiers following the Reconquista, although many of these adventurers were organized as mercenary groups and had history been different could well have been expected to sign on with the Portuguese. Shortly thereafter it became clear that Spain and Portugal would be fighting over the new discoveries.  With the Church's help the Treaty of Tordesillas was established in 1494, essentially giving Portugal rights to Africa and Asia and parts of South America, and Spain rights to most of North America and the rest of South America. This did enable Portugal to colonize Africa, which they attempted in Angola, Mozambique, etc.  Portugal also established a ton of small trading forts and territories along their trade routes, much as Spain was attempting in the New World. The difference was germs.  In Spain's case, whereever they landed the natives would contract European diseases and begin dying off in greater and greater numbers.  They failed to find the valuable trade routes they were after, but found that enslavement of the locals and colonization could return similar profits.  With the European diseases depopulating the natives and primitive firearms giving a military edge, Spain found that small numbers of European colonists could dominate large amounts of land.  Portugal's holdings on the other hand were filled with people not nearly as susceptible to European diseases, and while they attained rather amazing routes eastward as far as Japan, they never managed to establish strong enough colonies to displace the natives; the one exception of course being their South American colony of Brazil.  The two powers continued with their differing strategies - the Portuguese building better trade relations while the Spanish expanding through conquest. As a consequence, Portugal never really needed to colonize Africa to achieve their aims. Later, other European powers sought to get involved.  Having been left out of the Treaty of Tordesillas they simply chose to ignore it and focus on whatever lands looked ripe for the taking.  Thus the Dutch, Russian, French, and British took colonies in North America, Africa, and Asia, but only in North America - with foreign disease wiping out locals - were they particularly successful."
Why did Churchill order the destruction of the bombes?,"If you, as a nation, have the capability to decode communications, then why give that up? This is a fallacious assumption, and probably the source of your confusion.  Destroying the bombes did not amount to the British ""giving up"" their code breaking capabilities, as the bombes were essentially mechanical ASICs, designed specifically to break the encryption provided by the Nazi Enigma systems.  With the defeat of the Nazis, there was simply no need to break Enigma encoded messages on an industrial scale, as there was no one broadcasting such signals in range of British listening stations.  So, for almost all practical purposes, these devices became useless with the fall of the Nazi regime.  However, the minds behind those machines were still available to the British government, and if needed, they could be called on to build new bombes, or similar machines to break different cipher systems. The danger of keeping these devices around is that they revealed just how good the British had become at code-breaking, which was a secret that was very closely held.  The bombe has even been referred to as the most important machine in the history of Britain, which may be an overstatement, but it certainly had a huge impact on the course of the war.  Had the Germans known, they would have undoubtedly deployed countermeasures that the British may not have been able to penetrate, and the massive advantage the British enjoyed would have been lost.  This thought was certainly on Churchill's mind as he pondered the fate of these devices - the defeat of the Nazis did not mean that all of Britain's enemies and adversaries were vanquished, and revealing their incredible code-breaking ability to adversaries (such as the USSR) would have been a huge strategic blunder.  It was safer, and more prudent, to destroy the now-obsolete machines that were evidence of their code-breaking proficiency, and enlist the mathematical geniuses behind the bombes to build new machines to break the new or different codes that would be used by other countries going forward. that ability should, if nothing else, discourage others from even trying, or at least give a head start in case someone did try to use encrypted communications. Well, two things here.  It's actually much more advantageous to have someone communicate in a code they think is unbreakable, but that you can listen in on, than it is to try to discourage encryption.  If your adversary thinks you can break their code, they'll use a different code, and/or change the medium to one that you can't intercept (directed radio waves, in-person couriers, etc.), but if they're confident you can't listen in, they'll communicate freely and allow you listen in by breaking their ""unbreakable"" code.  Secondly, the foundations of cryptanalysis were already established by the minds at Bletchley Park, and the bombes, specifically, wouldn't really help much in advancing code breaking on whatever the next cipher was going to be.  The real magic behind the machines was the mathematics and the cryptanalytical theory/techniques that underpinned the machines.  This is what was valuable for future use.  And again, the best way to keep this capability a secret was to destroy the physical evidence (the machines themselves) and keep the minds behind them working in secret."
What knowledge may have been lost at the Library of Alexandria?,"Italian author Lucio Russo argues in his book Forgotten Revolution that a large part of the scientific knowledge of Hellenistic world has been lost. I find his arguments very convincing. Exact sciences in the modern sense of this word originated in Ptolemaic Egypt and other Hellenistic states, and reached very high degree of development. Few first class works survived, like Euclid, Apollonius and Archimedes, but there is a lot of evidence that this is just the tip of the iceberg. For example, almost all writings of Hipparchus, ""the father of astronomy"", are lost. We know about them from the account of C. Ptolemy who lived 3 centuries later. Nothing survives of the work of Seleucus of Seleucia, who was Hipparchus contemporary. Ptolemy does not mention him, probably because he was a heliocentrist. Or look at the ""Antikythera mechanism"" on Wikipedia and elsewhere, to get some evidence of what was lost. L. Russo is a mathematician, and on his opinion, the level of development in some areas of mathematics in Hellenistic time was not really surpassed until the XIX century. I am also a mathematician, and I confirm this. This does not only apply to exact sciences. Critical scientific study of ancient texts, as we understand it now, also apparently originated in these Hellenistic states. A legend says that one of the Ptolemaid rulers tried to buy the original texts of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides from Athens. The Athenians refused. Then he asked to borrow them to copy. The Athenians agreed, but required an enormous security deposit. He payed the deposit, and did not return the original manuscripts :-) I suppose they were kept in Alexandrian Library. (Where else?) The same Ptolemy issued the order that all ships arriving to Alexandria must be inspected and searched for books. All books found must be confiscated, and copies made and given to the owners:-) So we really lost a lot with the Alexandrian library.  When exactly it disappeared and how, is also subject to discussion. Some blame Julius Caesar who started a fire during a battle that destroyed a large part of the library. Other people say that it still existed at the time of the Arab conquest and was destroyed by the conquerors. And many events in between are also mentioned. The fact is that Claudius Ptolemy (astronomer, who probably worked in Alexandria in the 2 century AD) could read Hipparchus. And we cannot. In fact almost all work in astronomy before Ptolemy is lost. And all work in mathematics before Euclid is lost. We recently learned from secondary sources that there was highly developed combinatorics in the Hellenistic times (Habsieger, L.; Kazarian, M.; and Lando, S. ""On the Second Number of Plutarch."" Amer. Math. Monthly 105, 446, 1998). None of the original work survived. We know the name of the great polymath
Posidonius (135–51 BC) whose scientific output is comparable with that of Aristotle. He wrote on all sciences. All his works are lost. The philosopher and logician
Chrysippus (279-206 BC) was regarded by contemporaries higher than Aristotle. None of his works survived. None of the works of the founder of scientific medicine, Herophilos (335-280), survived. The great engineer (mechanic, hydraulic, pneumatic)
Ctesibius (3d century BC) is credited for many inventions. All his work is lost. Several sources frequently mention enormous warships of Hellenistic era
(tesserakonteres and leontophoros are the largest mentioned) whose crew could exceed the crew of a modern aircraft carrier. Historians speculate for the last 2000 years how these ships looked and how could they be constructed. No clear description survives. REMARK for a mathematician. What we know of mathematics before 300 BC mostly comes from Euclid. Imagine that from our contemporary period only Bourbaki books survive... REMARK 2. There is a consensus among modern scientists that Democritus of Abdera was one of the greatest scientists who ever lived. Here is the list of works of Democritus, as given by
Diogenes Laertius: The Great Cosmology; The Lesser Cosmology; Cosmography; On the Planets; On Nature; On Human Nature; On Intelligence; On the Senses; On the Soul; On Flavors; On Color; On Diverse Movements of the Atoms; Of Changes in Shape; The Causes of Celestial Phenomena; The Causes of Atmospheric Phenomena; On Fire and on Things in Fire; The Causes of Acoustic Phenomena; Concerning the Magnet; The Causes of Seeds, Plants and Fruits; On Animals; A Description of the Sky; Geography; A Description of the Pole; On Geometry; Geometrical Reality; On the Tangents of the Circle and the Sphere; Numbers; On Irrational Lines and Solids; Projections; Astronomy; Astronomical Table; On Rays of Light; On Reflected Images; On Rhythm and Harmony; On Poetry; On the Beauty of Song; On Euphony and Cacophony; Concerning Homer, or on Correct Epic Diction; The Science of Medicine; On Agriculture; On Words; On Names; On Values, or on Virtue; On the Disposition which Characterizes the Wise; On Painting; A Treatise on Tactics; Circumnavigation of the Ocean; On History; The Thought of Chaldea; The Thought of the Phrygians; On the Sacred Writings of Babylon; On the Sacred Writings of Meroe; On Fevers and the Coughs Deriving from Illness; On Aporiae; Legal Questions; Pythagoras; On Logic, or Criterion of Thought;

Did slaves have slaves?,"Short Answer Yes. There are examples of slaves owning slaves from different historical periods and in different regions of the world, including: Details Ancient Near East In the Neo-Babylonian period (605–333 BC), there is a wealth of documentation about slaves, working in three
capacities. First, there was a small number of royal slaves....Then
there were slaves as janitors owned by the temples...Finally, the
largest and best-known group of slaves were those owned by private
persons. Among them we see great variety in the tasks performed, from
agriculture to loan-sharking. ...The loan-sharking slaves could become very rich and in some ways quite
powerful. They could marry in legally recognised weddings and must
have known the high and mighty who gave them loans. They probably had
access to amenities that very few free Babylonians could afford, and
many apparently invested for themselves on the side and so controlled
their own money as a peculium. They also owned their own slaves. But
they never were allowed to accumulate enough money to buy their
freedom or the freedom of their loved ones. Source: K. Bradley & P. Cartledge (eds), The Cambridge World History of Slavery, Vol 1: The Ancient Mediterranean World, p.15 M. A. Dandamaev's key work Slavery in Babylonia: From Nabopolassar to Alexander the Great (626-331 B.C.) states that slaves also owned slaves (and land) during the (earlier) Neo-Assyrian period (911 - 609 BC).

that all his slaves (mamdlik) were manumitted  ""and he [the free man]
has slaves and his slaves have slaves."" In such a  case, according to
Malik ""only his [i.e., the free man's] slaves are manumitted and his
slaves' slaves are left in the possession of those of his slaves whom
he had manumitted, [remaining] enslaved to them .""  Given that
slaves could own other slaves, Malik granted a male slave  licit
sexual access to his female slaves, subject to the same restrictions
as a free owner. Late Medieval Mallorca In late medieval Mallorca, after it had been taken from the Moors by James I of Aragon, there is scattered evidence of Mallorcan freedpersons and slaves
owning slaves. In 1337, the Greek Serena, from the village of Muro,
unconditionally manumitted her slave Antonia. At the end of the
century, the slave Catalina petitioned for back pay owed to her slave
Antonio. The practice continued into the fifteenth century, as when
the freed Circassian slave Margarita manumitted the four month - old
daughter of her Bulgar slave in 1404. Source: Kevin D. Mummey, 'Women, Slavery, and Community on the Island of Mallorca, ca. 1360-1390' (Ph.D thesis, 2013) West Indies Slaves also owned slaves in the West Indies. James Rodway, in The West Indies and the Spanish Main (1899), contrasted the difference between slaves of rich planters and those owned by poor white men and other slaves. the miserable, broken-down creatures sold cheap as refuse lots to poor
white men or even to slaves. Yes, the slaves bought their diseased
fellow-countrymen, to work on their own allotments, treating them as
the costermonger sometimes does his donkey. Half-starved, hard-worked,
and covered with sores, they lingered in misery until death came to
make them free. Some were so disfigured with yaws, or leprosy, that
none but a negro could bear the sight of them; these were kept out of
the way and treated worse than mangy dogs. 19th Century Brazil Mieko Nishida, in Slavery and Identity: Ethnicity, Gender, and Race in Salvador, Brazil, 1808-1888 (Indiana University Press, 2003) refers to ""slaves owned slaves"": ex-slaves or sometimes even slaves themselves, who did own any other
form of property owned slaves. Pre-colonial and colonial East and West Africa This is very well documented, partly due to the involvement of Dr. Daniel O’Sullivan-Beare, the Vice Consul on Pemba Island in 1895. One early case was that of Mzuri Kwao: Mzuri Kwao became a mtumwa ya mtumwa, a slave of a slave. This is a
term that is rarely discussed in the literature on enslavement along
the coast. Yet it comes up several times in the documentation of
slavery on Pemba. Being the slave of a slave meant that the
slaveholders had little benefit to offer slaves in terms of social
status or even security. If slaveholders were enslaved themselves,
they could not guarantee where their own slaves could live, whether
they would be resold, and who would inherit them at the death of their
owner, among other problems. However, the ownership of slaves by other
slaves indicates the ability of slaves to own property even before the
British Abolition Decree. Source: Elisabeth McMahon, 'Slavery and Emancipation in Islamic East Africa' (Cambridge University Press, 2013) In a footnote, McMahon gives further information and references on slaves owning slaves, also mentioning West Africa Prestholdt discussed the concept of slaves owning slaves as a means to
remake their status in the society. Jeremy Prestholdt, Domesticating
the World: African Consumerism and the Genealogies of Globalization
(Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008), pp. 134–40. Abdul
Sheriff mentions this in passing for mid–nineteenth century Zanzibar
Town. Sheriff, 1987, p. 149. Klein notes in passing that is was a
common system in West Africa; rather than slaves buying their
emancipation, they bought their own slaves because it gave them more
security in old age. Klein, 1998, p. 13. On slave hierarchy, McMahon's book contains a clear example in East Africa: Within the social world of slaves there existed a hierarchy based on
gender, occupation, and the process of enslavement. Slaves of equal
social status referred to each other as njoli. Thus vibarua would
describe each other as njoli, but a kibarua would not call a mtumwa ya
nyumba a njoli because their positions were not socially equal.
Vibarua usually lived in urban centers independent of their owners.
They paid a daily or monthly wage to their owners, wherein mtumwa ya
nyumba mostly lived in rural areas doing hard agricultural labor under
the oversight of owners or overseers. Slave hierarchies were in fact widespread; for further examples, have a look at The Diversity of Private Slaving Strategies in Classical Athens and (for Imperial Rome) Slaves of Slaves: The Complex Status of Imperial Vicarii. (all emphasis is mine)"

Identify the era or any other clues from this soldier's picture?,"My thoughts so far: Standardized nametapes weren't a thing in the Army until at least the mid-50s, I believe, so this photo was taken after both the Korean War and the occupation of Japan ended. The shapka and parka imply a colder climate, and that plus the architecture of that house (note especially the curved roofline) means my best guess is that this was taken in Korea.  This guy's clothing is pretty interesting- he's got an army-issue parka, but quite nonstandard headgear and what appear to be pressed dark trousers. It's possible that he's wearing the old green service uniform under the parka, but then he should be wearing a tie, which I don't see evidence of. Maybe an off-duty staff soldier on a tour of the countryside? Hard to say, given the available info. Edit: I think I found the location referred to- 064953 is near the NE corner of a 100k grid square, so I checked the MGRS map for Korea, and there's one square with the NE corner near the DMZ. I figured that was the likeliest candidate, so I checked it out, and 064953 is right next to a town called Imjin-ri, in a hilly area overlooking a river. It's not 100%, but I bet that's the spot.

"How and when did the word ""nuclear"" replace the word ""atomic""?","Let's take Harry Truman as an example. He was born in 1884. The electron was discovered in 1897, which would have been Truman's freshman year at Independence High School. If he did take a physics or chemistry class at that school or at Spalding's Commercial College, models of the structure of atoms would not yet have been part of the standard curriculum. Maybe if he'd had a teacher who was exceptionally up to date on the latest advances in physics, that person might have mentioned the latest speculations on such things, including the brand-new plum pudding model of the atom. In that model, the atom consisted of some electrons along with a spherical part possessing a positive charge. Because chemical reactions don't change one element into another, the best understanding at the time was that the this spherical part was immutable. The spherical part didn't have a standardized name. Physicists might refer to it as the ""nebula"" or the ""pudding,"" but for lack of a specialized term, generally they would just call it the ""atom"" and depend on context so that it would be clear they meant just the positively charged part. If you wanted, for example, to change lead into gold, then you would have to split the lead ""atom"" (its positive sphere) into two smaller parts. This impossible feat would then be referred to as ""splitting the atom."" The atomic nucleus was discovered around 1911-1913 by Rutherford et al. So Truman would have grown up knowing the word ""nucleus"" only as a word that could refer to things like the nucleus of a cell, or figurative usages such as ""the nucleus of a new communist movement in Russia."" Nuclear fission was discovered in 1938-9, so it was cutting-edge science during WW II. Laypeople like Truman didn't know about this kind of thing in any detail, and therefore didn't have the new and specialized vocabulary for talking about it. From a modern point of view, we would say that both fission and fusion are nuclear processes, and we would talk about ""nuclear energy,"" ""nuclear fission,"" and ""harnessing the power of the nucleus."" But when political and military leaders talked about these things in the WW II era, they would use the vocabulary that they already knew: ""atomic energy,"" ""splitting the atom,"" and ""harnessing the power of the atom."" As shown by Brian Z's google ngrams graphs, it took until ca. 1950-1970 for the more precise and appropriate technical terminology to filter into the popular consciousness. Even Jimmy Carter, who did nuclear engineering work in the US Navy, would pronounce the word as ""nucular."" Mark C. Wallace wrote in a comment: Atomic splits the atom (fission); nuclear fuses nuclei (fusion) - they are two different processes. Neither is more accurate in general. This is wrong. Fission splits the nucleus. Fusion fuses nuclei. Both are nuclear processes. Examples of atomic processes are things like chemical reactions, fluorescence, or the emission of light by a neon sign."
Why didn't Roman emperors have harems?,"One key lies in their treatment of illegitimacy, or bastardy. In Roman society, as is typical of the West in general, illegitimate children had no formal link to their fathers. This was true from the earliest times, and lasted well into the Imperial period before a softening of the laws occurred in the second and third centuries.1 In the Roman setting, illegitimacy was chiefly a disability in inheritance law. It was a major problem in cases of intestacy, where the father either left no will or his will failed for technical reasons ... in Roman law illegitimate children had no legal relationship to their fathers.2 Conversely, in the Eastern societies (at least, the named examples with royal harems), all sons were acknowledged and given a place in the succesion line. Let us disregard the role of sexual jealousy and focus on the practical impact of such succession laws. Since any of them could produce the future emperor, all sexual partners of the ruler must be guarded from other men. This is to ensure that they could only be impregnated by the ruler himself, so that the correct progeny continue to sit on the throne. Indeed, this is why harems were commonly staffed by eunuchs6: In many of these cultures [practising castration] eunuchs were employed as harem attendants or guards. This was done to keep the attendants or guards from sexually interacting with the women or getting the women pregnant.7 The lack of formal rights to succession in the Roman system precluded the need for highly secluded, guarded harems in the style of the Orient. However, this does not mean Roman emperors behaved any differently in their sexuality.8 The Roman Empire was unabashedly a slave society. Slaves, being properties, were essentially at the mercy of their masters' whims. As is typically the case, slaves were commonly sexually exploited by their owners from at least the late Republican period. In [the first half of the second century B.C.] promiscuous, sometimes brutal, sex indulgences with slave women becomes noticeable in the Roman historical sources. In the following century this freedom of sex indulgence with female slaves become more marked and is openly discussed by Horace.9  Naturally enough, the Roman Emperors were no exceptions, though they may have been under more pressure to keep their activities hidden from the Roman public. Tiberius for instance was said to have bought numerous prostitutes to the relatively remote island of Capri. Similarly, the historian Publius (or Gaius) Cornelius Tacitus reported that Nero tried to hide his night life of sexual debauchery. [Petronius] described fully the prince's shameful excesses, with the names of his male and female companions and their novelties in debauchery, and sent the account under seal to Nero ... When Nero was in doubt how the ingenious varieties of his nightly revels became notorious, Silia came into his mind, who, as a senator's wife, was a conspicuous person, and who had been his chosen associate in all his profligacy. [Annales. 16. 19-20] The luridly detailed and particularly depraved tales of orgies, incestuous rapes and virgin fetishism involving emperors reported by Suetonius may or may not be accurate. Yet the mere fact that such rumours were preserved indicates that contemporary Romans did not find them so implausible.10 References:

Did World War II-era bombs actually whistle?,"It is true that bombs in World War II would make a whistling sound as they fell. This could be heard by both the pilot and the target, however due to the Doppler effect, they heard different things. The pilot would hear a high pitched whistle and as the bomb accelerated it lowered in pitch. The target would initially hear a higher pitched whistle than what the pilot heard because the target is in front of the bomb and the pilot is behind the bomb. The pitch would continue to increase until the bomb struck. This is assuming the bomb is going slower than the speed of sound. The bomb will not reach the speed of sound until it has fallen ≈19 500 ft. The whistles were purposefully attached to the bombs. Their purpose was to weaken enemy morale and to enhance the intimidation of dive-bombing. Look at the Stuka dive-bomber, a similar case. What other purpose did it's sirens have? As far as warning the target, it's too late to get to safety once you hear the whistle if you're not there already (bombs fall fast). Not all bombs were equipped with whistles, but they still all made noise as they fell due to air displacement (just not the famous whistling sound).
This Wikipedia page gives one example of bombs that were purposefully fitted with whistles.

Why did the Western Roman Empire collapse but not the Eastern Roman Empire?,"The biggest difference between the military threats of the Goths and the Huns compared to Persia was the migratory nature of the former versus the centralised (and thus spatially constrained) government of the latter. Rome and Persia had sparred against each other in the mesopotamian region for centuries, but, though one or the other might gain ascendancy, they were unable to maintain their advantage beyond their centre of gravity. In contrast, although germanic tribes had been fought off by the legions repeatedly over the centuries, when the Goths did finally break into the Empire, they brought their entire nation with them. It took just one sustained failure to deal a fatal blow to the Empire. Note that one of the reasons for the continued ebb-and-flow of the balance of power between the Persians and the Romans was that the Persians were also having to hold off similar migratory opponents on their north-east border (not always successful, as illustrated by the Parthian rule between the two Persian empires).  In this sense, Persia acted as a buffer for the Eastern Roman Empire, leaving only a small part vulnerable, north of the Black Sea. A good reason for the quality of the defenses of Constantinople!"
What damage did anti-tank rifles hope to inflict on tanks in WW2?,"Anti-tank rifles were made as a stopgap measure during and after WWI. The infantry needed something to stop a tank smaller than an artillery piece, and from further away than you could throw a grenade. There were no rockets. To give you an idea how desperate the US army was for anti-tank weapons, they tried shoving rifles and even rocks into the running gear of tanks to hilarious lack of effect (except on the rifle or rock). These tests were conducted in November 1939, two months after the invasion of Poland. Once WWII started, plenty of these anti-tank rifles were available and tank armor was thin enough that they were still effective. Even late in the war, tanks were designed with less armor in the sides and rear to save weight and so were still vulnerable to ambush. Better than nothing! The Germans considered anti-tank rifles to be such a threat to the sides of their tanks they added armored skirts, schürzen, to the sides of their tank hulls and turrets to protect against them. Modern ""spaced armor"" is used to defeat shaped charges used by many anti-tank grenades and rockets, but we know these were added to protect against anti-tank rifles. They did so because only the Soviets employed them in large numbers in WW2. When we think of tanks in WWII we think of great big hulking Tigers and well angled T-34s. But in the early stages of WWII the situation was quite different. Tanks were thinly armored. Here's the armor thickness of some of the main armored vehicles used by the Germans during the Battle of France mid 1940. Contemporary anti-tank weapons, too, were very small. The Panzer III's 37 mm was considered a good anti-tank gun in 1940. The Panzer II carried a 20 mm autocannon. It's only in the later war when the T-34 and KV-1 appear that guns and armor begin a rapid arms race. In this context, a 20 mm, 12.7 mm, or even 7.92 mm anti-tank rifle made sense. Another thing to realize is the bulk of armored forces were light tanks.  The Germans invaded France and the Soviet Union with mostly light Panzer I and IIs. While heavily armed and armored Allied tanks existed, particularly the French Char B1 and British Matilda II, they were very slow, and only available in small numbers. If you imagine a tank it is a huge armored box. The chance of hitting a vital point seems incredibly small. This is not true. With the exception of some odd experimental designs, WWII era tanks are incredibly cramped and incredibly complicated machines filled with all sorts of things that ""don't react well to bullets"". Every bit of available space is used to create as small a target as possible, and as light a tank as possible. Ammunition is crammed everywhere. You're very likely to hit a crew member, or a hydraulic line, or fuel line, or a fuel tank, or an oil line, or an oil tank, or a shell. Below is a cutaway view of the US M4A4 Sherman tank. Look at all that stuff to mess up! And that's without crew.  Source: The Sherman Tank by Roger Ford pages 28-29. For reference, here's a tour inside a T-34-85. Mind you, Soviet tanks are notorious for being built for short people, and The Chieftain is hilariously tall, but it should give you some idea. Your round might be armor piercing-incendiary like the 14.5 x 114 mm BS Soviet anti-tank round. Now your bullet is on fire and can ignite all those flammable things inside the tank. If you get a penetration it's not just the bullet bouncing around doing damage, but fragments of armor add a shrapnel effect. This is referred to as ""spall"".  Source: Think Defense: Vehicle Protection. Note: Spall liners were not used in WWII. Because of the spall effect, you don't even need a penetration to do damage. The first field-expedient way to stop a tank with a rifle was the reversed bullet. This was a normal cartridge with more gunpowder and the bullet placed in backwards. Instead of breaking apart, the flat end would hit the armor and squash transferring all its energy into the armor. Even with no penetration, the shockwave travels through thin armor and causes spall fragments to peel off the inside armor and bounce around the tank. This was later refined to make High-Explosive Squash Head (HESH) ammunition. Finally, for your viewing pleasure, 10 minutes of bullets impacting against armor in slow motion."
How did Israel win the Six-Day War?,"If you look only at the numbers, then Israel was bound to lose the war of course. The Arab countries had far more soldiers and they also had better/more equipment (the Soviet Union supplied them well). This view leaves out a number of important factors however: As to whether Israel had allies in this war: no. While the USA always supported Israel they did it mostly by diplomatic means. And they supplied Israel with weapons (it was Cold War - if the Soviets supply the Arabs then USA has to supply Israel). But nothing beyond that. The newspaper I linked to above says that this result ""would have been unthinkable but not for gross Arab incompetence"" - and I think that this is correct. In fact, Egypt claimed that Israel received military help from USA and Great Britain. As Wikipedia notes, these claims haven't been taken too seriously outside the Arab world. The death blow to the accusation was an intercepted phone conversation between Nasser and King Husein that Israel released to the press: Nasser: ...Shall we include also the United States? Do you know of this, shall we announce that the U.S. is cooperating with Israel?
  ...
  Nasser: Hello, will we say the U.S. and England or just the U.S.?
  Hussein: The U.S. and England."
Have there been any countries that voted themselves out of existence?,"Frequently. The most recent example might be Newfoundland and Labrador, which in 1949 voted to join Canada as its tenth province. A Dominion from 1907, the Newfoundland Legislature voted the country out of existence in 1933 when collapsing fish prices led to the threat of default on its World War One debt. This returned the country to colonial status governed by the Newfoundland Commission of Government appointed by Westminster. In 1949 a two-phase popular referendum voted on the second ballot to join Canada, by a margin of 52.3% to 47.7%. Although the Dominion of Newfoundland never ratified the 1931 Statute of Westminster, which formally ceded full individual sovereignty to the British Dominions, it did participate fully in the Imperial Conferences of 1926 and 1930 at which the agreement in principle on the terms of the Statue was reached between Westminster and the Dominions. However, a more succinct example might be the Thirteen Colonies. Following their victory in the American Revolution, the individual States all retained complete sovereignty while attempting to act and operate in a unified manner, under the Articles of Confederation, through negotiations of the Continental Congress. This was, rapidly, a complete and utter failure; and led to the development of the United States Constitution. As each sovereign State ratified the Constitution, by vote of its legislature it in effect voted itself out of existence as such and became only a partially sovereign State in the United States. The same argument of course holds for the Republic of Vermont, which existed as a sovereign state from 1777 to 1791. This ratification, and consequent surrender of sovereignty, has been shown both de facto (by the American Civil War) and de jure (SCOTUS on Texas v White  (1869)) to be permanent. Texas is a more complex example, covered in another answer. Through the course of 1866-7, during and following the Austro-Prussian War, the last three Hanseatic Free Cities of Lübeck, Bremen and Hamburg first surrendered military independence to Prussia, and then acceded economic and legal sovereignty to the North German Federation (effectively the Prussian Empire). While it is certain that there was suasion and coercion involved in both circumstances, in the end all three governments approved the negotiated terms. While formal dissolution of nominal independence would not occur until 1933, any notion of sovereignty had been surrendered in 1867 just as surely as it was by Bavaria, Baden, and the other German States in 1871. By the 1581 Act of Abjuration the rebelling provinces of the Netherlands jointly declared that in failing to uphold his obligations to his Dutch subjects, Philip II of Spain had ""forfeited his thrones as ruler of each of the provinces which signed the Act"". This act was simultaneously a declaration of both independence and full sovereignty by each of the provinces signing the Act: Full English text The States General of the United Provinces of the Low Countries, to all whom it may concern, do by these Presents send greeting: As it is apparent to all that a prince is constituted by God to be ruler of a people, to defend them from oppression and violence as the shepherd his sheep; and whereas God did not create the people slaves to their prince, to obey his commands, whether right or wrong, but rather the prince for the sake of the subjects (without which he could be no prince), to govern them according to equity, to love and support them as a father his children or a shepherd his flock, and even at the hazard of life to defend and preserve them. And when he does not behave thus, but, on the contrary, oppresses them, seeking opportunities to infringe their ancient customs and privileges, exacting from them slavish compliance, then he is no longer a prince, but a tyrant, and the subjects are to consider him in no other view. And particularly when this is done deliberately, unauthorized by the states, they may not only disallow his authority, but legally proceed to the choice of another prince for their defense. This is the only method left for subjects whose humble petitions and remonstrances could never soften their prince or dissuade him from his tyrannical proceedings; and this is what the law of nature dictates for the defense of liberty, which we ought to transmit to posterity, even at the hazard of our lives. And this we have seen done frequently in several countries upon the like occasion, whereof there are notorious instances, and more justifiable in our land, which has been always governed according to their ancient privileges, which are expressed in the oath taken by the prince at his admission to the government; for most of the Provinces receive their prince upon certain conditions, which he swears to maintain, which, if the prince violates, he is no longer sovereign. In the immediate aftermath of the Act, the United Provinces investigated various possibilities for a new Prince, including the Duke of Anjou and William the Silent, and of being an English Protectorate without obtaining any satisfaction. In 1588 the signatory provinces of the Act of Abjuration united as a confederacy, the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands or United Provinces for short, each voluntarily surrendering sovereignty. A key aspect of this question, and of any answers, must be the precise definition of sovereignty used. In my opinion a fully sovereign state must hold full authority over its own: An entity that possesses only partial authority over any of these has surrendered part of its own sovereignty, as well as part of the natural sovereignty of its citizens. If in exchange the state and its citizenry acquires a pro rata participation in the equivalent governance of a larger entity, that surrendering is possibly worthwhile. The question is raised in comments below as to the sovereign status of the Hanseatic Free Cities immediately before and after their accession to the North German Confederation in 1867. my position is that, the temporary interruption of the Napoleonic era notwithstanding, the ability of the Hanseatic Cities to wage war and negotiate treaties against the Emperor, as well as other foes, through its long history is full evidence of full sovereignty. However, as part of acceding to the North German Federation in 1867 the Cities of Lübeck, Bremen and Hamburg all fully surrendered control over: in return for participation in the same of the Confederation, and retained only partial control over their own:"
Why didn't Wehrmacht soldiers refuse to kill civilians?,"Saying that no Wehrmacht soldier ever refused to kill civilians or PoWs is wrong, there are documented instances of this happening. It's just that this did not happen often enough to make a difference. What happened to those who refused to participate? There is this study on some documented instances. In multiple cases, some punishment indeed was inflicted on refusers, but none were actually executed - although one man was incarcerated in Buchenwald concentration camp, which can probably be regarded as a de facto death sentence. Mostly though the case ended in demotion or transfer to another unit. Why these refusals did not happen more often, then? If there were so little of these cases, they probably were not well-known at the time. It also could be that these officially documented cases were only a small fraction amongst many other, more known to Wermacht soldiers cases - during WW2, ~50000 death sentences for insubordination were carried out in German army. If a soldier thinks that he might be executed for not following the (criminal) order, it makes it not a ""taking some kid's life for nothing"" situation, but ""giving my life for that kid's"" - not an easy choice for most humans.

Why did stock brokers go bankrupt after the crash of 1929?,"To expand on Schwern's answer somewhat, using leverage as a trader works more or less like this: Scenario 1: you have $1k of play money and use it to buy stocks. The market goes up 10%. You sell. You now have $1.1k. Net gain: $100, minus some transaction fees. Scenario 2: you use $1k as collateral for a loan to bring your play money to $10k. The stocks go up 10%. You sell. You now have $11k. Repay the loan. Net gain: $1k, minus some financial fees and some transaction fees. Suppose now that, in the above two scenarios, the market goes down 10% instead. The first sets you back $100; the second wipes you out. Suppose finally that the market goes down 20% instead. In the second scenario you're not only wiped out; you also owe whoever loaned you money an extra $1k. That whoever usually is your broker, and that is how they lost money."
When has a sovereign state last given territory to another as a gift?,"The UK transferred full sovereignty of its colony of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997. While the UK was already obligated by treaty to turn over the areas of the territory that was covered by the 99-year lease (the ""New Territories""), it decided to return the island of Hong Kong itself as well as Kowloon, which was voluntary at least in the sense that no treaty required it. One could make an argument that the transfer was influenced by political pressure from the PRC and the possibility of an invasion, but there was no actual violence. As @Relaxed and @TheHonRose mentioned, the UK also realized that the New Territories were essential to the survival of the colony and that a new, smaller colony consisting only of the island of Hong Kong proper plus Kowloon would not have been viable. There were population issues (are they all going to move across the border overnight?) as well as issues with essential infrastructure like ports being located in the New Territories."
Why was Britain willing to return Hong Kong but not Gibraltar?,"Despite common misconception, both Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula were ceded to the United Kingdom in perpetuity, via the Treaty of Nanking and the Convention of Peking, respectively. London was under no legal obligation to return them to China. However, most of the Crown Colony of Hong Kong actually consists of the New Territories. That was indeed a 99-year lease granted by the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory of 1898. By the time lease was coming up in the late 20th century, the three regions of Hong Kong were so integrated in their development that separation was impractical. Telecommunications, transportation links, utilities were all interlinked, and an artificial separation would have brought economic chaos. Meanwhile, China made it clear that it wished to resume sovereignty over the entirety of Hong Kong - both leased Chinese territory and British supposedly sovereign possessions. And that it was quite capable of doing so by force. Britain was not exactly willing to return Hong Kong. London did, however, understand the changed realities on the ground. The British Empire had faded into history, the Royal Navy no longer mistress of the seas. Nor was Communist China still the crumbling sick man of Asia under Manchurian rule or Maoist mismanagement. If push came to shove, Britain could not hope to defend Hong Kong any better than the Portuguese at Goa.  Thus, Britain had no realistic choice but to agree to return Hong Kong in 1984 after two years of negotiations. Rather than face the humiliation of a forcible Chinese takeover, it negotiated a relatively face-saving graceful exit that pretends attempts to safeguard some rights for Hong Kong residents. Gibraltar was ceded to Britain in perpetuity by the Treaty of Utrecht. With over three hundred years of history under her belt, the United Kingdom is under no legal obligation to return any part of it. A key difference with the Hong Kong cessions is that neither Spain nor Britain wish to fight a war over Gibraltar. From a realpolitik perspective, compared to Hong Kong, Gibraltar is far more defensible, and Spain considerably less formidable. Moreover, the British position is particularly strengthened by popular mandate, which are slightly more influential in western liberal democracies than jingoistic pseudo-communist dictatorships."
What were the reasons for the Renaissance / scientific revolution in Europe?,"Another simple but important reason besides economic changes starting at this time is the spread of printing technique. A scientific community really only works when scholars can cite each other and share their ideas in a cheap and fast way, thats why internet boosted scientific progress in our time. If you study the link, the Gutenberg printing technique had a advance of around 100 years in western europe compared to rest of the world. A lot of european philosophers at this time like Locke and Kant are still read today, the printing technique in conjunction with a dense and localized scientific community was a huge advance, which could only be catched up slowly."
Was the secession of the Confederate states illegal?,"The United States Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession unconstitutional while commenting that revolution or consent of the states could lead to a successful secession NOTE: The Supreme Court ruling was after the Civil War Legality: The principle of legality is the legal ideal that requires all law to
  be clear, ascertainable and non-retrospective. It requires decision
  makers to resolve disputes by applying legal rules that have been
  declared beforehand, and not to alter the legal situation
  retrospectively by discretionary departures from established law. No crime can be committed, nor punishment imposed without a
  pre-existing penal law, nulla poena sine lege. This principle is
  accepted as just and upheld by the penal codes of constitutional
  states, including virtually all modern democracies. At the time of the Civil War it was not illegal as the ruling by Supreme Court came later in 1869 (after the war) that unilateral secession was unconstitutional. Discussions and threats of secession have often surfaced in American politics, but only in the case of the Confederate States of America was secession actually declared. The United States Supreme Court ruled in Texas v. White, 74 U.S. 700 (1869) that unilateral secession was unconstitutional while commenting that revolution or consent of the states could lead to a successful secession. The topic of secession was hotly debated by both sides prior to Civil War with some proudly pro Union, some pro secession and some even hovering over middle ground which would include the president in 1860. President James Buchanan (D, 1857-61) did not take action to stop the states from seceding; although he argued that secession was not legal, he also claimed that the federal government did not have the constitutional right to stop the South from doing so. There where many who had an opinion in regards to secession and many of whom interpreted the Constitution including President Lincoln. Lincoln's first publicly denounced the proposed secession in his first Inaugural Address However, the speech also did not impress other states who were considering secession from the Union. Indeed, after Fort Sumter was attacked and Lincoln declared a formal State of Insurrection, four more states—Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas—seceded from the Union and joined the Confederacy. After the Confederate states began to leave the Union, Lincoln had an even greater need to prove secession was Unconstitutional and strong incentive to make his views against secession known to the American people in order to secure their support for the onerous war which was made necessary by his opposition to secession. So, as you can see, in 1861 no law existed in terms of prohibiting secession just multiple interpretations of the constitution none of which were interpretations from the Supreme Court in the sense that a ruling was made. This ruling would not be until legislature was reviewed (Texas v. White) in 1869. The 1869 ruling would be law after 1869 (until a new ruling is made) but not representative of law prior to 1869. 
Without one of the following three things secession, prior to the Civil War, would not have been unanimously agreed upon as illegal and in regards to law could not have been illegal (in 1861). ""Clear text"" within the Constitution (no grey area) In this case as pointed out by T.E.D. ""secession is part of what the    Civil War was fought over"" pointing out that certainly a
  ""grey area""    was present within the text of the Constitution which
  is one of the    primary reasons the Supreme Court would later be
  involved in 1869. An example of ""clear text"" within the Constitution:  Article II - The Executive Branch Note Section 1 - The President    Note1 Note2 … neither shall any Person be eligible to
  that Office who    shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five
  Years, and ... in    this case it is without confusion that a 21
  year old can not be    President of the United States."
Is it true that slavery was endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa previous to the establishment of the trans-Atlantic slave trade?,"Slavery is an ancient universal institution, which appeared independently in all cultures and societies which reached a certain level of productivity per capita. Early hunter-gatherers did not have it because each tribe member could barely sustain himself, so there was no incentive for slavery (i.e., male captives were murdered, often as sacrifices, while females bore children for their captors), but agriculture provided ample opportunities to exploit forced labor (and thus both male and female captives usually survived). Thus slavery in Sub-Saharan Africa appeared at least 5000 years ago. The statement that ""there has never been slavery in an agricultural society X"" is akin to statement ""there exists a flat (as opposed to spherical) planet Y"" - the burden of proof is on the author of such an implausible statement, not on someone who rejects it. Medieval European economy was based on a feudal rather than slave system: peasants were (usually, more or less, especially during and after the Plague) personally free, but most land was owned by the nobility. There was no place for major slave labor use. This does not mean that slavery as an institution was unknown.
Crusaders brought back black and Moorish slaves as a curio or a personal attendant, but these were irrelevant to the economic structure of the society. During the Age of Exploration and American conquest, slavery became economical again, and that's when it made its way back into the European economy: cash crops can be more efficiently produced by large plantations employing slave labor (or, today, using machinery) than by small family farms like in feudal Europe. Europeans found it more economical to buy Black slaves from the Muslim traders in Africa than to enslave the locals. PS1. I am fully aware of the cruelties of serfdom, but I am also aware that it was significantly different from slavery (specifically, serfs owned property and worked at least some time - in fact, most of the time in the most advanced societies - for themselves, while modern slaves never had any economic standing). You also need to take the answer in the context of the question, which specifically inquires about trade in Black African slaves. PS2. Of course, ancient Greece and Rome were major slave-driven powers. However, that was about 1,000 years before the period in question. By the time Atlantic slave trade came about, Slavery was replaced with Serfdom in Europe. PS3 See also What was the impetus for some African nations to participate in the slave trade?"
Why did the Germans spare Allied troops trapped at Dunkirk?,"Although we know a great deal about the events surrounding Hitler's ""Halt Order"" at Dunkirk, the truth is that the reasons behind it are not completely understood by historians, even now. It is a mistake, however, to think that the German army just stood around, watching the British Expeditionary Force being evacuated. They were fighting to reach the beaches the entire time the Allies were fighting to get off them. German artillery and aircraft shelled, bombed and strafed the troops on the beaches there without mercy. Adolf Hitler's ""Halt Order"" actually just confirmed an order given by General Gerd von Rundstedt, commander of Army Group A (the main German force fighting in western France). In turn, von Rundstedt had issued his order at the request of his tank unit commander, who had lost almost 50% of his armoured forces and wanted to regroup. However, Hitler's ""Halt Order"" was more specific than von Rundstedt's. It specified that the line of Lens–Bethune–Saint-Omer–Gravelines ""will not be passed"". This meant that some of the more advanced German units actually withdrew from positions that they had already taken. In particular, General Wilhelm von Thoma, Chief of the tank section of the Army High Command, was with the leading tanks near Bergues, and could look down into Dunkirk. He sent radio messages, asking to be allowed to push on, but was rebuffed. It is true that the tanks were in a commanding position, but they were low on fuel, and without infantry support. They were also within range of British naval guns in the channel. Even a Panzerkampfwagen IV (PzKpfw IV) would be outmatched by a 4.5 inch naval shell! The tanks withdrew as ordered. Hitler's own experiences in the trenches of the First World War were almost certainly a factor. By 24 May the troops had been fighting continuously for nearly a fortnight. Hitler knew how exhausting that could be. Also, it is certainly true that the ground around the Dunkirk pocket, with its network of canals, was not ideal for tanks. The infantry needed time to catch up. General Franz Halder wrote in his diary: ""The Führer is terribly nervous. Afraid to take any chances."" General Halder's diary is also the source of the claim that Goering had persuaded Hitler to allow his Luftwaffe to finish off the encircled troops. His diary entry for 24 May states: Finishing off the encircled enemy army is to be left to Air Force! Halder's diaries have been translated and digitised, with the relevant entries for 24 May 1940 in Volume IV. General Paul von Kleist met Hitler on the airfield at Cambrai a few days afterwards. He is supposed to have remarked that a great opportunity had been lost at Dunkirk. Hitler apparently replied: ""That may be so. But I did not want to send the tanks into the
  Flanders marshes"". There was also the belief among the German High Command that the war was already effectively won. A handwritten note from Major-General Alfred Jodl, the deputy chief of Hitler's planning staff still survives. It is dated 28 May and was written at Führer Headquarters to the labour minister Robert Ley. It states: ""Most esteemed Labour Führer of the Reich! Everything that has
  happened since May 10 seems even to us, who had indestructible faith
  in our success, like a dream. In a few days four fifths of the English
  Expeditionary Army and a great part of the best mobile French troops
  will be destroyed or captured. The next blow is ready to strike, and
  we can execute it at a ratio of 2:1, which has hitherto never been
  granted to a German field commander..."" After the war, perhaps not surprisingly, German generals vociferously blamed Hitler for the British ""miracle"" at Dunkirk. Even von Rundstedt placed the whole debacle at Hitler’s feet. This has led to the many theories about why Hitler had ""allowed"" the BEF to escape: These are, of course all utter nonsense and have been dismissed by all credible historians. Sadly, they still seem to be regularly trotted out by assorted Hitler apologists like David Irving, despite all the surviving evidence that should have condemned them to the dustbin of history years ago. The truth is much simpler. Hitler didn't entirely trust his army commanders and was being cautious. He, together with his military commanders, believed that he had time to regroup his forces and attack with the combination of infantry, artillery, armour, and air power that had already brought the German army success in France. The details of that build-up are set out in General Halder's diaries. Even after the ""Stop Order"" was issued to the army on 24 May, the Luftwaffe continued to attack the troops on the beach at Dunkirk. Whether this was to allow Goering's Luftwaffe the final ""glory"" of defeating the BEF remains just speculation. We should also remember that on 24 May the surrender of France was not yet assured. Neither Hitler, nor his high command, were prepared to risk unnecessary losses (as they saw it) that might put the next phase of their operation in jeopardy."
Why are the German and French languages so different?,"The biggest reason for how the lands east of the Rhine retained their German identity (unlike the Gauls of modern day France who lost their Celtic identity) is the Battle of Teutoburg Forest where the Germans won a decisive victory against Roman invaders. After this battle, the Romans never seriously attempted to conquer German lands in Magna Germania even though sporadic raids and skirmishes continued. This also ensured that German lands would remain German for eternity (or at least till now). The original inhabitants of France were Celtic people who were referred to as Gauls and Belgae by the Romans. Eventually Gaul was conquered by Julius Caesar and soon a dialect of Italiano-Celtic origin began developing which can be referred to as Vulgar Latin.  This Vulgar Latin is the core of the modern French language but Gaulish still left its impacts on modern French - for example, the loss of unstressed syllables, the vowel system etc.  As you have noted, the Franks and Alemanni aka Suebi or Swabians were both Germanic tribes and Romans were not wrong in calling them both Germans even though they both spoke different dialects of German.   However they were not the only German tribes; there were dozens of them, many of whom spoke their own dialects of Proto-German. Chief among them were of course Franks, Alemanni, Angles (who settled in England and gave it their name), Dani (modern day Danes), Goths (From modern day Sweden, Swedes are considered by some as descendants of Goths. Divided into Visigoths who conquered Hispania and Ostrogoths who conquered Italia), Langobardes (later known as Lombards and gave Lombardy (Italy) their name), Saxones (Sailed to England and laid foundations of Anglo-Saxon states), Vandals (Who conquered North Africa). There once used to be a confederation of German Tribes which was called Frankland or Francia or Regnum Francorum or later Carolingian Empire (Under Karling Dynasty) which was ruled by a German Tribe named the Franks. It existed from 481 AD to 843 AD.  Eventually Gaul was conquered by German Tribes. The Franks settled down in Northern France while the Alemanni settled down in the Rhine region at the border of Modern France and Germany. The Alemanni were also later conquered by the Franks under Clovis I. Unlike the Franks who were converting to Catholicism and adopting local culture gradually, The Alemanni were however very conscious about their roots and remained pagan until the 7th century. The Franks did give their own influences to the native language but linguists today believe only 500 French words have Frankish roots. Anyhow, after the death of Louis the Pious, the Carolingian Empire got embroiled in a Civil war between his sons which resulted in the division of the Empire.  It was only ended by the Treaty of Verdun, according to which Charles the Bald got West Francia which went on to become France and Louis the German got East Francia which went on to become Germany.  It must be noted that Latin Speakers were present only in West Francia. East Francia however remained the traditional heartland of the German People.  This division formed the line between East and West forever as from the 10th century, East Francia was known as the Kingdom of Germany which was further reinforced when the Salian dynasty took over the Holy Roman Empire.  In the end however, the Franks assimilated into the local Latin-speaking population and from Old Frankish and Italo-Gaulic, the French language was born.  East Francia, which contained the territories of the Alemmani, did not have any such political aspects to consider and therefore retained their dialects and language. Alemannian German is still spoken in various parts of Germany and also abroad e.g. in Switzerland etc. The French language however remains distinct among the Romance languages which is due to Germanic influence from the Franks and Normans. I read somewhere that: French is what happens when Germans learn Latin. A good similar example for the case of the Carolingian dynasty would be the Yuan dynasty of China. The Yuans were Mongols who invaded China, but in the end, they were the ones who adopted the native Chinese culture and language rather than the other way around. Similarly the Ilkhanate adopted Turco-Persian identity. Their cousins in Mongolia however retained their Mongol identity. "
Why are so many metros underground? Isn't that more expensive than an elevated system?,"In Moscow, under former mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, it was built a line (Butovo line) which is mostly elevated. I think the practice was not considered quite successful as a result. There are many drawbacks: The elevated line still consumes ground area. Even though one can lay highways and streets under it, one has to demolish buildings. Not much different from a ground-level railroad actually. That said, the Butovo line was built at the city's outskirts, where the land was cheaper and had less buildings (especially historically important ones). Greater levels of sound pollution. The extensive sound shields installed on the line were still unable to completely isolate the surrounding area from noise. Residential buildings have to keep a similar distance from this line as from any railroad. The need for special roll stock. It seems that the carrige park started to wear off much quicker than at underground lines and required special climate protection. The same roll stock is impractical to use on the both elevated and underground lines, which adds logistic troubles. In summer the trains on the elevated line need conditioners, while at winter they require a heater. Higher maintenance costs. The tracks need better care due to seasons. This includes cleaning of snow and ice of both rails and platforms and increased rail expansion due to different temperature in summer. Also, increased corrosion due to rain. Higher construction costs. Overall, the cost of construction turned out to be $34M/km compared to $30M/km for cut-and-cover underground lines in Moscow and $22M/km in Kiev. This difference includes the need for specialized roll stock though. That said, there is also a system of electric commuter trains in Moscow, so-called ""elektrichka"". They are mostly ground-level, share the track with intercity trains and the lines may go far into Moscow region beyond city limits. But inside the city they can be used the same way as metro, and often are cheaper."
How did Nazi Germany finance itself during WW2?,"I think the Great Depression was quite irrelevant for Germany in 1939 similarly to for other countries that took measures at state regulation.  As for the income, Germany was a well-developed industrial country with advanced technology. It was a pioneering country at chemistry, electrical engineering, machine-tool construction, railroads and transportation, metallurgy and mining. Its industry was known for exceptional quality. Germany had extensive exports, which did not stop throughout the war mostly through the neutral countries. With the German conquests German firms earned numerous advantages that maximized their income: Also prior to the war any strikes were outlawed in Germany so that the firms could operate without risking with workers' protests."
Which came first: polytheism or monotheism?,"""Is there any evidence to suggest whether either polytheism or monotheism came first, as an established form of religion? Or do we even have any way of knowing?"" The oldest written records we have that mention religion are all polytheistic.  The writer will sometimes claim that his god rules over the others, but this tends to have a 'my dad can beat up your dad' tone.  The word god is used for all of them - in other words, there's no claim that the writer's god is a fundamentally different kind of being. As you say, the main god sometimes developed a more central place in the cosmology, but we can often trace how that happened.   Amun, for example, started out as the patron god of Thebes.  When a Theban became pharoah, a lot of people found it expedient to talk about how great Amun was.  This often took the form of claiming that the local deity was really just another form of Amun, which was convenient for both the locals and the conquerors - no one really wanted a long drawn out religious war.   Ra was a fairly widely worshipped sun god, so Amun-Ra is a commonly known form, but it happened with others as well. A similar thing happened with Zeus and some of the other Greek gods, though the cause was more often cultural than military expansion.  Stories about local gods could easily be stories of Zeus taking another form; heroes could be identified as one of Zeus' children by a woman or nymph.  Over the years, Zeus came to look like quite the player. Similarly, the oldest Vedas are pretty clearly polytheistic, with the monistic ideas you mention developing during the Upanishad era and later.   It's more difficult to trace the development of religious ideas in areas without a written record, like Africa and North America.  Generally, though, what you see is that groups with very little technology don't place much emphasis on gods, if they have them at all; their religious practices tend to be more animistic.  Examples of that would be the Inuit and the Kung San.   You start seeing more elaborate mythologies and pantheons - ie, polytheism - among people with more complex social structures.  Thus, any monistic ideas that we find among cultures like this are generally taken to be newer developments or imports, rather than holdovers of a primitive monotheism that has never been observed. So... yeah.  Without building a time machine, there's no way we can be 100% sure of how religion developed.  But most of the evidence we have points towards polytheism coming first."
Were ancient ships named?,"Xenophon in his Hellenica (an account of the last yearsof the Peloponessian War and its aftermath) mentions several named ships, for example, ""Paralus"" and ""Salaminia"". Thus, we can infer that at least some of Greek ships were named in IV century BC, and maybe earlier. Also, Homer in his Iliad, which is dated to 8th century BC, does not give any names for any of numerous Achaean ships - that might be just a coincidence, but also may point to the tradition of giving ships names emerging later. As for the Romans - again, this is circumstantial evidence, but Aeneas ships' in the ""Aeneid"" all have names, so we can argue that by 20 BC Roman ships at least sometimes were given names."
Why did Columbus cross the mid-Atlantic instead of exploring from Greenland?,"There's a lot in the question that seems to be assuming modern knowledge that Columbus most likely did not possess. There is no good evidence the Iberian maritime community in the late 15th century had any knowledge of Greenland. The European settlement there did not exist by the time the printing press was invented, so any knowledge of it (unlike Portugal's and Columbus' discoveries) would have had to be hand-copied. The Danes knew about it, but they also laid claim to it, and this was an era where kingdoms jealously guarded maritime information as state secrets. So what knowledge was known would not have been as complete as what the Danes had access to, and no Iberian nation could lay claim to any route found using it. Remember, Columbus was not trying to ""explore"" or find the Americas, or anything like that. He was trying to get to the (East) Indies. Spain and Portugal already had possession of convenient sets of islands in the Atlantic (the Canaries and the Azores respectively) which would be great staging points for getting there. Wikipedia has a very convenient map showing Toscanelli's 1474 map superimposed on the actual globe projection. Columbus was sort of a disciple of his and used this map and others like it for his conception of world geography.  You can see that not only did it have no concept of Greenland, but where it actually exists would be much further from where he thought the Indies were than the Canaries. Not only that, but Columbus thought the Indies were even closer than this map shows*. To be exact, he thought the Canaries were only 3,700 km from the Indies (rather than 20,000!). What he did have was a correct conception of the trade winds in the Atlantic. These blow in roughly a clockwise direction in the northern hemisphere. What this means is that if you try to sail from the Canaries straight west, the winds will be helping you. However, if you try to sail from Greenland southwest, you'd be going straight into the wind. So even if it were an otherwise good route that someone knew about, sailing that direction from Greenland would not be an efficient way to cross the Atlantic.  * - He underestimated the distance between those longitude lines"
Why didn’t Japan attack the West Coast of the United States during World War II?,"There were several well-known attacks.  Aleutian Islands Campaign On June 6, two days after the bombing of Dutch Harbor, 500 Japanese
  marines landed on Kiska, one of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska...The
  next day, a total of 1,140 Japanese infantrymen landed on Attu via
  Holtz Bay, eventually reaching Massacre Bay and Chichagof Harbor...The
  invasion was only the second time that American soil had been occupied
  by a foreign enemy, the first being the British during the War of
  1812. Submarine operations:  During 1941 and 1942, more than 10 Japanese submarines operated in the
  West Coast, Alaska, and Baja California. They attacked American,
  Canadian, and Mexican ships, successfully sinking over 10 vessels
  including the Soviet Navy submarine L-16 on October 11, 1942. The United States mainland was first shelled by the Axis on February 23, 1942 when the Japanese submarine I-17 attacked the Ellwood Oil Field west of Goleta, near Santa Barbara, California.  In what became the only attack on a mainland American military installation during World War II, the Japanese submarine I-25, under the command of Tagami Meiji,[26] surfaced near the mouth of the Columbia River, Oregon on the night of June 21 and June 22, 1942, and fired shells toward Fort Stevens.  Balloon bomb attacks Japan released about 9,000 bomb-carrying balloons across the Pacific between November 1944 and April 1945. Hundreds if not thousands of these actually landed in North America. The program was suspended after Allied bombing took out Japanese hydrogen plants. The Japanese didn't have much way of knowing how effective the bombs were, but one did cause casualties.   On May 5, 1945, five children and local pastor Archie Mitchell's pregnant wife Elsie were killed as they played with the large paper balloon they'd spotted during a Sunday outing in the woods near Bly, Oregon—the only enemy-inflicted casualties on the U.S. mainland in the whole of World War II. It is somewhat incorrect to assume that there was no attempt by Japan to attack the mainland. There were attacks. However, Japan focused its military forces on the two main fronts, China and South-East Asia and it couldn't afford another front at the time. "
How did the general population of England convert so smoothly to Protestantism?,"Well, it wasn't smooth. First of all, there was already a minority of ""reform"" viewpoint in England before Henry VIII.  It was centered in the intelligentsia and gentry. So when Henry VIII decided to divorce the Church to marry Anne Boleyn, a significant and influential minority not only was in favor, but wanted to go further, faster. And, as always, a big group of people just wanted to get on with their lives and hoped it would all go away. Henry VIII's extravagance had bankrupted him and the country (there was not much distinction between the two at that time) so his other motive (besides Anne) was the wealth of the monasteries. By plundering them, he restored his checkbook's balance. Key point: He didn't keep the church lands, but sold it for ready cash to the gentry.  Now, the gentry -- whose lifestyle revolved around the land -- had an incentive to support the new regime, since a return to the old would probably mean the disgorgement of all that lovely land.  ""Return to the True Church?  Of course I'm in favor!  Always have been. But those monasteries were pretty bad -- do you know what I saw on Facebook the other day? They were doing terrible things! -- Maybe we should restore the Church, but leave the lands alone.  So that the Church can focus on saving souls, of course."" Once Queen Elizabeth took over from her activist siblings, she ruled as a kinder, gentler Protestant and -- mostly -- didn't punish people for what they believed, but for what they did. ""Be Catholic if you like. Just be discreet about it, don't support the Spanish or the French, or Mary Queen of Scots, and don't expect royal favor.""  It wasn't a happy time for Catholics, but it was -- mostly -- tolerable as long as they avoided religious politics. By the time that the Stewarts came in and made things a bit more difficult, this state of affairs had been in place for most people's whole lifetimes.  It could be lived with.  And it was. But Catholicism never died and was a significant minority religion throughout."
How did the USSR manage to innovate in an environment characterized by government censorship and high bureaucracy?,"The USSR didn't tend to go in for economic competition, but it made good use of intellectual competition and competition for prestige. It was also relatively good at creating organisations that did a specific thing, and kept on doing that. The competition between the MiG and Sukhoi fighter design offices, for example, was quite significant, driven by rivalry and prestige. They designed pretty good aircraft for far less money than the Western aircraft companies, and kept on doing it until the fall of the USSR meant that the money supply dried up. In the same way, the OKB-1, OKB-52 and OKB-586 design offices competed fiercely, with different ideas of how the space and missile programmes should be organised. Political influence was important in these rivalries, but it wasn't measured on a single scale, and the virtues of designs were also significant. The heads of design bureaus were engineers themselves - that was how you achieved distinction as an engineer in the Soviet system, by getting to start your own design bureau - and the politics inside a bureau seems to have been more restrained. The system had some definite flaws. One of them came when one ministry's organisation needed something that fell within the responsibilities of another ministry, but that ministry did not produce. For example, one of the problems with the unsuccessful N-1 moon rocket was the excessive weight of the first stage. That was because the USSR did not make aircraft-grade aluminium in thicknesses greater than 13mm. That was a responsibility of an aviation or metallurgical ministry, not the ministry responsible for rocketry. The 13mm aluminium wasn't thick enough to make a first stage whose outer skin was also the wall of the propellant tanks. So the tanks had to be spherical to make them stronger, and the rocket needed a separate outer skin for streamlining. That weight disadvantage meant that all kinds of other things had to be pared to the bone, the rocket needed extra stages, and things got harder and harder from there. Another flaw was that the system was pretty top-down. If the government wanted a better version of something that already existed, or knew it wanted something new and had a reasonable idea of what it wanted, that need could be met. Discoveries and entirely new inventions coming up from the bottom had a harder time than in less controlling systems, and political acceptability mattered a lot there. Lysenkoism was an extreme example. It was entirely wrong, but so politically acceptable that it became official doctrine for over thirty years. The USSR did do some science for its own sake, but this worked best in mathematics and mathematical physics, which are fairly cheap to run. Talented people in those fields also tend to be quite dedicated."
Was England called England in the days of King Arthur?,"No, England would not have been called ""England"" in the early post-Roman period. The name ""England"" derives from the Old English name Englaland, which means ""Land of the Angles"".  The earliest recorded use of the term that I'm aware of is in the late ninth century translation into Old English of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, which had been written in Latin in in the early eighth century. The name certainly seems to have become more widespread from the reign of King Alfred, although that may simply be because we have more surviving written evidence from that date. Obviously, the name had been long established when Sir Thomas Mallory wrote Le Morte d'Arthur in the late 15th century, so he probably didn't even realise it was an anachronism. Germanic settlers/invaders arrived in Britain in the early post-Roman period. We don't know how they identified themselves when they first arrived in Britain, but they eventually came to identify themselves as Saxons, Angles, etc. Bede names the Angles, the Saxons, and the Jutes as the main Germanic tribes that conquered England. The earliest genealogies of the kings of the various kingdoms weren't compiled until the ninth century."
How has hearing loss been avoided in war?,"Until the 1940s, it was believed that the cure to loud noises was developing a tolerance to them: The pervasive attitude of the early 1900s was that hearing loss could be prevented by developing a tolerance to noise. Consequently, any attempts to avoid loud sounds or to protect oneself from them were interpreted as weakness. Between 1941 and 1944, the US Army finally put this theory to the test: This “tolerance” theory was scientifically examined in 1941 when the US Army opened the Armored Medical Research Laboratory at Fort Knox, Kentucky. This laboratory completed a landmark study in 1944 resulting in the recommendation that gun crews, gunnery instructors, and others regularly exposed to gunfire blasts be provided hearing-protective devices. The hearing protector of choice was the V-51R, single-flange earplug. Although hearing protection was now being considered, it still was not deemed a requirement. emphasis added It wasn't until the advent of the Air Force that hearing protection really became significant: Even though World War II was a major contributing factor in the evolution of hearing conservation, it was not until after the war that the most significant event occurred. The Army Air Corps became a separate branch of service from the US Army and was renamed the US Air Force. Concurrently, this new branch of service introduced the jet engine aircraft to the military. No sound of that volume and duration had ever before been experienced. It was immediately noted that exposure to jet engine noise caused permanent hearing loss in a brief time. It also made verbal communication impossible and caused a series of physical manifestations described as “ultrasonic sickness.” Symptoms included earache, headache, excessive fatigue, irritability, and feelings of fear. Initially, it was believed that these symptoms were caused by inaudible, ultra-high-frequency sounds being generated by the jet engines. These symptoms, widely reported by air force maintenance crews, triggered a medical study that revealed that the illness was real; however, research attributed it to high levels of audible frequencies. Finally, the first regulation was established in 1948: As a result, the US Air Force published the first military regulation on hearing conservation in 1948. AFR 160-3, “Precautionary Measures Against Noise Hazards,” is significant not only because it was the first enforceable regulation in the history of hearing conservation, but it also placed responsibility for the new program on the medical leadership at air force installations. Some of the preventive measures described in AFR 160-3 include limiting noise exposures in terms of overall sound levels and using cotton wads moistened with paraffin as hearing protection for exposures to hazardous noise. So, for the United States at least, it wasn't until 1948 that preventative measures against the hearing loss of soldiers were really taken seriously. Source:"
Why did Britain and France not declare war against the Soviet Union when it invaded Poland in WW2?,"The political reasons of both France and Britain are well explained in other answers, so I just stick to the legal matter. France was not legally obliged by any pact to attack Soviet Union or to send troops to Poland to help. The 1921 Franco-Polish treaty specified the extent of help, which amounted to keeping the communication lines free between France and Poland (France and her Eastern Allies, 1919-1925). The 1939 pact, already ratified on September 4, was strictly against Germany, and had no provisions against Soviet Union (Britain, Poland and the Eastern Front, 1939). Britain, on the other hand, was legally obliged to attack Soviet Union, literally ""at once"" and to provide ""all the support and assistance in its power"", per the  1939 pact. There was no legal trick that allowed Britain to avoid this. Britain recognized Poland as a country, and the pact obviously didn't require Poland to be recognized by invaders. The pact did not require Poland to declare war on an enemy. Moreover, ambassador Raczyński requested such help from Britain as soon as Soviet Union attacked, and Halifax declined without any meaningful reason (Britain and Poland 1939-1943: The Betrayed Ally). Halifax said, 'As regards Soviet aggression we were free to take our own decision and to decide whether to declare war on the USSR or not.' (Britain and Poland 1939-1943: The Betrayed Ally) Edit: As Andy pointed out in his answer, the obligations of Britain were more blurred than the public realized, because of the British-Polish secret protocol accompanying the 1939 pact."
Why didn't the US and USSR jam each other's early-warning radar?,"John Dallman definitely has the right of it, but I wanted to chime in with a small bit of additional information. The early warning system that the russians used, the Duga Radar (eventually known as the ""Russian Woodpecker""), had an enormous range of operating frequencies. It would randomly hop between different channels, sometimes interrupting legitimate broadcasts, presumably in an attempt to subvert jamming attempts and avoid crowded signal bands. This is why it got the name ""woodpecker""; people's radios would randomly start emitting a sharp ""tap tap tap"" noise. As John answered, jamming the enemy's system is effectively a declaration of attack, and would have caused an all-out attack on both sides. But in addition to that, jamming the Duga network would have likely required jamming every single radio station, including the ones the allies were attempting to use."
Have any astronauts or cosmonauts died in space?,"Yes, the three crew members of Soyuz 11: Georgy Dobrovolsky, Vladislav Volkov, and Viktor Patsayev. On 29 June 1971, their spacecraft undocked from Salyut 1, the first space station, to return to Earth. In the process, however, a breathing ventilation valve between the Soyuz's orbital and descent modules was accidentally loosened. This caused a fatal decompression at ~168km above earth's surface, quickly killing the crew. According to a NASA writeup of the incident, the cabin pressure fell to zero for nearly 12 minutes, before increasing due to the ship re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. All three cosmonauts would have passed away within the first few minutes. They remain the only humans known to have died in outer space (conventionally defined to begin at 100km above sea level)."
"Why did LBJ, a staunch segregationist, champion and sign the 1964 Civil Rights Bill?","""Why?"" questions are particularly difficult to answer. It is not possible to stare into Johnson's soul, searching for motivation, from our vantage point more than fifty years later; instead we are left attempting to analyze his recorded acts and words, leveraging our understanding of human nature. However, I believe it is fundamental to recognize that racism acts on two levels in everyone: an emotional level and an intellectual level. At the emotional level racism develops from two deep aspects of human psyche: tendencies to ""oppose the unfamiliar"" and to ""support the group"". All of us encounter these tendencies; but they are merely tendencies. As humans we have the intellectual capability to set aside our emotional tendencies for rational reasons. Scant few of us may have been born in situations where those of a different race are a natural everyday phenomenon. But we are all born with an innate sense of group, starting with the family and successively moving out through friends, neighbours, townsfolk, and eventually, in some, race. When an emotional tendency to favour friends and family manifests itself in word and deed, uninhibited by rationality, that is merely nepotism. When it spreads to a blanket preference for one's race, buttressed by rationalization and a dislike of the unfamiliar, then that can truly be labelled a deep racism. But in between these I see an everyday racism, an autopilot racism if you will, where the emotional tendencies are simply allowed to wash over one without any attempt made to engage the intellect. It is the ""lazy human's racism"", of simply going with the flow. It seems to me that Johnson's racism was of this type. As a young ambitious legislator raised in a deeply racist and segregated South, ""fighting the good fight"" might have made him a better human; but would certainly have sunk any aspiration to a political career. Johnson was no Don Quixote, tilting at windmills; he had bigger plans. Then in the mid-50's, while Johnson is Majority Leader in the Senate, segregation hits the national consciousness. His long-standing support for the poor and downtrodden suddenly coincides with a recognition that many of those are not only black; but are poor and downtrodden because of being black. At that moment the driven, ambitious, and yes, racist, Senator from Texas steps up to the challenge; confronts one of his own demons; and conquers it. He remakes himself  as a Civil Rights Champion.  It seems appropriate to note here that, as President, Johnson was uniquely qualified in a manner that few of his predecessors, and none of his successors to date, have been: as a former Majority Leader of the Senate, Johnson understood the legislative process far better than most presidents. Johnson had perfected that craft in what his contemporaries termed ""the full Johnson"" (or alternatively ""the Treatment""):  flattery, deals, pressure, threats — delivered at all hours in manners ranging from lofty to crude  Further As Richard Russell, the South’s leader in the Senate during the 1960s, put it to a friend a few days after Kennedy’s assassination: “You know, we could have beaten John Kennedy on civil rights, but not Lyndon Johnson.” So: ""Why did Johnson champion the Civil Rights movement from 1957 on?""  Because it was the defining issue of his time; and, to be recognized as the great man that he aspired to be and saw himself as, one had to not only be on the right side; one had to be a champion of the right side."
Did Imperial Japan choose to ally with Nazi Germany because of ideological similarity?,"I seriously doubt it. Japan was a traditional monarchy, philosophically and ideologically far closer to China than Germany.
Of course both were mortal enemies and had been for centuries.

Far more likely they were drawn together simply by the fact that both were shut out from the ""international community"" and felt slighted by the UK and US (and in case of Germany France).
That's no different than Iran and North Korea being very chummy nowadays, despite having ideologies that couldn't be further apart (like the German race laws, Iran's religious laws would dictate them exterminate their ally rather than deal with them).
So as is so often the case, the enemy of my enemy is my friend, or at least my associate.

And yes, you're quite right that a lot of countries had similar racial ideas to the Germans (Japan wasn't so much racist as placing no value on any human life, especially that of those who were shown to be inferior to them by being conquered in battle. What the Germans did to the peoples they persecuted was because of their race, what the Japanese did was far more casual. This is shown clearly at the very end, when the German government issued a decree that suicide missions were a disgrace and not to be pursued, were dishonorable, when the Japanese embraced them as a last ditch effort to save at least personal honour in the defeat of the Empire."
How did the Romans do division?,"The short answer, according to Turner (1951), is: we don't know. The Romans were not interested in recording theoretical mathematics, so we don't have any written accounts how they did it. It is assumed that whatever they knew was learned from the Greeks, but alas there is no Greek account (from the period) of a pure number division either, only of one dividing an angle (with minutes and seconds). Turner notes that Friedlein (1869) was still the most comprehensive modern source on the topic, and goes on to reproduce from Friedlein a conjectured Roman division method using the abacus. This is a sort of successive approximation, vaguely similar to short division because it requires knowing only some multiplication tables (only by 10 and 20 in the example below), but there is no evidence the Romans used this method (as opposed to something else).  In the above method, the abacus is divided in two zones, but nevertheless only the remainder is represented on the abacus (the quotient is kept in the operator's head or elsewhere); the zone above the vertical divide multiplies by 5. It should be noted that even this method of representing Roman numbers on the abacus is conjectural. I don't know if any more recent research has been done in this area. As a side note (also from Turner), the Roman word for multiplication does imply repeated addition, but nevertheless the Romans likely learned from the Greeks a better method, based on powers of 10 (although unlike the modern method, it started from the largest power), first exemplified in Eutocius' commentary on Archimedes.

Has there ever been a non-rectangular banknote?,"Regular banknotes, issued in ""normal times"" and made from paper are  practically all rectangular and without holes. But there were a couple of times when people remembered that anything can be ""money"", if they just believe in it.  Below are some examples of holes in notes and odd shapes. These examples were chosen to fit the question as originally framed. Some examples still fit the updated question: Zimbabwe's hole was officially re-issued, although not designed that way. Some examples of Notgeld were designed and issued in more or less round form. The last example even being completely irregular from the start as the material used was small and intended to be used for another purpose…  Having a hole like coins? Hole Punched Notes
  In 1997, Zaire’s (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) dictator Josepeh Sese Seko Mobutu was finally overthrown. As his face featured on the country’s bank notes, the new government simply punched out Mobutu’s face out of their existing currency and continued to use it until new currency could be printed.  Hole Punched Notes, UKcredit, MoneyLife, 2017 If this is not that strict about ""not a rectangle but still valid, legal tender"", then: Then the Portuguese did something weird to the edges of the Real: Portugal's first paper money was introduced in 1797 by the government.5 Denominations issued until 1807 included 1200, 2400, 5000, 6400, 10,000, 12,000 and 20,000 réis. Some of these notes were revalidated for continued use during the War of the Two Brothers (1828 to 1834).5
  From the 1820s, several private banks issued paper money. The most extensive issues were by the Banco de Lisboa, whose notes were denominated in both réis and moedas, worth 4800 réis. This bank issued notes for 1200 and 2400 réis, 1, 4, 10, 20, 50 and 100 moedas. The Banco Commercial de Braga, Banco Commercial do Porto, Banco de Guimaraes and Banco Industrial do Porto also issued notes, with bearer cheques issued by a number of other banks between 1833 and 1887.
  In 1847, the Banco de Portugal introduced notes for 10,000 and 20,000 réis.6 5000 réis notes were issued from 1883, followed by 50,000 réis in 1886. In 1891, the Casa de Moeda introduced notes for 50 and 100 réis,7 and the Banco de Portugal introduced notes for 200, 500, 1000 and 2500 réis, followed by 100,000 réis notes in 1894.

Did the Romans eat breakfast?,"It seems the issue may be with generalizing 'Romans' as single entity and not as a group which changed through time. Johnston in The Private Life of the Romans goes into the changes seen in the Roman diet over time: The table supplies of a given people vary from age to age with the
development of civilization and refinement, and in the same age with
the means and tastes of classes and individuals. Of the Romans it may
be said that during the early Republic, perhaps almost through the
second century B.C., they cared little for the pleasures of the
table. They lived frugally and ate sparingly. They were almost
strictly vegetarians (§ 273), much of their food was eaten cold, and
the utmost simplicity characterized the cooking and the service of
their meals. But later: The last two centuries of the Republic saw all this changed. The
conquest of Greece and the wars in Asia Minor gave the Romans a taste
of Eastern luxury and altered their simple table customs, as other
customs had been altered by like contact with the outside world. This led to some new behaviors: Some of the very rich, on the other hand, aping the luxury of the
Greeks but lacking their refinement, became gluttons instead of
gourmets. They ransacked the world for articles of food,4 preferring
the rare and the costly to what was really palatable and delicate. The
separate dining room (trīclīnium) was introduced, the great houses
having two or more (§ 204), and the oecī (§ 207) were, perhaps,
pressed into service for banquet halls. The dining couch (§§ 224, 304)
took the place of the bench or stool, slaves served the food to the
reclining guests, a dinner dress (§ 249) was devised, and every
familia urbāna (§ 149) included a high-priced chef with a staff of
trained assistants. Johnson is of the opinion that breakfast was eaten, but it was definitely not 'the most important meal of the day' for the later Romans: In early times in the city and in all periods in the country the chief
meal (cēna) was eaten in the middle of the day, preceded by a
breakfast (ientāculum) in the early morning and followed in the
evening by a supper (vesperna). Concerning the ientāculum itself: So it seems references to Romans not eating three meals a day may be referring to the earlier Republic times, but later the breakfast was definitely part of the schedule."
Why didn't Hitler have more submarines in the English channel?,"The English Channel is too shallow in many places to be safe for U-Boats. The operating depth for the Type VII submarine was up to 230 meters, while the English Channel is only 45 meters deep in many places. In a confined channel such as this a U-Boat's only defence against air and surface attack is to dive quickly, to an unpredictable (but deep) depth. Unknown, because its fate is more uncertain if the depth charges used to attack it are set to the actual depth of the U-Boat. Note that the kill radius of a depth charge is only about 4m, and the disabling radius of one is only about 10m.  In a waterway only about 45m deep a depth charge set to go off at 30-35m covers half the possible escape depth, while the actual height of the U-Boat covers another 20% of that."
What fueled the street lights in 13th-century Cordoba?,"I have traced back this claim to its original source. Come along with me on this journey! Let's start with a source which used to be linked on Wikipedia and is commonly cited online: For ten miles in a direct line on the darkest night the pedestrian could walk securely through the city and its environs by the light of innumerable lamps. Samuel Parsons Scott, History of the Moorish Empire in Europe (1904), vol. 1, p. 619. This book has a massive bibliography but no footnotes, which makes it useless. However, it did make me google harder, and find an 1833 reference: For ten miles the citizens could travel by the light of lamps along an uninterrupted extent of buildings. Andrew Crichton, The History of Arabia (New York: Harper, 1845 [1833]), vol. 2, 52 The only source cited anywhere near this sentence is Washington Irving (!), who wrote a book called Chronicle of the Conquest of Granada in 1829. I found that this section of Irving's book was derived from an even earlier book: Ashshakandy† relates, in one of his works, that through Cordova, with the continuations of Azzahra and Azzahira, he had travelled ten miles by the light of lamps along an uninterrupted extent of buildings. † Abū'l Walid Ismāil, an eminent man from Shakanda, which is an ancient town on the south side of the river over against Cordova. He wrote a treatise on the excellence of Andalusia, in opposition to Abū Yahya, who vindicated that of Africa; and died at Seville in the year 629. John Shakespear and Thomas Hartwell Horne, The History of the Mahometan Empire in Spain (London: William Bulmer and Co., 1816), 162 This incredibly helpful footnote points us to the original source, a 13th century CE Andalusian named aš-Šaqundī! Se dice que estaban tan pobladas las construcciones de Córdoba, al-Zahrā’ y al-Zāhira, que se podía caminar por ellas a la luz de las lámparas por espacio de diez millas, sin interrupción alguna. (Google Translate: ""It is said that the buildings of Córdoba, al-Zahrā’ and al-Zāhira, were so populated that one could walk through them by the light of the lamps for ten miles, without any interruption."")

Maestre, 1934), p. 105 Finding this original source corrects a major error introduced through the chain of transmission and helps us understand the type of lighting being discussed here. These were not street lamps installed by the caliph. This would not have been a system of lamps posted on the road, but lamps installed outside doors by homeowners -- or, as commenters suggest, lamps from the inside of homes. We actually have examples of this exact model of Andalusian outdoor lamp in museums. You can see the spike inside on which a tallow candle would have been placed. The shape of the lamp would allow users to post it directly over a door. There is also a good article about Andalusian indoor lighting online which shows that indoor lamps of that time used oil and a fuel source resting on top of water in a glass fixture. Some of the Islamicate glass fixtures of this time are noted for their beauty."
Why does Japan use the same type of AC power outlet as the US?,"Japanese AC power outlets were first standardised in 1926 with the publication of the ""挿込型接続器標準仕様書"" (lit., ""Standard for a Insertable Connector""), which became JIS C 8303. At the time, Japan was barely an industrial nation, and generally relied on imported power outlets. The leading designs up for consideration were thus the German Schuko and the American ""2-prong"" connectors. In the standards, the authors actually explained their rationale for choosing the latter: 独逸の標準仕様書を参酌し、他方に於いては、現今我国にもっとも多く輸入せらる米国製品と共通性を失わざるを念とし In considering the German standard, on the other hand, we wished not to lose compatibility with the many American products that has been imported into this country. The United States was Japan's largest trade partner, and a technological leader; it stands to reason that American electrical appliances held a higher install base in Japan. Understandably, therefore, the Japanese standards committee settled on adopting the American plug officially, and the rest, as they say, is history. Note: The Japanese power grid seems not to have been specifically designed to match the American one; however, like the power outlets, early electricity generation in Japan relied on imported equipment. Eastern Japan imported from the German AEG while Western Japan purchased from the American General Electric. This produced a permanent division that lasts to this day, with electricity delivered to half of Japan at 50 Hz (the same as in Europe) and to the other half at 60 Hz (same as the nominal North American frequency). This is no longer a major concern as modern devices are designed with enough tolerance to deal with either, though."
How was law enforcement handled in large US cities before professional police?,"In 1800, only four cities in the US had populations of around 25,000 or more - the largest of these was New York with 60,000 (the others were Philadelphia, Baltimore and Boston) - so the challenges of policing in the US up to the early 1800s were much less than in the major cities of Europe where London was just short of 1 million, with Paris over 500,000. However, population growth over the following decades was rapid and from around the 1830s, city authorities began to make major changes in the organization of law enforcement. Looking in general at the early history of urban policing, Police are relative newcomers to the Anglo-American criminal justice
  system. The Constitution does not mention them. Early city charters do
  not mention them, either, for the simple reason that, as we know them,
  police had not been invented. Instead, cities had loosely organized
  night watches and constables who worked for the courts, supplemented
  by the private prosecution of offenders through lower-level courts
  (Steinberg 1989). The night watch and day constable, dating from the
  Middle Ages...
  were not replaced until the 1820s, when London police were reorganized
  by Robert Peel. The police precedent for the United States, as is well
  known, came from the establishment of the Metropolitan Police of
  London in 1829. Source: Eric H. Monkkonen, 'History of Urban Police'. In Crime and Justice, Vol. 15, Modern Policing (1992), pp. 547-580 On these early constables and the night watch, Constables were responsible to civil and criminal courts. They supported themselves by fees, which came from serving warrants and civil
  papers and arresting offenders. The victim of an offense had to seek a
  constable, paying for his actions... Night watch did just that: they were to raise the hue and cry in case
  of an offense or to sound an alarm for a fire. The usual criticism of
  them was that they slept, used their noisy rattles to warn off
  potential offenders, and ran from real danger....the night watch, who were either citizens doing required volunteer service or, more likely, their paid substitutes, were not in any way a serious crime-fighting organization. Source: Monkkonen Also 'imported' from Britain, and operating in American cities from at least the 17th century, were thief catchers and coroners. The former were often, but not always, thieves themselves; despite their name, their job was primarily to recover stolen property and act as informers rather than actually catch thieves. Coroners, on the other hand, played a more active role in actually examining evidence and determining cause of death. The NCJRS' website has an article on the development of the city's law enforcement, History of New York City Police Department In the Dutch era from 1625 to 1664, the first professional police
  department was created in New Amsterdam. Police officers used hand
  rattles as they patrolled the streets to discourage crime and
  apprehend criminals. Under British rule from 1664 to 1783, constables
  were charged with keeping the peace. They focused on such offenses as
  excessive drinking, gambling, prostitution, and church service
  disturbances. During the Revolutionary War, the British appointed a
  military governor and employed citizen patrols to protect New York
  City residents. After independence, New York adopted the London police
  model and established a paid professional police force in 1828. The
  first set of printed rules and regulations was issued to the police
  force in 1845, and full uniforms were adopted in 1853. Note that New York had a small population even in 1800, around 60,000 - making it the US' largest city. This was up from just 25,000 in 1776 and just 5,000 in 1700. Going into more detail and starting from the early days of Dutch settlement (then New Amsterdam, 1625 to 1664), the new arrivals formed a council to make and interpret the law. The council then
  appointed a schout-fiscal - Dutch for legal officer - to see that its
  edicts were obeyed. It was the schout-fiscal's job to punish each
  lawbreaker in a manner befitting the crime. He served as both sheriff
  and prosecutor throughout New Netherland, an area covering what is now
  lower New York State and eastern New Jersey. Then they got a bit more organized: In 1651, the first professional police department was created in New
  Amsterdam – the Rattlewatch. It was a voluntary patrol composed of
  citizens appointed by the council. In addition to muskets, its members
  were equipped with the hand rattles that gave the fledgling police
  force its name. They strolled the streets to discourage crime and
  search for lawbreakers. In times of emergency, they noisily spun their
  rattles to summon assistance from fellow Rattlewatch members.  In late 1658, the eight members of the Rattlewatch began drawing pay,
  making them the first municipally funded police organization. This seems to have worked reasonably well as, when the British took over in 1664, few changes were made. One was that, Instead of a schout-fiscal, there was an English constable. His job was
  to keep the peace, suppress excessive drinking, gambling,
  prostitution, and prevent disturbances when church services were in
  progress. However, this soon changed due to the French and Indian wars: During the late 1600's, with the first of the French and Indian wars
  underway, the military assumed responsibility for maintaining law and
  order in the City. Officials appointed a bellman to do the job. His
  title came from the bell he rang while making his rounds and calling
  out the hours. In  addition to the bell, he was issued a gun, uniform,
  badge, shoes and stockings, becoming the City's first uniformed
  policeman. In the next stage of development, The start of the 18th century brought radical changes to the City's
  system of public protection. The post of bellman was abolished and the
  English introduced the constable's watch to protect New York's 6,000
  residents. What is now lower to mid-Manhattan was divided into six
  sectors, with a High Constable and 12 sub-constables sworn to ""take
  care, and keep and preserve the peace"" throughout the area. In 1731, a
  watch-house - or Jail - was built at the corner of Wall and Broad
  Streets. Punishment for ""ruffians and evildoers"" was carried out in
  the ""cage, stocks, whipping post or ducking stool"" in front of City
  Hall. Things seem to have worsened after the revolution, though: By the time the Revolutionary War ended, the City's population had
  grown to 60,000 - and police protection had become a major problem.
  But little was done to deal with it. Crime continued to increase
  through the late 1820's. Although more watchmen were hired, they were
  widely regarded as incompetent and the protection they provided was
  considered inadequate. . . For years the situation remained this way.
  Nothing was done until contempt for the City's weak police force
  finally gave way to fear - fear that the City's social disintegration
  was imminent. And with that fear came the realization that something
  had to be done about providing New York with a strong, effective
  police department. The US' second largest city in 1800 had no professional police force at the time. Like New York, policing evolved as the population grew, from the Town Watch in around 1700 to the first paid (but limited) police agency in 1751: This agency, comprised of wardens and constables, patrolled the city
  on a limited basis, usually stationed in ""watch boxes."" Then, in 1830, An ordinance of December 30 of that year first established a ""police
  patrol"" which served throughout the day as well as night. Many
  ordinances extended the scope of the system; in 1833 the City
  Commissioners' function of lighting the streets was transferred to it
  and in 1841 a full-scale Police Department was created under the
  direction of the Mayor. In common with New York, it steadily developed with guidelines becoming more clearly defined and responsibilities sometimes added and then later transferred: ...in 1859 a Detective Division was formed within the Department and
  in the following year a River and Harbor Police were added to it. In
  1864 the office of Fire Marshal was created within the Department,
  where it remained until 1937."
Were any Kings/Queens who were monarchs as children good rulers?,"King James VI of Scotland (later James I of England) The existing answers have not given examples of Kings from British History. James VI became King in Scotland as a baby of 13 months, following the enforced abdication of his Mother, Mary Queen of Scots.  He played a difficult hand well, and avoided the civil wars and discontent that would affect the later Stuart Kings. If we judge him only on his rule of Scotland there would be no doubt of his success as a ""good king"". He established an effective government in Scotland, by the appointment of talented minister. He took control of the Highland Clans, in a way that would now be seen as despotic, but was effective in its day. He similarly gained control of the Kirk. In England he managed to prevent civil war between Catholic and Protestant, and between parliamentarian and royalist. Unlike his son, Charles, he negotiated with parliament effectively, and while he faced multiple attempts on his life. The threat of war went down as he managed to control the Hawks in Parliament who were pressing for war with Spain. His policies maintained the treasury, and supported the cultural development of Britain, and the start of the British Empire in America. It can be argued that he made errors that created problems for his sons and grandsons, but at the end of his reign he was genuinely mourned by people both North and South of the Border. By comparison with those who came after him (Charles I, II and James II)) and before him (Mary, Edward VI) and in consideration of the tensions that were simmering at the time, he should be considered a ""good"" king by the criteria in the question.

Is history always written by the victors?,"""History is written by victors"" may itself be an example of history written by the losers! While the quote is commonly misattributed to Winston Churchill, it's origins are unknown and it might be inspired by Hermann Göring's quote: We will go down in history either as the world's greatest statesmen or its worst villains. On a (perhaps) more serious note, the aftermath of the Fall of Constantinople (1453) is a prime example of history written by the losers. A wave of Greek scholars emigrated to the west after the event that essentially marked the end of the Byzantine Empire, bringing with them extremely biased accounts of Ottoman brutality. The vilification of the Ottomans was the prevalent opinion in the Western world for centuries and served as propaganda material as late as 1832, when the Greek War of Independence ended. Even modern attempts at identifying the historical truth of the era, such as the 2011 ""1821"" documentary, are met with controversy in Greece. A more recent example would be the American Civil War and the Lost Cause movement, a term borrowed from Edward Pollard's 1866 book The Lost Cause: A New Southern History of the War of the Confederates : Comprising a Full and Authentic Account of the Rise and Progress of the Late Southern Confederacy--the Campaigns, Battles, Incidents, and Adventures of the Most Gigantic Struggle of the World's History.  Lastly, a (perhaps controversial) example of history written by the losers is the account of the Vietnam War. Although whether the US lost the war is debatable they certainly didn't win it, still the overwhelming majority of historical documentation for the war comes from the US. Further reading:"
Why were so many more Jewish men than Jewish women killed during the Holocaust?,"Short Answer There is no straightforward answer here. Some factors aided the survival of women, others the survival of men, but it is plausible that those factors favouring women outweighed those favouring men. In short, the relative advantages held by women included: Relative advantages held by men included: In considering these factors, it is important to note that they are at best only partly quantifiable. Further, as pointed out by Will and Moishe Kohen, the total number of victims has an error margin. This error margin comes at least close to equaling (and at times exceeds) the difference between the number of adult male and adult female victims cited in Wikipedia. Also, significant differences in the estimates of the number children murdered further underline the uncertainty concerning the 2 million women estimate given by Wikipedia. Details The picture is somewhat complicated by a number of variables which worked against men in some cases but against women in others. On the one hand, Biological, psychological, sociological, and other differences left
  women at times more vulnerable to beatings, rape, forced abortions,
  and exploitation. Women with children were often killed first. while on the other hand, women’s differences also gave them certain advantages for survival.
  Because circumcision did not reveal their Jewishness, women could pass
  as non-Jewish more readily. Women coped with hunger differently and
  often provided mutual support to each other in the unsanitary and
  overcrowded camps. The Jewish Women's Archive article Women in the Holocaust also outlines some of these variables which, in the early stages of the war, worked more against men than women. One difference was the initial targeting of Jewish men for arrest and
  incarceration— in both Western and Eastern Europe. In Germany, for
  example, in the November 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom, only Jewish men
  (some thirty thousand of them) were arrested and only Jewish men were
  sent to concentration camps. Similarly, in the early days of the war in Poland, Jewish men were
  much more likely to be harassed, arrested and imprisoned. Men were
  also more likely to be executed in the systematic targeting of
  community leaders. A typical example was the fate of the first members
  of the Lodz Judenrat: all except Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski (1877–1944)
  were murdered. In many other cases the Germans targeted the
  traditional Jewish leaders—such as rabbis—for humiliation and murder
  to terrorize the rest of the population. Similarly, in Nazi-occupied Soviet Union, the order to liquidate all Jewish men was given some two months before women and children were also targeted. However, As the war progressed, it became clear that German brutality was not
  confined to men. In particular, in the camps pregnant women and women with young children were targeted for immediate extermination. Other women were used for slave labour so a pregnant woman would either have to abort or somehow hide her pregnancy if she were to survive as a labourer. Perhaps counterbalancing this brutally exploited vulnerability that women had is that men were probably more likely to die doing forced labour, in part because many were doing hard labour. It has also been argued that, in Eastern Europe, Jewish women were more 'acculturated"" and that this gave them an advantage during the war: Out of economic necessity, more Jewish women in Eastern Europe assumed
  responsibility for contributing to the support of their households and
  more of them actively participated in the secular and economic sphere.
  As Celia Heller and others have shown, in many families, especially
  middle-class families, it was the women who were the “engines of
  acculturation,” bringing Polish culture into the home and introducing
  it to their children. This greater acculturation of Jewish women in Eastern Europe provided
  them with important skills and contacts during the Nazi era. Because
  Jewish girls were more likely than Jewish boys to attend regular
  Polish schools, learn the Polish language and become involved in
  secular activities, they had contacts for securing false papers,
  trading clothes and food, locating jobs and finding a place to hide or
  live (illegally) outside the ghetto. This was evident among Jews who
  passed on the Aryan side. On the other hand, Jewish families perceived that their menfolk were more likely to be targeted by the Nazis and went to greater efforts to hide them and to help them emigrate. For example, One vivid example of the extent to which families believed it was only
  the men who were in danger—and therefore marshaled their resources to
  save them—is provided by the arrest statistics from Paris on “Black
  Thursday,” July 16, 1942....Because it was assumed that women and
  children were safe, they remained at home and thus turned out to be
  the disproportionate victims of the sweeping arrests. On that day
  5,802 women and 4,051 children were arrested (compared with 3,031 men)
  and they were also disproportionately represented in the subsequent
  deportations to Auschwitz. Once inside camps, though, it appears that women had better coping strategies than men, and this gave them a greater chance of survival. For example, the formation of “Camp Sister” relationships in which two women
  supported and sustained each other like sisters, by sharing food and
  other resources, trying to protect each other from threats and
  assaults, and taking care of one another when one became sick. This
  was especially important during roll call when women were required to
  stand for hours on end and those who were sick needed a camp sister to
  hold them up. In short, it's a complicated, but the above is not necessarily inconsistent with the overall statistics cited in Wikipedia. The difference (2.5 mil vs. 2 mil as per justcal's comment) is not so large that it can't be explained by the circumstances favouring women's survival outweighing those of men by a fairly small degree. Note also that the differences in the estimates of total numbers killed further complicates the overall picture. The Wikipedia numbers have to be treated with caution; none of the academic sources cited here (nor any of the others I've looked at) give a gender breakdown. Dalia Ofer, in The Holocaust Encyclopedia (cited in Moishe Kohan's answer) asserts that more than half of the holocaust victims were women, but this seems unlikely unless she is including female children, or not considering children at all (unlikely), or is using 'victims' in a much broader sense than just deaths. The variable estimates are also evident for children, with from 1 to 1.5 million cited by Zoe Waxman and ""more than 1.2 million"" cited by Projetaladin, while Wikipedia's Children in the Holocaust gives 1.5 million. Given the uncertainty over the numbers of children murdered, it seems unlikely that those for women can be stated with any more certainty. However, it seems reasonable to surmise that, initially, the proportion of men murdered far exceeded that of women, but that the gap narrowed as the exterminations came to include all Jews from around mid-August 1941.

Were Roman public roads built by private companies?,"If the question is ""did the roman government officials pay individuals, slave owners and groups of workers to build construction projects instead of using the government's direct manpower?"", the answer is yes, just like any other public construction work during the Roman republic, principate and empire. If the question is ""did something like Claudius & Sons Roadbuilding Inc. exist at that time that was paid to lay out, organize and execute these projects in the name of the government, with government funding?"", the answer is no. If the question is ""did a rich individual pay for the first tram of the via Appia and its bordering aqueduct out of their own pocket?"" the answer is yes-ish, the via was named after himself, Appius Claudius. 
It was not a concession nor a government instructed work though, the senate didn't even have time to debate if it was necessary when he laid out the first stones.  He was paying for it with the money granted to his political office, the Censorship, and not truly privately owned money, but it was still his to use during his ""term"". More importantly, nobody stopped him from doing so, his initial spending on this project gave him the surname ""the blind"", not because he was, but because he started investing on it without knowing if Neapolis would become a Roman colony or not in the end.

Why didn't battleship Bismarck have more support?,"The Germans wanted to send more, but there were none available.  Most were unsuitable to escort Bismarck.  Those which were suitable were damaged. A good warship for commerce raiding is fast, both to catch enemy ships and run from warships, fuel efficient to keep at sea for as long as possible, and carries heavy armament to rapidly sink enemy ships from long range.  Bismarck could make 30 knots and cruise for 10,000 miles, there were few heavy ships in the Germany Navy which could keep up. Her sister, Tirpitz, was still working up. The battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were both under repair in Brest on the wrong side of the North Sea.  The old pre-Dreadnaught Deutschland battleships were far too slow. Germany had build a small fleet of brand new Admiral Hipper heavy cruisers. Blücher had been sunk, Admiral Hipper was being overhauled in Kiel, Seydlitz was never completed, and Lützow had been sold to the Soviets. Prinz Eugen which was damaged but hastily repaired and ready. This left the older and slightly slower Deutschland class ""pocket battleships"" designed as commerce raiders. Of the pocket battleships, Admiral Graf Spee had been famously scuttled in her own commerce raid. Lützow nee Deutschland had recently finished repairs from a British torpedo attack and was waiting to go on its own raid with Admiral Sheer. Admiral Scheer had just returned from a five month long shipping raid in the Atlantic and was undergoing repairs in Kiel. The rest of the Germany Navy was light cruisers, destroyers and smaller ships.  While they had the speed, they did not have the endurance.  They also didn't have the firepower.  The heavy 203mm and 380mm guns of the Prinz Eugen and Bismarck will be in range long before the 150mm guns of a German light cruiser.  Since you're not planning on fighting a fleet of warships there's no need for a screen of light ships.  They're just a liability. As for carriers, Germany never had one. Bismarck was used as a commerce raider because she could destroy most British ships before they could even get in range and run from the rest.  Prinz Eugen was the only available consort.  But they were caught by equally fast and powerful units of the British Navy sent to find them, the Hood and the Prince of Wales, and forced to fight. Sending more warships risks the commander thinking they should be fighting enemy warships.  This was not their mission, though the German commanders often did not agree.  The diminutive German Navy had no hope of defeating the Royal Navy in a fair fight on the high seas, but it didn't stop officers from thinking they could, especially with a ship as new and powerful as the Bismarck.  Captain Lindeman, commanding Bismarck, was eager for a fight to use his powerful new ship.  But Admiral Lütjens strictly held them to their mission. Then there is the problem of supply, in particular food and fuel.  A successful commerce raider will be out as sea for as long as possible.  Even if they fail to sink a single ship, their existence can tie up enemy naval assets hugely out of proportion. A commerce raider can resupply from friendly overseas ports, and from friendly supply units, but mainly from scavenging from the commerce they raid.  The more fuel hungry warships you have in your fleet, and their very large and hungry crews to feed, the more thinly you need to spread your supplies. The Bismarck's mission was to raid commerce, not engage enemy warships. A good commerce raider will hide or run, only as a last resort should it fight.  Why?  It jeopardizes its mission of raiding commerce.  Fighting a warship risks damage, damage that could force it to return to port early (thus aborting its primary mission), or make it vulnerable.  The Bismarck's victory against the Hood caused both these consequences.  The Admiral Graf Spee had a similar fate after its victory in the Battle of the River Plate. Even with no damage, engaging a warship means firing a lot of precious main battery armament.  Fuel can be taken from enemy ships, but ammunition cannot be replaced without returning to port or a risky at-sea resupply mission.  Resupply at sea leaves you stopped and vulnerable with more ships for the enemy to track.  Returning to port both cuts short its primary mission, and it leaves it open to bombing and blockade by the much more powerful British Navy, as happened to its sister Tirpitz. If you sink a Royal Navy warship you risk the wrath of the Royal Navy, far more powerful and numerous than the German Navy.  It makes it difficult to raid commerce when you're dodging an ocean full of British warships.  It happened in WWI after a German victory by von Spee's powerful commerce raiding squadron at the Battle of Coronel, they were destroyed a month later by an even more powerful British task force sent to hunt them down at the Battle of the Falkland Islands. Sinking the Hood, pride of the Royal Navy, and in such a spectacular fashion, signaled the death of the Bismarck, failure of her mission, and the loss of an irreplaceable German battleship."
Why were the Romans unable to conquer Germania?,"To sum it up: The costs simply outweighed the benefits. You have to consider that Germania at this time was essentially one huge forest, which was very, well empty. No cities to conquer, the first German cities were actually founded by the Romans, like e.g. Aachen, Cologne or Trier. The Germans were primitive tribesmen and had little to offer to the Roman Empire. Yet they were warlike and fought many hard battles against them. Although the Roman armies were generally much more advanced with regard to arms technology and tactics, there were also huge setbacks like the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Even Germanicus' campaign from 14 to 16 AD is not considered a success. While Germanicus won the battles with only small losses, he lost ships and material to a storm in the North Sea after a generally successful campaign, and was recalled later. Consider also that the northern European climate is not very attractive for people who are used to the Mediterranean. You might want to read what Roman historian Tacitus wrote about Germania, the land and its inhabitants: Then, besides the danger of a boisterous and unknown sea, who would
  relinquish Asia, Africa, or Italy, for Germany, a land rude in its
  surface, rigorous in its climate, cheerless to every beholder and
  cultivator, except a native? Source: Tacitus Another fact that should be taken into account is that the Roman invasion actually created a dangerous enemy for the Roman Empire, as the German tribes of that time were rather small groups that were hostile towards each other. In my opinion, only the threat of Roman aggression allowed leaders like Arminius or Marbod to unite them into larger groups that presented a real threat at the Roman borders. So that eventually, the emperor Tiberius recalled his nephew Germanicus and decided to leave the Germans to their own discord (I can't find an English translation of the exact quote). In my opinion, this is exactly what the Romans would repeat later in northern England/Caledonia, where they decided that further conquests of hostile territory and peoples were not worth the effort, and just put up a wall (the limes in case of Germania, Hadrian's wall in England) to guard the frontier."
Was WW1 generally foreseen?,"It was foreseen that there would be new wars, and that the alliance system meant that there was real potential for a war to involve most of Europe. Otto von Bismarck said in 1897 ""One day the great European War will come out of some damned foolish thing in the Balkans."" and he was generally recognised as having a very acute understanding of European politics and the boundaries between peace and war. However, nobody anticipated that the war would take the shape that it did. It was not realised just how effective defence had become, with the fairly new technologies of barbed wire and machine guns, nor that the industrial age allowed mobilising huge armies rapidly, moving them swiftly and supplying them adequately. Nor did anyone believe that opposition troops could take the losses they did and carry on fighting (everyone believed their own troops were steadfast, but not anyone else's). Nobody understood that horse cavalry was obsolete on the battlefield, or believed that unrestricted submarine warfare would break out, or really knew how to manage a vast system of convoys, or manoeuvre large fleets in poor visibility. They didn't anticipate gas warfare, or flamethrowers, or aerial warfare, or the other expedients that would be tried to break out of the deadly embrace in which the armies of the Western Front held each other. War was anticipated, but not the scale of the tragedy that WWI became. It changed Europe greatly, and its after-effects are not yet over."

Was hay invented only in the Middle Ages in Europe?,"The Roman writer on agriculture Columella, who died around AD 70, gives a detailed description of the manufacture of hay (Latin: faenum) in his de re rustica 2.18, which reads as follows in the Loeb translation: ""It is best, moreover, that hay be cut before it begins to wither, as
  a greater quantity of it is harvested and it affords a more agreeable
  food for cattle. But a middle course should be followed in the curing,
  that it be gathered neither when very dry nor, on the other hand,
  while still green — in the one case because it is no better than straw
  if it has lost all its sap, and in the other because, if it has kept
  too much of it, it rots in the loft and often, when it becomes heated,
  it breeds fire and starts a blaze. Sometimes, too, when we have cut
  our hay a rain surprises us; and if the hay is soaked through it is
  useless to move it while wet, but better to let the upper side of it
  dry out in the sun. 2 Only then shall we turn it, and, when it is dry
  on both sides, we shall bring it together in windrows and then bind it
  up in bundles. And above all we shall lose no time in putting it under
  cover; or, if it is not convenient for the hay to be carried to the
  farmstead or tied into bundles, it will be well at any rate that all
  of it that had been dried out to the proper extent be built up into
  cocks and that these be topped off with very sharp peaks. 3 For by
  this method hay is very conveniently protected from rains; and even if
  there is no rain, it is still not amiss to build the aforesaid cocks,
  so that any moisture remaining in the hay may sweat and dry out in the
  piles. For this reason wise husbandmen, even in the case of hay
  brought under cover, do not store it away until they have allowed it
  to heat and cool for a few days in a loose pile. But now after the
  haymaking comes attention to the grain harvest; and that we may
  properly gather it, we must first put in readiness the implements with
  which the crops are harvested."" So much for the claim that ""in the classical world of Greece and Rome and in all earlier times, there was no hay""."
History of scientific regression [closed],"Roman Cement Concrete was widely used throughout antiquity by the Persians, Egyptians, Assyrians, and Romans. The Romans technique in creating concrete allowed them to build the Pantheon, Colosseum, aqueducts, and spectacular baths (big ones, awesome ones). Amazingly many structures built with this Roman Cement are still standing. The recipe was lost during the descent into the Dark Ages. A History of Cement ... Roman Formula The secret of Roman success in making cement was traced to the mixing
  of slaked lime with pozzolana, a volcanic ash from Mount Vesuvius.
  This process produced a cement capable of hardening under water.
  During the Middle Ages this art was lost and it was not until the
  scientific spirit of inquiry revived that we rediscovered the secret
  of hydraulic cement -- cement that will harden under water. ... Roman Arch, Roman Vault, and Roman Dome  Technique established around 100 BC. This powerful architecture would nearly disappear entirely from Europe until the Gothic Arch in the 16th century The Renaissance ... New Materials No one knew how to construct a dome such as the one that covered the
  Roman Pantheon. No one knew how to construct the equestrian statues of
  the Empire, or even the free-standing human sculptures of the Greeks.
  Creating such works required a knowledge of materials and design that
  had simply been lost after the fall of Rome. ... NOTE: I have been informed that the Roman Arch was indeed still put to use after the Roman Domination of Europe. However, I am still torn on wether or not the true Roman Arch and its building technique was implemented. If further information on this subject is found please feel free to add comments Indoor Plumbing Invented circa 1500 BC (and later) Indoor Plumbing in Rome was common throughout the majority of housing. During the Dark Ages, the technical knowledge of the plumbing system was lost. Throughout the Dark Ages, city plumbing would have been nice in much of Europe. Possibly even prevent the spread of certain plagues.?. Roads/Cartography Britain's prehistoric Icknield Way (running 200 miles, in places as wide as a four-lane highway) is superior to any road constructed by the later Romans. And later these ""inferior"" Roman roads in Germania and Britania would end up disappearing all together. Egyptian pyramids Egypt's earliest pyramid construction was superior to later pyramid construction. Greek Fire An incendiary weapon that was used by the military of the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantines most famously used it during the 11th century, when it was credited with helping to repel two sieges of Constantinople by Arab invaders. In its earliest form it was poured into jars and thrown at enemies like a grenade or a Molotov cocktail. Later, giant bronze tubes were mounted on warships, and siphons were used spray the weapon at enemy vessels. The closest counterpart to Greek Fire, napalm, wasn’t perfected until the early 1940s. Steel.?. Damascus steel was widely used in the Middle East from 1100-1700 AD. The blades are believed to have been created using wootz steel. The special quality may have been derived from a process which weaved together tough cementite and soft iron to form a metal that was as strong as it was flexible. The particular process for forging Damascus steel appears to have disappeared sometime around 1750 AD. The Key Role of Impurities in Ancient Damascus Steel Blades ... Research efforts over the years have claimed the discovery of methods
  to reproduce wootz Damascus steel blades,9-12 but all of these methods
  suffer from the same problem—modern bladesmiths have been unable to
  use the methods to reproduce the blades. The successful reproduction
  of wootz Damascus blades requires that blades be produced that match
  the chemical composition, possess the characteristic damascene surface
  pattern, and possess the same internal microstructure that causes the
  surface pattern. ... The number ""0"" Research has shown that very ancient cultures knew about zero and its necessity in performing complex mathematics. However, this knowledge was not present among the Babylonians, who wrote it as a black space a practice which eventually disappeared. The same retrograde process occurred in China. NOTE: The ""ancient cultures"" in Mesopotamia did not use the concept of zero as it would be used later. The ""zero"" was not used alone. Nor was it used at the end of a number. Thus numbers like 2 and 120, looked the same. Only context could differentiate them. Calendar Maya calendar, perhaps, more accurate than our own (Gregorian Calendar). [Expanded explanation and source cited per request in comments by Lohoris] ... Leap Year Needed to Correct Calendar Drift ""Finally it became so ridiculous that Pope Gregory XIII was convinced
  by his astronomers that basically all the Christian holidays were
  being celebrated on the wrong days,"" Duncan said. The pope introduced
  his Gregorian calendar in 1582, which determined that only one out of
  every four ""century years"" would observe a leap year. Thus while the
  years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, 2100, 2200, and 2300 are not. The
  Gregorian calendar was gradually, and sometimes grudgingly, adopted by
  much of the world and remains in common use. ... Maya's Missing Leap Year  The ancient Maya, famed for their elaborate
  and accurate calendar systems, observed two calendar years, but
  neither seemed to have bothered with a leap year. ""As far as we know,
  the people of Mesoamerica—the Maya included—didn't care about leap
  years,"" said Anthony Aveni, an expert in ancient Mesoamerican
  astronomy at Colgate University. The Maya solar year of 365 days was
  central to the agricultural cycle, while their ritual year of 260 days
  was critical for determining auspicious dates. These calendars were
  carefully designed to synchronize in 52-year cycles, but no effort was
  made to prevent ""drifting"" dates. ""They didn't care if they didn't
  have a white Christmas, or if their Fourth of July wasn't in the
  summer, to put it in our terms,"" Aveni explained. The Maya instead
  placed priority on marking the passage of time through additional
  calendar systems such as the Long Count, which unfolds on a cycle more
  than 5,000 years long. ""Our philosophy about leap year is a
  complicated scheme to make the seasons jibe with the calendar,"" Aveni
  said. The Maya ""were more concerned that time should be unbroken, not
  interfered with, and that the count of time should have continuity,""
  he said. ""To break continuity would be to break order."" ... Source: National Geographic News - Leap year (why) Birth control Romans used, Silphium, an herbal drug as one of the earliest forms of birth control. It is likely that over harvesting drove the plant into extinction. It is worth noting that other herbs that are chemically similar to Silphium have been proven to have a fairly high rate of preventing pregnancy.  General Researchers have commented that the medicine of ancient Egypt was, generally speaking, far superior to that practiced in Europe during the Middle Ages and Pre-Incan medical surgery was superior to that of the Peruvian Inca.  Stradivari Violins Constructed by the Stradivari family in Italy from roughly 1650-1750.

Why was Spanish Fascist dictatorship left in power after World War II?,"The OP said this in a comment: technically speaking, Spain was a satellite state. However, the treaty was mainly intended for the countries within the big blocks so I assume it was just ignored. The second statement, that Spain was overlooked, is flatly not true as will be demonstrated once we look at the text of the agreements and the historical arguing about what to do with Spain. The question of whether Spain counted as an Axis satellite state is one which was hotly debated in 1944 and 1945. This is the crux of the question. ""Axis satellite state"" is mentioned in the ""Protocol Of Proceedings Of Crimea Conference"", aka the Yalta Agreement, but it's never defined. They jointly declare their mutual agreement to concert during the temporary period of instability in liberated Europe the policies of their three Governments in assisting the peoples liberated from the domination of Nazi Germany and the peoples of the former Axis satellite states of Europe to solve by democratic means their pressing political and economic problems. However, section II ""Declaration Of Liberated Europe"" makes it clear what their goals were. It's worth reading in its entirety. Italics are mine to highlight relevant sections. The Premier of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the President of the United States of America have consulted with each other in the common interests of the people of their countries and those of liberated Europe. They jointly declare their mutual agreement to concert during the temporary period of instability in liberated Europe the policies of their three Governments in assisting the peoples liberated from the domination of Nazi Germany and the peoples of the former Axis satellite states of Europe to solve by democratic means their pressing political and economic problems. The establishment of order in Europe and the rebuilding of national economic life must be achieved by processes which will enable the liberated peoples to destroy the last vestiges of nazism and fascism and to create democratic institutions of their own choice. This is a principle of the Atlantic Charter - the right of all people to choose the form of government under which they will live - the restoration of sovereign rights and self-government to those peoples who have been forcibly deprived to them by the aggressor nations. To foster the conditions in which the liberated people may exercise these rights, the three governments will jointly assist the people in any European liberated state or former Axis state in Europe where, in their judgment conditions require, (a) to establish conditions of internal peace; (b) to carry out emergency relief measures for the relief of distressed peoples; (c) to form interim governmental authorities broadly representative of all democratic elements in the population and pledged to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of Governments responsive to the will of the people; and (d) to facilitate where necessary the holding of such elections. The three Governments will consult the other United Nations and provisional authorities or other Governments in Europe when matters of direct interest to them are under consideration. When, in the opinion of the three Governments, conditions in any European liberated state or former Axis satellite in Europe make such action necessary, they will immediately consult together on the measure necessary to discharge the joint responsibilities set forth in this declaration. By this declaration we reaffirm our faith in the principles of the Atlantic Charter, our pledge in the Declaration by the United Nations and our determination to build in cooperation with other peace-loving nations world order, under law, dedicated to peace, security, freedom and general well-being of all mankind. This isn't a denunciation of fascism. It isn't a call to arms to overthrow dictatorships worldwide. It's defining how the liberated nations and minor Axis powers will be treated after WWII. The goal is ""to solve by democratic means their pressing political and economic problems"". Someplace like Romania, Hungary, or Bulgaria, Axis belligerents who were devastated by the war. Or Norway and the Netherlands who had puppet governments installed. These countries needed their governments replaced, economies rebuilt, and social order restored. Spain, in contrast, was neither conquered by the Axis nor allied with them. They never declared war and they never allowed either power to move troops through their country (to the great relief of Britain and Gibraltar). Spain had a working, independent, if fascist, government. They were untouched by the war. By the scale of the rest of Europe they had no ""pressing political and economic problems"". This is not to say people didn't try to get Spain treated as an Axis satellite state. Spain was technically ""non-belligerent"" but they really, really pushed it. The Spanish civil war, a proxy battle between communism and fascism, and their support of the Nazis made Spain a hot button topic for communists and socialists after the war. In particular the French and the Soviets. While Spain never officially sent Spanish troops to fight, they allowed an entire division of volunteers to fight the Soviets. The 250. Infanterie-Division aka División Española de Voluntarios aka División Azul (curiously, their emblem is red and yellow) was an all volunteer division, some professional soldiers, some anti-communists, trained and supplied by the Germans, and sent to fight on the Eastern Front in 1941. They fought in the Siege of Leningrad and earned the Soviet's ire by stopping a major attempt to break the siege in 1943. Eventually almost 50,000 Spaniards would fight the Soviets. Pressed by the Allies, Franco ordered all volunteers to return to Spain in late 1943. This is an important point, by 1944 Franco could see the writing on the wall and was more and more cooperating with the Allies. But many wanted to see Spain excluded from the growing United Nations. At the UN Conference on International Organization... the Mexican delegate to the conference,  a Spanish exiled anti-fascist named Luis Quintanilla,  appealed  for the exclusion  of Spain from the UN on  the grounds that the United  Charter excluded all those countries ruled by regimes established  with the help of Germany or Italy. At the later Potsdam Conference in 1945... the Soviets  wanted  to  go one step  further and
proposed  on  19 July  1945  that all  relations with  Franco including  diplomatic and economic  links be  severed. The eventual statement was a bit softer. In a joint statement,  issued during  the Potsdam  Conference,
the three great powers,  US,  Britain and  the USSR,  expressed their wish  that Spain should not apply for membership to the United Nations given the fact that her current regime was founded with the help of the Axis  powers,  was closely associated with the
Axis and  did  not posses the necessary qualifications to justify membership The strongest statement made was the Tripartite Statement on Spain of March 4, 1946... THE GOVERNMENTS of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America have exchanged views with regard to the present Spanish Government and their relations with that regime. It is agreed that so long as General Franco continues in control of Spain, the Spanish people cannot anticipate full and cordial association with those nations of the world which have, by common effort, brought defeat to German Nazism and Italian Fascism, which aided the present Spanish regime in its rise to power and after which the regime was patterned. However this declaration had no teeth because it was considered an internal Spanish problem. There is no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of Spain. The Spanish people themselves must in the long run work out their own destiny. In spite of the present regime's repressive measures against orderly efforts of the Spanish people to organize and give expression to their political aspirations, the three Governments are hopeful that the Spanish people will not again be subjected to the horrors and bitterness of civil strife. But the idea of diplomatic and economic sanctions was floated. Such recognition would include full diplomatic relations and the taking of such practical measures to assist in the solution of Spain's economic problems as may be practicable in the circumstances prevailing. Such measures are not now possible. The question of the maintenance or termination by the Governments of France the United Kingdom, and the United States of diplomatic relations with the present Spanish regime is a matter to be decided in the light of events and after taking into account the efforts of the Spanish people to achieve their own freedom. In 1946, Spain was having a hard time diplomatically. Worldwide public opinion  was  moving against Franco.  Canada publicly  rebuffed Spain’s attempt to establish  diplomatic relations.  During  spring  1946,  six  Communist, four Latin  American,  three Commonwealth and  four other  states  severed  diplomatic relations  with  Spain.  There was also speculation  that Italy  might do the same. Article 33, beginning Chapter VI of the UN charter, says: The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice. The UN found that the issue of what to do about Spain fell under Chapter VI and thus had to be resolved by peaceful means, didn't matter that Spain was not then a UN member. There could be no invasion of Spain by UN states to topple Franco. This culminated in December 1946 with UN Resolution 39 ""Relations of Members of the United Nations with Spain"" which called for the end to the Franco regime and its diplomatic isolation. Spain may not be admitted to the United Nations... Recommends that the Franco Government of Spain be debarred from membership in international agencies established by or brought into relationship with the United Nations... Recommends that all Members of the United Nations immediately recall from Madrid their Ambassadors and Ministers plenipotentiary accredited there. Other sources talk about the desire of the US to take a gentle approach to Spain in order to bring her into the fold of a Western Alliance to defend against Communism. The US military found the prospect of a war and national uprising in Spain dubious saying: there is  no prospect of any  form of popular rising  taking place in  Spain...  a rising, caused by  foreign intervention,  if strong enough to avoid immediate suppression  by  the police with army backing,  would almost inevitably result in  the outbreak of another civil  war...  a civil war in  Spain  with French and Russian intervention  would  also be
likely to precipitate a crisis in France. The US military increasingly looked at Spain and Italy as fallback positions against possible Soviet invasion of Europe. The Pincher Plan saw the possibility of using the Pyrenees as a natural defensive line to buy time against an overwhelming Soviet attack for a US build up. The withdrawal of US  forces across France into  Spain also  may prove  feasible.  This, too,  will be largely dependent upon  political considerations.  It is probable that an anti-Communistic  government will remain in  power for at least the next year or two,  and  if Spain  is  willing  to  desert her position as a neutral,  then  the withdrawal  of US  forces into  Spain  would  make a material  contribution  to any  required  defense of the Pyrenees. On  the other hand,  the Allies  would probably be committed  to  the defense of Spain, which  might well entail a substantial diversion  of resources.  Retention  of an anti-Communist government in  Spain  would  materially  assist in  maintaining  the security of the western Mediterranean. Here we see the beginnings of the Cold War idea that if you're anti-Communist, you're a potential US ally. That it's better to support a fascist dictatorship than to risk a left-leaning democratically elected government. Sir Victor Mallet, British  Ambassador to  Spain, wrote A weak Government in  Spain, whether of the Right or the Left,  would pave the way for increased  Soviet influence and pressure through  the Spanish  Communists.  The one real  merit of the present Government is  that it does at least maintain order."
Why did the Roman military start to favour swords over the spear phalanx?,"Actually, the Romans used the same phalanx everyone else did for a very long time. Past Hannibal. The essence of winning a phalanx battle is to attack the flank of the phalanx. One may achieve that many ways, hence the many ways phalanxes were formed in particular battles - adapted to the width of the battlefield usually, though if one's enemy overdid that, one might go narrow and deep hoping to break them and turn into their new flanks. That kind of calculus. But ordinarily, the outcome depended upon gaining superiority on one flank or the other in one's mounted forces. I'll use ""cavalry"" from here, but they were in no way cavalry. Closer to knights in that they fought as individuals. The cavalry that gained superiority then piled in and while slaughtering the hapless foot soldiers, broke the phalanx allowing their own phalanx to complete the main destruction. As everyone fought spear-in-right-hand, a phalanx battle usually turned counterclockwise as if on a pivot making the enemy's right flank the most exposed and therefore an attractive target for trying to gain cavalry superiority. Side note:  elephants were never, ever effective unless held on the flanks for charging into men who were a) distracted by other men trying to kill them, and b) no longer screened by their own knights. Hence, the spear. To have even the least chance in the world of holding off horsemen, one needs pole arms. Those longer and longer spears one needs of were of no value fighting someone 4-5-6 ranks of men up, but they did allow one to face cavalry. And the most effective method of using a spear in combat is underhanded:  ripping up and across; not something one can even attempt with a 23-foot spear. Someone nearby striking over handed at the same man might be handy since he then has to defend up and down, so the 2-3 ranks behind you having slightly longer spears than yours meant they could provide a worthwhile assist. Spears though are unwieldy - all you really want is the sharp end. Hence the short sword. Why as long/short as it was? Because iron weaponry is brittle, and it couldn't be any longer without a good chance of breaking. Besides, the evolution of the concept started with just using the head of the spear. Bigger shield to hide your strikes and let you concentrate a bit more on the strikes due to its greater protection. A bit less mobile for the larger shield, but one's striking was far more aggressive, able to come from almost any place and direction. Not as effective anymore though against horse from the flanks, but if you can beat the enemy phalanx before his horse gains superiority on a flank, that never matters. So the maniple. It allows easier maintenance of your line when attacking over broken ground, so your enemy sees his more broken by the ground than you see yours. (Men can speed up or slow down because there aren't 7-49 men directly behind you (picture cars starting up from a traffic light and one driver hits his brakes for even a moment), and they can move up a rank or two if the ground causes a gap to form while the men farther behind can edge over and up to keep the depth uniform. In a phalanx, the men moving about have the wrong weaponry. Perhaps far more important, picture a man in the first rank getting tired. He just gets more tired until he is killed in the phalanx. The men behind him have completely unsuitable spears for first rank fighting. A man from rank 7 is going to replace him using his 23-foot spear?? There is weapon trading happening as they rotate out?? Not too easy. With the maniple, not only can men move up to rotate out tired fighters, but they can rotate into any role in the entire unit. They form a reserve of ready, rested replacements and use them as needed. (In fact, the concept of a reserve for the overall army may have been born in the maniple. Though it took a while for the Romans to learn how to use reserves properly.) Oh, and wounded men can be rotated fairly easily and actually live through the battle, perhaps even fight more later on. As to facing cavalry if/when the enemy gained tactical superiority on a flank, they still had supplies of javelins and actual spears. Though the truth is, no foot unit survives when an intact unit of heavily armored and weaponed knights piles into your formation from the flank. To make it very short, why fight using the whole heavy spear when all you really want is the short, sharp end? The Romans found they had no answer to that and used just the short, sharp end of the spear. What we call a short sword."
"In ancient Rome, could free-born Romans become slaves?","That is for sure an overgeneralisation, but so is Wikipedia's. There are some elements of truth in both: Ancient Rome held that freedom could not be sold, and in principle a freeborn person could not become a slave. [F]reedom was, like servitude, conceptusliased as a natural state. Thus, it was in principle, if not quite in practice, impossible to surrender one's freedom, except in very special cases. As one Roman orator declared, 'What nature gave to the freeborn cannot be snatched away b any injury of fortune.' Roman law thus considered free status inalienable . . . Throughout Rome's history the basic division appears to have remained intact. Mouritsen, Henrik. The Freedman in the Roman world. Cambridge University Press, 2011.</sub? In practice, many freeborn Romans did become slaves, and still more were functionally enslaved by fellow Romans, if not quite technically slaves. Despite the popular myth, poor Roman parents could not legally sell their children into real slavery. For instance, a law issued by Constantine in 325 states that even though a father had the power of life and death over his children, he could not sell their liberty (Libertati a maioribus tantum inpensum est, ut patribus, quibus ius vitae in liberos necisque potestas permissa est, eripere libertatem non liceret.). Yet we have good evidence of Roman parents doing just that from all periods. The Roman state would not sanction the practice in law, but also demurred in putting an end to it. Cicero [thought] that patria potestas had originally included some kind of a right to sell one's children, but for the period for which we have sources, the selling of freeborn children or pledging them loco servi were understood as offences - but with no punishment to parents. Ando, Clifford, Paul J. du Plessis, and Kaius Tuori, eds. The Oxford Handbook of Roman Law and Society. Oxford University Press, 2016. In practice, therefore, children were indeed put to work like slaves in exchange for money to their parents. By law these transactions were legally void and the children retained their freeborn status, but it probably made little practical difference. Nonetheless, unlike manumitted slaves, sold children did not become freedman on redemption but regained their full native freedoms. Likewise, there were many affirmations that exposed freeborn infants did not become slaves even if reared as such by a rescuer. In an age before DNA testing, however, this was basically theoretical. Ultimately, at some point, Roman law compromised its dogmatic principle with the prevalent practice, by recognising a parental right to ""rent"" their children out. According to the Pauli Sententiae: Whoever, under threat of extreme necessity or for the sake of sustenance, sells their own children, shall not prejudice their freeborn status. For a freeman has no price . . . Parents may nevertheless rent the labor of their children. Harper, Kyle. Slavery in the Late Roman World, AD 275–425. Cambridge University Press, 2011. The above source also mentions that in the 420s, Augustine states that the law permits a rental period of 25 years. Again, while theoretically different from slavery, there is little practical difference for the children in question. Aside from children, it was not generally possible for freeborn Romans to be legally enslaved by private transaction, and those who found themselves in chains could have their freedoms restored by a magistrate. Accordingly, free Romans could not legally sell themselves into slavery. In fact, Roman law recognised such transactions (if the ""slave"" shared the profits) to be fraud, since their free status could not be given up. Ironically, the punishment was for the perpetrator to be actually enslaved. Roman law guaranteed the citizen's status to such an extent that the status could be forfeited only by legally recognised processes: capture in war, or when a free man sold himself as a slave in order to defraud an unsuspecting buyer. Wiedemann, Thomas. Greek and Roman Slavery. Routledge, 2003. Nonetheless, it was possible for freeborn Romans to be sentenced to slavery, or slave-like conditions. In the High Empire, a punishment known as servi poenae developed, whereby both lower class freeborns and slaves could be sentenced to theoretically lifelong hard labour, typically in a mine. This is known as ""penal slavery"", and it was a condition even worse than usual slavery. These 'slaves of the penalty' were neither the property of the fiscus nor the property of the emperor. Nor did servi poenae enjoy the usual rights of a slave. An edict of Antonius Pius appears to have ruled that slaves of the fiscus could receive an inheritance, while servie poenae could not. Moreover, slaves condemned to the metalla and saved by the clemency of the emperor - according to Ulpian - were not returned to their owner but could become servi fisci. Hirt, Alfred Michael. Imperial mines and quarries in the Roman world: Organizational Aspects, 27 BC-AD 235. Oxford University Press, 2010 Legal punishments and black market transactions aside, another major source of enslaved Romans came from kidnappings. This was, obviously, not supposed to be legal. In practice, pirate kidnappers had no regard for their victim's status and slave traders asked few questions. In an age before personal identification and extensive government records, it would have been quite difficult for a freeborn person, once kidnapped and sold to a distant part of the Empire, to free themselves via the legal process. With regards to enslavement by tax collectors, there are a few well known examples including the Jews, the Frisii and Bityhnia. It is said that, when Rome requested Bithynian soldiers for the Cimbrian War, king Nicomedes III replied that all his able bodied men had been enslaved by Roman tax collectors. Likewise, the Frisii revolted when the Roman tax burden became so intolerable, that tax collectors enslaved their wives and children. Finally, Josephtus reports that Cassius reduced four Jewish cities to slavery for failing to pay their taxes. In these commonly cited examples, it seems clear that the victims were Roman ""allies"" or subjugated nations, rather than actual Romans. I am unable to find evidence that enslavement was a legally authorised punishment for Roman citizen. In any case, during this time Rome typically outsourced its tax collection to local agents, sometimes known as ""tax farmers""."
Was Switzerland really impossible to invade during WW2?,"Ok, since I think I finally got your real question (as I see it): I'm simply asking if the defense of Switzerland during WW2 was overrated. Many people claim that the country was impossible to occupy, I just want to know if this is not clearly exaggerated. The emphasis is what I interpret as your ""real"" question (since there is a lot of confusion here) and will answer it. First of all, you probably have the wrong impression (partly).
Switzerland never tried and was never seen as impossible to invade, even their well-planned defense wasn't impenetrable, and everyone knew that. The only point was to make a possible invasion (and occupation) so costly that it would never be worth it. You got it right that the invasion would be over very quick, however, you go wrong with this one: Feeding 800 000+ soldiers in the Alps for months if not years isn't realistic. Because they were well prepared to hold out in their bunkers (and go raiding from there) for an extended amount of time. And then we come to your ""real"" question (IMHO), which is not the invasion, but the occupation. And that is where another of your questions comes in: why would the German and Italian armies need to attack those strongholds in the mountains? Because the Swiss planned to constantly attack out from these forts, waging a heavy and costly guerilla warfare from against the occupying troops. This means Germany would have had two options:
A) attack the forts, which would be time, supply and manpower-costly to no end.
B) endure the terrorism And B) would be costly. The French resistance could be dealt with (somewhat) because they were few, mostly untrained civilians with (mostly) scavenged equipment. And they did their part, too. Now imagine that, but with 80k well trained, drilled, coordinated and fully equipped soldiers.
Yeah, Germany would have pretty much a third front right in their backyard for years, which would have been unacceptable. TLDR:
Switzerland would have been hard (but possible) to invade, but almost impossible to occupy."
Was race really unimportant in the 1660's?,"(Disclaimer: definition of race varies. Wikipedia offers this: ""a grouping of humans based on shared physical or social qualities into categories generally viewed as distinct by society"" and that is the view taken in this answer. Some of you prefer to define race by skin colour, in which case feel free to ignore Aristotle.) Racism is a very ancient concept. Aristotle famously argued that non-Greeks were inherently inferior races, naturally suited to being enslaved by Greeks.  Nature, then, has distinguished between female and slave . . . But non-Greeks assign to female and slave exactly the same status. This is because they have nothing which is by nature fitted to rule; their association consists of a male slave and a female slave. So, as the poets say, 'It is proper that Greeks should rule non-Greeks', the implication being that non-Greek and slave are by nature identical. Likewise, racism was very much in existence in Early Modern England, at a time when English settlers were creating colonial America. Consider Shakespeare's Othello. Iago roused Brabantio with vivid imagery of a black man ""tupping"" his daughter, and threats of black grandchildren: Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul.
  Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
  Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise,
  Awake the snorting citizens with the bell
  Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.   This is not to say that Shakespeare's Venice was a racist society (debate on this continues), but evidently the characters are well aware of race, especially as an emotional factor. By implication, so were the intended English audience. Moreover, visually, Othello's black skin is repeatedly associated with something bad. For example the Duke, in an effort to help, tells Brabantio: If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black Even Othello himself says: Her name, that was as fresh
  As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
  As mine own face Othello was written around 1600, only a few years before Shakespeare's audience began settling in America. It was also a work of its time - its racial stereotypes of jealous and intemperate Moors echoed other Renaissance texts. Are we really to believe that the same mindset evident in prejudice against the exotic Moor in 1600, wouldn't have manifested in even more explicit racism against enslaved blacks in colonial plantations? And in fact, evidence of racism in the colonies is trivial to find. In 1630, over three decades before the timeframe in question, the colony of Virginia ordered a white man severely punished for miscegenation. According to the official report, Hugh Davis to be soundly whipt before an assembly of negroes and others for abusing himself to the dishonor of God and shame of Christians, by defiling his body in lying with a negro, which fault he is to acknowledge next Sabbath day. Gabbidon, Shaun L., and Helen Taylor Greene. Race and Crime. Sage Publications, 2012. Davis was not being punished for merely fornicating, but specifically that he did it with a black woman. One readily sees that black people were regarded as distinctly inferior, to the point that sex with one is equated with ""defiling"". Certainly the importance of race in a society may have been less in times when it was less ubiquitous (e.g., meeting an Indian was purely theoretical for most medieval European peasants), but it was never truly nonconsequential, and certainly not in the timeframe Lerone Bennet specified."
Why did Hitler not invade Sweden?,"Sweden was a vital source of iron ores to Germany, an important strategic resource for her war effort. Because the allies controlled the seas, Scandinavia was Germany's main source of good quality iron. Attacking Sweden would have disrupted the supply for no real gain. Production of high-grade steel suitable for armour plate and gun barrels depended largely on the Bessemer process which, in turn, required ores of high phosphorus content. This Swedish iron had in plenty, and German foundries relied especially on supplies mined from ... northern Sweden. Swedish ore was so essential to the German armaments industry, in fact, that as late as 1944, when the Reich's inland transportation network was under considerable strain, Germany went to great lengths to sustain its coal exports to Sweden in order to complete the exchange for ore.  - Greenhous, Brereton, et al. The Crucible of War, 1939-1945. The Official History of the Royal Canadian Air Force, Volume III. Toronto: Toronto University Press, 1994.  Politically, this also meant that Sweden, while neutral, continued to trade with Nazi Germany. Hitler could get what he needed from Sweden by diplomacy or coercion. Soviet Russia, in contrast, was an ideological enemy and a competing or potentially competing great power. Although it ended badly, that gave Hitler an actual motivation to invade (in addition to his personal issues). Now, if Sweden refused to supply Germany's resource needs, then that would probably have increased the likelihood of an invasion; but Swedish leaders cooperated with Hitler."
"Was murdering a slave illegal in American slavery, and if so, what punishments were given for it?","Yes, murder of a slave was illegal in the antebellum South, and it was a capital offence. An example is the case of John Hoover of North Carolina.  He was arrested on 28 March 1839 for the murder of one of his slaves named Mira.  He was brought to trial on 12 September 1839 before a jury of his peers (i.e. 12 male slaveholders).  At his trial, it was recorded that Hoover had declared that: “the negro was his own property and he had a right to do as he pleased with his property ...”  Perhaps surprisingly, given that they were also all slave-owners, the jury disagreed.  On  Friday 13 September 1839, he was convicted on the charge of murder.  An appeal was heard at the North Carolina Supreme Court in Raleigh which upheld the verdict. John Hoover was executed for the murder of his slave in May 1840. Details of the case can be found in: Anthony V. Baker: “for the murder of his own female slave, a woman named Mira...” : Law, Slavery and Incoherence in Antebellum North Carolina Interestingly, Anthony V. Baker's paper shows how the laws of North Carolina had changed over time.  In particular, a 1774 statute which had criminalised the murder of a slave (“willfully and maliciously killing a slave”), but which had also reduced the punishment for such a murder, such that an offender would: “suffer twelve Months Imprisonment...” for the first offense and back to the more traditional punishment, “suffer[ing] Death, without benefit of Clergy....” for the second. However, how often these laws were enforced in practice is a different question.   Not only that, but the difficulty in obtaining a conviction should not be underestimated.  This was illustrated in the relatively well-known case of Eliza Rowand, who was charged with, & acquitted of, the murder of one of her slaves in 1847. For a wider view of the question, I'd recommend Andrew T. Fede's recent book: Homicide Justified: The Legality of Killing Slaves in the United States and the Atlantic World.  This includes discussions around the issues raised by both of the cases mentioned above, and also includes an entire chapter dedicated to The Antebellum States' Law on Slave Homicide (Chapter 11)."
How would a Spartan have held his shield?,"SHORT ANSWER Most battles were short and thus the shield did not have to be held for long in combat. Also, Spartans who survived the training which began in early childhood were extremely tough both physically and mentally. Lastly, most historians of ancient Greek warfare have estimated that the shield used in classical times weighed between 13.5 lbs / 6.12 kgs and 18 lbs / 8.16 kgs (i.e. 30 lbs is most likely an extreme limit, if not an exaggeration). DETAILED ANSWER Battles involving the Greek city states rarely lasted more than a few hours, and Most battles were decided essentially within an hour Source: Victor Davis Hanson, Hoplites: The Classical Greek battle Experience The actual fighting typically started no earlier than late-morning, after breakfast had been taken (which was mid-morning) and sacrifices made. The soldiers (hoplites) would march into position and there would be speeches exhorting them to be brave and fight well. Up to this point they would not have been holding their shields in front of them but rather resting them on their knee when stationary or carrying them on their shoulders when moving into position (see walrus' excellent and detailed explanation on this). They would only have to start holding them in front of them with the full weight on the arm when they advanced towards the enemy line. 
""Marble base of a funerary kouros"" showing hoplites (left side) on the move with shields carried on the shoulder, rather than in front of the body as they would be if in battle. Source: NATIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM, HELLENIC MINISTRY OF CULTURE & SPORTS Battles between hoplite armies usually involved (to put it simply) a lot of shoving and pushing until one side gave way (and it wasn't usually the Spartans), and some of the weight of the shield would have been taken by whatever or whoever it was pressed up against. Further, only soldiers within reach of enemy spears have to have held their shields in front of them. In short, they would not usually have had to support the full weight of the shield on their arm for an extended period of time.
 This vase shows clearly how the shield was held using the hand and the forearm Source: The Hoplite Shields - Periklis Deligianis Spartan fitness and training obviously counted in their favour in longer encounters as their opponents usually tired first (see below). Sometimes, Spartan opponents withdrew without engaging due to the reputation of the Spartans - in other words, 'real' combat could be over in a matter of minutes, if it even happened at all. At Mantinea in 418 BC, for example, many Athenians and Argives did not even wait to come to blows but immediately gave way as
  the Spartans advanced and there were some who were trampled in their
  haste to avoid being caught. Source: Thucidides, cited in M. M. Sage, Warfare in Ancient Greece After the battle line of one side gave way, there would usually be a general rout but hoplites rarely pursued the fleeing enemy far: the mopping up was left to the cavalry and light infantry. One notable exception to the customary short battle was Thermopylae (480 BC). In this encounter with the Persians, the front line was rotated to give everyone a rest. Spartans underwent rigorous training from the age of 6 or 7 in the agoge. They had to be extremely tough both mentally and physically to survive it. A particular emphasis was placed on enduring hardship. Thucydides wrote Spartans holding a position will fight long and stubborn battles until
  they rout the enemy, but once they have done so they do not pursue
  them for any great distance nor for long. Source: M. M. Sage This 'toughness' invariably meant that Spartan hoplites would win in the end, if for no other reason than endurance. Hoplites of other Greek city states were rarely able to match the Spartans in this regard (among other things) and thus, even if they were able to hold their own initially, they would almost always tire before the Spartans. They did not get anything like the same training and (excepting, at different times, Thebes - the Sacred Band - and Argos) did not have full-time professional soldiers. This uneven match made it more likely that battles would be short. Nonetheless, even Spartans recognized that holding a hoplon for long periods was tough: one form of punishment they used was to have the offender stand guard all day holding his shield. A final point here is that, when on the march (except immediately before battle), helots were often used as porters, carrying soldiers' equipment. Thus, the hoplites' strength was saved for the 'main event'. Concerning the weight of the shield, we can't be sure exactly and shield designs changed over time. I've seen estimates ranging from 13.5 lbs / 6.12 kgs to 30 lbs / 13.61 kgs, but Hansen (in Hoplites) cites the work of several experts, none of whom estimate the weight of the hoplon at more than 18 lbs / 8.16 kgs, and Sekunda (in The Spartan Army) is also within this range. Estimates for the total weight of shield, body armour and weapons are in the area of 70 lbs / 31.75 kgs so the hoplite had much more than just the weight of his shield to bear. Also, these shields were used primarily to form a protective wall in formation; they were not designed to be swung around (as you often see in the movies), something which would have quickly tired even the strongest Spartan soldier.

Why was the Council of Nicea held in Nicea rather than Rome or Constantinople?,"The First Council of Nicaea was held in 325, five years before Constantinople would be founded. At the time, the capital of the Eastern Empire was Nicomedia, which Constantine conquered in 324. The Emperor resided there until he refounded Byzantium as his namesake. Nicaea was a nearby resort town, and hosted an imperial palace - a suitable convention venue. Originally, the council was supposed to be held at Ancyra before Constantine had it moved to Nicaea. His letter of invitation listed the official reasons: The Syriac version of the Letter of Constantine summoning the bishops to Nicaea gives his reasons for changing the venue from Ancyra to Nicaea. It would be easier for the bishops from Italy and other parts of Europe to reach Nicaea; the air was better there; and it would be a nearer place for the Emperor to reach (from Nicomedia). These are unexceptional reasons. Hanson, Richard Patrick Crosland, and R. P. Hanson. The Search for the Christian Doctrine of God: The Arian Controversy 318-381 AD. A&C Black, 2005. Of course, politics being politics, Constantine probably had other motivations in mind too. The stated reasons were true; but there were unstated considerations as well. Besides the fact that Ancrya lay far inland on the hot Galatian plateau, it was also the episcopal see of the rabid anti-Arian bishop Marcellus - that site was not only inconvenient for western travelers, but was also inhospitable for Arian sympathizers. Nicaea, on the other hand, was a pleasant lakeside town only a day's ride from the Marmora Sea coast . . . within the metropolitan area of Eusbius of Nicomedia, and was the episcopal see of his Arian ally Theognis. Odahl, Charles. Constantine and the Christian empire. Routledge, 2010. It's worth noting here that one of the primary purposes of the council had been to resolve the theological controversy raised by Arius. Constantine's goal was to harmonise the church by reaching a consensus, not to create an echo chamber of anti-Arian clerics. Ultimately, the bishops at Nicaea ratified the Nicene Creed with an overwhelming majority, though the issue was still far from settled. Note: the Pentarchy of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem is a much later development. It was only formalised by the Council in Trullo in 692, though the five cities had been influential for centuries before that."
"What do the phone number suffixes J, M, R, W in 1940 New York phone book mean?","You are correct that these are party lines. The letters represent an additional digit dialed after the others in cases where automatic operations was implemented. This article goes into great depth all about how multi-party telephone lines worked, but as a short excerpt: A scheme widely used in the Bell Telephone System for four-party full selective  lines  (under  both  manual  and  automatic  operation)  used  a  suffix  letter,  generally  from  the  set  J,  M,  R,  and  W,  to  designate  which  of  the  four  ringing  signals  applies  to  the  station.  These  letters  were chosen to not be easily mis-heard when spoken (with regard to manual operation). With  regard  to  automatic  operation,  in  metropolitan  areas,  the  dials  had  most  of  the  letters  of  the  alphabet  associated  with  digit  values,  and  through  that  scheme  J,  M,  R  and  W  were  associated  with  the  digits 5, 6, 7, and 9. In other areas, when the dials did not have the full repertoire of letters, they nevertheless had J, M, R and W on the corresponding digits. Here is an image from such a dial: "
Why was the Scout movement so successful?,"Baden-Powell had been besieged in the town of Mafeking during the Second Boer War. He had formed the Mafeking Cadet Corps, which was a group of youths that supported the defending troops by carrying messages and similar tasks. This freed up men for military duties and kept the boys occupied during the prolonged siege. Back in the UK, the newspapers, had followed the progress of the Siege of Mafeking. When the siege was broken, Baden-Powell became a national hero. On the back of this, people bought the small manual, Aids to Scouting, he had written some years earlier about military scouting and wilderness survival. This fuelled public interest in the subject of scouting. When he returned to the UK, Baden-Powell became involved with the Boy's Brigade, becoming a Vice President of the organisation in 1903. This was already a large youth organisation (in 1910, there were some 100,000 boys enrolled in about 2200 companies across the British Empire and the United States). When Baden Powell re-wrote his manual and published it as Scouting for Boys he fundamentally changed its ethos. He left out many of the military aspects and applied the techniques to other, non-military, heroes of the day like explorers and backwoodsmen. He also added the Scout Method which was an innovative, informal educational system intended to develop good character. Scouting for Boys was originally published as a six-part series in 1908, and contained activities and programmes intended for use by existing youth organisations. It was an immediate success, but it seems that Baden-Powell had no intention of setting up a separate and distinct movement at that point. ""Scout patrols"" which followed the principles set out in Baden-Powell's book were set up across the United Kingdom, and spread rapidly across the British Empire. The first Scout rally was held at Crystal Palace in London the following year. Some 11,000 Scouts attended - including some girls who dressed as Scouts and called themselves ""Girl Scouts"". When Baden-Powell left the army in 1910, he founded the Boy Scouts Association and, shortly afterwards, the Girl Guides. In reality though, both organisations already existed in nascent form. People were attracted by the chance to emulate their heroes, and also by the fact that Scouting emphasised more adventurous, outdoor games than were usual in other youth organisations of the time (like the Boy's Brigade, for example). Then, as now, the skills learned by Scouts were seen as fun. Initially, many groups made dual registrations with the Boy's Brigade and the Boy Scouts Association. This capitalised on the existing infrastructure and fuelled the rapid growth of the Scout movement.  The fact that the Scout movement also catered for girls widened its appeal, since many of the youth movements up to that point had been for boys only. As noted above, the Girl Guides were formed by Baden-Powell and his sister, Agnes,  just months after the Boy Scouts Association. (Agnes Baden-Powell would lead the Girl Guides until 1918 when Olave Baden-Powell took over as Chief Guide.) The programme offered by the Girl Guides was radically different from those being proposed by other organisations for girls at that time. For example, the precursors of the Girls' Brigade had the goal of:  helping girls become followers of the Lord Jesus Christ through self-control, reverence, and a sense of responsibility. It is not hard to see that many girls, having read Scouting for Boys, would prefer to follow their brothers into scouting, and this is exactly what happened at the first Scout Rally in 1909. It is, perhaps, sometimes hard to remember just how progressive Baden-Powell was being when he made the decision to include girls in the Scout movement in 1910. For context, it is worth remembering that the girls' equivalent of the Boy's Brigade, the Girls’ Association, wasn't formed until 2008!"
Has there ever been a case when a traitorous military commander took command again for the side he betrayed?,"Perhaps Napoleon's marshal Michel Ney? He was first one of the marshals that forced Napoleon's abdication, and was promoted when Louis XVIII was put on the throne. During the Hundred days, he promised to bring Napoleon back in a cage, raised a force, but defected to Napoleon at first chance and commanded the army that fought Wellington at Quatre Bras and the left flank at Waterloo. After the defeat of Napoleon, Ney was executed. Granted, this was more of treachery on the personal level, but I think it fits the intent of the question."
Did it take 3 minutes to reload a musket when the second amendment to the US constitution was ratified?,"No. The rate of fire of competent musketeers was considerably greater than one round every three minutes when the Second Amendment was adopted at the end of the eighteenth century. In his book The Dawn of Modern Warfare, Hans Delbruck included a section titled 'Rapidity of fire in the eighteenth century'.  He states that: ""... a competent musketeer could load without command four or five times in a minute, and the platoon could fire five salvos on command in two minutes, and this was increased to almost three per minute."" By 1779 in Europe, a regulation required recruits to practice loading and firing with powder: “... daily and be continued until the new men could fire four times in a minute."" Although Delbruck went on to observe that Berenhorst wrote:  “at least 15 seconds were needed to load and fire with ball cartridges”  so it would have been impossible to get off a full four shots in a minute.  Nevertheless, a firing rate in excess of three shots per minute was certainly perfectly possible with contemporary muskets in the late eighteenth century."
Why didn't Great Britain give the colonies voting rights?,"I think there were two basic issues here: First off, it had never been done before in England. This was effectively the first colony outside of the British Isles peopled almost entirely with Englishmen that had ""grown up"" to an extent it could possibly consider running its own affairs. There was no real precedent for this situation.  When this situation came up later, in places like Canada and Australia, the British government knew what could happen, and had incentive to work something out. Second, it was an issue of power and face. Parliament felt like they had the right to legislate for the entire Empire, and any kind of accommodation would necessarily entail politicians there willingly giving up some of that power.  Once they got rebuked by the colonists in the use of their taxing power, it was felt by the ruling party (the more authoritarian Tories), that they had to establish this power for themselves out of principle. As they kept trying this, the American colonists felt more and more like they had to resist the unrepresented taxation, again as a matter of principle. This instituted a spiraling cycle where both sides continually got more radical. Without compromise there was only one possible result, and every cycle brought the two sides further apart.* What the colonies were initially agitating for was something like the modern Commonwealth system, where the monarch would still be head of state, but the legislation duties would be carried out by a local elected body, not Parliament in London. * - The details of this political death-spiral are described at length in Barbara Tuchman's The March of Folly."
What was the historical context of the 2nd amendment to the US Constitution?,"This issue had a long history in England, so the context and reasoning behind the 2nd amendment, which have generated such wildly different interpretations today, were 100% clear to contemporaries. The colonists considered themselves to be Englishmen and Englishwomen, and they instituted laws and customs that were closely based on those of England. England was unlike the Continent in that it had a tradition of militias. This went back to the days of long bows, when each village was required to have a target and people had to practice. Service in the militia was compulsory for males age 16-60. They kept their arms at home and were expected to use them to defend their own homes. There was also an obligation to raise a hue and cry when violence happened, to maintain watch and ward at town gates, and to pursue criminals, even into other counties. Militia service was compulsory. The alternative to a compulsory and universal militia would have been a volunteer force. A volunteer force, called a ""select militia,"" was considered politically bad, because then you'd have an armed minority that could exercise power or be used as a tool. A standing army was even worse. England had a history of militias successfully resisting government oppression. At one point the king tried to get a royal monopoly on gunpowder, but he was successfully resisted. English political theorists saw the right to bear arms as a necessary way of preserving one's own freedom, as opposed to ""parchment rights."" For example, Blackstone (1723-1780) writes: [The constitution] has therefore established certain other auxiliary subordinate rights of the subject, which serve principally as outworks or barriers to protect and maintain inviolate the three great and primary rights, of personal security, personal liberty, and private property: [auxiliary rights 1-4 are listed, and then] 5. The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall at present mention, is that of having arms for their defense, suitable to their condition and degree, and such as are allowed by law.  The English right and responsibility to bear arms had never been unlimited. In the 17th century, Catholics were forbidden to bear arms. In reality, nobody cared unless a rumor went around that they were stockpiling arms. Similarly, the American colonies made arms mandatory for all but slaves and Indians, who were forbidden to have them, although slaves often used firearms, which were a common tool like a shovel on the frontier. Rich people in England wanted hunting reserved for them. For this reason, they got rules made specifying a minimum income that you needed in order to be allowed to have arms. There were restrictions on handguns and crossbows, which were compact enough to be concealed, and were often used by highwaymen. Guns a full yard long were OK. The US 2nd amendment simply broadened the traditional rights of Englishmen and got rid of most of the exceptions. In historical context, the point of the clause about the militia is very clear. They wanted a militia instead of oppressive things such as select militias, mercenaries, or a standing army. (This answer is based on notes I took on a book I read, but unfortunately I have lost the title of the book, so I don't have any specific references to cite here. However, I don't think any of this is particularly controversial, although its application to modern gun-rights politics may be.)"
Were Hitler's anti-Jewish sentiments known at all to those who voted him to power in 1933?,"I think your question is best answered by addressing an underlying presumption. Namely: your 21st century eyes and your living in a society that considers hate speech to be antisocial are misleading you into assuming that societal norms were similar a century ago. They were not. On the contrary, hating jews (and gypsies) in the early 20th century was closer to being a matter of course than it was to being a socially unacceptable aberration. Europe had a very long history of being antisemitic. The breed of antisemitism that was prevalent then stemmed chiefly from 19th century thinkers who borrowed novel scientific ideas to explain how natural selection shaped the world they lived in - i.e. one in which Europe had subjugated the world. The notion that the Aryan race was superior, as an aside, was by no means a Nazi invention. Given how popular each of science, occultism, and Atlantis were at the time - the theory dips in all three - there are good grounds to assume that the idea was, if not widely held, at least widely spread long before the Nazis came to power. (For comparison: do you know anyone who holds that the US government was behind 9/11 or the assassination of JFK?)  Speaking of conspiracy theories, it certainly didn't help that crackpottery like the Protocols of the Elders of Zion were widely circulated, and likely taken at face value by many. (Nor did it help, for that matter, that Nietzsche's concept of Ubermensch or his critique of religion weren't understood by his sister or the Nazis.) At any rate, the answer to your question is yes, Hitler's voters were well aware of his antisemitism. He had written a book full of the stuff, for starters. Anyone opposing Hitler would have been quick to raise awareness of the issue if they had a problem with it. But much more salient, I think, is the fact that antisemitism was widespread enough at the time  (be it latent, through repeating Jew jokes and Jew-related crackpottery, or blatant, like the Nazis) that Hitler had little to no reason to make his racism and antisemitism a secret when speaking in public. On the contrary, don't miss that - much like now - being open about one's unsettling or downright outrageous views in politics can be icing on the cake for the right audience. Like o.m. suggested in a comment, Hitler's antisemitism was an extra selling point for parts of his voters."
When did worshipping of ancient Greek gods come to an end?,"Presumably no earlier than the ninth century, as there is this: 804 Hellenes of Laconia, Greece, resist the attempt of Tarasius,
  Patriarch of Constantinople, to convert them to Christianity. Further searching yields this, though it seems to be rather thinly sourced: The Maniots began to convert to Christianity in the 9th century AD,
  but it wasn't until 200 years later in the 11th century AD that the
  Maniots had fully accepted Christianity. (""Maniots"" is apparently another demonym for the Laconians, or at least some of them.)"
What are the factors that caused the new world civilizations to be less technologically advanced than the old world?,"According to Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel, one of the first steps from a hunter-gatherer society towards civilization is agriculture. While agricultural societies appeared all over the world, the old world had a more suitable environment, especially with regards to the grains and large animals that lived there. The old world had wheat, which is easy to plant, harvest and eat, while the new world had maize (corn), which is not. With regard to large domesticate-able animals, the old world had horses, sheep and cattle, while the new world just had llamas. The old world could also trade east-west, which meant plants and animals could easily find similar climates (because of similar latitudes) over very long distances, while the new world's trade routes were primarily north-south. Agricultural production encourages a sedentary society, which in turn leads to population growth, specialization of craft and labor, and a ruling class.  Put it all together and you get more and better technology."
Why were there no internment camps for German-American citizens in USA during WW2?,"According to Arthur D. Jacobs, author of the autobiographic book ""The Prison Called Hohenasperg: An American boy betrayed by his Government during World War II"", by the end of the war, 11000 persons of German ancestry were interned, both immigrants and visitors. Also, under the pressure of US Government, Latin American countries arrested more than 4000 German Latin Americans, from which most were shipped to US for internment. At least 2000 from both groups were exchanged for Americans that were held in Germany. If you ask why didn't they intern all Americans with German ancestry, such an attempt would be simply impossible, as there were too many of them. That's why Germans were interned as individuals, not as a whole, like Japanese. In 1940 there were more than million of persons born in Germany, next 5 million whose both parents were born in Germany and 6 millions with at least one parent born in Germany. I've got no source for the overall amount of American citizens with German ethnicity during WWII, but that would have to have been even bigger. It's well described with citations in the Sheridan Report, written in 1980 by the US Government analyst, in order to clarify the reasons for huge disparity in numbers between German, Italian and Japanese citizens of USA, who were interned during the war. Here are the key points from it: In December 1941 and January 1942 three Presidential Proclamations were signed, ""to regulate the conduct and movement of enemy aliens"": In February of 1942, the mentioned Executive Order 9066 was signed. A month later certain groups of enemy aliens were excluded from that order. The list of them contained such conditions as: old age, poor health or close family members of US Army soldiers. It was clearly stated that all those exclusions could apply only to aliens of German or Italian origins, not to Japanese, except for the poor health condition (deaf, blind or hospital residents). Around the same time Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of War, stated that Italians are ""potentially less dangerous, as a whole, than those of other enemy nationalities"" and that ""the size of Italian population and the number of troops and facilities which would have to be employed to deal with them, their inclusion in the general plan would greatly overtax our strength"". Similar conclusions were brought up by House Select Committee investigating the evacuation of enemy aliens. The linked material is the full text of Committee hearings with many paragraphs speaking of the German's and the Italian's situation. From the reasons mentioned above, it stated that ""Indeed, this committee is prepared to say that any such proposal is out of the question if we intend to win this war"". From this reasons it was decided by General Hugh A. Drum, commanding general of the Eastern Defense Command, that ""mass evacuation is not contemplated. Instead thereof, such evacuations as may be considered necessary will be by selective processes applicable to enemy aliens, or to other persons deemed dangerous to remain at large within the area or within its zones"". General John L. DeWitt, commanding general of the Western Defense Command, disagreed with that, finding the mass evacuation a ""military necessity"". He demanded ""definite instructions to the contrary that would exempt him from all responsibility for the consequences"". On May 15, 1942, he was informed that there was to be no ""collective evacuation of German and Italian aliens from the West coast or from anywhere else in the United States"", but that the War Department woul authorize individual exclusion orders ""against both aliens and citizens under the authority of Executive Order 9066"". As for Italians, in November 1942 it was announced that they were no longer considered ""aliens of enemy nationality"". Jacobs provides the following map of interment camps for German-Americans.

"How did 300,000 people survive the 3 1/2 year siege of Sarajevo?","A combination of the UN, NATO, the Red Cross, Sarajevo International Airport, the Sarajevo Tunnel, smugglers, and the Bosnian Army saved Sarajevo. While the siege officially ended in Feb 1996, it was loosened by steps, and supplies were always flowing in. Early on, the UN Security Council made a number of resolutions to protect the civilians of Yugoslavia and demand humanitarian aid be allowed through, particularly to Sarajevo Airport. Resolution 752 in May 1992 called for negotiations and cooperation with the UN Protection Force, UNPROFOR. Resolution 757 designated Sarajevo Airport as a UN security zone. Resolution 758 authorized military action to ensure the aid got through with 770 reiterating. Resolution 776 in Sept 1992 increased the scope of UNPROFOR's mission to include organizing and protecting aid convoys and gave permission for them to defend themselves. In June 1992, the Bosnian Serbs complied and handed over Sarajevo Airport to the UN. 13,000 flights delivered 160,000 tons of humanitarian aid. In addition to official international aid, smugglers were active bringing supplies in through Serbian lines. Bosnian defenders raided Serbian positions for supplies. Finally, in the spring of 1993, the Bosnian Army dug a tunnel linking the neighborhoods of Dobrinja and Butmir, one inside the siege and one outside, allowing humanitarian and war supplies to flow in. This bypassed both the besieging forces and the UN arms embargo that affected all parties, including the poorly armed Bosnian Army. Wagons could carry up to 400 kg of supplies at a time. On an average day, thousands of civilians and soldiers and dozens of tons of supplies passed through the tunnel for a total of 2 to 3 million trips. While the siege was not fully lifted until 1996, a string of on again / off again UN-negotiated cease fires around Sarajevo and the threat of NATO airstrikes on February 9th, 1994, helped loosen it considerably. Under Resolution 836 the Security Council demanded the Bosnian Serbs remove all heavy weapons from a 20 km exclusion zone around the city or be destroyed. February 12th, 1994, was the first day with no casualties since the siege began. On February 17th, the Serbs began to comply. 1994 and 1995 saw an escalating series of Serbian violations of UN safe areas and humanitarian convoys, with increasing NATO retaliatory air strikes. In September 1995, NATO began Operation Deliberate Force, systematically bombing Serbian heavy weapons and positions which threatened UN safe areas. Afterwards, the Bosnian Serbs were more compliant with UN humanitarian aid. In the fall of 1995, the Bosnians and Croats went on the offensive and further loosened the siege allowing power, water, and heat to be restored. In Oct 1995, an uneasy ceasefire went into effect under the Dayton Accords. In Dec 1995, 60,000 IFOR (Implementation Force) troops replaced UNPROFOR to implement the accords, enforce the peace, and help establish a Bosnian government. The siege was officially declared over on February 29th, 1996, when the Bosnian Serbs withdrew from their positions around the city."
When did humans develop the ability to sail any direction regardless of wind direction?,"From lateen sail history we note that the first known type of fore-and-aft rig capable of working upwind is the spritsail: The earliest fore-and-aft rig was the spritsail, appearing in the 2nd century BC in the Aegean Sea on small Greek craft.  The lateen sail originated somewhat later during the Roman empire in the Mediterranean Sea.  As the efficiency of a fore-and-aft rig to sail upwind is significantly affected by the the hull's ability to limit leeway with its keel (or centre-board on modern dinghy's) it is not known just how close to the wind these early boats could make. However on flat water and a wide watercourse these boats undoubtedly could - eventually - work their way upwind. More likely they were limited to a close reach, and preferred to await more favourable winds except under dire need. Recall Ulysses' adventures in the Odyssey. While it is possible with a square rig to sail closer to the wind than a beam reach (wind coming across the beam of the ship), only in ideal conditions including flat water would it ever have been possible to overcome the leeway and achieve net progress upwind that was worth the effort. The inability of the Spanish Armada's square-rigged galleons to make upwind progress in an unfavourable wind doomed them to attempt a stormy rounding of the British Isles that only a few survived. The importance of proper hull design in enabling a boat to sail upwind is explained in physics of sailing upwind  The keel must generate hydrodynamic lift of sufficient magnitude and suitable direction so as to overcome the aerodynamic drag force on the sail, enabling the boat to act under a net force that is close to the wind and roughly parallel to the hull. Without an effective keel and hull design it is impossible to sail upwind at all, regardless of sailing rig adopted. This was probably only discovered slowly, so even as fore-and-aft rigs enabled better performance on beam and broad close reaches, it was likely a gradual process to understand how to effectively sail upwind. It is possible that this really awaits development of the dhow and caravel. More on square rigs here and here. Even at their peak development in the 18th and 19th century a square rig sail could only be sailed to within 60-65 degrees of the wind. Combined with typical leeway of 5 or so degrees, the vessel is barely making headway to windward at all, for a very extensive sailing effort and a great deal of time spent sailing. In practice a vessel would have to be in dire straits, such as off a lee shore in a storm, to be bothered making the attempt - better to rest on shore and await a fair breeze. Note also that the square-rigged ships of the 18th and 19th centuries had several fore-and-aft sails (all the jibs and staysails below numbered 1-4 and 27) that were used to sail to windward, with the square rigs furled. Vessels expecting to sail upwind frequently would also have a fore-and-aft sail rigged as the main sail (numbered 5, 12 and 20 below) on one or more masts, with square sails rigged above it.  Claims of an earlier development in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean are possible, but unsubstantiated. James Taylor notes in Traditional Arab sailing ships: At this point in time the trail of the Arab ship runs cold and remains so for about 3000 years. ... there is no mention of the ships involved until the middle of the 6th century CE, when [Tarafa bin al-’Abd likens] camel-borne litters ... to the zigzag passage of khaliya safin in the sea. While this description clearly implies beating upwind, it is in the 6th century C.E. and long after upwind sailing was known in the Mediterranean."
"Are there historical examples of audiences drawn to a work that was ""so bad it's good""?","I’ll throw in a vote for Robert “Romeo” Coates, a theatre actor in Britain in the early 1800s. According to Wikipedia (emphasis mine): Despite this ridicule, Coates went on to tour the British Isles. If a theatre manager would hesitate to let him show his talents, he would bribe them. Managers, in turn, often called in the police in case things went seriously wrong. [...] His fame spread and people would flock to see whether he really was as bad as they had heard. For some reason, Baron Ferdinand de Geramb became his foremost supporter. Even the Prince Regent (the future King George IV) would go to see him. In 1811, when he played the part of Lothario in The Fair Penitent in London's Haymarket Theatre, the theatre had to turn thousands of would-be spectators away. In another performance in Richmond, Surrey, several audience members had to be treated for excessive laughter."
Did Albert Einstein really receive this rejection letter from the University of Bern?,"As pointed out by tohuwawohu in a comment to the question (later moved to chat), the University of Bern has publicly rebutted this as a forgery, and not even a very good one (also Internet Archive copy): There is currently a forged letter going round on the internet. In the alleged historical writing of 1907, the University of Bern rejects Albert Einstein’s habilitation. The university archivist Niklaus Bütikofer explains which errors the forger had made and tells the true story by means of the original documents. Some of the errors that are pointed out are laid out in a nice bullet point list: The article also discusses signs that the letter was not written on a typewriter at all, but rather that a typewriter font was used on an image of an already folded paper. The use of Einstein 25c USA postage stamps is another sign that the letter would not be genuine, even if affixing those to the letter itself had made sense. In summary, the alleged letter is referred to as a joke of a bored physics student by University of Bern archivist Niklaus Bütikofer."

"Has a state ever ""attacked"" another one by printing fake money?","Frederick II the Great, king IN Prussia 1740–1786 used to counterfeit currency of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (PLC) on a large scale, for profit and to economically weaken Polish state. Officially PLC wasn't at war with Prussia but the only reason that this and other hostile activities of Frederick the Great were unanswered by PLC was the weakness of Polish administration at that time.

Why were Spain and Portugal neutral / not invaded in WWII?,"I can tell you why Spain was neutral. (Sorry, I don't know much about Portugal) Germany and Italy helped Franco during the Spanish Civil War. When the Second World War started, Germany of 1939 was not very interested in Spain. As you know in May 1940 Italy joined the Axis while France was being conquered. After defeat the Germans prepared themselves to conquer the UK and Africa. In that moment Gibraltar started to be very important for everyone. Meanwhile in Spain Franco wanted to return the favour to Hitler. Summary of his thoughts:  So Franco ordered a report to each branchesf the military: Army, Air Force and Navy. The Army and Air Force reports advised to support Germany.
In 1940 Germany looked invincible and they were impressed by German tanks and Air Force (Legion Condor). Keeping in mind that most of the Navy (mainly sailors and NCO) remained loyal to the Republic Government, there were few experienced officers (Most officers were killed by loyal sailors and after the war purged, either executed, imprisoned or expelled from the Navy by Franco). So the report was made by a young officer (OF-4 equivalent) called Carrero Blanco. This started a friendship between Franco and him that eventually addressed him as president of Spain in 1973. Carrero Blanco had a different view from his colleagues from the Army and Air Force. 
The report from Carrero Blanco was signed by Salvador Moreno, head on Spanish Navy, on 11 November 1940 and explained in 21 bullet points the consequences for Spain and the needs in case of entering in the war. He recommended not to enter in the war as it would cause more problems than benefits to Spain and the Axis. Mainly the Report stated that Spain should remain neutral unless Suez was conquered by Axis. In that case it advised to attack Gibraltar and use Spanish Navy to blockade Gibraltar, assuming that Spain would lose Canary Islands.        Franco was impressed by the report and decided not to enter in the war. He had a strategy were he supported Hitler but at the same time he didn’t support him. Spain declared to be allied with Germany but non-belligerent. Hitler wanted to invade Gibraltar and had an interview in person with Franco in Hendaya (Frontier between Spain and France) to force him to enter in the war in October of 1940. Franco managed to convince Hitler to delay such a decision. He sent some volunteers in “Blue Division” that acted as a normal 250th Wehrmacht infantry division, instead of fighting as a Spanish Division. He was supporting Hitler, pleasing Falangists in Spain and the Allies at the same time. There was a plan (Operation Felix) to attack Gibraltar through Spain by having some German divisions enter from France and attack Gibraltar in January 1941. But the plan was cancelled because Franco refused to agree. Franco claimed that Spain was not ready to support the attack or repel the probable British counter attack in his overseas possessions or even mainland. He requested unacceptable conditions from Germany (wheat, oil, troops to defend Spain and Operation Felix to happen after German invasion of England.). Hitler cancelled the attack plan in December 1940. As time passed by it started to become clear that Germany was going to be defeated. Spain changed status from non-belligerent to neutral. Sorry, I didn’t find an English version of the report.  UPDATE: Admiral Canaris, head of Abwehr (German military intelligence agency) advised Franco not to go to war. Canaris was an expert on Spain, he was fluent in Spanish and worked on intelligence in Spain between 1935-1936 creating a net of German spies. He was ordered by Hitler to assess the possibility of invading Gibraltar and convince Franco. Canaris had his own agenda and instead of following orders, he influenced Franco, by meetings with his top advisors (including Serrano Suñer that was Franco’s brother in law and soon was made foreign  minister), not to go to war.

"Why was it ""acceptable"" for Prince Charles to marry a divorced woman, when Edward VIII had to abdicate for marrying divorcee Wallis Simpson?","It is mostly due to the differing social attitudes of the day, but the legal position was also different in 1936. The Wikipedia page is pretty clear about the social attitudes, but I'll try to explain the legal issues here. In 1936 the Church of England opposed remarriage after divorce. Furthermore, at that time, the Church of England considered adultery to be the only grounds for divorce. In English law, grounds for divorce were governed by the Matrimonial Causes Act (1857). In brief, men could sue for divorce on the grounds of adultery by their spouses, while women had to prove additional offences (such as incest, sodomy, cruelty etc.) had been committed. Wallis Simpson's first divorce (granted in the United States) had been on the grounds of ""emotional incompatibility"", and so was not recognised by the Church of England. In the eyes of the church, therefore, her second marriage was bigamous. There was also the very real possibility that had her divorce been challenged in an English court, it might not have been recognised under English law. In 1937, a year after the Abdication Crisis, Parliament passed the Matrimonial Causes Act (1937), which expanded the grounds for divorce, but which would still probably not allowed Wallis Simpson's first divorce to be recognised had it been challenged in an English Court. The law required that the monarch must be in communion with the Church of England (the monarch was head or ""Supreme Governor"" of the Church of England). A bigamous marriage would create a split with the Church as precipitate a constitutional crisis. Since 2002, the Church of England has allowed divorcees to marry. Furthermore, both Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles had divorced under English Law (which had become much more liberal since the Matrimonial Causes Act (1973)), so there could be no legal challenge to their union. Charles and Camilla were therefore able to marry without any problem in 2005."
Has NATO ever started a war?,"There are four main NATO ""operations"" that can be interpreted as starting a war: You could argue that none of these events were NATO starting a war, however. The Bosnian War and Kosovo War were already in progress when NATO intervened. In Libya, there was a civil war before NATO intervened. Finally, in Afghanistan, you could argue that the war started when al-Qaeda launched the September 11 attacks.* Or you could interpret these as NATO starting a war. For example, the Kosovo War started as a low-level insurgency that escalated into a full-blown war in part because NATO threatened military action. In Libya, NATO attacked government forces although the mandate was only for a no-fly zone. In Afghanistan, al-Qaeda was not part of the government; the government was the Taliban, and the invasion was because the Taliban refused to extradite Osama bin Laden. So it's up to your definition. If the answer to your question is ""yes"", one or more of these four operations will be the example you seek; if none of them satisfy you, then the answer is ""no"". *This is the only time article 5 of NATO was ever enacted to date."
Why did Britain not purchase Alaska when Russia had it up for sale?,Because Russia had been at war with Britain for most of the preceding two decades. One of Russia's problems in owning Alaska was defending it against it being used as a British route to invade Russia (militarily insane - but that's politics) - remember Canada was British at the time. By selling it to America they installed one of Britain's adversaries in the way
Why did Hitler declare war on the USA?,"There was an 88-minute long speech made by Hitler to the Reichstag on December 11th, 1941, which was four days after the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor, where he officially declared that Germany would join Japan in the war against the USA. In this speech, he mentioned a few of his personal reasons for this decision.  That decision to declare war had been delivered to the Americans two hours before the speech by his foreign minister.  About two hours before Hitler began his address to the Reichstag, Germany formally declared war against the United States when Reich Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop delivered a diplomatic note to the American Charge d'Affaires in Berlin, Leland B. Morris.    I think this would be an interesting read regarding this question, and there's a translation by a Mr. Mark Weber on the Website of the Institute of Historical Review WARNING Institute of Historical Review is considered by many to be a revisionist, Holocaust-denying institution with links to neo-Nazi organizations. Their translation of Hitler's speech might have been manipulated for propaganda purposes. "
When were swords last used in European warfare?,"Cavalry sabres (a.k.a. Shashkas) were still widely used in the Russian Civil War (1918-1922) and appear in many books on that period. This weapon is primarily associated with Cossacks even though it was standard equipment in the Russian and later Soviet army. The Russian Wikipedia article claims that Shashkas were still used by the cavalry in the Second World War which was (according to this article) the last massive military use of a sword-like weapon. Other sources seem to confirm that all Soviet cavalry units were equipped with Shashkas during Second World War - but it is hard to imagine what they would use them for. After the war they became purely ritual weapons. Edit: This article shows lots of WWII Soviet posters displaying cavalry charges with shashkas. The article (and a bunch of others) explain that this pretty much never happened in reality: horses were used primarily for transportation and shashkas were put away before an attack. So Wikipedia most likely exaggerates when it talks about ""massive military use""."
Is the claim that Hitler came to power democratically justified?,"Hitler was tapped by Hindenburg, and others, because it was felt that he was just a front-man for the Nazis, not the real power figure. As such, they believed that he could be ""leashed"".  On November 21st, Hitler saw Hindenburg again and tried a different
  approach. He read a prepared statement claiming that parliamentary
  government had failed and that only the Nazis could be counted on to
  stop the spread of Communism. He asked Hindenburg to make him the
  leader of a presidential cabinet. Hindenburg said no, and only
  repeated his own previous requests.  The Government of Germany had ground to a halt.  Meanwhile, a group of the country's most influential industrialists,
  bankers, and business leaders sent a petition to Hindenburg asking him
  to appoint Hitler as chancellor. They believed Hitler would be good
  for business. Events of course demonstrated how incorrect this belief was. It is important to realize that even Papen's center party had given up on democratic processes in the summer of 1932 and invoked Martial Law: Papen invoked Article 48 and proclaimed martial law
  in Berlin and also took over the government of the German state of
  Prussia by naming himself Reich Commissioner. Germany had taken a big
  step closer to authoritarian rule. The Nazis had played a central role (along with the Communists) in the collapse of civil order, and Hitler repeatedly used (the threat of) violence by the SA to extort concessions from Papen and Hindenburg.  Hitler became hysterical. In a display of wild rage that stunned
  Schleicher and Papen, he spewed out threats of violence and murder,
  saying he would let loose the SA for three days of mayhem all across
  Germany. No result flowing from that combination can be regarded as democratic, regardless of any claimed election results. Quotes from The Rise of Adolph Hitler"
"If the Union Jack joins the flag of England and Scotland, why does it have a different shade of blue than the Scottish flag?","In 1606, people didn't have pantone guidelines to keep colours consistent - nor did it matter. Heraldry only has a limited number of colors. Variations on blue exist but are not standard, so any blue could be used. It just so happened that the English were already using a blue, in the Blue Ensign being used by English ships. Wikipedia even suggests its darker colour was more durable: Various shades of blue have been used in the saltire over the years. The ground of the current Union Flag is a deep ""navy"" blue (Pantone 280), which can be traced to the colour used for the Blue Ensign of the Royal Navy's historic ""Blue Squadron"". (Dark shades of colour were used on maritime flags on the basis of durability.) Adapting the colours of the naval ensign made sense because the Union Jack was originally meant for naval use only. See the original decree: Whereas, some differences hath arisen between Our subjects of South and North Britaine travelling by Seas, about the bearing of their Flagges..."
How did people wash dishes before dish detergent?,"Given the broad nature of the question, what follows is more of a (roughly chronological) potted history than a comprehensive account of dishwashing before detergents became widely available. All highlighting is mine. SHORT ANSWER Among other things: sand, fats, ash, alkaline salts (which are often used in modern detergents), cuttlefish bone, horsetail, mare's tail, soapwort, hay mixed with ash, running water, hot water, wire scrubbers, cloth, baking soda and sugar sand (maple sap debris). Note that, in medieval Europe at least, cutlery was limited to a spoon and a knife, the knife being a personal item which was often just wiped clean after meals. Also, the 'plate' used may have been a trencher made of bread which was consumed after everything else had been eaten. DETAILS The Encyclopedia of Kitchen History by M. E Snodgrass mentions dishwashing a number of times, starting with The job began in prehistory with sand-scouring of pottery and utensils
  at the nearest water source.  The Babylonians are believed to have been the first to discover what we might recognize as soap but there are conflicting opinions as to whether it was used to clean kitchenware (for example, see here and here). Other ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians also had soap. There were different mixtures, perhaps to suit different purposes. The ingredients of these mixtures included two or more of: animal and vegetable fats, ash, alkaline salts and oils.  During the the Zhou Dynasty (1050 BC to 256 BC), the Chinese discovered that using the ashes of certain plants could be used to
  remove grease. This method is recorded in “The Rites of Zhou,” a
  sacred document detailing the religious ceremonies of this early
  Chinese dynasty. Although the context indicates laundry, it is not inconceivable that they used a similar kind of soap for greasy kitchenware as well. The Romans (but not, it appears, the Greeks) had soaps but they seem to have used other substances for cleaning objects: In the Roman villa, slaves cleaned tabletops and scoured stone and
  tile floors with handfuls of sand. Another useful substance,
  cuttlefish bone, served as a cleaning abrasive, as did the horsetail
  (Equisetum), commonly called pewter wort, scouring rush, or shave
  grass, a plant with jointed stems suitable for scouring wooden
  utensils, dairy vessels, and pewter. Later, back in China during the Sui dynasty (581 – 618) we see what may be the first visual representations of dishwashers at work.  Ceramic models of dishwashers. Unfortunately, there isn't enough detail to determine what washing 'aids' (if any) they might have used. Moving on into the European Middle Ages, there is a reference to the use of hot water: At hospices, taverns, and castles, cauldrons heated over an outdoor
  fire functioned as sinks for dishwashing and bathing and for scalding
  pigs. Snodgrass goes into more detail for medieval castles: workers washed crockery in a separate tub, polished
  brass skillets with rhubarb juice or sorrel, and scoured pewter with
  Hippuris vulgaris, an aquatic plant with densely whorled shoots
  commonly called mare’s tail. Delicate china and crystal were rinsed
  carefully in a vessel padded with soft cloth to prevent chips. She also cites John de Garland’s Dictionary (1220) Garland names the dishes that were most frequently scrubbed: cauldrons
  and becdasne (spouted pots with handles), pitchers, plates, frying
  pans, basins and fèrals (water jugs), mortars, trenchers, saucers,
  vinegar bottles, bowls and spoons, gridirons, graters, meat hooks, and
  chafing dishes. and adds For convenience, the cook or servant often washed dishes on a wood
  bench by the well and pulled handfuls of soapwort planted nearby to
  facilitate removal of grease. Also, Melitta Weiss Adamson, in Food in Medieval Times, says Cloth was used both for cooking and, along with scouring sand or ashes
  and tubs, for cleaning the kitchenware. Finally (for the European medieval period), as vinegar and sand were ""used to clean and polish flexible mail armor"", they were probably also used to clean metal pots, pans and utensils. From the Renaissance period, Snodgrass states: In a trough or stone sink, the dishwasher poured well water from a
  bucket or basin or opened faucets to admit a steady flow of water from
  a cistern or town fountain for cleaning and rinsing....The dreariness of the 
  job in a stifling, windowless
  area remained the norm into the late 1800s....A series of devices aided the 
  housewife or scullery servant in cleaning and sanitizing dishes.
  Dishmops, powdered abrasive cleansers and polishes, plate scrapers,
  and wire and rubber scrubbers simplified the job; a soap saver — a
  wire mesh box on a handle — saved the soap bars from sinking to the
  bottom of the dishpan and dissolving into a gluey mess. Also noted are Hay and ash boiled in an iron vessel loosened rust, which the
  dishwasher could then remove by scouring the pot with soap and sand.
  Stove surfaces, the bane of kitchen cleaning, required sandpapering
  and oiling. In the 18th century English navy, In his spare time, the cook made a seawater-soluble dishwashing soap
  by pouring oil, resin, fish glue, soda, and oxalate of potash through
  soapwort in a perforated tray into a tub. Somewhat surprisingly, and contrary to (for example) The American Women's Home (1869), another book (from 1879) says no soap because “while soap is a very good thing to take away
  dirt from our hands and clothes, it is a very nasty thing to eat” –
  use baking soda instead and sugar sand for scrubbing"
How did pilots know when to release bombs on airplanes during World War2?,"Electronic computing was not available, but a simple and constrained problem like timing a bomb drop can be handled by a dedicated mechanical or electromechanical device, the bombsight. These are ""analogue computers,"" as compared to modern digital computers. They aren't re-programmable, and can only solve the problem that is built into them, but they can be built with much less advanced technology.  For high-altitude bombing, the bombsight was used by a specially trained crewman, the bombardier (US usage) or bomb-aimer (British usage). As the aircraft approached the target, he would set up the bombsight with information such as the altitude, wind speed, type of bombs and so on. He would look through the device's telescope for an aiming mark on the ground and set that. Then he'd either give the pilot directions to turn left or right, or for the more sophisticated devices, the bombsight would tell the bomber's autopilot what to do. The bombsight indicated when the bombs should be released, and he'd push the button to let them go.  In the US daylight raids, formation bombing was often used. A group (3-4 squadrons) would fly in tight formation. The bomb-aimer on the lead aircraft would aim and drop, and all the other aircraft would release when he did. This seems to have been intended to get the most out of the most talented bombardiers. The British night bombers all aimed individually, since formation flying was impractical at night.  Models of bombsight included the US Norden and Sperry bombsights, which were aided by Sperry autopilots. The British used the Mark XIV for night bombing, and the SABS for special daylight tasks. Low-level bombing generally used simpler sights. One British example was the Low Level Bombsight Mark III, intended for operations over the sea. The simplest kinds of bombing, such as dive- or skip-bombing were aimed by the pilot, using a simple sight. I've avoided the term ""precision bombing"" this far, because it was the subject of a lot of controversy at the time, and ever since, and gets into political and doctrinal matters, outside the scope of this question.  As well as visual bombsights, there were a variety of radar- and radio-based systems for helping with bombing.  The simplest was a ground-mapping radar, such as the H2S system. These didn't appear until early 1943, by which time the American and British fleets of heavy bombers were growing fast.  The Gee system was a radio navigation system that was accurate to a few hundred yards at 350 miles (limited by the curvature of the Earth hiding its ground stations in the UK). This was good enough for area bombing without a bombsight (and hence through clouds), and when you wanted better precision than that, it at least made sure you were in the right area.  The Oboe system required both-ways communication between ground stations in the UK and a single aircraft (again, limited by the curvature of the Earth), but it was accurate to around 50 yards, approaching the accuracy of modern civilian GPS. It was used by ""Pathfinders,"" squadrons whose job it was to mark targets with flares. The main body of bombers would aim at the flares.  The Gee-H system was a kind of ""reverse Oboe"" in that the large control system on the ground in the UK had been miniaturised and was fitted in bombers. About 80 aircraft could use it simultaneously. Its accuracy was about 150 yards. The Germans tried hard to jam and mislead all of these electronic systems. The reason that all of them are British is that the British operated at night, and needed them to find targets.  The Americans used ground-mapping radar to bomb through clouds, but the other devices were less necessary in daylight, and they don't seem to have used them much. Their radars were H2X which was developed from H2S, AN/APQ-13 and AN/APQ-7. The numbers weren't assigned in the order they entered service. Add-ons to connect them to the Norden bombsight were available just after the end of the war in the Pacific. "
Is this artwork (used in a video game) real?,"Google image search brings this up pretty easily.  (Image recognition technology is amazing these days.)  It is The Abduction of Orithyia by Boreas, a late 17th century tapestry.  I gather it's currently in storage at a San Francisco museum rather than at a New England mansion."
Why do the pyramids show less erosion than the Sphinx?,"The Giza pyramids originally had a white outer shell of polished limestone. In other words, what you are seeing is not the eroded remnants of the original surface, but rather the underlying structure behind the casing stones. To get a sense of the past splendour of these monuments, look at the remaining stones in the upper portions of the Pyramid of Khafre.  While almost all of them are gone today, most of these casing stones were apparently still intact until just centuries ago. Wikipedia mentions that the Great Pyramid lost much of its casings in a 14th century earthquake, and was mined for the rest in the 19th century. Likewise, the Pyramid of Khafre retained a complete outer shell at least until 1637, when John Greaves remarked that: the sides are sooth, and equal, the whole fabric (except where it is exposed to the south) seeming very entire, free of any deformed ruptures, or breaches. So it's no wonder that the now-exposed stone blocks underneath show less signs of erosion than the Great Sphinx. The latter had been subjected to the elements for much longer."
How did the authorities not find the speakeasy clubs during the prohibition?,"Prohibition was enacted largely at the behest of pressure groups. This was a very new political tactic in the US where a group uses an emotional issue to create themselves a sizable cadre of single-issue voters, who they can deploy surgically to unseat any politician who isn't in a completely safe district who opposes them. Arguably this tactic had been tested out with reconstruction racial politics, but it was honed to a science by Wayne Wheeler and his Anti-Saloon League (ASL). A politician's voters might mostly be against prohibition, but if they aren't willing to vote a politician out over it, and the ASL cruises in with 10% of the electorate who are willing to vote him out if he doesn't support it, the choices for most were either kowtow to the ASL, or be replaced by another politician who would do so. What I'm leading up to here is that Prohibition was imposed on the USA, and particularly the cities, via these new pressure groups. This was in the days before scientific polling, so we don't know for sure, but its quite likely it never had a majority of support in the country. We do know the ""wet"" politicians who resisted the ASL were largely clustered in the cities. So the reason why enforcement was so lax was that by and large city authorities didn't support prohibition. Furthermore, their voters didn't support it. The ASL actually had to push through whole new Federal law enforcement agency responsibilities just so they could have an enforcement agency that actually cared about enforcing the laws they had pressured the Federal Government into passing."
How did they cook on ancient ships?,"That's a good question. As far as we know, most ancient voyages didn't venture that far from land. Ships like the Bronze Age Uluburun and Cape Gelidonya shipwrcks are thought to have been coastal traders. They simply plied their trade around the coast of the Mediterranean, probably never getting far out of sight from the shore. This would mean that they could go ashore at night to cook at a convenient anchorage  (and also avoid the potential dangers of navigating at night). Suitable galley wares were found on the Uluburun wreck. If cooking on board ship was required, an area would typically be lined with ""fire bricks"" to reduce the risk of fire on board, as found, for example, on the Roman period Cabrera III shipwreck. In fact, fire-bricks would continue to be used to protect galleys on wooden ships right up to the eighteenth-century. As they do not decay in seawater, they are one of the more common finds on the wreck sites, including, for example, from sixteenth-century Spanish galleons in the Americas."
When and how did the USA and the UK become allies?,"It was a slow process but it did begin with trade, most notably Southern cotton. This was followed by grain from the growing Mid-West. As the US became more industrialized, trade in other areas  increased.  In the interest of keeping trade going and avoiding being entangled in the war, the British were careful to avoid taking sides in the Civil War and ended up with both sides viewing them in a more favorable light. This, along with the establishment of Canada in 1867, which made it clear that Britain no longer wanted to expand their empire in North America, caused Anglophobia to turn to Anglophilia.  During the Spanish-American War, the British, after a delay and with some diplomatic assurances, supported the US. As the US grew in strength, it made sense for the two nations, who had a lot in common, to work together. Connections and friendship between the ruling classes of both nations increased during the early 20th century. This led into the events of WWI and WWII which insured a strong alliance."
"Was Hitler exclaiming ""Heil Hitler!"" himself when saluting?","Short Answer Despite the claims of some sites, I can find no evidence that Hitler himself said 'Heil Hitler', and it would make no sense for him to do so as the words were more than a greeting: they indicated obedience to the leader (Hitler) and were an oath of allegiance (to Hitler). This was made clear by a senior Nazi official, Gregor Strasser, as early as 1927.  The Boothby citation by Boris Johnson is wrong. Boothby's own account is that Hitler greeted him by saying his own name (without 'Heil') and lifting his right arm, and Boothby responded in the same manner.  When Boothby said 'Heil Boothby', it was in response to Hitler's secretary saying 'Heil Hitler'; he did not say this to Hitler himself, and Hitler did not say 'Heil Hitler' to Boothby. Albert Speer, in his memoirs, relates that Hitler would sometimes respond to Heil, mein Fuhrer from favoured members of the inner circle with Heil, Speer (or Heil, Goering / Goebbels etc.). Details The citation by Boris Johnson is wrong (Wikipedia's Lord Boothby has it without the full context, making it potentially misleading rather than plain wrong). Boothby was actually responding to the 'Heil Hitler' greeting from Hitler's secretary, not from Hitler himself. Rob Baker in High Buildings, Low Morals on Boothby says: in Germany he was once greeted by Hitler’s secretary with a ‘Heil
  Hitler’, to which Boothby’s admirable response was ‘Heil Boothby’ Leslie Mitchell's biography Maurice Bowra: A Life clarifies further. Sir Maurice Bowra was a British academic and a friend of Boothby's from their time at Oxford University. Mitchell, citing both Bowra and Boothby himself, writes: At some point, he [Bowra] and a party of journalists were given an audience by
  Hitler where they were treated to an harangue on the theme that the
  unity of Germany would not be political or economic, but spiritual.24
  It was on this occasion allegedly that Maurice replied to a salutation
  of ‘Heil Hitler’ with a spirited ‘Heil Bowra’. Unfortunately, there is
  no truth in the story, though it circulated widely and, as Maurice put
  it, ‘brought me nothing but credit’.25 What in fact happened was more
  prosaic. Bob Boothby was greeted by Hitler’s secretary with a ‘Heil
  Hitler’, to which he responded ‘Heil Boothby’. Later, as he
  remembered, ‘the story was attributed to Maurice Bowra, who asked me
  whether I would mind if he did not contradict it. I said I would be
  delighted to share the honour with him, because I knew that if he had
  been in my place, he would have done the same.’26 Footnotes (24) and (25) are citing Bowra's own Memories (London, 1966). The source cited in footnote (26) above is Lord Boothby, Recollections of a Rebel (London, 1978). Here, Boothby gives his version of what happened when he met Hitler (not the secretary) - and it's missing the word 'Heil': It is true that when I walked across the long room to a corner in
  which he was sitting writing, in a brown shirt with a swastika on his
  arm, he waited without looking up until I had reached his side, then
  sprang to his feet, lifted his his right arm, and shouted ‘Hitler!’;
  and that I responded by clicking my heels together together, raising
  my right arm, and shouting back: ‘Boothby!’ From this context, it is apparent that Hitler was simply greeting Boothby and giving his name, unnecessary though it may seem. Of related interest, it was not uncommon in Jyland / Jutland (Denmark) even in the 1970s for adult men to introduce themselves to other adult males by simply saying their family name and nodding (no 'Hello' or such like, no first name). Clearly, others (or even Boothby himself at times) have embellished the original version. For example, Israeli politician and journalist Yair Lapid's biography of his father Tommy Lapid has this: Lord Robert Boothby…once told me the following story: “In 1931 I
  visited the Fuhrer in Munich. When I entered his office he jumped from
  his seat, stood at attention, raised his right arm in the Nazu salute
  and shouted, ‘Heil Hitler’ I had no choice but to stand to attention
  as well, raise my right arm and shout, ‘Heil Boothby’” Who embellished this account is not in evidence; it could well have been Boothby himself for obvious comic effect. Hitler's (various) physical responses when greeting people are well-documented (see Nazi Salute, photos and contemporary film footage). In addition to the salutes described in Wikipedia and seen in film footage, Hitler usually shook hands when greeting important or well-known people. How he greeted them orally is less clear, but it most likely depended on the circumstances, the person or people and, quite possibly, his mood. As already stated, I can find no evidence that he used the words 'Heil Hitler' together, though this Quora post (unsourced) says otherwise (I've asked for a source so we'll see...). However, it would make no sense for Hitler to pledge loyalty to himself. The ‘Heil Hitler’ greeting, Strasser wrote in January 1927, was not
  only a symbol of personal dependence on the Leader, but contained in
  itself the pledge of loyalty. Source: Ian Kershaw, 'Hitler 1889-1936: Hubris' (1998) Boothby's account is one way Hitler greeted people he hadn't previously met, but he certainly wouldn't have said his family name in this manner to children or to people he already knew.  Albert Speer's memoires Inside the Third Reich, relate that Heil Hitler was rarely used by the 40 to 50 people granted access to Hitler's 'afternoon dinner table' at the Chancellery; Guten Tag was more common. Hitler himself was fairly informal at these gatherings, shaking hands and perhaps enquiring about their well-being or sharing snippets of news. On the phone, Speer would end a conversation with Heil, mein Fuhrer', to which Hitler sometimes replied, ""Heil, Speer."" This greeting was a sign of favor
  which he only rarely vouchsafed to Goering, Goebbels, and a few other
  intimates; underlying it was a note of faint irony at the mandatory,
  ""Heil, mein Fuhrer."" There is also no evidence in Hitler's written correspondence that he used Heil Hitler, but it was used by others sometimes (see, for example, this Martin Bormann letter). Fans of old films may have been reminded of the line Heil Myself! in the 1942 satire To be or Not to Be, directed by Ernst Lubitsch, with Jack Benny playing a Polish actor who plays Hitler. Although wholly anti-Nazi, it was considered inappropriate by many at the time despite its Jewish director and star. The film is now considered a classic. Clips with Heil Myself! can be seen here (the first 20 secs) and here (1m 39 secs, at the end of the clip). The same line was also used in the Mel Brooks-directed 1963 film The Producers."
Why were there no nuclear detonations in 1959?,"Why were there no nuclear detonations in 1959? The reason there were no tests in 1959 was that the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and the United States agreed to a moratorium on nuclear weapon tests in 1958. This moratorium lasted from November 1958 to August 1961. The Soviet Union resumed on 1 September, 1961, with the US following suit a couple of weeks later. France, being on the verge of being a nuclear-capable nation in 1958, did not take part in that moratorium. They didn't test in 1959 because they did not quite have the ability to do so. They did have that ability in 1960.

How were tanks scrapped after World War Two?,"Once nobody was willing or able to use them(either in other conflicts or as bulldozers), tanks were stripped of any particularly valuable or reusable parts, and whatever was left was disassembled/cut up to be used as scrap metal. (All of the images and detail can be found here or here.) Vehicles which were destroyed on the battlefield were recovered to either be repaired or stripped. The recovery operations were aided by specialized vehicles(such as the M32) which could move the disabled tanks to scrapyards:  At the scrapyards(also called ""strip out yards""), the valuable bits that still worked were removed from the disabled tanks to be used as replacements in more usable tanks. This was also a great time for military research, as engineers could poke around allied and enemy tanks looking for vulnerabilities and areas of improvement.  As for the rest, whatever could be removed from the hull or cut up using on-site tools was piled together. If there were no on-site tools to cut up the tank hulls, then the hulls were shipped to better equipped processing facilities elsewhere. Once disassembled, whatever couldn't be directly used for other tanks was used as regular scrap metal wherever metal was needed:  However, once the war was over there were still hundreds of thousands of working vehicles that needed a home. For those that didn't get sold/lent to other countries for other conflicts, there was plenty of room in military depots like those in the American Southwest:  In the years after WWII, the vehicles that weren't expected to ever be used again were stripped, chopped up, and scraped in pretty much the same way as those in the post-battlefield scrapyards(though with much less urgency):  A few of those that weren't scrapped were converted to monuments(as you found) or stored/refurbished in museums or private collections, but many chose a much more humble retirement and were cheaply sold to farmers to be used as tractors(ammo not included): "
Why didn't Portugal found universities in its colonies like Spain?,"SHORT ANSWER Spanish policy was rooted in the tradition of setting up universities in conquered territories, accompanied by the aim of converting the local people to Catholicism in order to bind them to Spain through religious faith. The Spanish approach was quite different to that of any other European colonial power. Portuguese policy on education in its colonies is difficult to summarize as it lacked consistency, but the most common theme was that educating local populations would lead to resistance to Portuguese rule. Thus, the few locals who were given an education had to be thoroughly 'indoctrinated' with Portuguese language and culture, something which they felt could only happen in Portugal itself. DETAILED ANSWER Spain The founding of so many universities in their colonies not only set Spain apart from Portugal but also (in most cases) from the other European colonial powers. Although both Spain and Portugal (usually, but not always) sought to spread their respective languages and cultures in their colonies, the aims were somewhat different. For example, in Mexico, the Spaniards set out to educate the Indians to help them run the
  empire. Source: Cristina González and Funie Hsu, Education and Empire: Colonial Universities in Mexico, India and the United States Thus, the Spanish saw educating the 'locals' as a way of strengthening their empire. To this end, they set up universities in their colonies. Following the reconquest of the Iberian peninsula from the Muslims, the Spanish had set up universities in towns like Sevilla and Osuna (among others). Thus, the Spanish were accustomed to providing education to conquered populations, which
  explains why they were so quick to establish universities in the
  Americas. Source: Cristina González and Funie Hsu This policy was also applied to the Philippines, although (for practical reasons), teaching Spanish was not a priority and most instruction (at least outside of the universities) was via local languages. In the Philippines: In essence, the Spanish  educational system was meant to keep the natives faithful, in order to keep the Church's authority over the lives of the Indios (colonized Filipinos).  The first university in the Philippines was set up in 1611 and others followed. In 1863: The implementation of [a] Royal Decree made the Philippines ... the first country in Asia which had a free and compulsory form of modern education, 10 years before the implementation in Japan. Ultimately, the reformed educational system gave Filipinos the opportunity to pursue higher learning, study liberal western ideas and develop valuable leadership skills.  This gave birth to select group of enlightened individuals who call themselves as Ilustrados. The Ilustrados played a major role in the Philippine revolution against Spain.  This was precisely what the Portuguese had feared (as noted in the section below). Portugal Although the Portuguese record on establishing universities in their colonies was very poor, the British, French and Dutch were in no position to boast about their achievements either. The Portuguese, whose education policy was in many ways a 'poor man's' version of French colonial education policy, were wary of creating an educated local elite who might challenge their authority, unless that elite thought the way the Portuguese did. The perceived best way to do this was the policy of taking Africans to Portugal to be educated there and steeped in Portuguese culture. Jerome Miinzer reports that in Lisbon he saw. . . many negroes, who had been compelled by the King to practice the Christian religion and to learn to read and write Latin. . . . A short time ago the King sent to Sao Tome black priests whom he had had educated, from their childhood,
  in Lisbon Source: Eduardo de Sousa Ferreira, Portuguese colonialism in Africa: the end of an era Although Portuguese policy from the start of the 20th century was 'assimilation to the national culture', in practice it discriminated against local peoples, as it had done pretty much from the beginning. Further, in Brazil at least, the Portuguese reserved the status of ""university"" to the University of
  Coimbra so anyone wanting a university level education had to do it in Portugal (there is an exception - Macau had a university, established by Jesuits, from 1594 to 1792). Further, Portugal saw some of its colonies as a way of dealing with widespread poverty back home; thousands of poor Portuguese were employed in the colonies, so there was (in their view) no real need to educate local populations. Even when the Portuguese did eventually give education a higher priority, they struggled to finance it (Portugal was the poorest of the European colonial powers). The limitations of the ambitions of Portuguese education policy are clearly illustrated by the Regulation of 1899 The purpose of Portuguese education in Africa, as outlined in the Regulation of 1899, was to prepare Africans for their future roles as peasants and artisans.

Could women be crucified under Roman law?,"In Antiquities of the Jews, the ancient historian Josephus reported an incident where the Emperor Tiberius explicitly ordered a woman to be crucified: Mundus had a freedwoman, who had been made free by his father, whose name was Ide, one skillful in all sorts of mischief ... Tiberius inquired into the matter thoroughly by examining the priests about it, and ordered them to be crucified, as well as Ide, who was the occasion of their perdition. (18:3)  More generally, the Romans often crucified slaves en masse. While reports usually neglect to mention gender, in many cases women are thought to have been among the victims. A common situation stems from the collective punishments prescribed by Roman law: if a slave killed their master, all slaves in the household would be crucified.  Up to the time of Nero, in Rome the collective execution of all slaves on the premises where one slave had killed the master seems to have been undisputed. Under this emperor, in 61 C.E., a minority of the Senate in vain attempted to prevent a crucifixion of 400 slaves of the household of Pedanius Secundus, the prefect of Rome.  - Barth, Markus, and Helmut Blanke. The letter to Philemon: A new translation with notes and commentary. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. In the case of Lucius Pedanius Secundus specifically, we may deduce that women were among those crucified because gender was one of the arguments raised in support of clemency. Since we are told that tradition prevailed and all of the former Consul's slaves were crucified, it appears women (as well as children) must have been among the victims of the mass execution.  The near-contemporary historian Publius Cornelius Tacitus writes in his Annals that: [C]lamorous voices rose in reply from all who pitied the number, age, or sex, as well as the undoubted innocence of the great majority. Still, the party which voted for their execution prevailed. (14:45) Moreover, the fact that they were voted down on the grounds of tradition reveals that crucifixion of at least slave women were relatively routine. Another infamous example is Crassus's crucifixion of recaptured slaves after the Third Servile War. Crassus had the rebels crucified along 'the whole road to Rome from Capua, as the ancient sources say ... They might have included women as well as men, since Roman justice did provide for the crucifixion of women. The Romans even crucified dogs in an annual ritual.  - Strauss, Barry. The Spartacus War. Simon and Schuster, 2009. Note that even Roman citizens could and have been crucified, even though they're usually exempt. Crimes such as treason void the protection of citizenship in the first place. Moreover, theoretical rights amount to little if those in power and/or popular opinion did not wish or care to uphold them, and it is not altogether clear if any law actually forbids Roman citizens from being crucified."
"Why was World War I ended on Nov 11 11:00, rather than immediately upon signing the armistice?","Communications weren't quick
It would have taken hours for the news to reach all the units on the western front. Radios were not in widespread use, so many telephone calls would have had to be made to many headquarters. They would then have had to send messengers to all their sub-units that didn't have telephones. If one side stops shooting, and the other doesn't, fighting will just restart
There would be no way to guarantee that the word of the cease-fire, spreading separately on the two sides of the lines, would reach the same areas at the same time. So if side A got an order ""Stop fighting immediately,"" and side B hadn't heard, A would stop, and B would carry on, causing casualties on side A. In fact B would be more effective than usual, because they weren't having to look out for enemy fire. Pretty soon, A would start firing again, because being shot at while having the means to shoot back, but being forbidden to do so is very hard on the nerves. So it was necessary to give some notice if everyone was to stop simultaneously. "
"What is the significance behind ""40 days"" that often appears in the Bible?","There seems to be a bit of pushback on Pieter's (correct) answer, so perhaps a bit more detail is in order. It is not at all uncommon in languages to have words that, while technically a specific number, are usually used just to indicate an unspecified large amount. One of the technical terms for this is non-numerical vague quantifiers. The most well-known of these is of course the Hebrew Bible's ""40"", but they also had a word for an even larger indeterminate number: רבבה. This word came into English (via Greek) as ""myriad"", but the technical literal value for it is 10,000. Probably the next most famous for us English speakers is 1,001, which came into English from the Arabic work 1,001 Nights (which usually doesn't contain exactly 1,001 stories, unless you get an edition that purposely tried to edit to that amount for some weird reason). You can find all kinds of English-language books with titles on the theme ""1,001 Uses For..."", and nobody really expects those to contain exactly 1,001 of the thing in question. Now most secular (and mainline Christian) Biblical scholars will tell you that the earliest written source for the Hebrew scriptures (including the story of Noah that prominently featured the indeterminate 40) committed the stories to writing around the 6th Century BC. This was about 4 centuries before the Hebrews started using their distinctive Greek-borrowed numeric system (which resembles Roman Numerals a bit in implementation). At that time the numeric system in use would have been the old Babylonian Sexagesimal system. This survives today mostly in our units of time and angle ""degree"" (and thus Earth surface coordinate) measurements. This was technically a hybrid base 60 system, but represented with a weird base 10 tally system within the 60.   If that sounds complicated to you, you're probably still better off than the common Semite, who as Pieter pointed out, probably didn't really know how to read or use this system themselves beyond the bare basics required for everyday life. Doing reckoning under this system was much harder than what we have today, and there was no equivalent to the modern western education system, where every child gets basic mathematics instruction. Working with numbers that high was difficult, and very few in the audience of these stories would have been trained to do so. You may notice that the superglyph for 40 specifically is the first one where there isn't enough space for all the 10's tallies on one line, so you have to start compressing them together into 2 lines in the same amount of space. Perhaps its a coincidence, but this is certainly the point where the writing/carving for numbers starts to look like a bit of a mess. Its a lot."
Has there ever been an instance of an active nuclear power plant within or near a war zone?,"The Ten-Day War, in 1990, was Slovenia's war of independence from Yugoslavia.  During this war, at least a few battles took places within 10-20 km of the Krško Nuclear Power Plant, which had been operating since 1983.  The map from Wikipedia shows at least three battles in the vicinity;  below, I've annotated the map with the Krško plant's location.  (Note the scale in the lower right.)  Unfortunately, I have been unable to find any online English-language sources on how (or whether) the Krško plant was affected by the fighting.  A 2015 article in Nuclear Engineering International claims that the plant remained operational during the war, but doesn't provide much more info: The battlefield map shows that engagement took place along the road passing a few kilometres from the plant. About 70 people were killed during the conflict. The station remained in operation and there is no information on the impact of the conflict on the plant safety or equipment, although it was clearly a stressful experience for the plant personnel. The cited figure of 70 casualties is for the entire war, not just the nearby battles;  the Ten-Day War was neither prolonged nor intense."
How did such a relatively minor event as the assassination of an archduke start World War I?,The assassination itself did not cause the war — it only caused the first declaration of war in World War One.  What really happened between the assassination (June 28) and the eruption of war (August 1 & 2) was this: It was by this series of steps that the minor assassination caused the first war to be fought on a global scale.
When did the Romans finally acknowledge that they were living in an empire?,"I take your question as meaning: when did Romans realize that they were living in a monarchy ? (As opposed to the aristocratic regime previously known as ""republic"".) We must first realize that there cannot be a single point in time, because the Roman people did not operate under a uniform and shared mind. Throughout the whole antiquity, three quarters of the population lived outside of towns, and worked hard in the fields to feed the remaining quarter. Generically speaking, these three quarters never took part to politics and, as far as we know, never even thought that they could be part of it. The question of ""realizing that the Empire is, indeed, a monarchy"" thus makes sense only for the urbanized Romans, excluding slaves and people too poor to have time for such things. Your question might be reduced to: ""when did senators and aristocrats began to notice that the old republic had disappeared and survived only by name ?"" Consider all the events related to the succession of Augustus. Octavius himself was well aware that he did not rise to the power through the will of the Senate. Back in 23 BC, he already considered it his duty to make provisions for his succession, and knew it was a touchy subject. Thus, at that date, at least Octavius and a few of his entourage were already operating under the sure knowledge that Rome had become a dynastic monarchy. They also knew that not everybody else would agree -- that's our first data point. Though the most astute Senators must have understood, back in the civil war times, that there was no republic anymore, we can say from the behaviours and declarations of Octavius that at that date, most of the Senate were still clinging to the notion that Rome was a Republic. In 14 AD, the situation had changed quite a lot. Augustus dies, and Tiberius obtains supreme power. Formally, this was granted by the Senate, but anybody with two brain cells would have noticed that the succession was orchestrated by Augustus from beginning to end. As a later data point, in 41 AD, Caligula is assassinated. His uncle Claudius was saved by the Praetorians (according to Suetonius, he had been hiding behind a curtain in the palace) and then made Emperor, even though he was quite unlikely in the role. Claudius was uninspiring as a leader (his speech impediment made him very unglamourous), had been kept out of office and politics for most of his life, and was apparently yearning for a scholarly life. Yet, in times of trouble, Praetorians turned to him. We can say that in 41 AD, the notion that the position of Emperor was dynastic had become firmly entrenched in the minds of soldiers, and probably of most other people as well -- being the closest in line of succession trumped any notion of competence at the job. (It must be said, though, that once in power, Claudius turned out, to the general surprise, to be quite good at being an efficient Emperor -- of course, comparatively to his predecessor Caligula and his successor Nero, that's not a difficult feat.) From these elements, we can conclude that Romans realized that they were living in a monarchy, the Emperor being a king in all but name, as part of a gradual process which had only begun in 23 BC, was going well in 14 AD, and was mostly finished in 41 AD. Of course, Emperors kept on feeding Senators with flattery, and formally sworn their fidelity to the Republic for a lot longer, but this was only ritual decorum, and everybody knew it."
Where did the Romans store their cash?,"Banking existed in the era of the Romans and earlier. In ancient Greece and Asia Minor temples served as a sanctuary where individuals could make deposits for safekeeping. This practice continued with the Romans (see this article titled ""Temple Banking In Rome""). For instance, the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus was the largest depository in Asia and served as a depository for Aristotle, Caesar, Dio Chrysostom, Plautus, Plutarch, Strabo, and Xenophon. The Temple of Saturn in Rome housed the aerarium (public treasury). During the imperial period the Temple of Castor and Pollux in Rome was a depository for the State treasury. The era of the Romans also saw the rise of private depositories. Private individuals (or individuals of a private organization) that served as bankers were known as argentarii. Such individuals were members of a collegium, or guild. Many individuals entrusted all their capital to them. The way these bankers transacted business is similar to modern times. Individuals could deposit funds with a banker, and pay their debts using a draft or check from the bank. If both the debtor and creditor had an account with the same bank it was easy for the bank to internally transfer the funds between the accounts. There were two types of deposits that could be made with an argentarius (singular form of argentarii). A depositum did not pay interest and was simply a way for the owner to give someone else the responsibility of keeping it safe. The argentarius would not use a depositum in attempt to make money off it. A creditum paid interest to the owner and allowed the argentarius to attempt to profit from the creditum. There were also public bankers, known as mensarii, who were appointed by the Roman government to loan out money in times of distress, with the first time being 352 B.C. I mention them because a class of the mensarii, the mensularii or nummularii (probably an inferior rank since mensularii is formed from a diminutive), seem to have been permanent state employees that private individuals may have deposited money with. This page provides a good overview. This page goes into detail and cites many primary sources."
Why did a young George Washington sign a document admitting to assassinating a French military officer?,"Short answer George Washington relied on the translation of a mercenary he knew well and who had previously acted as his translator, Jacob Van Braam, and did not think he was signing a document in which (the French later claimed) he admitted assassinating a French military officer. Further, the claim that the officer killed had been on a diplomatic mission, was not mentioned in the document he signed. Washington was actually more concerned with the part of the document which required that he and his men had to leave their arms behind and march though hostile territory; he requested that they be allowed to keep their guns to defend themselves against hostile Indians, and this request was granted. He then signed the document (copy here in French and English) and surrendered. Details Concerning the mistranslation and Washington's belief that he was admitting to killing a French officer (i.e. not a diplomat): the French commander offered Washington written articles of
  capitulation. He read them aloud to Van Braam so there would be no
  question what the blurred, water-blotched handwriting said. The
  preamble stated that the French intended ""only to avenge"" the death of
  Jumonville. Van Braam could not translate the next word. In the
  guttering candlelight of Washington's makeshift command post, it
  looked as if it were Passailir. Witnesses later had trouble
  remembering whether Van Braam translated it as ""death"" or ""loss"" or
  ""killing."" What the French later contended they had written had only
  one possible meaning: assassination. If Washington signed his name to
  such an admission, he was taking full responsibility, on behalf of
  Virginia and the English, for the murder of a French diplomat.
  Washington later said that what came next was what made him willing to
  sign: un de nos officiers. That was easy, ""one of our officers."" Source: Willard Sterne Randall, 'George Washington: A Life' (1997) Washington considered the document ""honourable"" except for one part: What concerned Washington more at the moment was that, after
  guaranteeing the Virginians' safe passage, the French wanted to
  ""reserve"" to themselves all his artillery ""and munitions of war."" This
  meant that Washington and his men would have to leave behind their
  guns and gunpowder and walk fifty miles through forests swarming with
  hostile Indians whom Villiers could only promise to restrain....he refused to sign. The French commander ended the impasse
  with a single stroke of his pen through the offending words. Source: Randall Ron Chernow, in Washington: A Life, has a broadly similar account, but emphasizes Washington's unawareness of the word 'assassination' in the document. How could this profound misunderstanding have arisen? The night of the
  negotiation was dark and rainy, and when Van Braam brought back the
  terms of surrender, Washington and the other officers strained to read
  the blurry words in a dim light. “We could scarcely keep the
  candlelight to read them,” recalled one officer [see note 1 below]. “They were wrote in a
  bad hand, on wet and blotted paper, so that no person could read them
  but Van Braam, who had heard them from the mouth of the French
  officer.” Not expert in English, Van Braam might have used death or
  loss interchangeably with assassination, yet it’s hard to imagine that
  he botched the translation deliberately. What is clear is that
  Washington was adamant that he never consented to the loaded word
  assassination. “That we were willfully, or ignorantly, deceived by our
  interpreter in regard to the word assassination, I do aver and will to
  my dying moment,” Washington insisted. On this last statement by Washington, more can be found here. He disputes much of his adversary's version of events, but also makes a fairly wild claim as to how many French were killed. Washington also disputed claims by the prisoners captured from Joseph Coulon de Villiers, Sieur de Jumonville's force (claims later re-iterated by the French) that they had been on a diplomatic mission when de Jumonville was killed [see note 2]. As to why Washington signed a document at all, the terms offered by the French essentially required that the conditions be put in writing; there were wider issues at stake which commanders of both sides would need to see. Further, Washington was not in a good position: the British were running low on supplies, they were outnumbered, their gunpowder was damp, the terrain favoured the French due to the poor location of the fort, and the fort itself was too small to provide shelter from the wet weather for all the soldiers. Under the circumstances, Washington negotiated the best he could [see Note 3 below]. The French commander Louis Coulon de Villiers' final offer was: If the English were now prepared to sign articles of capitulation, to
  withdraw from the Ohio Country and pledge not to return within the
  space of a year, to repatriate the prisoners they had taken, and to
  leave two officers as hostages at Fort Duquesne to guarantee the
  fulfillment of the surrender terms, he would allow them to march off
  the next day carrying their personal possessions, their arms, and
  their colors. But if the English did not agree to these terms, Coulon
  assured the Dutchman [Van Braam], he would destroy them. Source: Fred Anderson, 'Crucible of War: The Seven Years War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 Added to this, Washington was young and inexperienced, and he was relying on someone (Van Braam) who had previously served with his older half-brother. Van Braam had already acted successfully as an interpreter and Washington would have had no good reason not to trust him (Van Braam was later cleared of charges of treason in mistranslating the French terms). As Evargalo has noted in a comment, this incident should not be overestimated with regard to the Seven Years War; there were many causes and states involved, and territorial disputes were widespread. Notes Note 1: The officer mentioned is Adam Stephen, a Scottish doctor and military officer who was with Washington. This National Archives footnote for the page II., 3 July 1754 has more: In his discussion of the terms of capitulation Adam Stephen stated
  that when Van Braam “returned with the French Proposals, we were
  obliged to take the Sense of them by Word of Mouth: It rained so
  heavily that he could not give us a written Translation of them; we
  could scarcely keep the Candle light to read them; they were wrote in
  a bad Hand, on wet and blotted Paper, so that no Person could read
  them but Van Braam, who had heard them from the Mouth of the French
  Officer. Every Officer, then present, is willing to declare, that
  there was no such Word as Assassination mentioned; the Terms expressed
  to us, were ‘the Death of Jumonville.’ If it had been mentioned, we
  could have got it altered, as the French seemed very condescending,
  and willing to bring Things to a Conclusion, during the whole Course
  of the Interview” (Maryland Gazette [Annapolis], 29 Aug. 1754). Note 2: The following is from Washington's Expedition to the Ohio, 1754: Narrative: They [the French prisoners] informed me that they had been sent with a Summons to order me to
  depart. A plausible Pretence to discover our Camp, and to obtain the
  Knowledge of our Forces and our Situation! It was so clear that they
  were come to reconnoitre what we were, that I admired at their
  Assurance, when they told me they were come as an Embassy; for their
  Instructions mentioned that they should get what Knowledge they could
  of the Roads, Rivers, and of all the Country as far as Potowmack: And
  instead of coming as an Embassador, publickly, and in an open Manner,
  they came secretly,... Note 3: The National archives has this footnote: As Adam Stephen pointed out, GW had little option but to surrender,
  and the fact that the French were willing to offer terms was “no
  disagreeable News to us, who had received no Intelligence of the
  Approach of our Convoys or Reinforcements, and who had only a Couple
  of Bags of Flour and a little Bacon left for the Support of 300 Men.”
  Most of the arms were out of order, and the powder was wet from
  exposure to the incessant rain. “But what was still worse, it was no
  sooner dark, than one half of our Men got drunk” (Maryland Gazette, 29
  Aug. 1754). The men had broken into the fort’s liquor supply.
  According to GW’s later testimony on the capitulation of the fort to
  the French, he “absolutely refused their first and second proposals
  and would consent to capitulate on no other terms than such as we
  obtained.”"
"Why is Christopher Columbus credited for ""discovering"" America?","Columbus is traditionally (and indeed still) credited with the discovery of the Americas for a number of reasons, some dubious but others quite legitimate. First of all, we must qualify this discovery as discovery by Old World people. Clearly, the original ""discovery"" by the human species was some 40,000 years ago by the ancestors of the indigenous populations of North and South America, but given that this original settlement was well within the pre-historical period, and that there has probably been no contact between the peoples of the Americas and the Old World (specifically Asia) in the last 10,000 years, it might be said that we implicitly mean a ""re-discovery"" (within the historical era) of the Americas. Wikipedia actually has a fairly well-written paragraph on the subject: Though Columbus was not the first European explorer to reach the Americas (having been preceded by the Norse expedition led by Leif Ericson[6]), Columbus' voyages led to the first lasting European contact with America, inaugurating a period of European exploration and colonization of foreign lands that lasted for several centuries. They had, therefore, an enormous impact in the historical development of the modern Western world. Columbus himself saw his accomplishments primarily in the light of the spreading of the Christian religion.[2] Also worth noting is that Columbus led four expeditions to the New World: the first landed on the island of Hispaniola, and others ventured to Cuba, mainland Central America (Mexico area), and the northern coast of South America. Indeed, there is no doubt/controversy that Columbus was the first historical person of the Old World to discover South America. Over the past few decades there has been some talk and a beginning of tre acceptance of the theory that the Solutrean peoples of southern France/northern Spain made it across to North America on small boats some 20,000 years ago, by navigating the iceburg-ridden North Atlantic ocean. While lying chronologically after most of the waves of migration from East Asia into North America, it is still within the pre-historical period and hence is not usually considered in this discussion -- not least, due to its non-universal acceptance at present. Now, the first matter is that there exists clear historical evidence (both archaeological and written) that the medieval land the Vikings called Vinland does indeed correspond to Newfoundland, eastern Quebec, and the northern parts of New England. This occurred some time in the late 10th century A.D. (reputably by Leif Ericsson and his crew) when they were forced off course en route to Greenland and landed in Newfoundland. A number of reasons can be given for the diminished importance of this re-discovery, as follows. The discovery was virtually lost into Viking legend during the following centuries, when the successor states of the Viking homeland (Denmark and Norway) were forged and the Age of Migrations came to a close. As far as I know, conclusive evidence for the Norse discovery only came to light during the 20th century. The Vikings never made a permanent settlement in North America. At best, they explored around a bit, sailing up some of the major rivers (perhaps even the Hudson), and doing some minor trading with the Native Americans. However, there is no reliable evidence for routine trading with the North Americans, and indeed there are sources suggesting the Vikings considered them to be an inferior people, suggesting most contact with them was probably in the form of skirmishes. Despite the small inroads made by the Norseman, the discontinuation of any exploration or settlement efforts meant that the long-term relevance of their excursion into North America was of rather little significance. The Spanish discovery and the colonisation, on the other hand, had enormous import on the world has a whole. The Vikings as a people did not represent a particularly advanced civilisation for the time, except perhaps in warfare. They were not well-educated, and most of the literature surviving from the Viking era is in the form of sagas and the history of kings and rulers. Indeed, it was the case for many years that historians found it quite difficult to separate fact from fiction due to the nature of historical Norse texts. Now, while Columbus' discovery of the Americas (specifically of the island of Hispaniola) was no more intentional than the Vikings', it did however lead to permanent colonisation, settlement, political and economic expansion of the lands of the Americas by Spain, then Portugal, and finally other European nations. It really comes down to the import of the discovery on socio-political world affairs, which was huge in Columbus's case. Of course, there have been other rumoured (re-)discoveries of the American continents in historical times, but none with conclusive historical proof, or even a substantial level of acceptance by modern historians. These include rumoured and highly controversial discoveries by the Phoenicians, the Roman Empire, the Israelites, and the Yuan Dynasty of China, as you suggest. So in conclusion, given the importance of the two verifiable and widely acceptable discoveries of the Americas in modern time, it is not too inaccurate to say that Columbus discovered America. I personally would be quite happy if people said ""Columbus discovered central America"". To qualify this statement properly, one should really say ""Christopher Columbus and his crew were the first people of the Old World during the historical to make a discovery of the Americas that had macro-historical importance."" Well, you get the assumptions. Most people unfortunately probably do not realise these assumptions, though I do not think that totally invalidates the statement. Given the proper implicit qualifications, I do believe it is only fair to give Columbus credit for his great skills and daring as a navigator and explorer during this notable period of history.

"When did the Greeks stop calling themselves ""Roman""?","You are right, the name Hellenes means “pagans” in the New Testament, and was consequently abandoned by Greek Christians, who preferred to call themselves “Romans”. The term Hellene was revived by the Greek philosopher Giorgios Gemistos Plethon in the 15th century as part of his endeavour to replace Christianity by the “Religion of the Hellenes”. It was revived a second time by the Greek nationalist movement in the 19th century."
Why did Germany officially acknowledge the contents of the Zimmerman telegram?,"Arthur Zimmerman appears to have been trying to avoid being blamed by the German press and politicians for bringing the USA into the war. Placing your personal interests ahead of those of your country when you're a government minister is rarely a good idea.  He said: ... despite the submarine offensive, he had hoped that the USA would remain neutral. His instructions (to the Mexican government) were only to be carried out after the US declared war, and he believed his instructions to be ""absolutely loyal as regards the US"". In fact, he blamed President Wilson for breaking off relations with Germany ""with extraordinary roughness"" after the telegram was received, and that therefore the German ambassador ""no longer had the opportunity to explain the German attitude, and that the US government had declined to negotiate"". So he was claiming that his instructions to the German embassy in Mexico had been a contingency plan for use in case the US declared war, and was blaming President Wilson for a hasty and ill-considered breaking off of relations. I don't know if this had his desired effect within Germany, but it certainly increased the chances that the USA would go to war. That was disastrous for Germany; other not-so-great decisions by Zimmerman included helping to trigger the October Revolution in Russia."
Why is AD in Latin and BC is in English?,"The third answer at Guardian is perhaps useful: Anno Domini was first used by the church in England in the seventh century and came to be used in secular legal documents at a time when they, like church documents, were written in Latin. Dates `before Christ' were of little interest to the medieval church or to lawyers. The expression arose later when it was natural to use English.
Cedric Hoptroff, Milton Keynes This is supported by the same question on the English Language Stack exchange, with the following  answer Essentially the same information, presented in what may be a clearer manner: The concept of dating years B.C. is fairly recent. The English abbreviation began during the Renaissance. Before that, medieval historians dealing with pre-Christ history usually referred to the reign of various kings and emperors.Deseret news Having said that, I don't think there is a strong authoritative answer, ""Why the terminology changed from Latin to English is a matter of speculation.""

How did German unification affect existing sentences for criminal convicts?,"Thanks to some hints provided in the comments to my original post here, I have been able to locate some sources that answer my questions, at least on a high level: Beginning in 1989, even before the details of political reunification were being seriously considered, the GDR granted a number of automatic amnesties. Two of these—one on 1 October 1989 and another on 6 December 1989—were targetted at specific classes of crimes, including political crimes like Republikflucht that were not recognized as such in the FRG.  At the same time, the GDR also significantly loosened its rules concerning judicial review of sentences and convictions, a circumstance that many prisoners availed themselves of in order to get their sentences reduced or convictions overturned.  A third amnesty in 1990, which was made in furtherance of the impending reunification, resulted in a reduction in sentences across the board. Excepted from this amnesty were ""Nazi crimes, war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder, and aggravated violent or sexual offences"", which were also illegal in the FRG. Together, these measures had the effect of reducing the prison population from 24,171 in November 1989 to 4375 in July 1990, with still further reductions in the days immediately before reunification.  So relatively speaking, there were not all that many prisoners left when reunification took effect, and of these, it's unlikely that many (or even any) of them had been convicted for activities that weren't considered crimes in the FRG. The third amnesty, the law for which seems to have been carried over into West German law, granted every remaining prisoner the right to have his or her conviction reviewed by an independent commission.  These commissions were indeed constituted after reunification, and in about half of all cases the committee recommended clemency, conditional release, or quashing of the conviction. Nothing I have found indicates that there was any automatic adjustment of the sentences apart from the above-noted amnesties; it seems all prisoners who wanted their sentences altered or convictions overturned had to initiate judicial review themselves, either pre- or post-unification. I've found this information in various primary and secondary sources, though it's all briefly summarized (with references) in Corrections in the German Democratic Republic: A Field for Research by Jörg Arnold and Johannes Feest (British Journal of Criminology 35(1), 1995, pp. 81–94, DOI: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.bjc.a048490)."
What did babies eat before the advent of modern blenders?,"Many babies were indeed fed mashed food, typically of cooked vegetables and fruits. While it's true that not all foods can be prepared like this, keep in mind that pre-modern families rarely have access to the kind of dietary diversity as modern developed economies anyway. So this was likely not a realistic concern for most. Nonetheless, there is a variety of other historical baby foods. A common method of preparation is to soften food with liquid. For example, since antiquity European babies have been fed bread soaked in honey water, milk, soup, or even wine. Other, probably more familiar examples include what's basically oatmeal or porridge. At around six months the child would begin a mixed diet of breast milk and cereal [that has been] soaked in milk or hydromel, soup or eggs. At six months the doctors ordered that the child should be given sweet wine or wine sweetened with honey, or water . . . or else bread soaked in wine. Rousselle, Aline. ""The Bodies of Children"", in Porneia: on Desire and the Body in Antiquity. Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2013. Likewise, in Asia, infants and toddler were - and continues to widely be - fed congee. This dish is cooked simply by boiling rice in too much water, and has been prepared since time immemorial. No blender or other advanced kitchen appliances required. One of the first meals fed to a baby is “congee"", a broth and rice mixture of the consistency of oatmeal. This dish is usually prepared with meat, fish, or vegetables, but foods other than rice might be removed and not served to the child. Morris, Heather M., et al. ""Cultural brokering in community health."" The Canadian Nurse 95.6 (1999): 28. Finally, there's pre-chewed food. Humans actually come equipped with a kind low powered biological blenders: their own teeth, with which most foods can be rendered viably pureed for feeding babies.  Another acceptable method suitable for meat was for the parents or wet nurse to pre-chew some food and then feed it to baby with their fingers. One text describes the individual servings of pre-chewed food as being morsels the size of an acorn. Newman, Paul B. Growing up in the Middle Ages. McFarland, 2007. Premastication has been documented throughout human history and likely dates from the depths of prehistory - it is even observed in our biological cousins such as the orangutans."
Has anyone ever named a war after their own country or faction?,"(1) ""The Battle of France"" -  so called by the French. The term ""Battle of France is widely used for the WW2 fighting of the French against the German invasion. See e.g. Wikipedia Battle of France And the naming of it accordingly is attested to e.g. Winston Churchill: here ... What General Weygand has called The Battle of France is over.
The battle of Britain is about to begin. Upon this battle depends the
survival of Christian civilisation. Upon it depends our own British
life and the long continuity of our institutions and our Empire. ...
if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years,
men will still say, ""This was their finest hour"". — Winston Churchill General Maxime Weygand (2) Winston Churchill apparently coined the phrase Battle of Britain for the fight of Britain against the Germans in WW2 - see reference above. It has since come to be more tightly used to refer to the initial German-British air battle.
""The Battle of Britain"" has the distinction of being so named by both the British and essentially anyone else who talks about it - even though it was ""just one small battle"" out of very many - albeit an extremely important one. Note below that the Germans call it ""The air battle for England"" whereas   the English call it ""The Battle of Britain"". Wikipedia Battle of Britain The Battle of Britain (German: Luftschlacht um England, literally ""Air battle for England"") is the name given to the Second World War air campaign waged by the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) against the United Kingdom during the summer and autumn of 1940. The Battle of Britain was the first major campaign to be fought entirely by air forces,[18] and was also the largest and most sustained aerial bombing campaign to that date. ________________________________ The following are not ""named after their own side"" in the sense of being eponymous, but are in each case named by one of the combatant countries or leaders after their perception of their role or performance in the conflict. (3) WW2 is known to the Russians (or the then USSRians) as ""The Great Patriotic War"". Also known as ""Вели́кая Оте́чественная война́"" or ""Velíkaya Otéchestvennaya voyná"".
Presumably they did not have the German patriots in mind :-(. Wikipedia Great Patriotic War says: The term Great Patriotic War (Russian: Вели́кая Оте́чественная война́, Velíkaya Otéchestvennaya voyná[1]) is used in Russia and some other former republics of the Soviet Union to describe the conflict fought during the period from 22 June 1941 to 9 May 1945 along the many fronts of the Eastern Front of World War II between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany with its allies. Many examples here. (4) They are not being very original, as Wikipedia French invasion of Russia says The French Invasion of Russia, known in Russia as the Patriotic War of 1812 (Russian: Отечественная война 1812 года; Otechestvennaya Voyna 1812 Goda) __________________________ (5) Iraq's war against Iran under Saddam Hussein was known (at leat initially) by the Iraqis as
""The Lightning War"" due to the rapidity with which it was expected that they would overwhelm the opposition. The opposition has other ideas. That reference is harder to substantiate, but it is cited in various web references.
A reasonable example is here Saddam Hussein: The Last Great Tyrant - by the much derided and lauded Robert Fisk, December 2000 I recall huddling with Iraqi commandos in a shell-smashed city in southern Iran in 1980 when an officer announced a personal message from Saddam to all his fighting forces. They were participating, he announced, in ""the lightning war"". There was even a song that played continuously on Iraqi television: ""The Lightning War"". Like the ""Mother of All Battles"", it was a mockery of the truth. (6) Saddam may have been hat tipping to the well known German term Blitzkrieg = ""lightning war"". Wikipedia Blitzkrieg Blitzkrieg - German, ""lightning war"" is an anglicised term, describing a method of warfare whereby an attacking force spearheaded by a dense concentration of armoured and motorized or mechanized infantry formations with close air support, breaks through the opponent's line of defense by short, fast, powerful attacks and then dislocates the defenders, using speed and surprise to encircle them. Through the employment of combined arms in maneuver warfare, blitzkrieg attempts to unbalance the enemy by making it difficult for them to respond to the continuously changing front and defeating them in a decisive Vernichtungsschlacht (battle of annihilation)"
Are there confirmed cases where a country changed its language without being conquered?,"Scotland has gradually changed to using English without being conquered by England. Now I shall temper that a little in that there have been English speaking people living in Scotland just as long as there have in England. The Anglo-Saxons settled south east Scotland as well as north east England. However, English didn't become the majority language for hundreds of years after that. Scotland had several native languages such as Scots Gaelic, Pictish, a Brythonic language similar to Welsh, and also some Norse or Norn speakers. The Angles brought in Old English. Magnus Magnusson's book ""Scotland, The Story of a Nation"" has a map of this distribution on page 35. Old English changed to Middle English and then split to become Scots and Modern English. By the late middle ages just three languages remained. Gaelic, Scots and a small minority English speakers. (Map of Languages in Scotland circa 1400) After the Union of Crowns and latter Union of Parliaments, Modern English started to increase in use and Scots and Gaelic withered. However, the Union wasn't an invasion. Scotland was never conquered by the English. In fact the opposite. The Scottish king inherited the English crown. Today almost nobody uses Scots. Instead they use Scottish English with a few hits of Scots. There is a small group of Gaelic speakers but no where near the number of just 200 years ago. Wikipedia gives numbers of 297,823 speakers (18.5% of total population) in 1800 and just 58,652 (1.2%) today. Thus I would argue that Scotland has changed it's language without being conquered. Mongolia would be a contender for a second answer. Mongolia split from China during the early 20th Century. At that time they used a mix of Mongolian and Chinese (Mandarin) and a little Tibetan. They had there own Mongolian script for writing. However, today if you travel to Mongolia, you will see little use of the Mongolian script. It was replaced with Russian Cyrillic script. The strong influence of of the Soviet Union, which bordered Mongolia, brought about a change in the written language of the area. However, although the Soviet Union had a strong influence, Mongolia always remained a separate nation state and was never conquered by the USSR. Today Mongolian script is usually only seen in Inner Mongolia, within China. Outer Mongolia changed. Taiwan would also make a third answer. This one maybe politically contentious depending on how you view the status of Taiwan. However, before 1949, Mandarin Chinese was a minority language on Taiwan. When the Republic of China government relocated to Taiwan in 1949, a large number of refugees from the Mainland settled there. Today Mandarin Chinese is the majority language. So officially, the language changed without invasion. Some Taiwanese will not agree with my assessment as they consider Taiwan to have always been independent from China, assigned to Chinese control, and occupied after WWII. However that is a minority opinion. Others will disagree with me on the opposite argument that Taiwan is not an independent country and thus as part of China, doesn't count. Singapore will be my fourth contender as an answer. The official languages are Chinese, English, Malay and Tamil. The Last two, Malay and Tamil, are the native languages of the area. English came in via conquest and colonial rule. However, Chinese is now the largest language in use (49.9% of total population) but Singapore has never been conquered by the Chinese. Rather a large influx of Chinese immigrants has changed the cultural balance of the country."
Did the Soviets excel in one area of weaponry during World War II?,"I can think of a list of things which either excelled at the time or were feats not matched in the whole war. Some, like the T-34 and Yak-1, excelled in the early period of the war with clear advantages in technology and numbers (a superior weapon is no good if there's not enough of them), but their advantage faded as technology advanced, yet they remained viable front-line systems through the whole war.  Others, such as production miracles or use of artillery, were feats not to be matched in the whole war. Keep in mind that an excellent weapon system is not just the one with the best attributes, but also produced in significant numbers to make an impact on the war (""quantity has a quality all its own""). It has to fit the battlefield conditions and be usable within a soldier's (often inadequate) training. It has to be easy to transport and maintain, or expected to be destroyed so quickly that it doesn't matter. All of these weapons exemplify a style of equipment to meet the needs of the Soviet army. They're as effective as German equipment. They can be effectively used by poorly trained soldiers. They can be cheaply and simply made by a severely disrupted industry. They don't need to last long, because they'll probably be sacrificed, and there's more on the way. I'll go into each of them in some detail. The T-34 excelled, particularly in 1941.  Source: Wikipedia Pros Cons In 1941, when the Germans were slicing through most Soviet tank formations of BTs and T-26s, the T-34 was a shock.  With a better gun and armor than the German dedicated anti-tank tank, the Panzer III, a well positioned T-34 could hold up many times their number. Half a dozen anti-tank guns fire shells at him [a T-34], which sound like a drumroll. But he drives staunchly through our line like an impregnable prehistoric monster... It is remarkable that Lieutenant Steup's tank made hits on a T-34, once at about 20 meters and four times at 50 meters, with Panzergranate 40 (caliber 5 cm),[nb 1] without any noticeable effect. The Germans retooled their entire tank production to deal with the shock of Soviet medium (T-34) and heavy (KV) armor.  The upgunned Panzer IV, the Tiger, and the Panther were all rushed to deal with the surprisingly well armored Soviet tanks. The Soviets built heavy tanks like nobody else, and the IS-2 was the ultimate example.  It not only was a more balanced design than any other heavy tank, it was built early enough and in large enough numbers to have an impact on the war. The British Churchill was slow and woefully undergunned.  The German Tiger I was finicky and expensive, while the Tiger II was a bridge crushing 70-ton beast; neither were built in sufficient numbers to affect the war.  The Americans eschewed heavy tanks entirely until the very end of the war. The IS family evolved out of the powerful but unbalanced KV-1.  The KV-1 had extraordinarily heavy armor for 1941, but it was undergunned, underpowered, unreliable.  Attempts to improve upon the KV-1 lead to the IS-2. By 1943 the T-34 was already being armed with a very respectable 85mm gun, so the IS-2 was given a monstrous 122mm gun.  This gave the IS-2 very good anti-tank penetration, but also a very large high-explosive shell for use against German fortifications, (a consideration that is often lost in appreciating tank design is that tanks fight infantry far more than they fight tanks). The enormous shell could bull its way through the front armor of a Panther at 2500m. While the IS-2 was a ""heavy"" tank, it weighed the same as a Panther medium tank, but with heavier armor and a much larger gun while retaining similar range and decent mobility.  This was a far more balanced design than either the Churchill or Tigers and sets it apart.  Source: Wikipedia The other area where the IS-2 excelled is production.  Despite being introduced fairly late in the war 4000 were produced compared with 1400 Tiger Is and only 500 Tiger IIs.  While nothing compared to the volume of T-34s, it allowed them to have a significant impact on the Soviet offensive as a breakthrough tank. The IS-2 lead to the IS-3, a tank which gave Allied (and later NATO) planners serious pause.  Together, the best elements of the IS-3 and the T-34 would be combined to produce one of the most influential tanks in the world: the T-54 main battle tank. The Soviets focused on producing and improving three hulls for their armored vehicles, the light T-70, the medium T-34 and the heavy KV/IS line.  Their tanks and tank destroyers were all iterative improvements of these three hulls allowing a continuity of production and design.  This avoided the long teething problems and retooling of brand new designs so high production could be preserved. In contrast in 1944 the Germans were producing seven hulls and still introducing new ones (the Tiger II) when they should have been focusing on producing known designs.  The British also had a dizzying array of production and experimental hulls.  The Americans came closest to the Soviet achievement by focusing on the M3/4 medium and M3/5 light, but they also built the specialist M22, M24 and M18 in large numbers and never managed a heavy tank in numbers like the Soviets. The legacy of this focus on just a few tank models lead directly to the idea of the main battle tank. While there are better aircraft in WWII, the Yak-1 and Il-2 stand out for what you'll start to recognize as a Soviet pattern: early entry in the war, matching or beating their contemporaries, continuously improved, and produced in enormous numbers. The Yak-1 (and its many variants) was equivalent to a BF-109 or Spitfire and it was the aircraft that held off the Germans through the whole war. It is the most produced fighter in history with 37,000 produced. The Il-2 ""flying tank"" was a revolutionary dedicated ground attack aircraft.  Heavily armed and armored, it could (and was) flown by crews with little training.  42,000 Il-2 (and variants) where made making it the most produced military aircraft design in history. Due to its inaccuracy its actual effectiveness is debated, but its distinctive design, huge numbers, and legacy on ground attack aircraft design is solid directly inspiring one of the best ground attack aircraft, the A-10. The PPSh-41 and PPS are not particularly remarkable submachine guns, not much better or worse than contemporaries. It isn't the gun itself which excelled, but how many were made: 7 million during the war.  This is more than twice production of MP 40s, M3 grease guns, and M1 Thompsons combined. The only equivalent gun is the Sten gun which was cheap, brutal, and awful.  Source: Wikipedia It was becoming increasingly apparent that ranges of 10 to 300 meters were the norm in battle and short range firepower was what mattered.  In a war still being fought with bolt action rifles designed for aimed fire at ludicrously optimistic ranges (2000+ meters), the Soviets were arming whole companies with cheap submachine guns to close with and chop up the enemy. The Eastern Front of WWII was fought on a scale that the Western Front wouldn't see for two more years if at all.  To give one example for comparison Operation Uranus, the Soviet counter attack at Stalingrad, was fought with 1 million Soviet troops, 1000 tanks, 1500 aircraft, and 13,000 artillery pieces.  And this was November 1942 on a single front.  At about the same time the British were fighting the Second Battle of El Alamein with 100,000 men, 500 tanks, 800 aircraft, and just 500 artillery pieces.  The scale of fighting on the Eastern Front would not be seen in the West until well after the Battle of Normandy. On the theme of doing it before everyone else, the Soviets concentrated artillery in ways that only the Americans would begin to match in late 1944.  Again, Operation Uranus concentrated an accurate barrage of 3,500 artillery pieces on the Third Romanian Army.  Massive, crushing artillery barrages would continue to be a feature of Soviet offensives all the way to Berlin. One of the most overlooked Soviet achievements of WWII was evacuating its industries away from the advancing Germans and to the Caucuses or behind the Ural Mountains out of reach of German bombers (and also highlights the German strategic error in not investing in a heavy bomber). This is a feat unparalleled in world history and caused unimaginable hardship as entire populations were moved thousands of miles and forced to create cities and factories in the middle of nowhere.  Despite having a large portion of their country overrun, the Soviets maintained industrial output through the war."
"Why did Civil War officers tell their men to ""aim low""?","The sights on the Springfield Model 1861 had settings for three distances: 100, 300, and 500 yards. In the civil war, however, many battles were fought at much closer range. According to Battle Tactics of the Civil War (Paddy Griffith) many were fought inside of 100 yards. At this shorter range, the bullet didn't drop as much as the sights were calibrated for. Worse, it's almost inevitable that at least a few were using an incorrect setting, so their sights were calibrated for the even longer distances. If you were shooting only 50 yards with the sight calibrated for 500, the projectile was going to hit a lot higher than where you aimed. Another point to keep in mind is that many of the soldiers were probably accustomed to shooting various hunting arms. A military load used a prescribed amount of powder that was intended (as you can probably guess from the sight calibration) to maintain accuracy out to around 500 yards. Most people hunting at the time almost certainly used considerably less powder to minimize their costs (at the time, hunting wasn't a game to play in the fall; it was a primary source of protein). Most were probably accustomed to compensating for a fairly extreme trajectory, but the military load shot much ""flatter"". There is another point that isn't specific to that particular war, but it's probably still significant: shooting high tends to either kill (if you happen to hit somebody in the head) or miss completely. Although missing is obviously undesired, what may be less obvious is that killing generally isn't considered the optimal result either. It's actually generally preferred that you wound an enemy rather than kill him. Although it doesn't always happen, if a soldier is wounded there's some chance that one of his comrades will attempt to rescue him and get him back to where his wounds can be tended to by medical personnel (or at least get him out of the line of fire). When/if that happens, you've effectively taken not just one, but two enemy soldiers out of action (at least temporarily). Although a rescuer might come back into battle later, getting even a few extra enemy soldiers out of the battle at the right times could be decisive if the two sides started the battle almost evenly matched. Aiming low increases the chances of wounding an enemy rather than killing him (at least immediately)."
Why did Europe not see Roman-era numbers of men participating in battles until the 17th century?,"There are a lot of great answers here focusing on the material side of things: how many soldiers can a state feed/arm/support/hire? I want to complement these with an ideological factor. While people can be conscripted or paid to fight, mobilization is always easiest when the population is eager to serve. Some ideologies increase the supply of willing soldiers (e.g. republicanism, nationalism), while others decrease the supply (e.g. the medieval caste system). Classical republicanism as developed by the Greeks and Romans taught that all citizens had a duty to fight for their polis or republic. Horatius and Cincinattus are the embodiments of the martial aspect of this ideology: the citizen-soldier. Even as Roman power extended beyond the city itself, military service was understood to convey some amount of citizenship rights (e.g. the Social War). Virtuous Romans wanted to fight for Rome, and so there were large reservoirs of willing soldiers. As this ideology deteriorated, so did the population of willing Roman soldiers. Of course, the late Empire could still field large armies despite the breakdown of this ideology with time--but arguably these forces would have been much more effective if they'd had a firmer attachment to Rome. Medieval Europe had a caste system with a supporting ideology that (in its ordinary operations) discouraged the vast majority of Europeans from martial pursuits. Under this caste system, the noble minority were warriors and the peasant majority were laborers. Peasants (with some exceptions) would rarely feel the calling to defend their lord, as a Roman citizen might defend Rome or nobles might defend their ancestral lands. Indeed, when armies did grow to considerable size in this period, it was often due to the aid of religious ideological motivation, usually encroaching Islam (Peasant's Crusade, the Battle of Tours). Interestingly, we see a revival of classical republicanism in the Renaissance, precisely when ambitious city-states need to mobilize their non-noble citizens to fight. Liberal ""bourgeois"" nations (with their emphasis on the rights of citizenship) also found classical republicanism to be a useful ideology--especially the United States, where the founding fathers wanted to rely on a volunteer militia for as long as possible. So it's not surprising that in the 18th century, Cincinattus gets a revival and in the 19th, Horatius gets his.  By the 19th century we have entered the era of nationalism, an ideology that (as Napoleon realized) is ideally suited for mass mobilization. Of course, you can't explain the enormous and sustained mobilization of the World Wars (let alone their causes) without some reference to nationalism. There's all sorts of interesting philosophical discussions to be had about whether the material or ideological preconditions for mass mobilization come first. But I want to put that aside for now and just point out that why people fight is important. Each era has its own set of ideologies, and these affect how inclined citizens and subjects are to serve as soldiers."
Has Britain's 1940 invasion of Iceland been downplayed by historians?,"I have looked through the German Propaganda Archive and haven't found any references to the British occupation of Iceland in 1940.  So I would hesitantly guess that if the occupation was used by German propagandists, it was not used widely."
Why couldn't soldiers sight their own weapons without officers' orders?,"The question asks why British officers would micromanage enlisted troops by doing things like dictating the range to sight their rifles.  This type of ""micromanaging"" is a foundation of the military tactics of that time and one of the key differences between a ""military unit"" and a ""group of men with guns"" in the period being discussed. A few hundred years of warfare using muskets preceded by thousands of years of warfare using bows had left the concept of massed volley fire as a deeply ingrained component of military doctrine, and for good reason since it worked so well.  Machineguns were still too new and somewhat uncommon so their impact on infantry tactics was only beginning to emerge.  Without a machinegun, massed volley fire was still the best way for units of infantry to engage other units of infantry on a ""conventional"" battlefield.   At the time of the Boer wars, British infantry doctrine dictated that soldiers would only fire individually when fighting at distances less than 300 yards.  Any fighting at distances beyond that was only allowed to occur using volley fire with everybody in the unit firing as a single unit.  The only way this type of volley firing can occur is if the unit leader ""micromanages"" the unit by dictating the distance selected on the rifle sights, dictating the target or target area to engage, when to fire, and when to stop firing.   With this concept of massed fire so deeply ingrained in the military mind and such a foundation of their tactics, infantrymen were taught from the beginning of their training that they are to adjust the range setting on their rifle sights when (and only when) they are ordered to do so by their officer.  Discipline is critical to military order and British solders had a well earned reputation for discipline and order.  If the officers ordered that sights be adjusted to 500 yards then that is where they were going to stay adjusted until a new order was given.  Second guessing orders in the middle of a firefight is not something that a well-trained soldier of that day would ever consider.   And to be clear, when we are talking about adjusting the sights on the rifle in this context we are not talking about zeroing the rifle sights.  Some comments in response to another answer seem to be confusing these two concepts.  We are talking about soldiers raising the folding ""ladder"" sight into position for long distance firing and adjusting it to the distance ordered by the unit leader.   This is the rear sight of a Martini-Henry rifle folded down for short range firing or to keep it from being damaged during storage or transport.  And this is the sight raised into position for longer range volley fire.
 Another important factor that is not mentioned in the wikipedia article quoted in the question is the effects on bullet trajectory when shooting at a downward or upward angle.  The soldiers were shooting down the hill towards their attackers which means the bullet's arc does not ""fall"" as far relative to the point of aim indicated through the sights.  Any British soldiers who were not experienced enough to understand the effects of firing at a downward angle would likely still have been firing too high even if they did flip their sights down to the short range position.  "
"How was Germany able to hold itself together, while Austria-Hungary could not?","The German Empire was a far more homogeneous state than Austria-Hungary. While the vast majority of Germans were... Germans, Austria-Hungary famously had to issue mobilisation orders in 11 languages. Their ethnic identities included: Although Germans and Hungarians dominated politically, none of these groups were more than 25% of the population. Once the prestige and authority of the Habsburg Monarchy disintegrated, there was nothing holding these disparate nationalities together. Perhaps even more importantly, each nationality was to a large degree concentrated in specific locales. The Hungarians dominated central Hungary; the Czechs were concentrated in Bohemia; and the Croats lived within Croatia-Slavonia, for example. Once central authority broke down, it was therefore relatively easier for each of these subregions to transition into a new nation-state of their own.  In contrast, the German Empire was very much a single-nation state. Now, to be sure, there was still numerous minority groups. However, Germans constituted 92% of the German population. This was an overwhelmingly dominant group, which by and large continued to identify with Germany even after the monarchies collapsed. Moreover, on a geographical level, ethnic Germans dominated most of Germany. Hence although there were many uprisings, separatist revolts were limited to the periphery and did not threaten the core German territories.   One of the policies pursued by the victorious powers is national self-determination, a principle expressed by President Wilson in his Fourteen Points declaration. If you examine the ethnic maps posted above, then it becomes obvious that the Allies actually partitioned both Germany and Austria-Hungary roughly along ethnic lines. Most of the Polish regions of Germany were detached. The Danish dominated the northern bit of Schleswig-Holstein, which was returned to Denmark. Likewise, Austria-Hungary lost South Tyrol to Italy, Galicia to Poland, Banat to Romania, and the remaining Germans, Hungarians, Croats/Serbs/Slovenians, and Czechs/Slovaks each gained their own nation states. Since most of Germany was inhabited by Germans, she stayed together largely intact. In contrast, Austria-Hungary was very fragmented ethnically. Therefore, the logical result of ""giving every language its own state"", as the exasperated French complained of Wilson, meant that Austria-Hungary ended up being completely dismantled. Of course, Allied strategic concerns regularly overrode this principle. For instance, the Danzig Corridor was awarded to Poland despite its German majority, in order to give the Poles access to the sea. Austria was also prevented from entering into a union with Germany, because the Allies feared this would strengthen Germany too much. Even then, however, there was inter-allied manoeuvring to avoid taking blame for violating the principle of self-determination. While they wished to make [the prohibition of Anschuluss] permanent, the British instead stressed its temporary character. Some Englishmen wanted the French to bear the ""odium"" for any violation of the principle of national self-determination. Low, Alfred D. The Anschluss Movement, 1918-1919, and the Paris Peace Conference. American Philosophical Society, 1974. The principle of national self-determination was not wholly lip service - it found many believers among Allied intellectuals. Although practical concerns regularly overrode it, Allied leaders were nonetheless unwilling to appear completely hypocritical. Thus: Preventing anschluss was relatively easy to achieve. the French simply dismissed the Austrian movement as a ruse orchestrated by Berlin. While President Wilson was insistent that the Allies ""cannot deny a country the right to link up with another; we cannot refuse a country the right to join another, if she wishes it"", he was quite willing to agree that ""we can prohibit an annexation"" by Germany. And so the Big Three resolved to prohibit anschluss except with the approval of the League of Nations. To go further by substantially dismembering Germany, however, would have been a much more egregious violation of the principle of self-determination. The French did consider such a move, asking for the creation of an independent Rhenish state, but this time Wilson adamantly refused to budge: The most that France felt able to urge for its own security was the creation of a separate Rhineland state, and even this was thwarted by Wilson's use of the national determination argument. In lieu, Wilson offered the French demilitarization of the Rhine and an Anglo-American guarantee of the frontier with Germany. Cassels, Alan. Ideology and International Relations in the Modern World. Routledge, 2002. Although the French didn't bother pushing to move Bavaria to Austria, we can reasonably expect Wilson to have the same reaction. Moreover, there was substantial support within the British Foreign Office for joining Austria to Germany in order to counterbalance Prussia's dominance by strengthening southern, Catholic Germany. To detach Bavaria would have the opposite effect, and would produce pressure on Lloyd George to oppose such a scheme. [A] secret memorandum drawn up in the Foreign Office in the fall of 1916 had recommended both the dissolution of the Habsburg multinational empire and the Anschluss of the ""German provinces of Austria"" with Germany. In his memoirs [prime minister David Lloyd George] praised as ""remarkable"" this British memorandum, which had been prepared and signed by two prominent officials of the Foreign Office . . . In any event, this increase will not add to Prussia's power, but rather enhance the importance of the non-Prussian German states and substantially enlarge Germany's Catholic elements. The weakening of Prussia will diminish Germany's threat to Europe. ""We therefore think that the drifting of the Austrian provinces to Germany need not alarm the Allies who are not intent on crushing Germany"". Low, Alfred D. The Anschluss Movement, 1918-1919, and the Paris Peace Conference. American Philosophical Society, 1974."
How did the Roman state verify citizenship?,"Update Less prestigious than these two offices but still part of the ‘twenty six men,’ were the decemviri stlitibus iudicandis (‘ten men for judging lawsuits’), a board which judged minor lawsuits,including adjudicating the free or non-free status of a person when the question was in doubt. ACOUP Obviously my answer below was ... at the very least incomplete.  It is possible that ACOUP doesn't actually modify the answer, but the big missing piece is how the decemviri stlitibus iudicandis adjudicated. I don't have a good citation for this - the Wikipedia article provided by @kubanczyk is relatively decent, and highlights the role of the censor, which is probably the state oriented solution to the question. I think the question relies on modern assumptions.  Roman citizens would never have needed to prove their identity. Set aside for the moment the urban tribes - they're really just a special case. - and let's set aside women, because that is probably a book length answer. Every other Roman citizen is bound in a fairly strong social context; they're a member of a family, a tribe, and a gens.  Furthermore most Romans were a member of some kind of a patron-client relationship. Remember also that there are sumptuary laws and customs that determine clothing/costume. Also remember that your legal rights and obligations are based on your social class. For anything other than the lowest social ranks, you are effectively required to participate in the state, and your participation is defined by your social class/citizenship status.  Anyone with any ambition is on the cursus honorum, which has the effect of creating a reputation throughout society.  If the individual is not actively on the cursus honorum, then they're goign to want to ask a favor or provide a favor to someone who is on the cursus honorum. Roman society is bound together by a web of relationships, and that web serves as such a strong evidence of citizenship that there is no need for any kind of proof.  Anyone who had any doubt about an individual could easily ask someone for a report on their reputation. Anyone who didn't have a good reputation would be unable to act politically, economically, socially, etc. Update: Mr. Goldberg raises another interesting edge case (apart from women and urban tribes).  What about Romans travelling abroad? This is a slightly different set of questions. 1) How do Foreign governments determine whether someone is a Roman citizen? 2) How do Romans determine if someone is a Roman citizen. In truth, I believe that the answer remains the same.  Despite the fact that Roman society invented the rule of law, neither Roman society nor any other society of the period practiced the rule of law.  The rights of an individual arise first and foremost from their social network and only secondarily from any legal status.  If Egypt (or Armenia, or Persia, or whoever) takes action against an individual, that action is legal unless the individual's network imposes consequences.  Mr. Goldberg poses the perfect case - Verres execution of a Roman citizen.  If Verres had not pursued justice for his lictor, then nothing would have happened. If Verres had not been over the top, he wouldn't have been brought to trial. Rome had no police force, no agency charged with enforcing the law (There were specific forced devoted to enforcement of laws against arson, and against treason, but that takes us into book length territory; I'm making a concious generalization).  The responsibility for enforcing the law fell on the kin, tribe, gens and patron of the offended individual. Update 2: Voitcus cites the example of St. Paul who asserts that as a Roman citizen he has the right to be tried in a Roman court (by the Caesar).  Paul is an interesting case because he was an itenerant preacher, a member of a persecuted minority.  In fact, part of the reason why Christians were persecuted is that they didn't fit neatly within the mold. Paul could be simultaneously a Christian, a Roman citizen, and a Jew.  (Discussion of what it means to be simultaneously a Jew and a Christian are out of scope for this question).  Based on my memory and quick research, we don't have a great deal of facts concerning Paul's alleged crimes, or his accusers.  He seems to have offended the local Jewish population.  His offenses against Judaism should have been tried in a court in Jerusalem.  Paul asserts his right as a Roman citizen and demands a change of venue to a Roman court in Rome, which we may infer would be a less hostile court. Unfortunately in order to discuss the issues that Voitcus raises, we'd have to know more. We don't know if Paul's claim was challenged.  If it was unchallenged, then Paul never needed to prove his claim. (the local authorities may have felt that getting him out of town would resolve the local problem.)   I would assume, based on my study of Roman history, that the local authorities had already consulted Paul's relationships and reputation and knew him to be a citizen."
"During the breakup of the Soviet Union, on what basis was citizenship granted or withheld for each of the fifteen new republics?","This question gets really complicated really fast. After the breakup, each of the former Soviet republics established its own set of laws, and then these laws were rewritten multiple times. The region also includes half a dozen unrecognized states (Transnistria, Artsakh, Abkhazia, Ossetia, DPR, and LPR) each of them having its own very original definition of citizenship. I'll try to give a general answer, but if you need to investigate a particular case you should probably ask a much more specific question. USSR had uniform citizenship for all republics and a common passport for all its citizens. Article 33. Uniform federal citizenship is established for the USSR. Every citizen of a Union Republic is a citizen of the USSR. The grounds and procedure for acquiring or forfeiting Council citizenship are defined by the Law on Citizenship of the USSR. When abroad, citizens of the USSR enjoy the protection and assistance of the Soviet state.
Consitution of Soviet Union, 1977 Republics had to respect the law of the Union and their constitutions usually reflected that: Статья 31. В соответствии с установленным в СССР единым союзным гражданством каждый гражданин Казахской ССР является гражданином СССР. ... Граждане других союзных республик пользуются на территории Казахской ССР одинаковыми правами с гражданами Казахской ССР.
Article 31. According to uniform union citizenship established in the USSR, every citizen of Kazakh SSR is a citizen of USSR. ... Citizens of other union republics on the territory of Kazakh SSR have the same rights as the citizens of Kazakh SSR.
Constitution of Kazakh SSR, 1978 So, the citizenship of a republic was vaguely defined and didn't mean much. For example, one didn't have to apply for a new passport to migrate from Tajikistan to Lithuania. There were other bureaucratic hurdles, though. The Soviet Union had a concept of residency permits (see, propiska). This means that Soviet people had to notify the authorities and receive an inscription in their passports to be allowed to move to another city, even if both cities are in the same republic. The requirements differed from city to city and could be very complicated at times. As a result, every Soviet citizen had a verified physical address written in their passport. USSR also issued other types of IDs like birth certificates and employment record books (obligatory for all working people). Also, the ethnicity (natsional'nost') was recorded in the passport. Some of the former republics still continue to record the ethnicity in official IDs and occasionally this can let someone fast-forward the immigration process. For the first couple of years after the breakup people continued to use Soviet IDs. It took a couple of years to implement a new legal framework. Most of the newly independent countries accepted all permanent residents as citizens. To give an example from Central Asia, here's a law enacted in Kazakhstan ( On citizenship of the Republic of Kazakhstan, 1994): 3-бап. Қазақстан Республикасының азаматы болу
Мына адамдар: Rough unoffiical translation
Article 3. Belonging to the citizenship of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Those people are considered as citizens of Republic of Kazakhstan: So, the proof of residency (propiska) was enough to receive citizenship. Soviet IDs were in limited use long after that. People were allowed to exchange Soviet passports until 1999 in Kazakhstan and 2004 in Kyrgyzstan (according to Wikipedia at least). I believe Soviet birth certificates can still be used in some exceptional cases (e.g. people who don't have any other kind of ID). Ethnicity was never the requirement to receive citizenship, but many countries established a fast-forward naturalization process for people returning to their historical homeland. As far as I can tell, of all 15 republics, only Estonia and Latvia refused to give citizenship automatically for all their residents. They only recognized people who lived there before the Soviet occupation in 1940. Article 2. Possession of Latvia citizenship
Citizens of Latvia are: Law of citizenship, Latvia, 1994 The rest of the residents had to go through a naturalization process to receive citizenship. The Law includes very detailed restrictions (Article 11, e.g. convicted criminals and former Soviet officials are excluded) and regulations (Article 12, e.g. citizen need to have a command of the Latvian language) for naturalization. All former republics, except Estonia and Latvia, granted citizenship to all permanent residents willing to receive it. The Soviet Union was tracking people, so the residency was easy to establish. ""Ethnicity"" (natsional'nost') was also easy to establish because it was written in a passport. I'm putting quotes here because natsional'nost' is a very rough version of ethnicity, e.g. people with multiethnic background didn't have an option to put multiple ethnicities in their documents. Anyway, ethnicity was never a basis or requirement to receive citizenship in former Soviet states. In some cases, ethnicity can help fast forward the immigration process, though. Persons of Russian descent with a connection to Central Asia needed to have proof of residence to be granted citizenship in Central Asia and/or Russia. With enough dedication, it wasn't and it still isn't hard to receive citizenship in both countries. Cases like these are not unheard of, even in countries where dual citizenship is illegal."
Why were the Allies so much better cryptanalysts?,"Short Answer Allied superiority in cryptography versus both the Germans and the Japanese can be broadly attributed to (1) better/greater coordination among personnel, awareness of vulnerabilities, and allocation of resources for breaking enemy codes and, (2) the fact that Axis codes were (mostly, though not always) more easy to break than Allied ones. However, it should not be overlooked that the Axis powers did break some important Allied codes, and that some Axis codes were not broken by the Allies. German Codebreaking vs. Allied Codebreaking While the Allies were superior in the use of cryptography, the Germans had their successes as well, as detailed in the Wikipedia article German code breaking in World War II. The most notable success was the breaking of many British naval codes by B-Dienst, which proved particularly damaging to transatlantic convoys. Nonetheless, there was overall Allied superiority in this area and this has been attributed to nine factors by David Kahn in his article Codebreaking in World Wars I and II: The Major Successes and Failures, Their Causes and Their Effects (1980). Kahn divides these nine reasons into two broad categories: (1) internal or technical and, (2) external or general. For internal or technical, and listed in rough order of importance, Kahn notes: Allied knowledge of the Enigma: the German use of one main machine
versus the Allied use of many; a poorer German machine; and inadequate
operating procedures. On the first of these points, The Enigma was originally sold to the public. Even though it was
modified for government use, and even though the several agencies of
government had their own variations of it, the Allies knew its basic
layout. To this must be added the information about its keys and
operation provided by the spy. Cryptanalytically, this is of course an
enormous head start. It is also a great psychological advantage. The
Germans did not have these benefits. The British Type-X and the
American SIGABA machines were developed in secret. On the second point, This use of one machine [Enigma, by the Germans] had several effects.
First of all, it meant that the Allies could concentrate more manpower
on a single problem. Secondly, the greater volume of messages
enciphered in that single system facilitated its solution. Thirdly, a
single system increased Allied incentive, because its solution would
yield a greater prize than if it were just one system among many. None
of these factors operated for the Germans, and it correspondingly
depressed their efforts and results. On the third point, and referring to the American SIGABA, It was in fact devised a decade after the Enigma, and because the
Americans did not begin equipping their army and navy with cipher
machines until the late 1930s, they could utilize this more advanced
mechanism without losing capital investment. The Germans, who had
mechanized a decade earlier, were stuck with an older, weaker machine. On the fourth point, ...just as the German hardware was poorer, so was their software. Two
of their operating procedures proved fatal to many an Enigma
cryptogram. One was the flawed keying method used by the Germans
before the war and for its first year or so.....This keying method was
later changed, but by then Enigma had been cracked. The Allies, on the
other hand, used far more secure keying systems which obviated this
sort of attack. Turning to the five external or general reasons, ...the fragmentation of the German organization compared to the unity
of the Allied; Germany's aggression, which led to a neglect of
cryptology, contrasted with the Allied defensive posture, which
emphasised intelligence; the expulsion and killing of the Jews; better
Allied luck, and greater German reluctance to face reality. Kahn asserts that the first of these was the most important: The Germans had a great many codebreaking agencies. The
Chiffrierabteilung of the armed forces high command, Pers Z of the
Foreign Office, and Goring's Forschungsamt competed on the highest
level. For a time the SD, the Sicherheitsdienstt, the SS's
intelligence arm, had its own agency. The army, the navy, and the air
force each had its own unit, though there was rather more
justification for that. But this multiplicity spread the available
manpower, which was scarce to begin with, very thin. And it diffused
the codebreaking effort. Contrast this with the concentration of
effort at Bletchley Park, Britain's sole codebreaking agency, and with
that in America, where the army and navy codebreaking units worked in
the closest co-operation. On the other points, Kahn notes that German recruiting and training were inferior to that of the Allies while, concerning the Jews, the ...exodus or extermination of a whole people, many of them highly
intelligent, cost German codebreaking - as it cost German mathematics
and German physics - many useful brains. Finally, the Germans were slow to accept that Enigma had been broken, even when faced with strong evidence. A senior British MI6 officer, F. W. Winterbotham, noted this when he later wrote in The Ultra Secret (1974) that the Germans ...must have been puzzled by our knowledge of their U-boat positions,
but luckily they did not accept the fact that we had broken enigma. Japanese Codebreaking vs. Allied Codebreaking A key point that needs emphasising here, even more so than for the Germans, is not that the Japanese were inept at codebreaking but rather that they made it much easier for the Americans to break their codes than it should have been. This was especially true of the Imperial Japanese Navy: William Friedman, the great American cryptologist...noted that while
high level US Naval communications security in WW2 was quite adequate
for the time, Japanese Naval communications security was quite
inadequate and the IJN lacked the ‘experience and knowledge’ to
rectify it. Source: Peter Donovan & John Mack, 'Code Breaking in the Pacific' (2014) The Japanese did, though, have a significant amount of success in cracking Allied codes: ... the SIGINT abilities of Japan were not as low as has traditionally
been thought. The Imperial Japanese Army was able to read the
diplomatic codes of the US, Great Britain, France and China, and some
of the military codes of China and the Soviet Union. Source: Kotani Ken, 'Japanese Intelligence in WWII: Successes and Failures' (NIDS Security Reports, 2009) Also, unlike Japanese Imperial Navy codes, In the case of the Army, counterintelligence activities were
relatively effective, and there were no cases of Army codes being
deciphered by the Allies until the final stages of the war. Source: Kotani Ken A key reason for the weakness of the Imperial Navy on the intelligence front was that they effectively ignored signs that their codes had been broken but a ... thorough investigation of the cause and countermeasures were not
implemented. ....Rear Admiral Ryunosuke Kusaka, who had participated
with the assistant chief of staff of the 1st air fleet, stated that
“The fact that the planning of the Combined Fleet in relation to the
Battle of Midway was leaked to the US side was a major cause of the
failure of that operation.” In an Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff
diary, it was stated that “the enemy had sensed our plan.” However,
even though these suspicions remained in the Imperial Japanese Navy
General Staff, the cause of defeat at Midway was basically considered
to be technical operational factors, such as problems in cooperation
with supply ships and inadequacy in searching for the enemy.
Ultimately, the fact that the Japanese codes had been deciphered was
not touched upon. Source: Kotani Ken One problem for the Japanese was the far-flung nature of their empire; this made it difficult to easily implement code changes. Further, Commander Chikataka Nakajima who was a specialist in communications
within the Navy recalls that “the greatest deficiency in our Navy’s
coding plan was inadequate consideration of the fact that our code
charts could fall into enemy hands.” The weak awareness of counterespionage on the part of the Imperial
Japanese Navy at the time, and the lack of a self-cleansing function
caused a number of problems to arise. When we consider the effects
exerted on subsequent naval strategies, they were all serious. Even if
one of the codes were taken, the arrogance that “our codes cannot be
deciphered” meant that little labor was put into counterintelligence
work. Source: Kotani Ken Some of these weaknesses would probably have been dealt with had the Japanese army and navy co-operated and learnt from each other (especially the latter from the former). However, as gktscrk pointed out in a comment below, interservice rivalry was fierce, the damage stretching far beyond counter-intelligence. As for the Japanese failure to break Navajo (and, as noted by jamesqf in a comment below, other Native American) codes, these were exceptionally difficult to crack: The Navajo language seemed to be the perfect option as a code because
it is not written1 and very few people who aren’t of Navajo origin can
speak it. However, the Marine Corps took the code to the next level and made it
virtually unbreakable by further encoding the language with word
substitution. Source: 'Navajo Code Talkers and the Unbreakable Code' (CIA) A further complication for the Japanese was that it was used in the field via portable radios so, without a Navajo speaker to hand, this made it even more secure: The Navajo language has no definite rules and a tone that is guttural.
The language was unwritten at the time1, notes Carl Gorman,
one of the 29 original Navajo code talkers. ""You had to base it solely
on the sounds you were hearing,"" he says. ""This made it very difficult
for others to understand."" 1. The 'not written' and 'unwritten' bits are not strictly true (see, for example, Schwern's answer here and this article, but it wasn't widely available and new words had to be invented for military terms."
"When did FDR announce he was running a 3rd time, and was there any outrage?","SHORT ANSWER TO THE MAIN QUESTIONS We can't be sure when FDR decided to stand for a third term but the evidence suggests it was not long before the Democratic National Convention (15th to 18th July 1940). Concerning breaking tradition by running for a 3rd term, reaction from his opponents was vociferous but from the country at large it was mostly fairly muted. DETAILED ANSWER According to Richard Moe in Roosevelt's Second Act: The Election of 1940 and the Politics of War, In early July 1940, with the Democratic National Convention scheduled
to convene in less than two weeks, the president was moving towards a
decision. He likely saw it as perhaps the most important decision of
his presidency to date, perhaps even of lifetime. We will never know
how he saw it because he faced it alone Thus we can't be sure. FDR's practice of solitary decision making...continued through his youth and
early adulthood until it became deeply ingrained. Jean Edward Smith, in FDR, cites Eleanor Roosevelt as also being unsure as to husband's intentions: ""I think my husband was torn"" said Eleanor years later. ""He would
often talk about the reasons against a third term, but there was a
great sense of responsibility for what was happening."" However, on July 3rd (12 days before the Democratic National Convention) the then Secretary of State Cordell Hull lunched with FDR. During the course of the meal, he came to the conclusion the President had likely already made up his mind. Hull relates that at a previous meeting 10 days before, FDR had advocated his (Hull's) candidacy, but that at the July 3rd meeting FDR was listing reasons why Hull should not be the candidate. Thus, if Hull read the situation correctly, FDR made up his mind sometime during the ten days before July 3rd. This runs somewhat contrary to opinion at the time and later: Many close observers believed at the time that FDR had long before
decided to run again; it was obvious, they concluded, that this man of
outsized ambition would find a way to remain in the job he loved. Many
historians and biographers have concluded as well that the decision
was inevitable. Richard Moe argues otherwise, pointing out that ...in fact the decision was far from inevitable. President Roosevelt
never challenged the wisdom of the sacrosanct two-term tradition. On
the contrary, as his second term wound down, he made specific plans to
retire to his beloved Hyde Park in January of 1941...Colliers magazine
had persuaded him to sign a lucrative three-year contract to write
regular articles (The contract with Collier's was signed in January 1940.) Smith concurs with Moe that FDR's decision was not inevitable; Roosevelt was concerned about his health, was already transferring papers to his library and his retirement home was nearing completion. FDR also stated he didn't want to run unless ""things get very, very much worse in Europe."" According to both Smith and Moe, FDR did not take the decision to run for an unprecedented 3rd term lightly but was swayed by the situation in Europe; the collapse of France in June 1940 left Britain as the only European power still resisting Hitler. Roosevelt felt that he was the only one with the experience to deal with the situation. The Democratic Party wanted FDR to run as they felt that none of the other prospective candidates would be able to defeat the strong (though politically inexperienced) Republican candidate, Wendell Willkie. The decision of his vice-President, John Garner, to seek the Democratic nomination stemmed at least partly from strong disagreements with the President on some key policies; how much he was influenced by his reading of FDR's intentions is hard to tell. For the record, Roosevelt made his decision public on the 11th of July 1940. On the reaction to FDR's decision, fdrlibrary says The 1940 election was the most challenging and divisive of FDR’s
political career. The President’s decision to seek an unprecedented
third term inflamed his opponents—and some former supporters—who
charged he wanted to become a dictator. And his efforts to aid
countries fighting the Axis Powers led to charges he would drag
America into war. The Republicans certainly made much of the 3rd term, and they were joined by some democrats, even though there was at that time no bar in the constitution. Teddy Roosevelt (as noted by Pieter Geerkens in his comment) regretted his comment about two terms being enough, and Ulysses S. Grant had wanted a third term but lacked the support of his party. However, the weakness of Vice-President Garner's candidacy and FDR's economic record were enough to get him the nomination and win the election. Some of the badges below, though, give a good idea as to how Republicans - and some democrats - felt about a third term.  Image source: Kentucky Historical Society 
Source: https://fdrlibrary.wordpress.com/tag/third-term/ As you noted in your question, Willkie's criticism was somewhat muted, and he wasn't much of a campaigner: Willkie proved lackluster on the stump and he seemed to agree with
much of FDR's domestic and foreign agenda. In late September, though,
Willkie began to tighten the race, largely by charging that if FDR won
a third term, ""you may expect that we will be at war."" Roosevelt
countered that he would not send Americans to fight in ""any foreign
war."" Over its last month, the campaign degenerated into a series of
outrageous accusations and mud-slinging, if not by the two candidates
themselves then by their respective parties. Source: William E. Leuchtenburg, 'Franklin D. Roosevelt: Campaigns and Elections' Wilkie, in fact, worked with FDR after the election, sharing the President's concern about the situation in Europe (and certainly a proportion of the electorate shared that concern, even if not a majority). Despite the noise made by FDR's opponents, a majority of the electorate did not in fact favour limiting a president to two terms if a Gallup poll conducted in 1939 is to be believed. According to this poll, 37% were in favour of a two-term limit while 51% were against such a limit (12% no opinion). Interestingly, George Gallup was a republican and Roosevelt suspected that Gallups polls in the lead up to the election would do him no favours - this poll, though, did. Analysis of polls conducted on issues relating to American policy on Europe indicate that America was not as isolationist as many believe. Bear F. Braumoeller, then Assistant Professor at Harvard University, has labelled it a 'myth'. In his article The Myth of American Isolationism, his abstract states: American policy in the years leading up to the bombing of Pearl Harbor
was in fact quite responsive to events on the European continent.
Isolationists did exist, of course, but they never came close to
constituting a majority. In short, American isolationism is a myth. Perhaps 'myth' is a little strong for polling shows that there certainly were millions of Americans who wanted to keep their country out of the European conflict. The America First Committee had 800,000 members at its peak and congress was strongly isolationist throughout the 1930s. Nonetheless, as Braumoeller states later in his article, The events of May and June 1940, especially the surrender of France on
June 22, produced a drastic change in American perceptions of the
European balance. Even so, newspaper headlines such the one below (on July 11, the day Roosevelt formally announced his intention to run) show that opposition to entering the war was still vociferous in some quarters.  Source: Labor Press Project, University of Washington Polling data indicates that two months before the election on November 5th, around 50% of Americans favoured helping Britain, and this figure continued to rise. Berinsky et al in Revisiting Public Opinion in the
1930s and 1940s write that Majority support for the policy of helping England, even at the risk
of war with Germany, was attained during the 1940 election Another poll found that, even in September 1939, 38% of Americans thought the US should Help Allies with Food and Materials, as opposed to 36% who thought the US should sell food to anyone and 21% who favoured strict neutrality. By March 1940, around 65% of Americans felt that the help given to Britain and France by the then current Cash and carry policy was 'about right'. Roosevelt was avid follower of polls (though he distrusted Gallup in particular) and would have been aware of the general direction in which American public opinion was going, even though early polling data was far from reliable. His political instincts weren't wrong; by October 1941, two months before Pearl Harbor, support for helping England had already reached 70%. Other source: Steven Casey, Cautious Crusade: Franklin D.

Did cows in Medieval times have calves in spring or all year round?,"All highlighting is mine Concerning calving in the middle ages, Cows...would calve in the
  early spring. Calves would nurse for about a month and then be
  separated from their mothers and fed by hand until they learned to
  graze on their own. Ideally, the calves would be weaned just as the
  pastures began showing some good growth, but in a cold spring the
  farmer would just have to hope he had enough hay stored up. E. Griffiths & M. Overton in Farming to Halves also state that calving was in spring. Peter R. Coss, in Thirteenth Century England IV, says that the medieval cow was not generally added to breeding stock until she
  had reached her fourth year, probably because the animals were
  undernourished and slow-growing. On the consumption of milk, Melitta Weiss Adamson in Food in Medieval Times says In the Middle Ages, infants were fed the breast milk of mothers and
  wet nurses, and animal milk after they were weaned. Cow's milk was the
  most common milk. The Wikipedia article on Medieval Cuisine adds, Plain fresh milk was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick,
  and was usually reserved for the very young or elderly. Peasants were more likely to drink milk than wealthy adults and it had other uses too: milk was used for a lot of cooking, even on days when fasting

What mysterious Flemish peasant activity is depicted in this painting?,"The question is: Q: What mysterious Flemish peasant activity is depicted in this painting? and one guess was: Q: There is this activity he depicts in the background... It looks like shooting arrows at a pole - but that doesn't seem to make much sense. And curiously, this is exactly it. The group is playing a game: shooting at a popinjay: Popinjay or Papingo (signifying a painted bird), also called pole archery, is a shooting sport that can be performed with either rifles or archery equipment. The object of popinjay is to knock artificial birds off their perches. […] The archery form, called staande wip[circular reference] in Flemish language, is popular in Belgium […] With Wikipedia bringing us two pictures as examples, first Tir à l'arc au papegai: [ and the following picture 'Popinjay mast for archery in Havré Belgium' as an example:  This example in turn matches the echo master Bruegel himself presents us with, this time unused for sports and fun, just standing there in the background, in the painting ""Hunters in the Snow""  (empty field, vertically centred, extreme right):  zoomed in:  Two more Wikimedia commons pictures with a more matching configuration of shooters compared to the painting:   and how it evolved:  This solution is confirmed by: It is the calendar’s festivity of carnival in Gloomy Day that balances out the prudent tasks of early spring: at the right, the little carnival king in his printed paper crown watches the adults happily eating waffles, while in the opposite corner of the scene, down in the village, another family dances in the street outside an inn. In the next remaining scene of the series, Hay Harvest (June/July […]), the festive moment is very distant and yet, characteristically, fairly central on the panel: on a village green, people have gathered for a competition involving shooting at a popinjay on a pole. This pole also stood in an empty, snow-covered village green beyond the frozen ponds in Hunters, one of the echoes in the series that gives a sense not that we see the same place, but that every place we see is somehow archetypal, universal. In Hay Harvest Bruegel gestures to the universality of the view by structuring his composition as a clear echo of the ‘world landscapes’ of Joachim Patinir, some forty years earlier, with the colour scheme moving carefully from foreground brown to green to distant blue, the rather choppy sense of space where roads fail to connect individual features, and the great inhabited rock formations jutting suddenly upward from pleasant farmland. — Elizabeth Alice Honig: ""Pieter Bruegel and the Idea of Human Nature"", Renaissance Lives, Reaktion Books: London, 2019.

Has there ever been a cold war other than between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.?,"The Great Game, fought between Britain and Russia from 1830 to 1895, is a very close analogue. Like the US-Soviet Cold War, the two powers competed for dominance in Central Asia through a full spectrum of avenues including diplomacy, commerce, and proxies.  The Anglo-Russian rivalry led to several conflicts in the Central Asian region such as the Siege of Herat (by Persia acting as proxy for Russia) and the Second Anglo-Afghan War (by Britain to secure Afghanistan against Russia), but did not lead to direct action between the two Great Powers in the area. Russia and Britain did end up at war in the Crimean War of 1856, but that was in relation to the Ottoman Empire rather than the Great Game. Moreover, the two powers has not engaged in direct conflict again since then (barring the Allied intervention during Russian Civil War in 1919), so the Anglo-Russo ""cold war"" can be regarded to have started in 1856 through to the end of the Great Game."
Why didn't the USA move to the left after WWII? [closed],"It's probably too simplistic to say ""the rest of the world jumped to the Left"". That's not really the case. It's also pretty simplistic to say the U.S. ""lurched to the right"" - what does this mean in practical terms? The right wing/left wing paradigm is in of itself a simplistic paradigm that often obfuscates more than it illuminates. It also ignores the domestic political contexts in these nations that supposedly jumped to the left. I'm sure people had their own reasons for their voting intentions. What we can say is that there are a couple of reasons why the Americans have traditionally favoured liberal capitalistic politics. In short there was not a single root cause for this but a number of existing and emerging factors that would have contributed to voter intentions. But did the United States really lurch to the right? What is ""right"" in this context? By what yardstick do we measure ""rightness""? This is the problem with the right-wing left-wing paradigm - it doesn't explain a lot and tends to obfuscate more complicated political realities."
How do we know baroque art depicted obese ladies because of a different ideal of beauty?,"Art does not exist in a vacuum, but is rather only one part of the historical record. Just as people comment on our modern standard of beauty today, so does early modern writers on theirs. Fortunately, Baroque art dates from a recent enough period that the historical record is extensive. For example, a 17th century commentary on a Van Dyck portrait of a heavier women states: William Sanderson in the treatise Graphice, published in 1658, noted that a beautiful woman was to have ""a noble neck, round rising, full and fat . . . brawny arm of good flesh. Such a lady possesses a goodly plump fat."" Wind, Barry. A Foul and Pestilent Congregation: Images of Freaks in Baroque Art. Routledge, 2018. Beyond artistic contexts, we also find examples of beauty being explicitly attributed to body fat: The use of fat is . . . It fills up the empty spaces between the Muscles, Vessels, and Skin, and consequently renders the Body smooth, white, soft, fair, and beautiful . . . Persons in a Consumption and decrepit old women are deformed for want of Fat. Bartholin, Thomas, Caspar Bartholin, and Johannes Walaeus. Bartholinus Anatomy: Made from the Precepts of His Father, and from the Observations of All Modern Anatomists. John Streater. Historians, on the basis of information like this, therefore argue that people of the period - at least in some countries - considered it desirable for women to have a bit of plump.  As for ""rationalisation"" - of course, you can definitely make the case that they only considered chubbiness beautiful because of the association with wealth. However, does that necessarily invalidate their standard of beauty? I believe this delves into a philosophical realm over how beauty should be defined, which is beyond the scope of history."

How did the Nazis plan to defeat America during World War II?,"No, Hitler had no plan for defeating the US outright. However, the Germans had been fighting against the US for quite some time in the Battle of the Atlantic, since US escorts would take convoys partway across and defend them against U-Boats.  So the US neutrality was very strained already. And when the US entered the war, the Germans at once sent U-Boats into US and Caribbean waters where the ships were not convoyed or escorted and the shore lights not blacked out and had a field day sinking these ships for a considerable period.  So there were some advantages to the Germans to the new situation."
"Is the photograph ""England’s Revenge in India"" real, staged, or fake?","It seems to be the painting Suppression of the Indian Revolt by the English, a painting by the Russian artist Vasily Vereshchagin c. 1884 According to the annotation on Wikipedia: It anachronistically depicts the events of 1857 with soldiers wearing
(then current) uniforms of the late 19th century. The ""photograph"" originally appeared in a 1941 Nazi book titled Raubstaat England (""Robber State England""). It is one of a collection of propaganda images that was published in a collection titled Visual Nazi Propaganda (Artwork in magazines) by 'Hagur'. That particular image, together with the text from the 1941 publication, is on page 107. I've found a number of sites, like this one about an exhibition at Tate Britain, that reproduce the picture, and describe it simply as a ""black-and-white reproduction"" of Vasily Vereshchagin's painting. The photogravure image used in Raubstaat England may have been taken from this print in the Library of Congress Prints and Photos Collection produced by the American Art Association of New York. If so, they were probably using it in breech of copyright, but given the scale of Nazi crimes during the 1940's ... The method of execution Blowing from a gun was certainly used by the British in India, and also by the Portuguese and even the Mughal Empire. We know that it was used on convicted rebels in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. However, British Army field uniforms in 1857 were indeed very different from those depicted in the painting. The East India Company was formally dissolved, and its ruling powers in India transferred to the British Crown by the Government of India Act 1858. The archive from the Picture Post is published online and is searchable. I have searched from 1938 - 1940 and could not find the image. Searching for the picture by title and by artist obtained no results. It is worth noting that the Picture Post was a liberal, anti-Fascist publication which had campaigned against the persecution of Jews by Nazi Germany since it was founded in 1938. It is entirely possible that this was propaganda directed against both the British and the magazine."
Why did Greeks and Romans dilute their wine?,"Well alcohol does have a strong anti-bacterial effect,and adding water to wine was a way to create more drink as there was very little clean drinking water. During the fermentation process many microbes die, eventually the yeast too dies in the anaerobic environment. I think adding water to wine and letting the two mix for a while would kill a significant percentage of the microbes, perhaps enough to make a safer drink.  Also because everyone, including young children, drank wine all the time from the beginning of the day until night, dilution was important in order to prevent the people from getting to drunk by the end of the day. In effect, the reliance on wine for hydration meant dilution could kill two birds with one stone.  NPR has a very interesting and informative article where they interview Paul Lukacs and his new wine history book. He talks about the necessity of wine dilution according to his research.

When and how did people begin to consider slavery immoral?,"As @Luke states, there seems to have been a tipping point in the 19th century; I'd have dated it a few years earlier, and I'd have located it in England; Britain started out as a major participant in the slave trade (more slaves went to British possessions in the Caribbean than to the US colonies).  I've edited in a few comments with credit to the original authors with the intent of preserving them from the beasts that roam SE and consume comments like bon-bons. The redoubtable P. Geerkens draws our attention to 1772: Somerset v Stewart, 1772, where the judgement says, in part: It [the state of slavery] is so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive [ie statute] law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from the decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged. Sometime between 1780's and 1830's there was a major shift in perception and values.  I would point to the Quaker AntiSlavery committees and William Wilberforce as representatives of that shift.   The British campaign to abolish the slave trade is generally considered to have begun in the 1780s with the establishment of the Quakers' antislavery committees, and their presentation to Parliament of the first slave trade petition in 1783.[53][54] The same year, Wilberforce, while dining with his old Cambridge friend Gerard Edwards,[55] met Rev. James Ramsay, a ship's surgeon who had become a clergyman on the island of St Christopher (later St Kitts) in the Leeward Islands, and a medical supervisor of the plantations there. What Ramsay had witnessed of the conditions endured by the slaves, both at sea and on the plantations, horrified him. Returning to England after fifteen years, he accepted the living of Teston, Kent in 1781, and there met Sir Charles Middleton, Lady Middleton, Thomas Clarkson, Hannah More and others, a group that later became known as the Testonites.[56] Interested in promoting Christianity and moral improvement in Britain and overseas, they were appalled by Ramsay's reports of the depraved lifestyles of slave owners, the cruel treatment meted out to the enslaved, and the lack of Christian instruction provided to the slaves.[57] With their encouragement and help, Ramsay spent three years writing An essay on the treatment and conversion of African slaves in the British sugar colonies, which was highly critical of slavery in the West Indies. The book, published in 1784, was to have an important impact in raising public awareness and interest, and it excited the ire of West Indian planters who in the coming years attacked both Ramsay and his ideas in a series of pro-slavery tracts. Wikipedia summary of William Wilberforce Mr. Quinsey cites 1793  As I understand it, in 1793 Ontario was the first place in the British Empire to ban slavery (albeit grandfathered). See Lt Gov John Simcoe's 1793 ""Act to prevent the further introduction of slaves and to limit the term of contract for servitude within this province"". The question is far larger; books could and have been written on the subject, but I hope this pointer is useful in setting up further research. Update: Valladolid debate is an earlier event that some cite as the beginning of anti- slavery; I discovered it through the In Our Time podcast, although as the podcast relates, this is not an unqualified attack on slavery - reality is somewhat more complex."
"Was Napoleon as short as ""common knowledge"" states?","According to this page which cites Steckel, Richard H. and Roderick Floud (eds.) ""Health and Welfare during Industrialization."" Chicago: University of Chicago (1997) as a source, the average height of a Frenchman between 1800 and 1820 was 164.1 cm. According to the French historian, Marcel Dunan (1963): ""If one refers to the Memoirs of Marchand, t. II, 1955, p.338 ""the total height of the crown to heel is 5 feet, 2 inches, 4 lines"",
or (French measures) 32.47 cm X 5 + 2.7 X 2 + 0.22 X 4 = 1m 68.6. These measures have been taken by Antonmarchi helped by Marchand.

While an original source detailing Dunan's claims appears to be difficult to find, he is cited often in relation to Napoleon's history.

What was the typical peasant's diet like in Europe during the High Middle Ages?,"Here is one noting: The European medieval diet was largely determined by social class. For the majority of the of the people, peasants, a large portion of their daily diet was made up of grains such as wheat, rye, oats or barley(carbohydrates). The grains were boiled whole in a soup or stew, ground into flour and made into bread, or malted and brewed into ale. Estimates from the late Middle Ages indicated that a gallon of ale a day was not unusual, but the actual alcohol in the drink was low. Protein was usually provided legumes such as beans, peas or lentils, fish where available, or on very rare occasions, meat such as poultry, pork, or beef. Additional nutrients were provided by seasonal vegetables and fruits. The peasant's diet rates high on modern nutrition standards. But seasonal fluctuations in food availability and poor harvests often caused long periods of very poor nutrition. From Jeffrey L. Singman, Daily Life in Medieval Europe, Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1999, P. 54 - 55."

  Isidorus the Younger, nephew of Isidore of Miletus, who used lighter
  materials and elevated the dome by ""30 feet""[18] (about 6.25 meters or
  20.5 feet)[clarification needed] – giving the building its current interior height of 55.6 meters (182 ft).[22] Moreover, Isidorus
  changed the dome type, erecting a ribbed dome with pendentives, whose
  diameter lay between 32.7 and 33.5 m.[18] Under Justinian's orders,
  eight Corinthian columns were disassembled from Baalbek, Lebanon, and
  shipped to Constantinople around 560.[23] This reconstruction, giving
  the church its present 6th-century form, was completed in 562. Not before the fall of the western Roman Empire, but (as per comments) early medieval."
"Why did the Germans use the Enigma machine rather than the far superior ""Lorenz"" cipher machine?","The Enigma was portable. You could carry one on a small submarine, or in an armoured battalion headquarters, and they weren't a problem when an airfield had to be moved in a hurry. They didn't require mains electricity, or special communications hardware - messages were sent and received by hand using Morse code - and they were believed to be secure, provided they were used properly, and the key lists and rotors were kept out of the hands of the enemy. It was also economical to procure, and the basic technology was well-proven.  By contrast, the Lorenz did require mains electricity and special communications equipment, and was only really suited to a permanent headquarters. It was known to be more secure, but the Enigma was thought to be sufficiently secure for everything except the highest level communications, so that's what the Lorenz was used for by the German Army. It was also expensive, and complicated by the standards of the time, which made it only usable in situations like a permanent headquarters, where skilled technicians could be available.  The Lorenz was also decrypted by the Allies, from mid-1942, after considerable amounts of previous work. It is not as widely known as the Enigma decryption, because the Enigma has a cooler name, and was much more tactically important. The Lorenz gave strategic-level information, which appeals less to journalists and movie-makers.  The Siemens and Halske T52 family were another family of enciphered teleprinters, used by the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine. They weren't compatible with the Lorenz. The a, b and c versions were weak enough to be broken by hand, but the d and e versions were stronger than the Lorenz. The British cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park broke into these ciphers, but didn't put as much effort into them as the Lorenz. This was because the Luftwaffe often re-transmitted messages in ciphers that were already broken, or much easier to attack. Also, reading the Lorenz used by the German Army would usually tell you what the Germans intended doing. "
Has the United States ever had a non-Christian President?,"Only two US presidents haven't self-described themselves as being Christians to date: Lincoln (whose case is murky) and Jefferson (who rejected the idea of the divinity of Jesus and became a deist later in life). [Edit: but see JMS's better answer, as it has more specific details and things appear murkier still.] If you scan through the linked list, you'll see a further note on Andrew Johnson, who was nominally Christian but is considered to be one of the least religious presidents to date. If you look at actual practice, the current occupant of the White House might be a good addition to that list. While Presbyterian Christian on paper, Trump exhibits a laundry list of behaviors that, depending on viewpoint, might disqualify him from being considered devout. He notoriously doesn't go to church, and he even got censured by the Presbyterian Church for his stance on immigrants and refugees."
Why did navies abandon armour?,"Analysts concluded that battleships were killed by carrier aircraft, not by other battleships. This conclusion might have been influenced by several factors: And as Jon points out, battleships didn't have the same armor over all faces. Early battleships just armored their waterlines and their guns. High angle fire made deck armor necessary and torpedoes made underwater side armor necessary. There was no comparable protection for the underwater underside. Torpedoes come not just from submarines but also from torpedo bombers. "
Has any country ever diverted an international flight in order to arrest a wanted person?,"By Googling ""Snowden""+""Ryanair Belarus"" I've found four more relevant examples. One story from 2010 seems to be a direct equivalent to what happened in Belarus: Taalaibek Turumbekov, deputy chief of Kyrgyzstan Aba Joldoru, the national airline, told RFE/RL that a plane flying from Dubai was made to land in the southern Iranian city of Bandar Abbas on February 23, escorted by two Iranian jets.
Iranian authorities announced on February 23 that that they had seized the leader of the Sunni rebel group Jundallah, Abdolmalek Rigi, on a flight from Dubai to Bishkek. The other is only tangentially related because the plane never left Ukraine: MINSK, October 22 2016. Belarus has protested against Ukraine's actions to return by force on October 21 a Belavia plane to Kiev. The republic's Foreign Ministry summoned Ukraine's Charge d'Affairs in Belarus Valery Dzhigun, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said in a statement released on Saturday.
The Belarusian company said the dispatcher told the captain ""in case of disobeying the order, fighters will take off."" As the plane landed at the Ukrainian airport, the local law enforcers detained a passenger, who is a citizen of Armenia. After the refueling, the plane left for Minsk and later on landed there safely. Later on, the law enforcers released the man and he took an evening flight to Minsk. Finally, Turkey forced a Syrian plane to land in 2012 but that seems to have been motivated by military cargo rather than arresting someone on board: Moscow has accused Ankara of endangering Russian lives after Turkey forced a Syrian passenger plane to land and seized what it suspected was military equipment being ferried from Russia to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Military jets escorted the Damascus-bound Airbus A-320,which was carrying around 30 passengers from Moscow, into Ankara airport late on Wednesday after Turkey received intelligence that it was carrying “non-civilian cargo”. There was also a controversial story involving the interception of an Egyptian jet by the US Airforce but that involved a chartered plane rather than a scheduled flight."
Did the leaflets from the US to Hiroshima/Nagasaki civilians on bombing cities reduce the civilian casualties of the two nuclear bombs in August 1945?,"There is a 1946 book by John Hersey, Hiroshima, which is an excellent compilation of personal testimonies from Hiroshima residents following the atomic bombing. Although it doesn’t mention Allied leafleting specifically, there’s a few important things it indicates about civilian perceptions of the threat at the time, namely It was abundantly clear to Hiroshima residents at the time, from the lack of conventional American firebombing, that the Americans were planning something terrible and that it was best to stay away from the city if possible. For example, city doctors were already turning away patients since they didn’t want to be responsible for evacuating them during what they expected to be a massive imminent fire raid. According to Hersey, at least 135,000 of the city’s ~380,000 residents had already evacuated by the time August 6th rolled around. Nobody (who wasn’t a government nuclear physicist) was expecting an atomic attack, since nobody knew what an atom bomb even was. Everyone was expecting just a scaled up firebombing. The Hiroshima municipal government had been preparing for this for some time (since they, like everyone else, were expecting an attack), to the point of drafting local teenage girls to clear fire lanes to nearby rivers. So the type of person who would be unfazed by threats — that is, most people still in the city, since the jumpier people had already evacuated — felt confident that the city could withstand a large American attack. Since July at least, American pilots had been using Lake Biwa (just northeast of Hiroshima) as a rendezvous point, so there were basically always American bombers in the sky, which meant that Hiroshima residents were always hearing air raid sirens. Since the bombers were simply flying over the city on their way to bomb some other city, this lead to a great deal of alarm fatigue among city residents. The night before the US dropped its atomic bomb, the city’s air raid warning system detected about 200 B-29s approaching the city, which forced a lot of grumpy people to get up in the middle of the night and run to shelter. It was a false alarm, so naturally even fewer people than usual were in the mood to take cover when the real bomb came the next morning. Since everyone was expecting a scaled-up firebombing, they assumed that any such attack would have to involve many many bombers. The air raid sirens went off any time they spotted at least one plane, but city residents had learned to distinguish between “harmless” reconnaissance flights and “dangerous” large formations of bombers. It also didn’t help that the Enola Gay came around the same time that an American weather plane (which was known to city residents, since it triggered the alarm at the same time every morning) made its regularly-scheduled pass. To summarize, most people already knew some sort of attack was coming, but they probably wouldn’t have understood what an atomic attack meant, even if you explained it to them. They had also been hearing false warning after false warning, so those who had decided to stay probably wouldn’t have believed it anyway."
Where did Hitler get the funds to invest in economic development programs such as the autobahn when the German economy was in a depression?,"The funds for the Autobahn project came from the Reinhardt Program, a credit finance scheme originated by Kurt von Schleicher. The contractors who built the highways were paid not in Reichsmark, but with debentures issued by the Reich Finance Ministry which could be redeemed at a discount at certain banks that formed a work creation consortium. These banks, in turn, could redeem the credits with the Reichsbank. The Reichsbank, which collected pools of these instruments, was promised that they would be honored by the Reich Finance Ministry on a fixed schedule guaranteed by taxes. So, in essence, the Autobahn was financed with a sort of a bond. The first Reinhardt Program which was used for the initial finance of the Autobahn had only a limited amount credits issued under it. In 1934, further work creation projects were instituted under a second Reinhardt program. In this program, the credits were generated the same way, but instead of delivering them to the contractors, they were just paid directly as Reichsmarks. Also, the program was reduced to just being a subsidy to private investment, not full financing. The Reich Finance Ministry (RFM) was still responsible for reimbursing the Reichsbank for the amounts incurred. You also asked about armaments. Financing re-armament was not considered ""economic revitalization"" by the German leaders. Unlike the two Reinhardt programs, which were highly publicized and involved popular participation, the rearmament financing was undertaken relatively quietly, almost secretely. To fund rearmament, they adopted the same basic scheme from the first Reinhardt program: a controlling agency issued bonds, these bonds were delivered to the industrialists as payment, the Reichsbank redeemed the bonds, and the government promised to reimburse the Reichsbank on a fixed schedule from tax proceeds. The agency used in this case was not a government agency, as in the Reinhardt program, but a newly created shadow entity called Metallurgische Forschungsgesellschaft (Mefo or MEFO) which was capitalized by the several large industrial concerns, such as the Krupp steel works, that stood to benefit by it. Contractors were paid in Mefo bills which could be cashed in with the Reichsbank at any time, but were often held because they paid interest. Further information on the economy of Germany during the 1933-1938 period can be found in the books ""The Wages of Destruction"" by Adam Tooze, ""Hitler's Economy: Nazi Work Creation Programs, 1933-1936"" by Dan Silverman and ""War and Economy in the Third Reich"" by R.J. Overy."
Where did Asian Americans go to school during the 'separate but equal' era?,"Short Answer This really depended on several factors, including state, city, time, Asian origin and even international politics. Local housing regulations also influenced the schools that Asian Americans attended. Asians were sometimes treated more favourable than African Americans, sometimes the same and sometimes even worse. Thus, options could include either a segregated or desegregated public or private school, or home schooling. In short, it's complicated. Details Chinese in mid to late 19th century California were confronted with discrimination to varying degrees. Children might be able to attend 'white' schools if the white parents didn't object, but local laws sometimes made no mention of Asian children, instead focusing on segregated schools for Indigenous and African Americans. Home schooling was one option for Asian Americans, private schools another. It was not until 1885 that the first Chinese public school for elementary ages was established. Varying and frequently changing policies continued into the early 20th century: During the early decades of the twentieth-century, school segregation
policies affected Asian Americans differentially depending on their
specific heritage, geographic locale, and the prevailing social
climate. In 1900 89,863 people of Chinese birth or descent lived in
the United States, most on the West Coast. Source: US Dept. of the Interior, 'Racial Desegregation in Public Education in the United States' (2000) California accounted for a large percentage of Asian-origin residents and even within this state policies varied. Note this interesting example: Living with his family outside of Chinatown, Dr. Wong Him enrolled his
daughter Katie in a neighborhood school, but a year later, Katie was
instructed to attend the Chinese Primary School. The doctor filed suit
noting that the San Francisco school board permitted blacks, American
Indians, and Japanese to attend local schools while targeting only
Chinese for discriminatory treatment. In Wong Him v. Callahan (1903),
the U.S. District Court disagreed and upheld the idea of “separate but
equal” as stipulated in the school code. Source: US Dept. of the Interior In 1905, the San Francisco School Board ruled that Our children should not be placed in any position where their youthful
impressions may be affected by association with pupils of the
Mongolian race. The discrimination against Chinese was soon also applied to others: In response to the challenge of changing demographics more than a
century ago, the San Francisco School Board established a segregated
Chinese Primary School for Chinese children to attend, including those
who were American-born. By the turn-of-the century after Japanese
immigrants had settled in the wake of Chinese exclusion, the School
Board also applied the Chinese segregation policy to Japanese
students. International politics then dictated a reversal of the decision to desegregate Japanese students: Japanese American parents refused to comply, filed suit (Aoki v.
Deane, 1907), and appealed to their homeland by reporting their
mistreatment to Japanese newspapers and the consulate (Wollenberg,
1976). Interested in maintaining healthy relations with the Empire of
Japan, President Theodore Roosevelt intervened on behalf of the
Japanese and forced the school board to relent (Daniels, 1992; Wollenberg, 1976). Source: Joy Ann Williamson, Lori Rhodes and Michael Dunson, 'A Selected History of Social Justice in Education'. In 'Review of Research in Education
Vol. 31, Difference, Diversity, and Distinctiveness in Education and Learning' (2007) However, segregation was not universally applied. The amended 1921 California school law stated The governing body of a school district shall have power to exclude
children of filthy or vicious habits, or children suffering from
contagious or infectious diseases, and also to establish separate
schools for Indian children and for children of Chinese, Japanese, or
Mongolian parentage. When such schools are established, Indian
children or children of Chinese, Japanese, or Mongolian parentage must
not be admitted into any other school. Cited in US Dept. of the Interior However, only four towns (Walnut Grove, Courtland, Florin, and Isleton) duly
segregated Japanese and other Asian American youth into “oriental”
schools, all four were small farming outposts in the San Joaquin River
Delta of northern California. Source: US Dept. of the Interior In mid-1920s San Francisco, local authorities came under pressure from Italian Americans especially to build a secondary school for the increasing number of Chinese children. Francisco Junior High in North Beach, near Chinatown, did not accept Chinese students. Then, After a year of contentious Board
of Education meetings, Chinese American students won the right to enroll in Francisco largely
because the city lacked the money to pay for a segregated junior high
school in Chinatown. Source: Charlotte Brooks, 'Alien Neighbors, Foreign Friends: Asian Americans, Housing, and the Transformation of Urban California' (2009) Meanwhile, in poor areas in pre-WWII Los Angeles, Asian children might attend the same schools as Mexican, Greek, Italian, African and Jewish Americans. In more affluent areas, however, when Japanese Americans placed their children in the public school system, white resistance
mounted; ...If the Nisei* school-age population grew too large in such
areas, white parents knew to invoke the state constitution, which
allowed the segregation of Asian American students in separate
classrooms or separate schools. Source: Brooks Nisei: US-born children of immigrants from Japan."" Information on the northern states and midwestern states is scarce, perhaps because the number Asians was low. Atlantic City High School in New Jersey appears to have accepted Asians as the writer George Kin Leung graduated from there in 1918. Segregation was the norm in the south but, again, laws were not exactly the same everywhere, and often existing rules or laws were challenged: While laws pertaining to school segregation for Asian Americans varied
throughout the South, battles between school districts and Asian
American parents over their right to send their children to white
schools resulted in local, state, and federal courts determining the
“correct” race of Asian Americans for segregation purposes. Asian
Americans did not readily accept the courts’ decisions, however, and
actively pursued their rights to send their children to white schools
through lawsuits and appeals. There was, though, often disagreement among whites as to segregation policies concerning African and Asian Americans: some believed African Americans should be treated more favourably than Asians, others held the opposite view. U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan made a striking
comment that reminds us of the role Asians and Asian Americans have
always played in the U.S.’s otherwise binary, Black-white racial
system. Justice Harlan’s famous dissent against the “separate but
equal” doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) contrasts the loyal and
patriotic African American with the Chinese, a “race so different from
our own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens
of the United States,” and goes on to lament how the Chinese could
ride in a railcar in Louisiana with whites while Blacks remained
segregated under force of law.2 Jim Crow segregation would regularly
group Asians alongside whites, yet others like Harlan saw whites and
African Americans as united against the intrusion of these “strangers
from a different shore.” Concerning Brown v. Board of Education, In 1954, the Supreme Court declared racially segregated schools
unconstitutional in its famous Brown v. Board of Education decision.
African Americans initiated the case, but the decision affected all
other racial and ethnic groups similarly situated. Source: Joy Ann Williamson, Lori Rhodes and Michael Dunson Although a landmark decision, it did not immediately change the situation, and some districts moved much more slowly than others. Further, as reirab points out in a comment below, the ruling did not apply to private schools. Thus, in 1976 the Supreme Court issued another ruling on segregation in schools. There was a landmark decision in Runyon v. McCrary, ruling that even private,
nonsectarian schools that denied admission to students on the basis of
race violated federal civil rights laws."
Why didn't Aboriginal Australians invent agriculture?,"Everyone else is referencing Guns Germs and Steel, but I'm going to give the answer from The Biggest Estate on Earth by Bill Gammage.  Gammage suggests that not only did Indigenous Australians discover a form of agriculture, they developed an agricultural technology that Europeans didn't even realise was possible.  The development of technology is not necessarily a linear progression with cavemen at the bottom and Englishmen at the top, but the early English settlers of Australia were sure it was. So they were unable to see the evidence of indigenous technology even when it was used right before their eyes. One settler (in the east, which is not a desert) might wonder at how ""well gee, this landscape looks more like an English lord's estate than a natural wilderness"" and the next day joke ""gosh the natives love setting fires everywhere they're so funny"" and not realise that, in fact, one of these things actually explains the other. The landscape looked like a park because Indigenous Australians controlled the entire ecosystem by using lots of different kinds of fire: different patterns of burning, different heat intensity, different season, different length of time between burnings. All of these factors change which plants will thrive in an area. Grass recovers faster from destruction by fire than forest does, but trees are more resistant to low intensity fire than grass. Some native plants actually cannot breed unless their seed pods are roasted. And so on. Which animals live where will depend on the amount and type of vegetation, and of course fires can be used to drive wild animals between locations too. In this way they were able to control which plants and animals could live where over vast areas of land with relatively little labour. And they used this to make nice grassland to walk through, with occasional trees for shade, and combinations of edible plants in close proximity that would not naturally be found together. They left patches of forest cover, and trees along the river bank, to cultivate the conditions for prey animals to live, which they would hunt. Over long periods of time they would be able to move the patches of forest as they saw fit.  Arguably this makes the entire land their farm. Europeans blundered in and thought they didn't have farms, but what they really didn't have (aside from the obvious, like ploughs and fences) was the belief that any part of the world wasn't everybody's farm. Since we came in and stopped them setting fires, some areas have become dense forest now that weren't forest at all in the 1700s. The patterns of vegetation in 1788 were in many places more man made than true wilderness. And I'm sure people would sometimes spread the seeds of plants they liked to eat, too. They just didn't tend them in little plots with fences.  What appeared to be natural bridges created by trees falling over streams could be created deliberately by digging out the roots on the river-facing side of the tree. Another way they controlled the landscape in a way that was invisible to European settlers. (Here ends the part I got from The Biggest Estate on Earth; now for some other random observations about indigenous innovation)  Other cultures invented mnemonic devices like epic poetry to preserve cultural knowledge before literacy. Indigenous Australians invented an even more advanced form of this mnemonic technology; their songlines are songs that tell you how to get from A to B (including major landmarks and sources of food and water along the way) in the format of a religious narrative that might also teach other cultural lessons, and the routes cross so the combination of multiple songlines forms a complete 2D map of your people's territory. I think that's actually really clever. Imagine how great it would be if all the parts of your brain that you use to remember pop song lyrics were instead holding a detailed and accurate map! "
Was there ever a treaty between 2 entities with significantly different translations to the detriment of one party?,"The Treaty of Waitangi (1840) between the British and Maori chiefs of North Island, New Zealand This treaty has ""long been the subject of debate"". Wikipedia's Treaty of Waitangi article goes into these differences in some details, noting that: The most critical difference between the texts revolves around the
  interpretation of three Māori words: kāwanatanga (governorship), which
  is ceded to the Queen in the first article; rangatiratanga
  (chieftainship) not mana (leadership) (which was stated in the
  Declaration of Independence just five years before the Treaty was
  signed), which is retained by the chiefs in the second; and taonga
  (property or valued possessions), which the chiefs are guaranteed
  ownership and control of, also in the second article. Few Māori
  involved with The Treaty negotiations understood the concepts of
  sovereignty or ""governorship"", as they were used by 19th-century
  Europeans, and lawyer Moana Jackson has stated that ""ceding mana or
  sovereignty in a treaty was legally and culturally incomprehensible in
  Māori terms"". More on this treaty can be found at the New Zealand History site where there is this similar, but perhaps clearer, summary: The Treaty in Māori was deemed to convey the meaning of the English
  version, but there are important differences. Most significantly, the
  word ‘sovereignty’ was translated as ‘kawanatanga’ (governance). Some
  Māori believed they were giving up government over their lands but
  retaining the right to manage their own affairs. The English version
  guaranteed ‘undisturbed possession’ of all their ‘properties’, but the
  Māori version guaranteed ‘tino rangatiratanga’ (full authority) over
  ‘taonga’ (treasures, which may be intangible). Māori understanding was
  at odds with the understanding of those negotiating the Treaty for the
  Crown, and as Māori society valued the spoken word, explanations given
  at the time were probably as important as the wording of the document. For some background, Lieutenant-Governor William Hobson had the task of securing British
  sovereignty over New Zealand. He relied on the advice and support of,
  among others, James Busby, the British Resident in New Zealand. The
  Treaty was prepared in just a few days. Missionary Henry Williams and
  his son Edward translated the English draft into Māori overnight on 4
  February. About 500 Māori debated the document for a day and a night
  before it was signed on 6 February. Hobson and others stressed the Treaty’s benefits while playing down
  the effects of British sovereignty on rangatiratanga (chiefly
  authority). Reassured that their status would be strengthened, many
  chiefs supported the agreement. Images of the treaty can be found here - Waitangi treaty copy (Maori) and here - Waikato-Manukau treaty copy (English)."
Did the King of Siam offer war elephants to the Union during the Civil War?,"Yes and No. What appears to be true is that the King of Siam did send a letter offering a herd of elephants to the US President in 1861. According to the US National Archives King Mongkut said that he had heard that the United States had no elephants. As a remedy, he offered a gift of elephants—several pairs of them—that could be ""turned loose in forests and increase till there be large herds."" The elephants would be useful in the unsettled parts of the United States, he continued, ""since elephants being animals of great size and strength can bear burdens and travel through uncleared woods and matted jungles where no carriage and cart roads have yet been made."" The letter was mistakenly addressed to Lincoln's predecessor James Buchanan and makes no mention of war elephants. Lincoln responded in 1862 declining the offer: Great and Good Friend: I have received Your Majesty's two letters of the date of February 14th., 1861. I appreciate most highly Your Majesty's tender of…a stock from which a supply of elephants might be raised on our own soil. This Government would not hesitate to avail itself of so generous an offer if the object were one which could be made practically useful in the present condition of the United States. Our political jurisdiction, however, does not reach a latitude so low as to favour the multiplication of the elephant, and steam…has been our best and most efficient agent of transportation in internal commerce. Conclusion:
Yes, the King of Siam did offer elephants to the US during the Civil War.  No, they were not offered to aid in the war effort but rather to be beasts of burden in unpopulated areas of the country."
Why did English adopt Kamikaze (神風) as a loanword instead of Tokko (特攻) during/after WWII?,"It's possible we adopted the term Kamikaze because that's what we heard from the Japanese themselves.  The term was apparently used by Tokyo Rose on her broadcasts to the American troops.  The book Lucky Lady: The World War II Heroics of the USS Santa Fe and Franklin,By Steve Jackson, states she declared the Japanese had a new  ""superweapon...the kamikaze...the divine wind"". This broadcast was dated Nov 25, 1944.  The term was what the GI's and sailors heard over their radios, in English, not the full unit designations. And that's what stuck in their minds."
"When did ""&"" stop being taught alongside the alphabet?","Ironically, it seems to coincide with the addition of the very word 'ampersand' to the dictionaries. But the process took a while to complete and a precise date seems to be undeterminable, not in the least because it wasn't universally adopted ever. The character got its corrupted name around 1837 and from then on lost popularity so much that by the late 1800s it was already distant memory for most. A real watershed for its use in alphabet learning early readers' books seems to be 1857: Even as late as 1857, & was printed in some early-reader books as the 27th letter of the alphabet. And it is the ampersand’s status as a letter that gave it the name by which we know it today, a name that  first appeared in English in about 1835.

""McGuffey's eclectic primer"" neither from 1881 nor from 1867 does not have it,
""Chambers' primer, or, First book for children"" from 1852 has it. Not really implausible speculations and reasoning around that to be found at How and why has the ampersand been removed from the alphabet?  When Old English was discarded in favor of the modern English were are now familiar with, the ampersand maintained its status of “member of the alphabet” (to coin a phrase) to a degree, with some regions and dialects opting to include it until the mid-1800s. Except that it was not yet called an ampersand.  The & sign was, rather, referred to simply as “and” — which made reciting the alphabet awkward. As Dictionary.com notes, it was (and is) odd to say “X Y Z and.” So, they didn’t.  Instead, our lexicon developed another saying: “X, Y, and Z, and by itself, ‘and'” — but instead of saying “by itself,” the Latin phrase per se came into favor.  The result?  “And per se, and,” or, muttered quickly by a disinterested student, “ampersand.” Why the inclusion of the ampersand in the alphabet fell out of use is anyone’s guess, but there is a good chance that credit goes to the ABC song we are most all familiar with — that is, the one which shares its tune with Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star (and borrows from Mozart’s Ah vous dirai-je, Maman). That song was copyrighted in 1835, around the time that the ampersand started falling out of favor with the rest of the ABCs.
–– ""And, the 27th Letter of the Alphabet"", NowIKnow, 2011. And It all begins with the Little Folks learning their ABCs. In the 1830s the alphabet started incorporating the symbol “&” as the 27th letter. From the Dixie Primer for the Little Folks: And In the early 1800s, school children reciting their ABCs concluded the alphabet with the “&”. Since it was awkward to say, “X,Y,Z, and,” students said, “and per se and.” Per se means “by itself,” so the students were basically saying, “X,Y,Z, and by itself and.” By 1837, the “&” sign had entered common English usage as the 27th character of the alphabet. It didn’t take long before the “and per se and” officially appeared in English dictionaries as ampersand. The Scottish people called the word for the symbol “&” epershand, derived from the “et per se and” using the original Latin “et” to refer to the symbol when spoken, instead of the English, “and”.     –– Heather Sanders: ""Twenty Interesting Things About…The Ampersand"", April 10, 2015 Etymological 1837, contraction of and per se and, meaning ""(the character) '&' by itself is 'and' "" (a hybrid phrase, partly in Latin, partly in English). An earlier form of it was colloquial ampassy (1706). The distinction is to avoid confusion with & in such formations as &c., a once common way of writing etc. (the et in et cetera is Latin for ""and""). The letters a, I, and o also formerly (15c.-16c.) were written a per se, etc., especially when standing alone as words.  In old schoolbooks the ampersand was printed at the end of the alphabet and thus by 1880s the word ampersand had acquired a slang sense of ""posterior, rear end, hindquarters."" During the 19th century it then fell out of favour. An early example The name ampezant, occurring above in the same passage with ableselfa, is not the only evidence for a final t instead of the usual d of ampersand. Professor Joynes writes:  ""As to ampersand, my recollection is quite distinct. In my day fifty years ago the sign & always stood at the end of the alphabet, and we recited it as a letter : x, y, z, ampersand. Yet I think we called it rather ampersant or ampersants, without the slightest idea (on the part of pupils or teacher) that it contained any trace of the word and. I was in childhood also familiar with the name izzard""  Mr. George H. Browne of Cambridge informs me that he used to hear his grandfather (a native and resident of Framingham, Mass.) say the  alphabet ending in zed, ampsam. Mr. Browne is not quite sure, at  this distance of time, what the vowel of the second syllable was;  that of the first was œ. Still another form is eppershand, given in  Samuel Ramsey's The English Language and English Grammar,  New York, 1892, p. T04, 1 and well explained as et-per-se-and.

Why does German money from the 1940s not bear Nazi symbols?,"The currency you posted is from an occupied territory, see the related wikipedia link. If you read carefully, it says: Reichskreditkassen on the bottom, Nazi Germany issued these notes in occupied territories which weren't considered to the Reich's territory. Note that these notes had completely different rules than real Reichsmarks, for example they were legal tender only in occupied territories, and couldn't be subject of a negotiation inside the Reich. Also the fact that it was independent from Reichsmarks, it added a layer of protection of real Reichsmarks. For example it could have been inflated separately from real Reichmarks. Take a note: 5 Reichmarks in German territories were minted on silver coins (I have one), not notes, an important difference! Read more interesting facts of your banknote here. I have only a subjective opinion on why didn't they have Swastika, since the webpages only give clues, not definite answers: The occupied territories had their own currency in this form, maybe this was easier to accept as legal tender than Reichsmarks. It was printed very differently to make it easier to separate from real Reichsmarks. Real Reichsmarks were printed approximately 3:4 ratio while occupation Marks were printed on the whole surface. But if you check out other - in-Reich - notes, for some strange reason swastika doesn't seem to be overly used on banknotes unlike on coins."
Where did the Gaels originate?,"This is kind of a wide-ranging question. I'll do my best with it. The Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages consists of Irish Gaelic, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx. It appears to have differentiated in Ireland, the other branches existing due to conquest/immigration. In particular, Scottish Gaelic pretty much completely replaced the Pictish element in Scotland, starting sometime between the 3rd and 6th centuries. There was also, according to the Romans, a movement into Cornwall and Wales, but that doesn't seem to have had a lasting impact. The word Gaelic itself seems to have been an Old Welsh word for ""pirate"" or ""raider"". :-)  Here's a pitcure Wikipedia had showing the divisions of Celtic in the British Isles in the 5th Century. Green is Goidelic, Red is Brythonic, and Blue is Pictish, which eventually got replaced by Goidelic (and then Anglo-Saxon). The earliest historical attestation I could find for Goideic: The oldest written Goidelic language is Primitive Irish, which is
  attested in Ogham inscriptions up to about the 4th century. The forms
  of this speech are very close, and often identical, to the forms of
  Gaulish recorded before and during the Roman Empire. The next stage,
  Old Irish, is found in the margins of Latin religious manuscripts from
  the 6th to the 10th century Going further back, you get your first clue here. Goidelic languages in the 4th century were not all that far removed from the Gaulish being spoken in today's France. Gaulish in turn is an Indo-European language of the Western branch. Indo-European is generally presumed to have been native to somewhere in the eastern european or west asian steppe. So presumably when the Indo-Europeans moved into Western Europe, their language became Celtic (or ""Gaulish""), and when the Gauls moved into the British Isles, their languages became Goidelic in Ireland and Brythonic in England (and perhaps Pictish in Scotland).  
 One correction I should make here though. Galician in Spain is a language cousin to Portugese. It is a Romance language, and doesn't have any closer relation to Celtic languages than any other Romance language does. (How close is a matter of debate. It used to be popular to combine them into a sub-family. Today that idea is out of fashion). The question was probably thinking about the Gallaeci (dang, this gets confusing), who were an ancient continental Celtic people, absorbed by the Romans, who historically had lived in the same area. They and the other Celtiberians shared their respective regions of the Iberian peninsula prior to the Roman era. However, after the Roman Era, there was a movement of Brythonic speakers into the NW of the Iberian peninsula (along with the Brittany peninsula in France), presumably as refugees from Anglo-Saxon conquests of their territory in England. Their settlement Britonia doesn't appear to have lasted very long as a culturally distinct unit*, but it did happen.  * - Their church used the Celtic rite for about 50 years."
Why did the Soviet Union have multiple airplane manufacturers?,"I can't speak to the specifics of the Soviet Union, but I want to address the opening assumption of the question. Generally, Communism believed in economic central planning, with each field being serviced by one ""company"" (to avoid waste). This is untrue of (or at least unnecessary for) both communism and centrally planned economies. A centrally planned economy is one where production, prices, and distribution are set by the government, not by market forces. No monopoly is necessary. Communism does not require a centrally planned economy, but rather is about the ownership of the means of production which covers a wide spectrum of social, political, and economic structures. What you're asking about is the Soviet model. It's important to not use the Soviet model as a stand in for communism. Communism is a very broad set of social, political, and economic philosophies. The Soviet model is a specific, and rather broken, flavor featuring a centrally planned economy, single party control, and powerful committees. The Soviet model is more like an oligarchy masquerading as communism. Two examples of centrally planned economies within the United States are large scale manufacturing for the military and, until very recently, space. The US government is the major buyer of things like aircraft carriers, tanks, nuclear submarines, and heavy launch vehicles. They effectively control what is produced, who it gets distributed to and, somewhat, the price. The US government deliberately doles out contracts to multiple suppliers, even to the point of paying more money, in order to keep multiple suppliers around (also to get the votes of powerful senators by funneling money to their districts). This is to foster competition, prevent a single company from controlling the market, and also as a hedge in case one goes out of business. For example, there were two builders of US Navy submarines, Newport News Shipbuilding and General Dyanamics Electric Boat, but reductions in the US navy's submarine fleet means now there is only one, Electric Boat. Should something happen to General Dynamics this would be put the US's ability to build submarines, a highly specialized skill, in danger."
Why did Europeans (and not people in other regions) dominate oceans?,"Europeans had an incentive to explore the Atlantic because they were dependent on the trade routes which pass through Arab territory. The Arabs and other peoples living in the Middle East made a lot of profit selling luxury goods to Europeans, so cutting out the middle man was very desirable. The Atlantic has currents that make it easier to traverse. Note that all of the colonial super powers border the Atlantic. Like the other poster said, Chinese exploration was halted by a single Emperor. They had built super fleets which Europe simply could not rival at that time.  I would be careful about using Jared Diamond's book as a source, though, because it is heavily disputed."
What do the numbers on this 1960s anti-integration sign mean?,"Short and ""to the point"" answer: Those numbers are just identifiers for various school district organization plans. The digits refer to the number of years a student spends in each ""section"" of a schooling system.
The general notation is A-B-C, where ""A"" is the number of years in primary school (elementary school), ""B"" is the number of years spent in middle/junior high school, and ""C"" is the number of years spent in secondary (high) school. 6-3-3 and 5-3-4 were both fairly common at the time, but recent (proposed) policy changes in the Brooklyn school systems led to confusion and even outrage in the area. More details on the specific meanings of the numbers are included below. That sign is simply mocking the changes, as a ""2-2-2"" system doesn't exist (and is in fact completely nonsensical) and ""?-?-?"" is seemingly a way of asking ""What's next? How much longer are we going to mess with the system, treating our children like pawns in some game of political chess?"". The numbers almost certainly aren't referring to dates or court cases. Detailed answer (the most important details are bolded):
It's important to note that this is the source of the image. The photo was taken on April 14, 1965 and submitted to the Associated Press image library in 2011. The submission notes for the photo read as follows: ""Pickets from the Parents and Taxpayers Association march outside the city Board of Education building in Brooklyn, New York, April 14, 1965. The demonstration was held to protest a report submitted to the board by school superintendent Calvin E. Gross. The report was called a ""blueprint for further action toward quality integrated education."" Two groups picketed the building opposing the report, the other was headed by the Congress of Racial Equality."" If we're hoping to learn more about the specific protest featured in that photo, then this description tells us some pretty useful information. Apparently this crowd was protesting against the ideas of a man called Calvin E. Gross. Gross, according to his obituary featured in the New York Times, was the superintendent of schools in New York city around the time that this photo was taken (particularly, in early 1965). Apparently, he was asked to resign after a storm of criticisms and controveries due to the report he released, referenced in the blockquote. I'm not entirely clear on what exactly this report was, but we can learn a lot about what Calvin Gross was proposing from other information at the time. According to yet another NY Times archive I found, this time dating to mid-late 1964, Gross was fairly vocal about his plans for the integration of segregated schools. On top of unspecified ""proposed steps"", he also intended to immediately pair up ""four sets of elementary schools"", create five additional ""Educational Complexes"", and change up the year sequence of the school districts, namely adding one year to high school (presumably so that the year systems of various segregated schools matched up, in order to ensure a smooth integration). Gross was planning to spend around $4.3 million on all of this. As you can imagine, the vagueness of some of these announcements (as well as the cost) naturally irritated many people who would be affected by the changes. Let's set that aside for a moment and go back to those numbers themselves. Since the image description describes the protest in relation to education troubles, the meaning of the numbers in this case must be whatever relates them to the education system. This paper reveals what the numbering system means, and details the history of their relevance to school programs in the United States. Personally, I went to school in a 4-5-3 plan, but it seems that the 5-3-4 plan is most common nowadays in the United States. Notice that the sum of the three numbers is always 12, since it represents the twelve years of primary through secondary school that students take. Pre-1960's schools systems often didn't even have middle school or junior high, leading to more of an ""A-C"" system. Sometimes the notation is extended to include A-B-C-D, where ""D"" refers to the number of years typically spent in college or university for a particular area (i.e. 4). The notation can be extended even further as X-A-B-C, where ""X"" refers to Kindergarten, preschool, or whatever it is chosen to represent in a particular instance. Despite these special cases, the more general A-B-C notation is most commonly used (...not that any of this knowledge is ""common"" to begin with. I had to do some serious sleuthing to learn all of this, and now my entire afternoon is gone!). It's also worth noting that there is no such thing as a ""2-2-2"" system. Those numbers don't even add up to 12! Anyways, the 6-3-3 system of learning (6 years of primary school, 3 years of middle school, 3 years of high school) was starting to become pretty common in the New York City area during the 1960's (I live in New York and it's actually still not uncommon), but it wasn't exactly something people were used to. So when Calvin E. Gross suggested adding a new year to high school, implying a sudden shift to the 5-3-4 plan that was just starting at the time, I imagine that annoyed quite a few people! One of the common criticisms of Calvin Gross' proposed system that I described above comes down to the fact that he was proposing a lot of sudden changes to the education system that many were uneasy about, something that always gives rise to outrage from the public. It's pretty clear from the photo that this is what the protest was about. The ""DON'T MAKE PAWNS OF OUR CHILDREN"" and ""HASTY IMPLEMENTATION"" signs make it obvious that the people are protesting sudden and uncomfortable changes, which is consistent with all of the evidence described above. I believe the sign on the left was trying to emphasize the supposed ridiculousness of the changes that were supposed to have taken place. In a ""We recently had to adapt to the 6-3-3 system, and now we might already need to switch to the 5-3-4 system all in the name of racial integration???"" sort of way. The ""2-2-2"" part of the sign was just mocking the numbering notation entirely in a ""What are we going to switch to next?"" manner, and the ""?-?-?"" part is clearly a continuation of the point: ""What comes next? Where does it stop?"" I completely disagree with the comments saying that the numbers refer to dates or Supreme Court decisions. X-Y-Z is an extremely unusual notation for representing dates, and one that I've never seen before, not even in the early 1900's. That interpretation also doesn't add up with all of the evidence and points I've presented that are directly supported by the original description of the image."
"How do ancient Chinese ""mirrors"" such as these in the National Museum function?","They’re displaying the back of the mirrors. Here are a couple of images I found via Google that shows both sides:   Chinese Museums typically exhibit the back of these mirrors, because doing so showcases the craft and design of the objects more. The reflective side, aside from not being particularly interesting, are generally not actually reflective anymore due to corrosion and wear."
(Why) are there two different versions of the photograph of inmates at the Buchenwald concentration camp?,"The original photo is the one with the man standing on the right, which is available from the National Archives as used in high resolution on Wikipedia. The New York Times version, with the man on the right missing, was manipulated by the New York Times. This is a photo used in conspiracy theories. The alternative version in higher resolution was indeed printed in the New York Times Magazine (NYTM) question as is, with the man, named Simon Toncman, and then published on a blog that claims ""famous photo faked, therefore holocaust is hoax"". This even reflected on the WP-Discussion page for the photo, where a Russian commentator placed the allegation: ""Узник, который стоит на переднем плане - фотомонтаж. Заметно ретушь левой руки, тень от тела не совпадает с направлением тени от нар."" Which translates as: The prisoner standing in the foreground is a photomontage. Noticeable retouching of the left hand, the shadow from the body does not match the direction of the shadow from the bunks. The alleged problems with the version from WP/National Archives are indeed more numerous: the arm before the wooden pillar looks strange and shows some ghosting like the entire left half and more importantly the left ear as well, quite visibly:  The NYTM version is usually only found on such sites. The problem here: really all other persons are exactly in the position in both versions. No other movements, not even eyelids between shots. That makes it impossible that these are two takes of the same scene.  One of the photos was retouched, one of the photos is fake. Which one? The photograph motif is inmates at KZ Buchenwald after liberation. The US army took a sub camp on April 4 and the main site on April 11. The photo was taken and indeed staged for effect after April 16. Apart from the National Archives, a detailed history is also available at Fotoarchiv Buchenwald. The original caption for it reads: These are slave laborers in the Buchenwald concentration camp near Jena, many had died from malnutrition when U.S. troops of the 80th Div. entered the camp. 16 April 1945. It was taken by Harry Miller and shows Befreite Häftlinge des Konzentrationslagers Buchenwald in den Schlafboxen 26 bis 28 des Blocks 56 im Kleinen Lager.

 On the same day the New York Times publishes the same picture, but cropped.
 While on April 30 the Moberly Monitor-Index and Democrat has again the full width picture:  In Germany the unretouched picture went into circulation immediately at the end of April, as the Amerikanischen Kriegsinformationsamt im Auftrag des Oberbefehlshabers der Alliierten Streitkräfte April 1945 printed the brochure ""KZ - Bildbericht aus fünf Konzentrationslagern."" (reconstruction PDF, page 3, p6 in PDF) and was reprinted in newspapers like Bayerische Landeszeitung, May 18. (— Cornelia Brink: ""Ikonen der Vernichtung. Öffentlicher Gebrauch von Fotografien aus nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslagern nach 1945"", Akademie Verlag: Berlin, 1998. doi) One big hint against the theory that the NYTM image was showing the supposed original is found in the version used on the cover of the 1979 edition of Mel Mermelstein's book ""By Bread Alone"" (remember from the list above that he was in that picture as well, now circled on the cover):  Indeed, Toncman is again missing. So at first glance Mermelstein's books used the supposed original? Look closer and see that this is also a retouched version, but differing from the NYTM picture.  The wooden support below the bunks (to the right of the unnamed last man in the lowest tier) was kept/added in the cover version, it appears, but is surely entirely missing in NYTM. Further, the NYTM version seems to have a bulging shadow from the support beam behind Toncman and the dirt on the floor is more smoothed over in NYTM but more varied in the book cover version. That means the supposed evidence for 'originality of NYTM — as 'evidenced by re-use on the cover — and fake official photo' is actually strongly against this theory. The version of the picture with Toncman in it is the original and New York Times manipulated it twice. It cropped Toncman out of the picture the first time they ran the photo, and they retouched him out of it the second time a week later. We see indeed a lot of more detail in the high resolution version from the National Archives. Like the shadow of Toncman, lining up indeed rather well with the rest of the lighting, and leaving even details in the texture of the dirt on the floor prominently visible. The strange arm and ear ghosting are motion blur, which is also visible on the inmate below ""27"" in height of the shoulders.  And replicated by Spanish writer Victor Baldovi on the subject:   The most damning detail for the NYTM version is that the bunks were supposedly full, yet are empty in the back. While the original Signal Corps picture in the National Archive shows the astonishing small detail of yet another face visible directly below Toncman's right shoulder.  The retouched NYTM version smudges over the shadow and may invent some wooden beams for bunk lining, they forgot the support beam and couldn't insert people only fractionally visible in the original. That means the New York Times manipulated the image twice: first by cropping out the portion with Toncman, then by retouching him out of the picture.
'The original' was published before and after in numerous other newspapers. 'Why' did the Times do that? Some speculative circumstantial hints may be found in the nature of the exact information the journalists at the very time had themselves, what exactly they wanted to tell, and what kind of policies and morals were prevailing at the New York Times, especially under the leadership of Arthur Hays Sulzberger.
Which internal policies or sentiments led the New York Times to this decision on picture manipulation despite seemingly many other papers just printing it 'as-is' remain unclear.
But it is noteworthy that for most Americans, including those actually visiting the camps very shortly after liberation, Dachau was often seen as the worst of the camps, despite quite some details for the liberated earlier Auschwitz/Oswiecim being known by then.  Times Vice President Julius Ochs Adler, facing the camera with dark hat, was among a group of editors and publishers who toured German concentration camps in April and May 1945. Adler is shown here near the crematorium at Buchenwald. (Source: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum)
[— Leff2005, p231] Note also that by the time of liberation not many Jews over all were left to be photographed alive, also not in Buchenwald. But it happens that this picture shows a few of those Jews left, even evacuated from Auschwitz, then left at Buchenwald. And yet, even the original captions — or those used in other papers depicting the photo directly — makes no mention of that fact and just calls them ""slave laborers"".
This remains speculation.
If ever anybody comes up with recorded internal editorial minutiae of ""retouche this picture, because I/we want/don't want…"", then this will be much better than all this 'reasoning around' here. But it is really noteworthy how the New York Times, at the time, treated the entire subject. Some details for that in:
— Laurel Leff: ""Buried by the Times: The Holocaust and America's Most Important Newspaper"", Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, New York, 2005. (review) The above in short: As with any historical source, using the New York Times as a source for 'what happened' is confounded by the fact that this reveals primarily 'what the New York Times presented as happening'. That was in and around 1945 'suboptimal' in itself. And thus again a tiny little argument against: ""see this is proof and must depict the real truth."""
How do we know the gender distribution of cave art painters?,"A significant portion of cave paintings are so called ""hand stencils"": People pressed one hand onto the wall and applied color around the hand.  Image: Cueva de las Manos, Perito Moreno, Argentina / Wikipedia So from these paintings, we can infer the shape of the artist's hand. It had been known for a long time that among the hand stencils there were bigger and smaller hands. One older interpretation was that the bigger hands belonged to older, experienced (male) hunters, and the smaller hands belonged to young (male) ""novices"", maybe as some kind of intiation ritual. But about ten or twenty years ago, scientists started to look closer into the hand shapes, and found interesting results. The proportions of a male hand and a female hand tend to be different. For example, with males the ring finger is typically significantly longer than the index finger. With females it's the other way around, or both fingers are of about equal length. One of the first scientists to look into this was Dean Snow, an anthropologist from Pennsylvania State University. According to an German article on wissenschaft.de, the homepage of the German science magazine ""bild der wissenschaft"", he leafed through a photo book with pictures of stone-age cave art. There, he ran across a hand stencil that clearly didn't originate from a man, but from a woman. In that book alone, out of the six stencils shown, four were from female hands. Snow decided to look closer into this, visited several caves with stone age art in Europe and got high-res photos from other caves. Additionally, he took measurements from the hands of contemporary people from the respective regions. He found that only about 10% of the stone age hand stencils had originated from adult males, and 15% from juveniles. The vast majority of 75% of the stencils clearly had originated from adult females. According to Snow's measurements, the sexual dimorphism of the human hand was even more pronounced 30.000 years ago than it is today. He had feared that because of the significant overlap today, it might be hard to assign the sex of the stencils' creators. But the stone age hands all fell into the extreme areas of the modern statistical distribution. Snow published his findings in a paper in the journal ""Antiquity"" in 2006. Since, other scientists also found that at least the hand stencils weren't as much of a ""male domain"" as had been assumed before, for example Paul Pettitt (Durham University) et al., also in ""Antiquity"". Obviously, this method won't work for other cave paintings like depictions of animals."
"Why was ""leaping into the river"" a valid trial outcome to prove one's innocence?","It was a divine judgement in cases where the evidence was inconclusive and previous attempts to resolve the case had failed. In some cases at least, it was only used after other attempts at a resolution had failed. We can't be certain why it was considered a valid outcome as there is insufficient evidence, but it is likely that the apparent verdict of a god would have been convincing evidence for believers. The law referred to in the question is not the only mention of a river ordeal in ancient Mesopotamian law codes. The Code of Hammurabi itself later on refers to this ordeal in cases of suspected adultery (see No. 132). Also, the earlier (c. 2100–2050 BC) Code of Ur-Nammu (No.14) similarly mentions the river ordeal for adultery. The ordeal was not so much a means of giving evidence as a referral of
  the issue to a higher court — that of the gods. Clear examples are found
  only in Mesopotamia and Anatolia, where it took the form of a river
  ordeal, the river being conceived of as a divinity. The trial could
  involve one or both parties. The mechanics are not well documented,
  but it seems that ordeals were carefully monitored and could involve
  swimming or carrying an object in water a certain distance. At Mari,
  the use of substitutes for the parties is attested. Drowning indicated
  guilt, but the unsuccessful subject could be rescued prior thereto and
  punished. The issue need not be criminal; already in the third
  millennium, disputes over property could be settled by ordeal. Source: Raymon Westbrook (ed), 'A History of Ancient Near Eastern Law' (2003) p.34 According to Bertrand Lafont and Raymond Westbrook in Westbrook (ed), the river ordeal was, in at least some cases, a last resort once other means had been exhausted. After a claim against another person had been made, a request could be made by either party to have access to a court. These included an investigation report, declarations by the parties concerned, and the weighing of evidence and statements. ...The judgment may be a direct decision closing the case ... in favor
  of one party. It may also be a decision depending on further proof.
  This can be realized by a declaratory oath ... of one of the parties
  or of one or more witnesses to the fact or to the original
  transaction... An alternative to the oath is the river ordeal. It seems to have been
  practiced quite frequently, as a large list with seventeen short
  protocols of ordeals and another fragmentary tablet, both from Nippur,
  show....Most disputes are over fields, some over silver, barley, oxen,
  and sheep; one is about a slave... The river ordeal was also used in cases of witchcraft and adultery in the Neo-Sumerian period. In one case concerning a princess, a substitute was used. The best evidence we have on river ordeals comes from Mari in modern-day Syria. Citing J.-M. Durand, Westbrook notes the procedure there involved swimming a set distance, perhaps with
  some handicap, such as carrying a millstone or swimming underwater.
  Prior to entering the water, the swimmer reiterated the claim at
  issue, sometimes in answer to a series of interrogatories (ARM 26/1
  249, 253). The use of substitutes was possible: townspeople swim for
  their prince (ARM 26/1 249), a lady-in-waiting for her queen (249), a
  wife for her husband (254), a mother for her daughter (253). If the
  swimmer failed to complete the course and a fortiori if he drowned,
  his case was lost, by divine judgment. According to Westbrook, The reasons for using the ordeal are unclear. It had the advantage of
  giving an immediate divine judgment, whereas with the oath, divine
  punishment would have to be awaited. It may also have been the last
  resort when all other attempts to ascertain the truth had failed. In
  CT 29 42–43, after the plaintiff had twice rejected a judgment based
  on the oath, the king sent the parties to “the river god, the judge of
  truth.” Worth noting is that the ordeal was undergone freely and voluntarily (e.g., MDP 23 242:1–5
  ina †ubàti“u ina nar""amàti“u), but it could still have been ordered by
  the court. The subject could refuse to undergo the ordeal, thereby
  losing the case. Thus, the subject's faith was being tested and, undoubtedly, the ordeal was open to manipulation (see Betterthan Kwora's answer for more on this). Whether or not the ordeal was most likely to be undertaken by the innocent, and the outcome manipulated on that basis, we can't say for the time of Hammurabi. Unlike some of the medieval evidence (which shows most trials by ordeal resulted in a 'not guilty' verdict), we do not have enough evidence on verdicts for ancient Mesopotamia. We know that some were found 'not guilty' (the aforementioned princess again) while others were not (there are records of people who failed, some of whom were fished out of the river to be punished). Whether women undertaking the river ordeal after being accused of adultery were more likely to be guilty or innocent in the first place is a matter of some debate. Siaw Fung Chong, in Innocence by Ordeal or Ordeal By Innocence? observes that, in the ancient Near East, women facing accusations from their husbands or from the man folks of
  their communities—even when there is no evidence—may find it
  challenging to defend themselves. A guilty woman might have little to lose as, in the Code of Ur-Nammu, at least, she would be killed if guilty; the river ordeal could be her only chance of survival. Allowing the use of substitutes, at first glance, may seem to negate the aspect of faith being tested. However, if someone was able to find to find a substitute (or lots of substitutes in the case of ""townspeople swim for their prince"") willing to undergo the ordeal on their behalf, it could be seen as a public statement of belief by a third party in the subject's innocence (though whether the aforementioned princess' substitute had much choice is of course debatable)."
"In the Soviet Union, why was the Cheka renamed so many times?","The secret police was key to the Soviet government (so-called Chekism), so its structure changed frequently in response to state political needs. Note that the renaming and restructuring was fairly transparent to the population, and there was no ""rebranding"" effort - security officers were informally called ""Chekists"" up until the dissolution of the USSR.

Did Roman troops suffer from PTSD?,"PTSD, or stress reactions from battle, were well known during the Greek and Roman era. The Greeks understood it very well. Alexander the Great's men are said to have mutinied after suffering ""battle fatigue."" These examples of Roman era PTSD are taken from a blog of ancient examples sourced from Max Hastings', An Oxford Book of Military Anecdotes: According to Herodotus, in 480 B.C., at the Battle of Thermopylae, where King Leonidas and 300 Spartans took on Xerxes I and 100,000-150,000 Persian troops, two of the Spartan soldiers, Aristodemos and another named Eurytos, reported that they were suffering from an “acute inflammation of the eyes,”...Labeled tresantes, meaning “trembler,”... During the Roman siege of Syracuse in 211 B.C., a number of Greek soldiers defending the city were “stricken dumb with terror,” according to Greek historian Plutarch. Surdomutism, which is now recognized as a common conversion reaction to the stress of combat, was first clinically diagnosed during the Russo-Japanese War of 1905. According to Peter Connolly, the Greek military historian Polybius wrote that as early as 168 B.C., the Roman army was quite familiar with soldiers who deliberately injured themselves in order to avoid combat. According to The VVA Veteran, a Congressional Organization: Aristodemos (example above) later hung himself in shame.  It relates the story of another Spartan commander who was forced to dismiss several of his troops in the Battle of Thermopylae Pass in 480 B.C. ""They had no heart for the fight and were unwilling to take their share of the danger.” Also:  The Greek historian Herodotus, in writing of the battle of Marathon in 490 B.C., cites an Athenian warrior who went permanently blind when the soldier standing next to him was killed, although the blinded soldier “was wounded in no part of his body.” So, too, blindness, deafness, and paralysis, among other conditions, are common forms of “conversion reactions” experienced and well-documented among soldiers today "
"In WW2, why did Germany sink allied supply convoys instead of capturing them?","The options that submarines had were, in practice, limited to sinking Allied shipping and leaving the area as quickly as possible to avoid detection. U-boats had a disadvantage compared to destroyers (not to mention airplanes) when it came to speed, especially when submerged. They were also poorly equipped to fight surface warships as their deck guns were no match for those of a destroyer, and lining up a torpedo took time. U-boats could not store captured cargo, unlike Armed merchantman such as the Atlantis which operated in the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. Although, as the OP correctly implies, the vast majority of Allied cargo ships were sunk (for reasons already given by Orangesandlemons and Laetus), some were captured using armed merchantman. Unlike submarines, these had space aboard to store the captured cargo as well as captured crewmen. These were 'disguised as neutral or friendly vessels which would capture Allied merchant vessels and seize their cargo for the Axis powers'. The article Return of the Clandestine Merchant Raider? notes: In World War II nine German Merchant raiders, Atlantis, Komet,
  Kormoran, Michel, Orion, Pinguin, Stier, Thor, and Widder, sank or
  captured 129 ships, totaling 800,661 tons. The English Wikipedia article on Atlantis gives an example of ships where the cargo was taken: Atlantis sank Athelking, Benarty, and Commissaire Ramel. All of these
  were sunk only after supplies, documents, and POWs were taken."
Are there any examples of technologies have been lost over time? [closed],"Are there any examples of technologies have been lost over time? At least four examples spring to mind: Damascus steel, which might have been rediscovered last century, Greek fire, whose composition is still a matter of debate, Roman concrete, whose formula was lost in Western Europe after the fall of Rome and later rediscovered during the Renaissance, and the Antikythera mechanism, an ancient Greek clockwork device that was discovered early last century and only recently established to be an astronomical clock. There's also the stuff of legends, whose accounts attract the skepticism of modern scholars (like burning glass) or of contemporaries (like the circumnavigation of Africa by Phoenicians). If you feel like sitting through an hour and a half long video, this example of traditional African iron smelting was nearly lost -- it would have been had it not been for a desire to preserve it. The video will walk you through the whole thing: creating the charcoal, creating the furnace, and then operating it. The latter video is, I think, interesting in that it hints at how much technical knowledge may have been lost over time without us necessarily realizing -- at times while leaving a trace that can later be rediscovered, and at times not. Iron smelting technology is alive and well, but had it not been for conservation efforts, the above video would never have been created, and how Africans smelted iron in that area would have been lost to time unless later researchers would have succeeded at recreating it through detective work. In this sense, obsolete technology is comparable to a dying language. At one point there are only a few people left who know it. And then comes a day when the last person who knows it passes away. But their reason for existing stays with us in some form or shape and they simply get replaced. As a last illustration of the above, consider the (actually Celtic) Roman saddle, which all but disappeared after the introduction of the stirrup:  How they worked was reconstructed last century by Peter Connolly."
Has an heir ever made the country believe the current ruler died in order to take over the throne?,"Yes. King John of England attempted to take the throne from Richard I while he was on crusade. Richard's delayed return was due to the fact that he had been taken prisoner by Leopold V, Duke of Austria, and then handed over to the Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI. John, in the meantime, took advantage of his brother's imprisonment, gathering supporters around him and scheming with Philip II of France. He also began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Although Richard had named his nephew, Arthur Duke of Brittany, as his heir before leaving for the crusade, Arthur was only a child and John managed to gather around him leading nobles who recognised him as heir. In order to placate John and get his help in raising the ransom money, Archbishop Walter urged Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine and the regency
  council to adopt a conciliatory policy towards John....Eleanor and the
  magnates took Hubert's advice and negotiated a truce with John. He
  agreed to surrender his castles to his mother and if they were unable
  to get Richard back, he would become king. Richard, of course, did eventually return upon payment of a huge ransom. John promptly fled to France but was later forgiven by Richard. In 1196, Richard again named Arthur as his heir but he changed his mind on his deathbed in 1199 and named John instead, probably because he felt Arthur was too young to be king and to command the support needed to hold onto the Angevin empire. Arthur subsequently 'disappeared' (1203), with John being the prime suspect in his nephew's murder."
Why was the Japanese Army's fatalities inflicted:suffered ratio so low in the Pacific theatre?,"First of all, Japanese Forces were by no means inferior to their enemies in terms of fighting spirit or training. Beyond a doubt, No nation in WW2 had soldiers of such fanatical devotion in her service as Japan did, who actively sought out Gyokusai (Glorious death). Their mindset could be explained in Japanese martial song, Umi Yukaba: If I go away to the sea, I shall be a corpse washed up. If I go away
to the mountain, I shall be a corpse in the grass. But if I die for
the Emperor, It will not be a regret. Such was ferocity and fearlessness of the Imperial forces that it left the rivals bewildered for this was the sort of fighting they had neither experienced nor even imagined before. This glorification of death reached such extremes that families of fallen soldiers were congratulated and normal mourning was considered shameful and inappropriate. Among the recommended expressions to be offered to bereaved families were: ""Congratulations on his having achieved the honor of a death in
battle"" ""This occasion was really one of honor"" The bereaved were expected to respond with: ""Thanks to your kind concern he was able to achieve the honor of a
death in battle. He certainly wanted this above all else. For us as
family member it is enough that his death could repay the emperor's
great beneficence."" Training of a Japanese soldier begain at school. The first text book a Japanese child was expected to study began with ""Advance, Advance, Soldiers advance!"". This sums up how early overwhelming victories of the Japanese were more relying on quality and training of Japanese soldiers, sailors and airmen rather than quality of their weapons. This is more credible as decline of Japanese might in the East can be traced back to Battle of Midway which resulted in loss of many veteran servicemen of Japanese forces, creating a shortage of similar calibered soldiers for future campaigns. By mid-1942, the Japanese found themselves holding a vast area from the Indian Ocean to the Central Pacific, even though they lacked the resources to defend or sustain it. Rather than falling back to shorten the line of supply or consolidating the gains, the Japanese planned to expand even further which resulted in Battle of Midway. Japanese lost four carriers and one heavy cruiser, resulting in Japanese navy being on defensive stance afterwards. Loss in naval capability also meant that Japanese navy was no longer in a strong position to protect Island garrisons from Allied assaults or to completely secure routes for supply shipping to the garrisons. Which eventually resulted in the Isolation of Japanese strongholds and led to desperate actions as Allies began to by-pass unimportant island garrisons and blockaded them with submarines and air power with IJN being too weak to issue a proportionate response or to defend the isolated garrisons. The death to kill ratio in terms of infantry/other personnel was 8:5 in favor of Japanese, overall with 4,000,000 allied deaths as compared to 2,500,000 fallen Japanese. Elsewhere, the Allies fared much better than their Adversary. Following is an approximate overview: The key here is that above mentioned losses are over all Allied figures and do not reflect on the performance of the strongest Western Allies i.e US and UK. If we break down the figures by country then we get following results  (KIA only, not including MIA, WIA): Japanese Deaths: Army Note: Enemy here refers to the country which inflicted the stated number of losses on the IJA Navy Allied Deaths (POW Deaths Included) So as you can see, the bulk of Allied deaths were Chinese forces while other Allies did not lose near half as many men as China did. The biggest factor in high casualty rate for Japanese was because of their Senjinkun military code based on ""No-Surrender"". Even when facing impossible odds, Japanese would rather kill themselves or launch suicide attacks than surrendering1. You might have noticed that Japanese POWs were in a very low number. They literally fought to death and then some more. For example, in the Battle of Okinawa, the Japanese garrison of 77,000 mainland troops was virtually wiped out. In the Battle of Saipan, only 921 surrendered out of a 31,000 strong garrison. The rest chose death. In the Battle of Iwo Jima, out of 20,000 defending Japanese troops, 17,845-18,375 were dead or missing. Only 216 surrendered, which is both horrifying and astonishing when you see the size of opposing allied force. In most hopeless situations where any other Army would surrender, the Japanese attacked. The results were as you can imagine, all-out slaughter. Then we have the technical stagnation of the Japanese war machine. It is often said that a weapon is as good as the soldier wielding it but nevertheless having a good weapon is necessary. The superb soldiers of the Japanese forces were without a doubt badly equipped as compared to their adversaries. The standard rifle of the Imperial Army was the Arisaka. After Manchuria, however, Type 38 was upgraded to Type 99 (though both rifles continued to stay in service, causing troubles in terms of ammunition supply). The integral magazine could hold five rounds. Because of the limitations of Japanese metallurgy, the barrel could not take a very high chamber pressure, but the Japanese compensated by making the barrel unusually long.  However, the Arisaka proved satisfactory for jungle fighting, where its weak report and lack of flash and smoke aided concealment. On the other hand, its bullet made a distinctive cracking sound that was easily distinguished from Allied rifles during firefights, and some Japanese veterans envied the higher effective rate of fire of Allied rifles. The Japanese were lagging far behind the West in terms of artillery, armored vehicles and cavalry. Most of their machine guns were also notoriously unreliable. Please refer to Schwern's answer to know more about small arms of IJA. The Imperial Navy was in better material shape than the Army when war broke out. Its sailors were well-trained and its main combat units were comparable in quality with those of Western navies. The Yamato, which was just being completed as war broke out, was the largest, most powerful battleship in the world. Japanese carriers lacked catapults and were somewhat lacking in underwater protection, but were otherwise the equal of their American counterparts. Japanese cruisers and destroyers were lacking in antiaircraft protection, but were armed with the deadly Long Lance torpedo, which was far superior to anything in the Allied arsenals. The Japanese Airforce & Naval Air arm shocked the West when they were first encountered. The Zero fighter was faster, more maneuverable, and had a longer range than most Western aircraft of 1941. It would be some time before its weaknesses were discovered. Japanese bombers were long-ranged, but vulnerable, and Japan never created a true strategic bomber. But Japanese light attack aircraft, such as the Kate and the Val, wrought havoc on Allied shipping. But almost all Japanese aircraft were dangerously lightly armored (And saw little progress as the war danced on), thus proving to be flying coffins by the end of the war. (Rather than despairing, Japanese made use of the flying coffins to be literally flying coffins, launching Kamikaze attacks on Allied shipping) The Inadequacy of the Logistical Corps of the Imperial forces made the situation even worse as almost all of the military graduates chose other branches than logistics.  At the time of the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, only 4 percent of military academy graduates were choosing to go into the logistics corps. Soldiers suffered due to this, whether due to lack of food, ammunition, equipment or medical care, thus escalating death rate. The tropical terrain of Pacific theatre was specially unforgiving. Diseases were common and in some instance due to lack of food, soldiers turned to cannibalism. As mentioned by Tom Au, also in later stages of the war when the Japanese had lost the ability to counter-barrage, the Allies always began their attacks with heavy aerial and naval bombardment barrages which were used to kill as many defenders as possible and crack open as many defensive positions as possible. After Guadalcanal, the Japanese rarely bombarded Allied positions while an IJ soldier would have to endure hours and even days of shelling. Sources 1. Many Historians and Japanologists such as James J. Weingartner, Niall Ferguson and  Ulrich Straus are of the opinion that Allied Forces deliberately acted to minimize the number of POWs and actively strived to not to take any prisoners as Japanese were viewed as subhumans and animals much like Nazis viewed Soviet Soldiers"
Why didn't the US choose to demolish Tokyo with an atom bomb?,"Hiroshima, the first city, was ""an important army depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged. There are adjacent hills which are likely to produce a focussing[sic] effect which would considerably increase the blast damage. Due to rivers it is not a good incendiary target. (Classified as an AA Target)"" [1]. There were also four other possible targets: Kokura, Niigata, Yokohama, and Kyoto. There were three criteria for choosing targets: The first source states: The possibility of bombing the Emperor's palace was discussed. It was agreed that we should not recommend it but that any action for this bombing should come from authorities on military policy. It was agreed that we should obtain information from which we could determine the effectiveness of our weapon against this target. [1] Tokyo was considered as a target, but it was not of as much strategic value as other cities. If Japan were to be invaded, it would be from the south and Tokyo was not in the south. With the exception of Niigata, all of the targets were in the south. Kyoto was eventually dropped from the lists because the US secretary of war had honeymooned there. It was replaced by Nagaski, which was eventually chosen for the second bomb."
How did passengers keep warm on sail ships?,"Long ago, in 16 century they used open fire in fair weather (with all possible precautions) on the deck to cook (ref. Morison, Admiral of the Ocean Sea). When the sea was rough, only cold food could be served.  Later they used galleys of higher and higher sophistication, but still mostly in the good weather.
There was no other way to heat oneself, except with a lot of cloth, blankets etc.
Yes the travel was not very comfortable, even for the rich. They rarely traveled in winter by the way,
and for more important reasons than mere cold. Recently I saw a film on YouTube of some re-enactment of a trip of Vikings
in a replica of a Viking ship. The re-enactment was in summer,
and they used modern high-tech cloth. But the ship and its equipment was authentic as much as possible. Several people had to drop from the enterprise,
and they were picked by an accompanying modern boat and evacuated. Because they
could not tolerate the cold. (And being wet for 24 hours day after day.) Such stories are abundant. One 20th century re-enactment of the Columbus
voyage had to be abandoned  completely because the crew could not endure
the conditions and rebelled. I recall that Columbus own crew was also
on the verge of rebellion when America was finally discovered. My general impression is that people were tougher, and could endure more hardship then most of modern people. (And more people died from various reasons,
in particular during the sea travels.) Remark: I sailed in the North Atlantic myself, in a 40 ft sail boat, in summer. There was no heating of any kind. It was difficult to stand a 4 hour night watch, in ordinary cloths without a special modern high-tech sailing suit. But it was OK to sleep in a sleeping bag in a cabin. Standing these night watches I tried to imagine how people could stay on the deck at night under icy spray, wearing only wool, linen, leather etc. in the old times, and it was hard to imagine."
When did the Roman Empire fall according to contemporaries?,"Most people at the time did not think the Roman Empire had fallen -- it's only from five hundred or a thousand years later that we can conclude that it did.  Both points of view are reasonable. What happened around 476 is that the Western part of the Roman Empire was lost to central control. This was not the first time it had happened -- consider the Gallic Empire of the late 200s.  We can look back and say that this time there was no returning, but people at the time were not thus privileged. Furthermore, the institutions of the Empire did not all fall together.  Some of them had been growing increasingly ragged for a couple of centuries.  Some of them (e.g. local administrative practices) had changed repeatedly over the course of the centuries as warlords replaced proconsuls -- what is the real difference between a chunk of Gaul being run by a Romanized German with an Imperial Army title and a Romanized German calling himself King?  It had happened before, so what's new this time?  'Sure our local boss is a minor warlord -- has been from before my grandfather's time, at least.  This German guy is better than that thieving lordling from down the Rhone valley, anyway.' And while the city of Rome was sacked, so what?  It hadn't been the actual ruling capital for a couple of hundred years -- the western part of the Empire had been ruled from places like Milan and Trier and Ravenna.  'Sure it's a great old city -- a shame that it was attacked -- but what does it really matter? It's still there, isn't it?  Yeah, it's a lot smaller now, but it's been shrinking for hundreds of years.' 'Anyway, what do you mean that the Roman Empire fell?  Its western territories are temporarily lost -- again -- but I hear that the Emperor in Constantinople -- the New Rome -- is sending Bellisarius with an army to reconquer Italy.'  (And he did.  It didn't stay conquered of course, but who could know that at the time?) 'And what's this Byzantine Empire you speak of?  Did the Parthians finally beat back Rome or something?  The only Empire I know of is Roman!'  It's only looking back that we see that the eastern half of the Roman Empire eventually and gradually became a Greek-speaking empire clearly different from the classical empire -- in 500 AD its language of administration was Latin, and its everyday speech had never been anything but Greek.  We can see the seeds of a later empire that looks very non-Roman; contemporaries? Not so much. Finally, from the 200s on (and probably earlier) people whose outlook in life was tilted towards half-empty glasses wrote of the imminent (or maybe past) collapse of Empire. 'Yawn.  Another over-educated parasite saying that the Empire is dead.  Boring!  I'm a practical man and as long as I have to pay taxes, the Empire is not dead.""  Looking back, we can see that somewhere around 500 AD the Roman Empire in the West passed a point of no return, but people living at the time could not skip ahead to the end of the book to see that."
Was there a contingency plan in place if Little Boy failed to detonate?,"If the bomb failed to explode in any way (which was unlikely, see comments and Mark's answer), the USA still would not have to worry about it (too much). They would win the war anyway within a few months, and pick up the wrecked bomb from wherever the Japanese had stored it. Even if Japan could figure out what that bomb was supposed to be doing and repair it, they didn't have any delivery system that could reach mainland USA (with any degree of certainty). More importantly, the USA knew Japan did not have the capacities to build a second bomb, so even the microscopic chance that Japan could deliver the salvaged bomb to some target would not have changed the outcome. The USA had both the delivery system and the production capacity to build a second, third, fourth bomb (of the Fat Man design), quite aside from having the strategic upper hand so firmly that they did not actually need the A-bomb to win the war. Not even in the very, very unlikely scenario of a major city, Pearl Harbor, or any other single location taken out by the salvaged Little Boy."
States calling themselves a dictatorship,"The Despotate of the Morea, which was a province of the Byzantine Empire, looks like one of these at first glance, but it isn't. The words ""Despot"", ""Tyrant"" and ""Dictator"" have all changed their meanings over time.  I very much doubt that the original name of the ""Centrocaspian Dictatorship"" had the implications of modern English ""dictatorship."" Given that the title must be a translation, I'm suspicious that ""dictatorship"" is translating some word that was meant to imply government in an emergency, and that the English translation originated with someone with an excessively classical education, who assumed everyone would apply the ancient Roman meaning. I'm still doubtful that ""dictatorship"" had all of the implications of the modern English term. "
Were there U.S. weapon restrictions during 19th century?,"The official way we determine how the Constitution is ""understood"" is through US Supreme Court decisions, and there haven't been any on that particular subject. There have been basically 3 definitive decisions on the 2nd amendment, only one of which came before the 20th Century. Note first that prior to the 14th Amendment, the Bill of Rights was generally held to constrain only the Federal Government, not the states. So the 2nd amendment at that time would have been essentially preventing the Federal government from keeping weapons from state militias, but not prohibiting the states from regulating weapons any way they chose (including prohibiting their militias from having certain weapons). That's how you get ""well-regulated"" and an absolute right in the same sentence. They are referring to two different regulating entities. After the 14th amendment, the bill of rights was essentially applied to every government within the USA at any level. This could be viewed as having ""broken"" the old view of the 2nd amendment. The first attempt to grapple with this was United States vs. Cruikshank in 1875 (just after the 14th Amendment). This essentially said the 14th didn't apply to the 2nd Amendment, and any relief from infringing laws would have to be sought from state courts. This was reaffirmed twice before 1900. The second, United States vs. Miller in 1939, held the SCOTUS could strike down state gun laws, but for a regulation to be unconstitutional it had to apply to a ""well-regulated militia"". So effectively, the 2nd amendment applied to militias, not to individuals. The third was District of Columbia vs. Heller, in 2008. This kept Miller's finding that the SCOTUS had authority, but changed the interpretation of the amendment to make it apply to individuals, not just militias. This is effectively the regime we are under now. Note that it isn't until you get to where the Second Ammendment is a personal right, unabridgeable by any US government at any level, that it matters much if a canon counts as an ""arm"". So it never had a reason to come up before. There seemed to be a big-hangup with some in the comments on the word ""regulated"". The word ""regulated"" meant essentially the same thing back then that it does now. This is pretty easy to see by perusing a search of archived writings from the founders. As an example, here's the conclusion of a petition Benjamin Franklin wrote to the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1731, asking for tighter laws on fairs: Your Petitioners therefore Pray, that, the said Fairs may either be
thoroughly regulated in such Manner as to the Wisdom of this House
shall seem meet, or else totally abolished and Your Petitioners shall
ever pray &c. ""{adjective} regulated"" (eg: ""well regulated"", ""thoroughly regulated"") was in fact how one talked about collections of laws on a specific activity back then. Just like now."
How did Italy and Germany get rubber in WWII?,"Short answer For most of the war, the main supply of rubber for Germany and Italy was synthetic rubber. They were able to obtain some natural rubber from Japanese controlled Southeast Asia via the Soviet Union (until June 1941) and limited (by blockades) amounts via shipping. There were also pre-war stockpiles, while some was seized from French stockpiles and a small amount was recoverable from cars. Efforts to cultivate Russian dandelion in occupied Soviet territory produced only small amounts of rubber. Details In 1940, The Western democracies controlled about 93% of the world's production
  of natural rubber. Around 77% was from plantations in British Malaya
  and the Netherlands East Indies,... Source: John Tully, 'The Devil's Milk: A Social History of Rubber' However, both Germany and Italy had adopted a policy of autarky (economic self-sufficiency) and had invested in synthetic rubber. There were a few other sources of rubber, but shortages were inevitable. The problem for the Axis powers was that, although Japan controlled much of the world's natural rubber from 1942, blockades and Allied control of critical sea routes made shipping it to their German and Italian allies very difficult. Consequently, for most of the war, the Germans relied very heavily on synthetic rubber, specifically Buna rubbers developed by I. G. Farben: When Hitler came to power in 1933, he immediately began to plan for
  war. To avoid a repetition of World War I, in which Germany had faced
  an especially bitter defeat, he demanded autarky (economic
  self‐sufficiency), especially in metals and rubber....He turned to IG
  Farben...to refine and develop Buna for military use. Source: Stephen L. Harp, 'A World History of Rubber: Empire, Industry, and the Everyday' (2015) Buna, though, was very expensive compared to natural rubber but, Hitler personally authorized a significant subsidy to bring Buna tires
  to market. With government support, the product became a success
  story, even winning a gold medal at the Paris World’s Fair in 1937. In
  the process, IG Farben became a critical pillar in the war economy of
  the Third Reich... Source: Stephen L. Harp Farben's synthetic rubber, made primarily from coal and limestone, was used to create a red rubber floor at the exhibition. Just how critical Buna rubbers were can be deduced from the fact that, by 1943, synthetic rubber accounted for over 90% of Germany's supply, up from just 22% in 1939 and 70% in 1940. Also, In late 1941, German tyres contained 37% natural rubber, but this declined to around 8% in February 1943. Source: John Tully, 'The Devil's Milk: A Social History of Rubber' Also, both the Italians and the Germans had stockpiled natural rubber before the war, although these reserves were quickly depleted (German stockpiles were estimated at 50,000 tons by British analysts). The British blockade was very effective, but Germany was still able to obtain rubber from the Japanese via the Trans-Siberian Railway until Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 put an end to the German–Soviet Credit Agreement of 1939. Although the Germans managed to seize French stockpiles of rubber, once the Soviets were in the Allied camp, Germany had to rely largely on blockade runners for natural rubber, bringing it from the Japanese in the Far East. But there was a problem: Although by mid 1942 Germany and Italy had unlimited access, at least
  in theory, to natural rubber, shipping it safely to Europe became
  extremely dangerous. This situation prompted increasing cooperation
  between German and Italian commercial representatives in East Asia,
  but their options were limited. While the only viable route was now
  via the sea, the Allies’ blockade became so effective, especially
  after the introduction of the Checkmate System on 8 June 1943, that
  fewer and fewer Axis blockade-runners succeeded in reaching Europe.
  By late 1942 and early 1943, only one of the six ships that left for
  Europe reached its destination. As the toll of using surface ships
  became unbearable, this route was virtually terminated by the end of
  1943. Between 1941 and 1944, these blockade runners had only delivered 43,983 tons of natural rubber to the German and Italian war
  industries. Note that, for comparative purposes, IG Farben produced 140,000 tons of Buna in 1944 alone (by which time their factories were being heavily bombed, for example this Italian factory). The Germans had hoped to obtain natural rubber through Vichy France as French West African colonies were under Vichy control, but Vichy wanted this for itself; that the Germans did not push harder on this would imply that the quantities were small, and it was not enough to meet even the requirements of the Vichy regime. Vichy did, though, exchange some natural rubber for German synthetic rubber. One other source of rubber the Germans were interested in was Russian dandelion or Taraxacum kok-saghyz. The Soviets had cultivated this since 1931 as an alternative source of natural rubber to the rubber tree (hevea brasiliensis) of Southeast Asia. German-occupied Ukraine and the Baltic States had large areas of land growing Russian dandelion, around 20,000 hectares not destroyed by the enemy, but little came of it in terms of final product: the Nazi conquerors ordered peasants on collective farms to maintain
  fields of kok-saghyz, and soon ratcheted up the pressure. After
  Heinrich Himmler had won overall control over production for his SS
  empire in July 1943, he ordered the rounding up of women and children
  in partisan zones of eastern Europe to grow the crop, and the
  mobilisation of school children. In 1944, prisoners, juvenile
  delinquents, orphans, the deaf and dumb and Russian refugees from
  Stalinism were all pressed into service in the Baltic States. How many
  people died pursuing Himmler’s phantasms is not known. No more than a
  few hundred tons of rubber were ever delivered to the Reich. Source: William G. Clarence-Smith, 'The Battle for Rubber in the Second World War: Cooperation and Resistance'. In Jonathan Curry-Machado (ed.), 'Global Histories, Imperial Commodities,
Local Interactions' (2013) As T.E.D. has noted in a comment, the Allies also ""had issues with rubber, once the Japanese took SE Asia"" in 1942. The US was by the world's largest importer of rubber (over 50% of world production, while Germany imported just 8% in 1939). The US turned to synthetic rubber and Latin America while Britain relied heavily on Sri Lanka which became the Allies’ single largest source of natural rubber... Africa also provided relatively small amounts of rubber for the allies, including Liberia, the Belgian Congo and various British colonies. Much of the pre-war production capacity in SE Asia was simply not utilized; Japan couldn't use it all, and nor were they able to ship significant amounts to their allies."
What did the Emancipation Proclamation exactly do?,"Since it only applied to areas that didn't recognize Federal authority, the snarky take on the Emancipation Proclamation has always been that it didn't itself free a single slave. Like a lot of famous snark, this isn't entirely true.  The US Army had already been given the authority to free any slaves it came across in Confederate territory as Contraband of War for the previous two years. However, ""Contraband"" rule was at military discretion, which left a lot of slaves behind Union lines in limbo until a decision was made on their specific case. The EP made it automatic. Something on the order of 20-50 thousand slaves were freed the day it took effect. Here's a map* showing the areas affected:
 There were about 300,000 slaves in the exempted (blue) areas, and 100,000 in the red areas that were legally free on Jan 1, 1863. Of course the red area would expand and move around as the war progressed, which is where the real importance of the proclamation came in. As soon as it was issued, the war became just as about the survival of slavery to the Union side as it had always been in the South. This had the following effects: What I think might not have been obvious to a lot of people at the time was that, whatever else may have happened, as soon as the Proclamation was issued, slavery was as good as dead in the United States of America. No matter what the existing legalities may have been, when 400,000 young men died fighting it and another 300,000 were casualties, it was simply politically impossible for the cause of that to be tolerated any more. * - I believe this map originally appeared in an article by William Harris in North and South magazine from 2001"
"What is the logic for the map maker classifying the map this way, specifically in Canada?","The main purpose is – per caption – to illustrate the varying degrees of censorship: For Quebec, no definitive solution seems to be known. But there are convincing hypotheses out there: The situation in Quebec in 1938 An element that will not fail to challenge the Quebec reader is the status of Quebec in this grid of analysis of freedom of expression in the world: neither in black like Nazi Germany, nor in yellow as the United States where freedom of expression is protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution, but in gray, in the company of the Canadian province of Alberta, colonies of French and British empires, Baltic nations and several Latin American countries . But why is Quebec colored in gray? For US observers Cotton and Ackerman, why is Quebec threatened by the ""new Black Death""? The map remains silent on this subject: we put forward three hypotheses. First hypothesis: the domination of the clergy The domination of religious powers in Quebec could be a potential target. During the 1930s and 1940s, the Catholic Church opposed the government's desire to promote economic liberalism while supporting the struggle against communism and all forms of socialism. For the citizens of Quebec, the strong influence of the clergy is reflected in social pressure contrary to the principle of freedom of conscience and expression. In support of this hypothesis, let us recall the boycott orchestrated by the Catholic Church against Ken Magazine : it illustrates well the marked opposition between the clerical ideology of the time and the progressive factions of the society. Second hypothesis: nationalist aspirations The economic crisis of the 1930s brought many economic and social upheavals. At this point in history, for its neighbors to the south, does Quebec embody a sort of ""gray zone"" because of its cultural differences and its autonomist ambitions, which may pose a threat to Anglo-American hegemony. American on the continent? In the context of the rise of fascist ideologies on the Old Continent, was the assertion of French-Canadian nationalism causing concern? Third hypothesis: the Unionist Government Does the map designed by Cotton seek to denounce the political regime imposed by the National Union of Maurice Duplessis ? The Union Nationale cabinet, 1947-1948: the defender of the rights of the province and his team of patriots, wall calendar, Quebec, National Union, 1947.
  This calendar highlights the cabinet of the National Union formed by Maurice Duplessis during his second term. Shortly after its publication, the provincial elections of July 28, 1948 will create a real Unionist tidal wave thanks to the party's well-equipped coffers and modern marketing strategies. The main electoral slogan is striking: ""Liberals give to strangers; Duplessis gives to his province. In 1938, however, Maurice Duplessis is a new party leader who does not yet have the influence, power and arrogance that will be his trademark from 1944. The populist style of Duplessis can recall up to a certain point that of a Mussolini, but the period known as the Great Darkness in Quebec covers after all only the fifteen years after the war. US activists defending freedom of expression may have noted the passage in 1937 of the Protecting the Province from Communist Propaganda Act (better known as the ""Padlock Act""). Any place for the propagation of Communism or Bolshevism could now be condemned by the Attorney General. This legal measure could be a threat to trade union or religious organizations. In particular, it served to legitimize the closing of newspapers such as the communist weekly Clarté (which occurred on November 9, 1937) and numerous searches. –– Appel à tous : la liberté d’expression au Québec en question en 1938
  Publié le 13 septembre 2018 par Carnet de la Bibliothèque nationale Comments are already in favour of that third option: Perhaps the simplest answer for Quebec is on the Wikipedia page for Maurice Duplessis ""His era was later labeled as La Grande Noirceur (""The Great Darkness"") by its critics.""
 – @sempaiscuba  And that seems very plausible, although the first two were certainly not suited to lighten things up. For Alberta it was something more direct: Canada’s first, and perhaps most famous, legal case on free speech dates from 1937. In that year, the Alberta Social Credit government passed the Act to Ensure the Publication of Accurate News and Information, as part of a major legislative package to regulate the provincial economy. In effect, the law would have required newspapers to disclose their sources, name their writers, and print government-supplied “corrections” of any critical coverage. Papers that violated the law could be punished with a large fine and a ban on publishing restricted information. The Accurate News and Information Act was unquestionably the most blatant peacetime attempt to gag the press. In 1939, the Supreme Court of Canada found that the law was ultra vires (beyond) the powers of the Alberta government, ruling for the first time that provinces could not unilaterally restrict fundamental freedoms. Justice Lawrence Cannon accused the provincial government of imposing a doctrine that “must become, for the people of Alberta, a sort of religious dogma of which a free and uncontrolled discussion is not permissible.” [Alberta Press Bill, 1938] Writing one of Canada’s most cited legal decisions, Justice Lyman Duff argued that “even within its legal limits, it [public discussion] is liable to abuse and grave abuse, and such abuse is constantly exemplified before our eyes; but it is axiomatic that the practice of this right to free public discussion of public affairs, notwithstanding its incidental mischiefs, is the breath of life for parliamentary institutions.” –– Canada's Human Rights History: Home > Encyclopaedia > Events And Issues > Censorship How appropriate is this classification into this map? I'll enjoy comments on that one. Could this be about anything other, like 'race'? When the US and especially the South is yellow? South American Countries or the Baltics already were independent and were 'just' in turmoil or getting another round of military coups or dictatorship. We see a single one black communist/socialist dictatorship in the Soviet Union. With its leader Stalin indeed being the very odd one out and about touching the Arctic circle. All other black countries are right-wing 'civil' governments or military dictatorships. Like the full-on Vargas-Era one in Brazil. The most prominent leaders of those countries being cowered together into the lower right corner of the picture.
The grey areas are mostly European colonial 'possessions', like in Africa (Ethiopia an exception, but under Italian onslaught), or Asia (British India and Burma).  Now what exactly is it, that ""it could happen here"", in North American Canada?  That it's really mainly about creeping censorship, and through this lens how authoritarian regimes suppress freedom, by controlling the press, is shown for the other cases: Most Central American and Caribbean dictatorships were brutally repressive and able to curb most forms of overt protest, providing very limited political opportunities for social movements and forcing most opposition to remain hidden and organize covertly (Bulmer-Thomas 1987). For example, repressive policies were characteristic of the Ubico regime (1931–1944) in Guatemala who regularly tortured and killed political
  opponents, and signed several laws which would condone executions of laborers by landowners as a “disciplinary” measure (Grieb 1979). In Hon- duras, the government of Tiburcio Carías Andino (1932–1949) restricted civil liberties, created a secret police, and started a campaign of censor- ship and repression against any opposition (Meza 1985; Dodd 2005). And in Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza assassinated Augusto Sandino and 300 of his followers in Wiwili, used the National Guard as a spy network, and persecuted and killed any popular social movement that opposed his political power (Walter 1993). In contrast, some Southern cone dictatorships – though still repressive – were more permissive towards social organization of workers and peasants. This resulted in more opportunities for mobilization and patterns of repression and accommodation that sometimes led to the fall of dictatorial regimes. In Uruguay, for example, the short-lived dictatorship of General Terra (1933–1938) could not effectively repress a series of general strikes organized by the labor movement; this created enough pressure to make him call for elections that resulted in a more liberal government lasting through the 1950s (Korzeniewitz 2000).

Burma:  The Official Secrets Act was passed in 1923, which makes it unlawful for any person to possess classified information from the state. A decade later, the Burma Wireless Telegraphy Act was passed, criminalising possession of telegraphs without government permission. And of course more than just that.  It is often assumed that censorship was not used to any great degree by British authorities in Burma. Yet, by looking at the way the British colonial government reacted to a variety of media including traditional Burmese drama, western blockbuster movies, and Burmese political pamphlets agitating against colonial rule, it is possible to see that censorship was very much a part of the British administration. British authorities censored pamphlets, books, dramas, and movies not only to contain political thought contrary to colonialism, but also to control the image of British officials as seen in the eyes of the Burmese.

Bourque & Kay B. Warren: ""Democracy without Peace: The Cultural Politics of Terror in Peru"", Latin American Research Review, Vol. 24, No. 1 (1989), pp7–34;

The only weakness in this grouping would be the Baltics, as they really should be quite black? Since it was disputed in another answer: why was Greece coloured black? The 4th of August Regime (Greek: Καθεστώς της 4ης Αυγούστου, Kathestós tis tetártis Avgoústou), commonly also known as the Metaxas regime (Greek: Καθεστώς Μεταξά, Kathestós Metaxá), was a totalitarian regime under the leadership of General Ioannis Metaxas that ruled the Kingdom of Greece from 1936 to 1941.    Metaxas' policies such as the censorship of the media, the banning of political parties and prohibition of strikes copied contemporary European authoritarian regimes. As its far-right contemporaries Italy and Germany, the Greek State also had its political police force, the Asfaleia, based upon the Gestapo (its chief Maniadakis maintained a close relationship with Himmler on methods and techniques). The objective of Asfaleia was to secure public order. Or perhaps about China under Japanese control? Look no further than the magazine that published the map itself, John Maloney: ""Bow to the Sentry"", Ken Magazine, 30 June 1938, p70. Although that overstates Japanese control of China on the one hand and the continued control of the press before Japan 'went in': –– Lee-hsia Hsu Ting: ""Government Control of the Press in Modern China, 1900–1949"", Harvard University Press: Cambridge, 1974. (archive.org) If any medical/psychiatric diagnosis would go by a democratic majority consensus vote, then having a democracy or allowing freedom of speech was 'the crazy idea' in the 1930s… In any case, this map is referencing another map attributed to Carl William Ackerman, as a tiny bit wrongly explained in the quote in question.  Q Of note, Cotton has adapted and satirized Deal Carl Ackerman's contemporary ""map of the black plague in the 20th Century"" for this work First Dea_n of the newly established graduate School of Journalism program at Columbia University Carl Ackermann familiarised an American audience with the concept of censorship being the contagiously spreading black plague at the time. In 1938 Carl Ackerman, the dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, said,  If the Black Plague spreads to the United States, newspapers will be controlled by the Federal government, and this school's functtion will be to train agents of propaganda and enlightnment, teaching its students to recognize only that aspect of truth which is authorized by a central government. –– St John III Burton: ""Press Professionalization and Propaganda: The Rise of Journalistic Double-mindedness, 1917-1941"", Cambria Press, 2010. (p127) Referencing: ""Ackerman Calls for Action to save Freedom Of The Press"", Editor & Publisher,January 8, 1938, 5."" This is on the originally published map in Ken, the magazine, which itself  was investigated in 1938 by the House Un-American Activities Committee for being Communist leaning. However, its editor Arnold Gingrich denied that the publication had any political slant. Seldes maintained throughout his life that ""To these people [i.e, people like the House Un-American Activities Committee under Dies and later the McCarthyites ] 'one step left of center' meant 'leftist,' and 'leftist' meant 'red,' and 'red' of course meant 'Communist'"" (despite that when Seldes was cleared by McCarthy, the press did not report it). By the way: The backside of that map has this picture, fully in line with being just 'so 1938': 
 (src) Being under such an investigation from the Committee on Un-American Activities is then of course a wonderful opportunity for Ken's publisher Arnold Gingrich to point out what his concern was all about. That anti-fascism is the liberal thing to do, not identical to communism: I would like … to point out that democracy in America is now on the defensive,” Gingrich said. “Anybody who can read without moving his lips realizes that democracies at the present moment are showing what looks like a case of sprained, if not a broken, back.”  Gingrich went on to offer the committee evidence, gathered in the course of reporting pieces for Ken, of fascist activity in the United States.

That conservatism is just a slightly lighter black on its way to fascism isn't a new concept though. In 1934 Great Britain's Labor party already used the same metaphor. (Cf R. J. B.

  On Dean Ackerman's map there are much larger black splotches than on any of the other maps. He is trying to portray the prevalence of a relatively new disease, probably far more serious than any of those taken into account by Dean McKinley. His black splotches cover the whole of Russia, China. Japan, Siam, Arabia, Ethiopia, Libya, Egypt, Turkey, the Balkans, Italy, Spain. Portugal, Morocco, the Gold Coast, Angora, Mozambique, Yugoslavia, Brazil and Guatemala. There are also gray splotches indicating the areas into which the disease is spreading. These cover India, Burma, Lithuania, Latvia, most of Central America, Cuba, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Quebec and Alberta.
  Dean Ackerman labels his disease ""the black plague of the twentieth century.” It is the abolition of the freedom of the press by governments.
–– Evening star. [volume] (Washington, D.C.), January 07, 1938, Page A-8, Image 8 Clearly, Cotton took the entire theme and actual map info and added his info-graphic and cartoon, for the general theme of his publishing intents, without adding much in terms of re-colouring areas. The areas comprising this new Black Plague clearly encompasses more than half of the world. This wonderful drawing shows all of the characteristics of a pictorial map […], as well as Hornsby’s categories of pictorial maps showing amusement, instruction, place, industry (i.e., the military/industrial complex producing the weapons shown on the left), and the impending war and predicted postwar world if the dictators are not stopped.
–– Nick Kanas: ""Star Maps. History, Artistry, and Cartography"", Springer: Cham 32019. (p435) The map colouring is not just some crazy leftist's imagination.  Although those areas that are coloured yellow certainly would need a re-evaluation by today's standards, as the do show some moral bias. For example in Britain there was a certain 'freedom of the press', but it was for sure not free of censorship. The newspapers may have had some licence compared to other parts of the world but under the guise of morality and decency all media was subject to being called to be censored, like Joce's Ulysses or Virgina Woolf… This is examplified thusly: People in inter-war Britain knew little about sexuality, in part because of censorship policies and the legacy of previous censorship cases that discouraged the circulation of knowledge. Men and women did not have an adequate vocabulary to describe their own bodies, let alone the opposite sexes or the acts that bodies could perform. People lived in a culture of ignorance. Thousands wrote to Marie Stopes, the noted authority about sexuality, for information about birth control, abortion, sexual problems and sexual practices. The lack of information about these matters made bad conditions even worse. One infantry officer, unable to find basic birth control information, never consummated his marriage: “I have been married for nearly a year, but owing to the fact that I have been serving as an infantry officer in France, + having therefore a somewhat uncertain tenure in this world, our marriage has yet to be consummated.”103 He feared he would leave his wife pregnant and widowed. Another man's letter illustrates the ways that any information might have been useful. “We are both self-taught in the matter. To be candid for the first 4 months of our married life I did not know that it was necessary to move my body in any way. We only know of the one positions (sic) in which my wife is underneath + I am sure I nearly smother her sometimes. Now can you tell me of alternate positions + also is my wife supposed to move about?” Obscenity might not provide the best education on sexual matters but any information would have been better than none. Such small, sad stories illustrate the consequences of censorship; though state policies remained hidden, they still resulted in real suffering.
–– Lisa Z. Sigel: ""Censorship in Inter-War Britain: Obscenity, Spectacle, and the Workings of the Liberal State"", Journal of Social History vol. 45 no. 1, 2011, pp. 61–83. Such preoccupations reflect the centrality of important questions of political authority, economic crisis and escalating conflict to interwar historiography, the enduring power of national historical traditions, and constraints of sources and language. The centripetal tendencies of institutional histories of the press and an emphasis on the specific local contexts in which newspapers operated might similarly work against a systematic transnational comparison. The impassioned claims to press freedom voiced from Fleet Street and the power and personal influence of press barons like Beaverbrook and Rothermere in Britain, to take the most obvious example, provide sharp contrast to the forms of censorship and control elaborated in the emerging continental dictatorships. Through a close and careful analysis of the office records of newspapers in Germany and Italy, she draws attention to the striking influence of changing state policies on journalism and commercial advertising on the format, tone and content of German and Italian newspapers. Drawing on the office archives of popular journals like Frauenwarte and Il Popolo di Roma, Gaudenzi traces the everyday interventions and influences of officials from government departments like the Ministry of Popular Culture in Italy on the decisions made by journalists, editors and proprietors. Such interventions, she suggests, marked a growing collusion between the state and the professions of advertising and journalism* most evident in the ways in which official policies towards womanhood and consumerism began to pervade the popular press in both Germany and Italy. Through such interventions, Gaudenzi suggests, the boundaries between state and market collapsed. Yet the politicisation of the press was a feature of Europe’s democracies as well as its dictatorships. In Britain, for example, even the royal household employed a professional press officer between 1918 and 1931 in order to cultivate public opinion and sell what was often perceived as the fragile and anachronistic institution of monarchy to a modern mass democracy. There and in France, political parties sought to use the press to engage an expanding electorate. Whether debates around the power of the press coalesced around the influence of censorship and central control in the Fascist powers or the growing power accrued to the press baron within the capitalist marketplace, the concerns were broadly the same (Curran and Seaton 2003; Forgacs and Gundle 2007).

How did the ancient Romans count with their fingers?,"This page displays many Roman era testimonies that there was a system, and that it served to count at least up to the hundreds.
I'll copy here the most important ones. Juvenal in his Satire X, 246 251, referring to Nestor, famous in Antiquity for his longevity, clearly implies that units and tens were counted on the left hand and the hundreds were counted on the right hand: The king of Pylos (Nestor), if any credibility you give to the great Homer,
  was an example of life as long as that of the crow.
  Hugely lucky he who avoided his death for so many centuries
  and already counts his years with the right hand
  and has drunk the new wine so many times! In Apuleius' Apology, 89 , one finds convincing evidence in favour of the  signs for 10, 30 and 40 (given that we can look at them in the picture), as well as a first-hand account of the difficulty of the system:  If you had said thirty years old instead of ten, we may have thought that you had made a mistake in the act of numbering and you had opened the fingers you should have had in a circle shape. But forty, which are easier than any other to be expressed with the opened palm, which you increase in a half, cannot be an error in the gesture of the fingers, unless, thinking that Pudentilla is thirty years old, you have counted them double because of the two consuls there are every  year"". Also Quintilian in his Institutio Oratoria, I, 10, 35 makes this difficulty evident: In the processes some tasks or questions to check the participants ´skills on the use of numbers are very common and in them they are considered ignorant not only those ones who hesitate or doubt on the sums, but those who fail on the account by the wrong or clumsy gesture of the fingers as well. These three sources ought to make the picture more believable, and in fact,  ""it seems that St. Cyril of Alexandria (c. 376-444) in his Liber de computo (Calculating, Computing or Counting Book), chapter CXXXVIII, entitled De flexibus digitorum, III, 135 (about the positions of the fingers) provides us the earliest description of the system"". So Bede's description owes to that. The following is an illustration present in the Distinctio secunda, Tractatus quartus of Luca Pacioli's Summa de Arithmetica, geométrica, proportioni et proportionalita (1494, Venice):  The earliest graphical representation is probably found in Rabanus Maurus' De Numeris (9th century):  It is also important to note there was one such system (the same?*) in Greece; Aristophanes refers to it, for example, in his comedy The Wasps (pages 655-663): Bdelycleon (the one who hates Cleon).- Listen to me, dear little father, unruffle that frowning brow and reckon, you can do so without trouble, not with pebbles, but on your fingers. According to Professor Michele Scolari's blog (Italian), an analogous system existed in Persia. It was described in the Persian dictionary Farhangi Djihangiri (XVI century), but Plutarch speaks of ""finger calculations"" at the court of the Persian King Artaxerxes III, who lived between the fourth and third century BC. *Scolari suggests that indigitatio, the art of counting with fingers, originated in Egypt - traces of it can be seen in a group of scultures (which he calls Censimento del bestiame (""Livestock census""), though I'm failing to identify this group or at least its English name) displayed at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo - and then spread to the Greco-Roman and Persian worlds. Alberto Angela in his A day in the Life of Ancient Rome gives credit to the system, giving (Italian) another depiction of it as well as stating that a consequence of this counting system can be seen still today, in how people count in some souks in the Arab world.  Angela states that numbers up to 10000 could be expressed with fingers, combining the two hands. But obviously a number like 1234 would be expressed in 4 steps, not (impossibly) all at once albeit with the two hands, as the other answer misleadingly puts it. Given that the Romans read from left to right and wrote numbers starting from the largest ""digit"" (like MCCXXXIIII), it's safe to say the steps would be: first, make the sign for 1000 with your right hand; then, make the sign for 200 with that same hand; then make the sign for 30 with your left hand, and finally make the sign for 4 again with your left hand."
Why were there no religious wars in Poland?,"That Poland avoided internal wars of religion can indeed be attributed to the religious tolerance of the state at this time, a tolerance that stretches back a long time. And this has to do with it's position, where many of its neighbouring countries were not Catholic. To the east the Kievan Rus adopted Orthodoxy, and further north the areas now known as Lithuania remained pagan until the end of the 14th century, by which time the pagan Lithuanian kings had expanded their rule to cover much of the Orthodox Kievan Rus. Although the Lithuanian rulers adopted Catholicism (in a failed attempt to stop the Teutonic Order ""crusading"" in Lithuania) much of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania remained Orthodox. Soon after the official Christianization of Lithuania a Polish-Lithuanian Union was created. This means that the Polish kings had not only the Catholic church, but also several different Orthodox churches in their area. At that point the rulers had a choice between either trying to forcefully convert everyone to the same church (but then, which one?) or just adopt an attitude of religious tolerance. But Poland's leaders was constantly busy fending off enemies like the Teutonic knights (early 15th century), the Bohemians (15th century), the Crimean Tatars (attacked on 75 separate occasions between 1474 and 1569) and the Grand Duchy of Moscow (pretty much all the time). That meant that it needed to concentrate on defending itself rather than bothering with religion, so the obvious solution was to just let people go to whatever church they wanted. When the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was created in 1569, it also had a system with checks and balances on power, meaning that the King couldn't have forced a religion on the people even if he wanted to, which continued the religious tolerance, made official in the above mentioned Warsaw Confederation. To a large extent then, the religious tolerance was to prevent internal religious wars, due to having many churches. This tolerance then paved the way for other religions. The tolerance may also have had some source in the relatively large Jewish population living in Poland since the 10th century. This population seems to have been tolerated by polish kings and princes for economic reasons. But the question then arises why this happened in Poland and not in other places, and I suspect that once again the answer is that the Polish was dealing and trading with both Orthodox and pagans anyway. If this is multi-culturalism that creates tolerance, or tolerance that creates multi-culturalism, depends entirely on your definition of multi-cultural. But I would say that with normal definitions it's not multi-cultural to have several different churches in a country, but it is multi-cultural to have many ethnic groups and religions. And with that definition it is the tolerance that creates the multi-culturalism, and not the other way.

Were Medieval Britons aware of the existence of the Roman Empire?,"Educated Britons would've received an education deeply steeped in classical antiquity, so knowledge of the Roman Empire must have been inevitable among the literate. Unsurprisingly, therefore, many writings from this time period mention Roman Britain. Notable examples include the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, both of which mention Rome. These date to around the 9-12th centuries and the 8th century, respectively. The common folk would have been acquainted with the Romans too, both because of knowledge filtering through from the learned class, and because of retained traditions. Much of these folklore were later recorded by scribes or poets, or otherwise served as inspiration for their literary traditions. Examples include pseudohistorical works that speak of Rome, such as the fantastical 9th-century Historia Brittonum and the 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae. The latter became especially popular during the High Middle Age and gave rise to a lot of British folklore. Among them is the legend of Maximianus, ""the only Roman emperor to occupy an important place in later British folklore[1]."" This is the same story @ForestPines mentioned earlier, and probably predates Geoffrey of Monmouth writing it down in his Historia. Thus, we may safely conclude Medieval Britons indeed knew about the Romans. [1]: Jones, Michael E. The End of Roman Britain. Cornell University Press, 1998."
Why did the Soviet Union name their strongest bomb Tsar Bomba?,"The official designation for that particular device was the RDS-220. The nickname Tsar Bomba was an appellation applied by the West, rather than the designers of the bomb (who - according to the site linked above - apparently referred to it as Big Ivan, or simply the Big Bomb). According to the information on nuclearweaponarchive.org, The nickname Tsar Bomba is a reference to a famous Russian tradition for making gigantic artifacts for show. The world's largest bell (the Tsar Kolokol) and cannon (the Tsar Pushka) are on display at the Kremlin. The only reference to the device that I could find made by a member of the design team simply refers to the RDS-220 as the ""Big Bomb"": ""... Krushchev was already familiar with the test program, and in particular with our program to explode a device of record-breaking power, the ""Big Bomb""."" (It's worth noting that ""Big Bomb"" is the English translation from the original Russian. It would be interesting to know if there is an alternative translation if anyone has access to a copy in Russian). In any event, since Sakharov headed the design team, the fact that he doesn't use the term Tsar Bomb in his memoirs would seem to support the idea that it is a western designation for the device."
Why did the United States not resort to nuclear weapons in Vietnam?,"The US did not resort to using nuclear weapons in Vietnam for a variety of reasons: fear of the damage it would cause to the US's international reputation, domestic political considerations, a reluctance to break the 'tradition' of non-use, and a realization that, although there were plenty of viable targets such as airfields, ports and supply lines, only extensive use of nuclear weapons would be likely to have a decisive military impact. Added to this was the strong opposition on moral grounds from key figures such as Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, and President Johnson's concern at the long-term consequences of the use of such weapons. A 1966 CIA Memorandum for the Director came out strongly against the use of nuclear weapons in Vietnam for a variety of reasons. Principle among these were that there would be widespread and fundamental revulsion that the US had broken
the 20-year taboo on the use of nuclear weapons. Another section adds weight to the above point: Their use in Vietnam, regardless of the circumstances, would send a
wave of fear and anger through most of the informed world. The report also mentions that there would be intense agitation in Japan, probably leading to a restriction
US use of Japanese facilities and possibly to denunciation of the US -
Japan defense treaty...[and] a probably resolution of condemnation in the UN; and a marked diminution of such public support as US policy in Vietnam now has. The report also says that the use of nuclear weapons might lead to a Chinese withdrawal but we think it more likely that they would not do so At the same time, though, the author(s) believed that the USSR would not use nuclear weapons or otherwise become directly involved. Instead, the Soviets would exploit the US action for propaganda purposes. Among other possible or likely negative consequences, the report mentions There were other opinions, though. Tannenwald notes that, in a report in May 1967, the Joint Chiefs raised the possibility of using nuclear weapons in southern China, a prospect described by General Robert Ginsburgh in a September 1967 memo as ""virtually unthinkable"" when he was deputy to national security advisor Walt Rostow. Less than a year later, the US commander in Vietnam, General William Westmoreland approved a planned contingency operation called Fracture Jaw which recommended the use of tactical nuclear weapons in January 1968: Westmoreland cabled to Admiral Sharp a recommendation that the
Commander in Chief, Pacific (CINCPAC), and MACV begin contingency
planning for the use of tactical nuclear weapons in northern Quang Tri
if necessary to prevent a major defeat. He noted that in the
uninhabited mountains around Khe Sanh, such weapons could be used with
great effect and with “negligible” civilian casualties. When the White House found out, which it inevitably had to as only the President could approve the transfer of nuclear weapons to Vietnam, the plan was quickly shut down. In a memorandum to President Johnson, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara stated that the use of nuclear weapons was not an option because of terrain and other conditions peculiar to our operations in
South Vietnam, it is inconceivable that the use of nuclear weapons
would be recommended there against either Viet Cong or North
Vietnamese forces Rumours of the proposed use of nuclear weapons had also become public by February 9th: By that time...the issue had become public in the United States, with
Senator Eugene McCarthy and others charging that the military was
preparing to use nuclear weapons in South Vietnam. The administration,
facing a domestic and foreign outcry, publicly disavowed any such
intent. Further, according to Tom Johnson who was then ""a young special assistant to the president and note-taker at the meetings on the issue"" “When he [the President] learned that the planning had been set in
motion, he was extraordinarily upset and forcefully sent word through
Rostow, and I think directly to Westmoreland, to shut it down,”... He said the president’s fear was “a wider war” in which the Chinese
would enter the fray, as they had in Korea in 1950. Johnson had already gone on record as being opposed to the use of nuclear weapons. In a speech on Labor Day 1964, he said: For 19 peril-filled years no nation has loosed the atom against
another. To do so now is a political decision of the highest order.
And it would lead us down an uncertain path of blows and counterblows
whose outcome none may know. No President of the United States can
divest himself of the responsibility for such a decision. Source: Chapter 6 in Nina Tannenwald, 'The Nuclear Taboo: The United States and the Non-Use of Nuclear Weapons Since 1945' (2008) Johnson was, at the time, campaigning against the 'pro-use of nuclear weapons' Barry Goldwater but then United States Under Secretary of State McGeorge Bundy said LBJ's speech wasn't just politics: Bundy wrote later that although there was politics in Johnson’s
speech, there was “passionate conviction” as well. Two factors
appeared to be key in Johnson’s thinking: the long-term effect of any
use of the bomb “on the survival of man” – a prudential consideration
– and the desire not to be the first president in twenty years to use
nuclear weapons, that is, to break the powerful “tradition” of non-use
that had now developed – a taboo consideration. Source: Tannenwald It wasn't just the people at the top of the administration such Johnson, Bundy and McNamara who were against the use of nuclear weapons: Most scientists and civilian defense analysts involved in policy
advising opposed use of nuclear weapons in Vietnam, for both military
and moral reasons. Source: Tannenwald As an example of the above, see this March 1967 report Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia. One exception to this opposition was the physicist Samuel T. Cohen who, although defiant, wrote that: anyone in the Pentagon who was caught thinking seriously of using
nuclear weapons in this conflict would find his neck in the wringer in
short order. Source: Samuel Cohen, 'The Truth About the Neutron Bomb' (1983) Tannenwald summarizes the decision to not use nuclear weapons in Vietnam thus: Several considerations motivated non-use of nuclear weapons in
Vietnam: the possibility of inadvertent and uncontrolled escalation
with the consequences this entailed for US vulnerabilities,
preservation of the tradition of non-use, and finally a taboo, a
normative belief that using nuclear weapons would be wrong. For many
US leaders, nuclear weapons were morally repugnant. To be militarily
decisive, such weapons would probably have to have been used in large
numbers, and this would have been politically and normatively
unacceptable."
Why did Lincoln wait to issue the Emancipation Proclamation?,"@Peter Diehr's answer is a good one and I've upvoted it - but I'd like to expand on that, remembering that Lincoln was a very good strategist.   First, The Civil War was about slavery, and the South's (correct) understanding was that the North was growing faster than it was and free states would sooner or later substantially outnumber slave states. (Some of the nominally slave states allowed slavery, but were not economically dependent on it as were the Deep South states.  Sentiment for abolition was growing in those states, also.  Slavery was doomed under the Union.) If the South did nothing, they lost in maybe twenty years when the North would have the political power to abolish slavery.  They had to secede when they did. Lincoln, on the other hand, had history on his side. If he could hold the Union together, then slavery was doomed.  Until the war was beyond settlement, his best bet to abolish slavery was to try to keep the Union together.  So in the early days he insisted his only purpose was to hold the Union together. Secondly, the Union included several border states which allowed slavery, but where it wasn't the bedrock of the economy. To have a decent chance of winning the war militarily, the North had to hold on to those states. So even the Emancipation Proclamation didn't free the slaves in Union states!  Key point: For the Emancipation Proclamation to have effect anywhere it needed to not push the slave states still in the Union into rebellion. So it had to exempt them. And then thirdly, as Peter says, once Lincoln had a strong Union victory he could start pushing explicitly on ending slavery. Once the North (and foreign countries, especially Great Britain) saw that the Union would end slavery and had to power to do it its moral authority was immeasurably strengthened which sped the end of the war."
When was drinking water recognized as crucial in marathon running?,"Before 1970 Up until about 1970, it was thought to be harmful to drink water while running a marathon, and a marathon course might have no aid stations or only one. Marathon runners were actively discouraged from drinking water. For a description of this period, see this interview. 1970-80 In 1969, a paper by Wyndham and Strydom (""The danger of an inadequate water intake during marathon running,"" S Afr Med J. 19;43(29):893) argued that marathon runners should be allowed to drink fluids in order to prevent heat stroke. From about 1972 to 1981, a South African researcher and runner named Tim Noakes started a  campaign through publications such as Runner's World to get people to pay attention to the Wyndham paper and drink fluids during a marathon. The American College of Sports Medicine wrote guidelines saying that people should drink regularly while running. This was also the period when so-called sports drinks were becoming popular. In 1969, Gatorade started to be marketed in the US, and it was designated the official sports drink of the NFL. Aided by these commercial interests, the scientifically unfounded idea began to be propagated that drinking before thirst was necessary in order to prevent heat stroke. Studies were carried out with football players in which it was claimed that drinking early versions of Gatorade led to increased performance, but the methodology was not capable of discerning whether this was a placebo effect. A physiologist named David Costill had distance runners run on a treadmill without water, and then in separate trials drinking 1.2 liters per hour (which is a huge amount of water). He found that body temperatures were lower if they drank water. The meager evidence from studies like Costill's was overinterpreted, and in many case overzealous people began to simply invent scientifically unsupported guidelines for hydration. The US military adopted guidelines calling for soldiers to drink 64 ounces of water per hour. During this same period, a cultural idea in the US of ""getting back to the land"" led to a craze for wilderness backpacking, and with this came further anxiety about water. This included a scare about contracting giardiasis from backcontry water sources in the US, which turns out to have been unfounded (Zell, ""Epidemiology of wilderness-acquired diarrhea: implications for prevention and treatment,"" Wilderness and Environmental Medicine 3 (1992) 241). 1980- During this period, scientists began to do more complete and careful studies, which showed that drinking large amounts of water was bad. It decreases performance, and can lead to a dangerous condition called hyponatremia. Studies with larger samples in real-world conditions showed that post-race body temperatures were not reduced by drinking more water (Noakes et al., ""The danger of an inadequate water intake during prolonged exercise,"" European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology 57 (1988) 210). Despite the scientific consensus that emerged by the end of the century, the irrational and extreme fear of dehydration began to grow in the popular consciousness, leading even sedentary people to believe that they were in danger. For example, there was a folk belief that one should drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day (""8x8"") (Valtin, ""'Drink at least eight glasses of water a day.' Really? Is there scientific evidence for '8x8'?,"" Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 283: R993-R1004, 2002)."
What were Hitler's religious beliefs?,"That's an interesting question. There is a book by Michael Hesemann, a German historian, in which he is interpreting Hitler's religion (that is actually the title of the book) like this: Hitler's plans were going towards a ""German pseudo-religion"". Hitler got his first ideas from the ""Ostara""-magazine, which was published from 1903 to 1931 and propagated Aryan and antisemitic theories. The publisher, an Austrian named Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels, wanted to get his followers to convert to Protestantism, but most of the Austrian population was strictly Catholic at this time, so he failed. So Hitler, not wanting to share the fate of Liebenfels, had to keep a Catholic facade. He needed the church (Catholic and Protestant) to get a chance to achieve his goals. Hitler found his idol in Richard Wagner. In his beliefs, Jesus Christ was Aryan, but was affected and influenced by the Jews and therefore his teachings were distorted. Hitler's target was actually to destroy Christianity to make way for his German religion, but considering the percentage of German Christians, this was not possible, so Hitler started with the Jewish population. Nonetheless there have been assaults on Catholic churches and priests too. According to Hesemann, the destruction of Christianity in the Third Reich would have been Hitler's plan after the ""Endsieg"". So, personally, I can't say if that is the truth, but it seems reasonable in some factors, but I want to close with a quote from Hitler, spoken in 1941: Christianity is a rebellion against natural law, a protest against
nature. Taken to its logical extreme, Christianity would mean the
systematic cultivation of the human failure. Source: Michael Hesemann - Hitlers Religion"
Is there any proof that Robin Hood existed?,"So yes, there were Robin Hoods. But not precisely the one you're thinking of."
How were smallpox vaccines enforced in the US?,"After a brief period of federal control in the early 1800s, administration of the smallpox vaccine was mainly left to the states. Because of that, there is more than a century of different laws, mandates, and vaccination campaigns to sift through. To keep things simple, we can look at a few big court cases and outbreaks to get a general idea of what states did to eradicate smallpox through vaccination. In short, smallpox vaccinations could be enforced among adults through fines for noncompliance, children were often required to be vaccinated to attend public school, and people were just generally encouraged or willing to get vaccinated to prevent or control outbreaks. In 1813, Congress passed the Vaccine Act of 1813, which had half a sentence authorizing a federal agent to preserve the vaccine for any citizen who asked for it, and two paragraphs devoted to how that agent could use the postal system to distribute it: ...That the President of the United States be, and he is hereby authorized to appoint an agent to preserve the genuine vaccine matter, and to furnish the same to any citizen of the United States, whenever it may be applied for, through the medium of the post-office; Unfortunately, it seems that in 1821 a doctor appointed as the federal agent caused an outbreak in North Carolina by accidentally sending a sample of smallpox rather than the vaccine, and the law was soon repealed. For the rest of the 19th century, states implemented their own measures to control any smallpox outbreaks, including mandatory vaccinations in certain situations and different punishments for noncompliance. In 1905, Jacobson v. Massachusetts established that compulsory vaccine laws were constitutional, and the text of the decision provides a good overview of vaccine laws in Massachusetts at the time: This case involves the validity, under the Constitution of the United States, of certain provisions in the statutes of Massachusetts relating to vaccination. The Revised Laws of that commonwealth, chap. 75, § 137, provide that 'the board of health of a city or town, if, in its opinion, it is necessary for the public health or safety, shall require and enforce the vaccination and revaccination of all the inhabitants thereof, and shall provide them with the means of free vaccination. Whoever, being over twenty-one years of age and not under guardianship, refuses or neglects to comply with such requirement shall forfeit $5.' In short, towns were allowed to require everyone to get a free vaccination, and adults who refused would be fined $5 (about $150 today). In 1902, the city of Cambridge enacted such a requirement: Proceeding under the above statutes, the board of health of the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, on the 27th day of February, 1902, adopted the following regulation: 'Whereas, smallpox has been prevalent to some extent in the city of Cambridge, and still continues to increase; and whereas, it is necessary for the speedy extermination of the disease that all persons not protected by vaccination should be vaccinated; and whereas, in the opinion of the board, the public health and safety require the vaccination or revaccination of all the inhabitants of Cambridge; be it ordered, that all the inhabitants habitants of the city who have not been successfully vaccinated since March 1st, 1897, be vaccinated or revaccinated.' Subsequently, the board adopted an additional regulation empowering a named physician to enforce the vaccination of persons as directed by the board at its special meeting of February 27th. The Supreme Court found this vaccination requirement to be within a state's power to enact, and in their decision they reference cases involving vaccinations as a condition to go to school: And the principle of vaccination as a means to prevent the spread of smallpox has been enforced in many states by statutes making the vaccination of children a condition of their right to enter or remain in public schools.

Williamsport School District, 162 Pa. 476, 25 L. R. A. 152, 29 Atl. 742. That list references cases in Indiana, Georgia, North Carolina, California, Connecticut, Vermont, and Pennsylvania, indicating that school children across the country were being vaccinated for smallpox, much like they are for a variety of diseases today. These sorts of vaccination requirements helped control smallpox outbreaks, and by the 1950's smallpox was essentially eliminated from the US. The last major outbreak occurred in New York in 1947, when a couple returned to New York City from a vacation in Mexico. Eugene Le Bar had apparently been exposed to smallpox in Mexico, and caused a small outbreak that resulted in 12 confirmed cases and 2 deaths. As a result of these cases, a massive vaccination campaign was launched to prevent a larger outbreak. Vaccinations weren't required, but an ad campaign and door-to-door volunteers urged people to go to newly set up vaccination clinics, leading to most of the city being vaccinated within a few weeks."
Which monarch had the longest break in their reign?,"Norodom Sihanouk was crowned King of Cambodia on 3 May 1941. At the time, Cambodia was a colony of France, so he was not really a head of state yet. But he remained king, and therefore head of state, of Cambodia when the country became independent on 9 November 1953. He then abdicated on 2 March 1955. After that point, Norodom Sihanouk was appointed prime minister and effectively ruled the country, but he was not formally the monarch or the head of state: the monarch and head of state was his father Norodom Suramarit. After his father died on 3 April 1960, Norodom Sihanouk's mother Sisowath Kossamak became Queen of Cambodia. Her son Sihanouk became head of state, but was not formally crowned king. On 9 October 1970, following a coup, Sisowath Kossamak was deposed as queen and Norodom Sihanouk was deposed as head of state, and Cambodia became the Khmer Republic. Norodom Sihanouk went in exile. In 1975, after a civil war, Cambodia became Democratic Kampuchea. Norodom Sihanouk was formally the head of state of Democratic Kampuchea from 17 April 1975 until April 1976, after which he was under house arrest, then went again into exile. Following the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime, Norodom Sihanouk returned to Cambodia in November 1991. The constituent assembly declared him head of state again in 1993, and on 21 September 1993 a new constitution went into force, making Cambodia a kingdom with Norodom Sihanouk as its king. He then reigned (with very limited political power) until his second abdication in 2004. If you only count the times when Norodom Sihanouk was formally a monarch, there was a 38-year gap (1955–1993). If you count all the times when he was head of state, the largest gap is a less impressive, but still significant 17 years (1975-1993). (Apologies for only referencing Wikipedia, but I don't think any of the facts that are relevant to this question are in dispute. If I have inadvertently misrepresented Cambodia's complex history, please correct me.)"
Have American urban rioters ever looted residences?,"To pick just one notorious example, 99 years ago to the day, black people's homes were heavily looted by whites in the Tulsa riots of 1921. As this article describes, at least 65 looters were arrested. In addition to taking basic goods like sacks of flour, they opened up safes in people's homes to take gold and silver. EDIT, July 2020: I should have made clear that the looting was not the central aspect of this event. It was a massacre and (as @T.E.D. pointed out in a comment) the total destruction of a prosperous black neighborhood called Greenwood. Excavations of a potential mass grave recently began in Tulsa. The Washington Post reports Historians believe that as many as 300 black people were killed, and 40 square blocks of what was known as Black Wall Street were destroyed by fire. The destruction included more than 1,250 homes, churches, schools, businesses, a hospital and library."
Why were helmets and other body armour not commonplace in the 1800s?,"Looking at this slightly backwards, you could ask what are the factors that have enabled the supply of body armor to the modern infantry soldier?  Modern ballistic materials, such as kevlar, are comparatively lightweight and flexible, so armor can be manufactured in a small range of sizes and self-tailored (with straps, velcro, elastic, etc) to fit and so does little to interfere with the soldiers ability to fight. The cost of training a modern soldier is high and there is also a public expectation that the government will protect them as well as they can be protected.  A modern soldier is transported to the battlefield (by ship/plane/vehicle or combination of those) and is driven around the battlefield in an APC or flown in a helicopter, so the extra weight of their armor not a long-term factor. Modern battlefield first-aid and medical care is such that even a badly wounded soldier stands a good chance of survival, so preventing an immediately fatal wound occuring in the first place also improves the soldiers chances of returning to service.  In comparison, a rigid metal breastplate/backplate is far less practical. Getting an exact fit for each soldier would be much harder and tailoring each to its owner would be more expensive. Potentially you might be able to manufacture an adjustable metal armor but that would drive up the cost (and probably the weight too). Without a good fit it would be uncomfortable to wear and might actually interfere with soldier's movement and, therefore, their ability to fight. As the campaign progressed, the soldiers would almost certainly lose weight, which would mean that a breastplate that was a good fit when they left home becomes a loose fit after a few months in the field.  Also the 19th Century infantry soldier was literally a foot soldier, they marched to and from the battlefield (in some cases over hundreds of miles). The soldier had to carry everything they owned, their weapon(s), ammunition, uniform(s), cooking utensils, blankets, etc. Including a set of rigid armor would add both weight and encumbrance. They wouldn't want to wear the armor the whole time so it would have to be slung from the backpack in some manner. So would there be an actual benefit to the 19th Century soldier of having this extra armor? Studies of casualties during the Napoleonic campaigns have shown that only about 30% of the French army's fatalities at the time were from battlefield injuries. The biggest dangers to the soldier were disease and malnutrition. Body armor would provide no protection against the first and its added burden would accelerate the second.  This situation didn't change much through the century, two-thirds of the fatalities in the American Civil war were due to disease. There were similar figures for the Crimean War: It is worth noting that the majority of deaths were not a result of combat but rather that of disease. For example, 2,755 of the British Empire’s force were killed in action compared to the 17,580 who died of disease.  On the battlefield, the majority of wounds would have been from direct fire weapons; muskets, rifles, solid shot (cannonballs, grape and cannister shot). For example, from an analysis of the injuries at the Battle of Waterloo: There were, over the course of the four-day campaign, around 100,000 casualties to care for. About 60% of wounds were caused by small-arms from low-energy transfer injuries fired by smooth bore muzzle-loading fusils, carbines and pistols...Wounds from heavy (3–12lbs) iron round shot were usually fatal if received centrally or on the head and neck. Many limbs were avulsed by round shot. Tangential strikes by these large balls could cause severe tissue internal disruption.  There were similar figures for the American Civil war, where small arms accounted for 51.8% of battle injuries, with cannon an additional 5.7%. It's probably worth noting that bladed weapons, such as sabers and bayonets (which body armor might have provided protection against) accounted for less than one percent of these battlefield injuries.   It would have been possible to manfacture armor plate that could withstand musket and early rifle rounds but these would require thick plating that would have been unreasonably heavy for an infantry soldier. No practical armor plate would be able to stop cannon-fired shot. By comparison to the modern battlefield, in the early part of the century there was far less shrapnel (shell fragments) flying about. Early in the century there were field howitzers firing explosive shells but these were comparatively rare and their method of fusing meant that many of the fired shells were ineffective. By the end of the century, guns firing high-explosive shells were the most common form of artillery. The shrapnel from these shells would be travelling at similar velocities to rifle rounds so the armor required to stop those would be prohibitively heavy. If a soldier was wounded, the lack of effective medical care on the battlefield and the lack of hygiene in first aid in general would mean that a soldiers chances of a return to service were low. Even a minor wound could become infected and cause the loss of a limb or even death.  ...while musket balls, grape shot and sabre slashes could be lethal enough, but even superficial wounds could be fatal. Field hospitals were notoriously unhygienic and without antibiotics common infections were deadly. 
  source So armor that prevented a fatal chest wound might only mean that the soldier ends up dying a slower, more painful death in a field hospital. From a brutal economic point of view, it was more cost effective to have the men die on the battlefield than it was to treat the wounded and have them die later. So if you were in charge of 19th Century army and you wanted to improve survival rates for your men, it would be far more productive to spend your money on additional food and improving heath care than on body armor."
Why didn't Britain's nuclear weapons deter Argentina from invading the Falklands?,"Because no one in their right minds would think Britain should use a weapon of mass destruction on Argentina over the Falklands, what with its 1600 population. Even then the well documented concept of a nuclear taboo was in effect. No one regarded nuclear bombs as normal bombs, and therefore no one wanted to use it so casually. The Falkland Islands were not, after all, in any way an existential crisis for Britain. The Argentinians specifically were undeterred because they didn't really think the United Kingdom would actually respond (that is, aside from diplomatic noises). Their hope was that a quick, clean takeover would present a fait accompli that London would then have to live with. In this they were inspired by the Indian takeover of Goa which was similarly greeted only with indignant but quickly-forgotten words. Several specific events reinforced this belief in the Junta's minds: There was a good deal of bellicose comment in the Argentine press in late February and early March ... It would have been absurd to dispatch the fleet every time there was bellicose talk in Buenos Aires.  -- Margaret Thatcher in the House of Commons, 3 April 1982"
Were kamikaze pilots an effective strategy for Japan?,"The general argument goes something like this: It can be argued that it was the most effective tactic for the situation they found themselves in, and I'll leave that argument to Military History Visualized: Kamikaze Tactics - Insane or Rational?. Because it was a more effective tactic didn't make it an effective tactic, as we'll see below. And it doesn't make it an effective strategy, meaning a plan to achieve their goals. What was Japan's goal? The general argument goes something like this: I'm not aware of the US demanding unconditional surrender until the Potsdam Declaration in July 1945, Japan knew the war was lost a year before that.  And how are they supposed to use kamikaze to force negotiations if the US won't negotiate? However, Japan was trying to negotiate an end to the war... in a piecemeal and lackluster fashion. They were also preparing a desperate defense against invasion... while throwing away battleship Yamato to save face and continuing to fight on the mainland (note: I don't have much information about what their thinking was for their mainland army). If that doesn't strike you has a coherent strategy, it wasn't. Japanese high command could not come to a consensus about how to end the war right up to the end. Were kamikaze pilots [part of] an effective strategy for Japan? Which strategy? Japan was fighting to the last, fighting to negotiate, fighting in China, and willing to accept unconditional surrender all at the same time. Whichever way you slice it, the kamikaze strategy was supposed to make invasion so costly the US would blink first. From day one Japan made many bad bets on US resolve and always lost. In the end Japan blinked first under the weight of an entirely predictable worsening situation. Kamikaze strategy only works if you have the resolve to see it through. While they were probably doing more damage than they could with conventional attacks, they weren't doing significant damage to an increasingly overwhelming Allied fleet. With conventional attacks the Japanese sank roughly 2 battleships, 4 fleet carriers, 1 light carrier, 3 escort carriers, and 7 heavy cruisers without even getting into the lighter ships. In comparison, kamikazes sank 3 escort carriers, 14 destroyers, and a few dozen transports and auxiliaries. Additional heavy vessels were damaged, but the US was very good at repairing ships and their experienced crews would fight on. The impact of kamikazes gets worse once you look at them in context. After Hornet was lost at Santa Cruz in Oct 1942, the damaged USS Enterprise was the only operational US fleet carrier. The naval battles of Guadalcanal were chewing up US cruisers and battleships such that they were running out. Each US vessel damaged or lost during this period could have a large impact on the war. Fast forward to the Battle of Okinawa, April 1945, and the Allies arrive with... Much is made of USS Bunker Hill, but damaging even several fleet carriers is not going to stop this fleet. Their crew will survive. Their air groups will survive and can be reassigned. The ships will be repaired and return for the 1946 invasion. A dozen more were being built or working up. Tactically it was ineffective. Strategically it was hopeless. The Japanese were throwing away aircraft, fuel, and pilots they could have been husbanding for the invasion of the home islands and not even gaining a local tactical advantage for it. It only made the situation worse. Conventional vs kamikaze presents a false dichotomy between very hopeless and hopeless. There was one sane option on the table: surrender effect a settlement of the present situation by resorting to an extraordinary measure as the Emperor put it. Japan made a number of bad bets about attacking the United States. All of Prime Minister Tojo's offensives in 1944 failed and he was forced to resign. Prior to the Potsdam Declaration of July 1945 Japan could have negotiated while they had something to negotiate with. Starting in spring 1945 the Japanese began pressing the ""neutral"" Soviets to mediate peace talks with the US. The Soviets strung the Japanese along while they planned to invade Manchuria. At best the Japanese could hope the Soviets waited until their neutrality treaty expired in April 1946. They didn't. After Potsdam the Japanese could have simply accepted the terms, or just tried to negotiate anyway. They did both. Right up until the Emperor made his decision the Supreme War Council was split between accepting unconditional surrender and trying to hold out for some guarantees and concessions. Kamikaze tactics were not going to win the war; they were never going to get better at it, and the Allies were only going to get better at defending against it. While Japan had large reserves of aircraft, they did not have the industry to replace them. Their kamikaze attacks would only get weaker using fewer and increasingly obsolescent aircraft and pilots with less and less training. The Allied fleet was only going to get stronger with more and increasingly superior aircraft and training. Even if kamikaze convinced the Allies that invasion was too costly, the Japanese knew the Allies were not going to fight their way across the Pacific and then just walk away. The best outcome they could hope for was blockade, bombardment, bombings, starvation, revolt, and Soviet invasion. The issue of Japanese surrender is a very large topic: the fear of unconditional surrender, the sanctity of the Emperor, military leadership sacrificing their people to stay in power... I have my own answer. I just want to remind everyone that when discussing last-ditch WW2 tactics, even if they didn't like the terms, surrender was always an option. And that's the option Japan took after a year of bloodletting. Kamikaze tactics were the result of multiple failed strategies. Why did Japan have a shortage of trained pilots? Why did they have a shortage of fuel? These problems could have been solved, or mitigated, well before the situation became desperate. Even before the war started. Japanese aviation was set up for a short, sharp war. They had their existing squadrons of highly trained pilots, but limited means of replacing and replenishing them. Unlike the US, they did not set up a continuous training regimen to make good their losses. While in the early war they might have outfought the Americans, every lost pilot was irreplaceable. Japanese aviation got weaker and less experienced while the US got stronger and more experienced. The Japanese started the war with a superior but ""unbalanced"" aircraft, the A6M Zero. It required an experienced pilot to exploit its strengths and protect its weak points. Increasingly experienced US pilots learned to overcome their aircraft's disadvantages and exploit the Zero's weaknesses with tactics such as the Thach Weave. Superior Allied aircraft arrived, such as the F6F Hellcat and F4U Corsair. The Japanese continued to fly the Zero with less and less experienced pilots culminating in the Battle of the Philippine Sea aka the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot losing 600 aircraft and their irreplaceable pilots. It didn't have to go this way. The Japanese had been at war for years prior to attacking the US. They had ample time to establish a proper pilot training and air group rotation system to make up for wartime loses. Increasing loses of existing airframes due to loss of experienced pilots diverted resources away from developing superior aircraft such as the N1K and Ki-84 delaying their introduction until it was too late; there wasn't the fuel to use them, nor the experienced pilots to exploit them. Why did the Japanese have a shortage of fuel? They succeeded in March 1942 conquering the oil fields of the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia). They had plenty of capacity in Japan to refine fuel. But they were losing it in transit to an increasingly effective American anti-shipping effort. Despite being an island nation and able to watch and learn from British experience in WW1 and WW2, their anti-submarine equipment and tactics were very poor. They never employed a convoy system. The situation became so desperate they resorted to using small cargo ships and tankers hugging coastlines in the hopes of avoiding Allied submarines and aircraft. This entirely predictable situation could have been mitigated before WW2 even began. Prior to the war, the US oil embargo was a major threat. Capturing the Dutch East Indies was a vital strategic necessity. Even as the Japanese were planning to launch the Pacific War to get oil, they were watching Germany attempting to strangle Britain with submarines and commerce raiders as they had done before during WW1. To kick off a war to get oil without a plan to protect it while it gets to where its needed was negligent. In conclusion, kamikaze tactics only make sense when compared to conventional tactics in an already hopeless situation with surrender taken off the table. But surrender was always an option, negotiated or unconditional. That Japan found itself lacking experienced pilots and fuel was in part of its own strategic negligence. Kamikaze drew irreplaceable resources away from the final defense of Japan to inflict replaceable and inconsequential losses on a growing Allied fleet. The Allies repeatedly demonstrated they would not shrink away from taking casualties to end the war. Even if they decided not to invade, what then? The Japanese people suffer bombardment, starvation, and eventually revolt. In the end, it was the Japanese high command who did not see their own strategy through. Kamikaze could not win the war, nor even win a battle. It could only get more people killed."
"Was it militarily possible to ""island hop"" the Philippines if not for MacArthur?","The islands of the Philippines are quite large and close together in comparison to the Pacific islands. A battalion or regiment of Japanese soldiers left on a small island many miles from anywhere else are stuck there, and can't contribute to the war.  A much larger group of Japanese soldiers on a large island can feed themselves from the island's resources. Since they likely include combat engineers, and have an island's population under their control, they can build or commandeer boats and move to another island in the group. So bypassing them doesn't take them out of the war.  If the whole of the Philippine archipelago could be isolated and bypassed, that should work, but it's rather large for doing that without nearby bases. It was important to cut the Japanese access to Indonesia, since that was their main source of oil, and that pretty well requires bases in the Philippines. That was their grand-strategic importance. "
Are there any accounts of everyday life during the Black Death?,"While the Joseph Byrne book you mentioned is certainly useful, many of its citations are actually from the the Early Modern period, and it usually summarizes a range of sources rather than quoting directly from specific primary sources. The widest selection of quoted primary sources can probably be found in The Black Death by Rosemary Horrox (1990), which can be viewed for free on the Internet Archive. It has excerpts from numerous chronicles and other documents from across Europe, most of which were written by people who survived the plague. In these can be found accounts of how the plague affected survivors economically, socially and emotionally. One such chronicle, that of the Westminster monk John of Reading (died 1368/91), aptly summarizes what 'life' was like in those times: And there was in those days death without sorrow, marriage without
affection, self-imposed penance, want without poverty, and flight
without escape. How many who fled from the face of the pestilence were
already infected and did not escape the slaughter. For more from this source, see Chronica Johannis de Reading et anonymi Cantuariensis, 1346-1367 (which can also be accessed for free on the Internet Archive). Looking at the many medieval accounts, Horrox highlights some interesting observations on the extent of the gloom to be found. For example, To the chroniclers of Padua the plague was a devastation more final
than Noah’s Flood – when God had left some people alive to continue
the human race. and, even more pessimistically, in Kilkenny, John Clynn left blank pages at the end of his chronicle
‘in case anyone should still be alive in the future’ A translation of Clynn's chronicle, The Annals of Ireland, can also be accessed for free on the internet archive. Clynn died in 1349, probably from the plague. In an overview of how chroniclers across Europe recorded the Black Death, Horrox notes that: The very enormity of the disaster drove chroniclers to take refuge in
clichés: there were not enough living to bury the dead; whole families
died together; the priest was buried with the penitent he had
confessed a few hours earlier. The same comments appear in chronicle
after chronicle, and the result can seem curiously perfunctory, with
only the occasional vivid detail bringing the reality of the situation
before the reader, such as William Dene’s remark that the stench from
the mass graves was so appalling that people could hardly bear to go
past a churchyard. and Alongside these verbal clichés are the numerical ones. The most common
claim was that scarcely a tenth of the population survived the plague.
Other writers opted for one in five. A few, more modestly, suggested
that barely half or a third of mankind was left alive. It is easy to
dismiss such claims as meaningless exaggeration....But if the figures
are exaggerated, they are not meaningless. The chroniclers’ resort to
them is a measure of their horror and disbelief at the number of
deaths they saw around them. There are many specific examples of how daily life was affected. For example, the monk Louis Heyligen (died 1361) on people’s daily diet in Avignon: ...sea fish are now not generally eaten, men holding that they have been
infected by the infected air. Moreover no kinds of spices are eaten or
handled, unless they have been in stock for a year... Also mentioned are examples of food prices increasing but rents decreasing as the shortage of workers meant that the landlords had to bargain with labourers to get the work in the fields done, and even then much was left undone. There was even a shortage of priests in England, with many of the vacancies being filled as a great crowd of men whose wives had died in the pestilence rushed
into priestly orders. Many of them were illiterate, no better than
laymen – for even if they could read, they did not understand what
they read. Source: Chronicon Henrici Knighton vel Cnitthon monachi Leycestrensis, cited (and translated) in Horrox. From Letters on Familiar Matters by the poet Francesco Petrarch (died 1374), we have an example of the emotional and social impact on this individual’s daily life: Where are our dear friends now? Where are the beloved faces? Where are
the affectionate words, the relaxed and enjoyable conversations?....
We should make new friends – but how, when the human race is almost
wiped out; and why, when it looks to me as if the end of the world is
at hand?.... You see how our great band of friends has dwindled. Some of the primary sources cited, often at length, by Horrox include: and many more... 1 Not to be confused with another John of Reading who died in 1346 in Avignon."
Why was capturing the south of Okinawa necessary?,"There are some misconceptions in the question which need to be cleared up, and doing so will go some way towards answering the question as posed. The following is sourced from the official US military history of the operation which can be found online here:-   Okinawa: The Last Battle (CMH 1993 ed.)  Firstly, the specific purpose of the mission as conceived and planned was primarily to secure the southern part of the island, as this was where the best roads, the major port on the island, the best anchorage, the existing airfields, and the terrain deemed most suitable for further airfield construction were all located. It was also where three quarters of the population were located, and it was hoped that some of these might be employed as a labour force. Secondly, the planned US Okinawa military base was not intended solely for supporting the invasion of Japan, there were also potential operations against Formosa and the east coast of China under consideration which were also to be supported from Okinawa, should they eventuate. One secure airbase was far less than what the Americans were hoping to achieve here. Thirdly, and probably most significantly in answering the question, US intelligence relating to the terrain of Okinawa was very limited prior to the operation, and it was expected that only 8 airfields would be developed on the island. After examining the island at first hand it was found that 18 airfields could be sustained, including those suitable for long range bombers, so the rugged northern part of the island had been neglected as strategically useless prior to close examination, and planning of the operation reflected this. The perceived lack of strategic value of the north was also shared by the Japanese as evidenced by their decision to barely defend the northern part of the island themselves."
What is the pre-schism Christian church called today?,"This is incredibly complicated and almost always misleading. For example, in many countries the Catholic Church is called strictly the Roman-Catholic church. The higher up members of that community that acknowledges the papal supremacy call their own organisation most often just ""the church"".  In that they are sharing this endonym with most other sects of course, Christian or not, in antiquity and today. Then there are the early and still valid Notae ecclesiae: The Four Marks of the Church, also known as the Attributes of the Church, is a term describing four distinctive adjectives — ""One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic"" — of traditional Christian ecclesiology as expressed in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed completed at the First Council of Constantinople in AD 381: ""[I believe] in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church."" Or, in the Latin, then in Greek: Et unam, sanctam, cathólicam et apostólicam Ecclésiam.

It is the only authoritative ecumenical statement of the Christian faith accepted by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican, and the major Protestant denominations."" Then there is that dating problem. Choosing 1054 as the cutting point for the schism is totally unhelpful in that, except for having an answer in quizzes. When did that schism begin? Was it as early as 180 because of Quartodecimanism? Or as late as 1729, when Congregatio de Propaganda Fide actually forbid the community of sacraments. There are a few options to consider as good names for ""the church"" before the 11th century: They all have advantages and disadvantages. Is the Chalcedonian church just the congregation in that locality? Is pentarchical just referring to the exact five sees? How ecumenical is the universal church? Still other formulas like pre-schism Christian church etc. might be used.
It would very much depend on context, intended audience and readership which description to choose. It will be necessary to not just use ""the word"" (i.e. ""a word"") and be done with it. There is no real solution for this as too many names have been proposed and used already. In any text you will likely have to define the way you are going to use that word to avoid misunderstandings. Without a given and strictly defined timeframe the words change their generally understood meaning. Without such prolegomena, confusion in a general audience is not just a possibility but will arise. Bonus question to ponder about after having wrecked your brain on when the East-West schism started: Is it still in effect or did it end? If it ended, when did it end? The ban and counter-bans from 1054 were abolished at the end the Second Vatican Council in 1965. But: East and West since 1054
""Even after 1054 friendly relations between East and West continued. The two parts of Christendom were not yet conscious of a great gulf of separation between them. […] The dispute remained something of which ordinary Christians in East and West were largely unaware"". There was no single event that marked the breakdown. Rather, the two churches slid into and out of schism over a period of several centuries, punctuated with temporary reconciliations.
— Wikipedia East-West Schism If you want to refer to the church or churches before the caesarian date of 1054 it would be probably easiest and most pragmatic to say ""pre-1054 church(es)""."
"Who first called natural satellites ""moons""?","Chistiaan Huygens in 1656 is the first documented evidence. The invention of the telescope limits this to after 1610. Since Galileo was the first to observe such objects, it was Kepler who in 1611 called them satellites in his Narratio de observatis a se quatuor Iovis Satellitibus erronibus. Which is about 'the Satellites wandering about Jupiter'. The comparison to Earth's moon was then made by Huygens, who called Saturn's Titan a/his ""luna"" and provided a rationale for making this comparison: Saturnius hic mundus adferat: si enim gravaté olim isti systemati assentientibus, scrupulum demere potuerunt quaternae circa Iovem repertae Lunae; manifestius utiq; nunc eos convincet unica illa circa Saturnum oberrans, atque ob hoc ipsum quod unica est, nostratis Lunas similitudinem magis exprimens ut omittam nunc aliam quoque Saturnij globi cum hoc nostro cognationem, quam in simili axium utriusque inclinatione invenient Astronomiae periti.[…]
— (archive.org) On WP: 1656 – De Saturni Luna observatio nova (About the new observation of the moon of Saturn – discovery of Titan) As confirmed by this article: Christiaan Huygens, the discoverer of Titan, was the first to use the term moon for such objects, calling Titan Luna Saturni or Luna Saturnia – ""Saturn's moon"" or ""The Saturnian moon"", because it stood in the same relation to Saturn as the Moon did to the Earth.

(archive.org), Text printed with date of ""March 5, 1656"", page number on page: 62, page number in PDF: 148, original pamphlet 4 pages long. English translation in the Hartlib Papers.) A note on the timeline of confusing dates:
Huygens discovered the object we now call Titan in March 1655, published a rushed but cautious pamphlet already calling it ""Saturn's moon"" in The Hague in March 1656. He did this because he wasn't really sure about all he concluded from his discovery but wanted to assure his primacy on this discovery in a time before copyright. In that Latin paper we see all the terminology current at the time. Those objects around Jupiter were the most obvious to compare and those are called variously ""star"" (stellulam), ""satellite"" (novus Saturni satelles), ""planet"" (planeta), ""Medicaen planet"" (Mediceos Jovi |named after the Medici), ""companion"", ""follower"". He already concludes that neither Jupiter's nor Saturn's 'planets' are properly called 'planets', as they are different from those in orbiting not the sun, but orbiting an object that orbits the sun. A difference in properties he claims no other astronomer before had recognised nor taken into account. But as the very title of the pamphlet shows, his synonym Moon=satellite was already there, and within the text he just goes on to make this comparison: Caeterum mihi novum Saturniae lunae phaenomenon ad haec quoque viam aperuit
(However, this new phenomenon of Saturn's moon…) It took a little while longer for him to publish his full treatise on why the moon of Saturn is really much like Earth's moon, together with his explanation of Saturn's rings in his Systema Saturnium in 1659. In this we find his explanation, him still juggling with other terminology of planets, star, satellite, for the 'new', 'Saturn's moon', and the moons around Jupiter: Now I was greatly helped in this matter not only by those more genuine phases, but also by the motion of Saturn's Moon, which I observed from the beginning; indeed it was the revolution of this Moon around Saturn that first caused to dawn upon me the hope of constructing the hypothesis. The nature of this hypothesis I will proceed to explain in what follows. When, then, I had discovered that the new planet revolved around Saturn in a period of sixteen days, I thought that without any doubt Saturn rotated on his own axis in even less time. For even before this I had always believed that the other primary planets were like our Earth in this respect that each rotated on its own axis, and so the entire surface rejoiced in the light of the Sun, a part at a time; and, more than this, I believe that in general the arrangement with the large bodies of the world was such that those around which smaller bodies revolved, having themselves a central position, had also a shorter period of rotation. Thus the Sun, its spots declare, rotates on its own axis in about twenty-six days; but around the Sun the various planets, among which the Earth is also to be reckoned, complete their courses in times varying as their distances. Again, this Earth rotates in daily course, and around the Earth the Moon circles with monthly motion. Around the planet Jupiter four smaller planets, that is to say Moons, revolve, subject to this same law, under which the velocities increase as the distances diminish. Whence, indeed, we must conclude perhaps that Jupiter rotates in a shorter time than 24 hours, since his nearest Moon requires less than two days. Now having long since learned all these facts, I concluded even then that Saturn must have a similar motion. But it was my observation in regard to his satellite that gave me the information about the velocity of his motion of rotarion. The fact that the satellite completes its orbit in sixteen days leads to the conclusion that Saturn, being in the centre of the satellite's orbit, rotates in much less time. Furthermore, the following conclusion seemed reasonable: that all the celestial matter that lies between Saturn and his satellite is subject to the same motion, in this way that the nearer it is to Saturn, the nearer it approaches Saturn's velocity. Whence, finally, the following resulted: the appendages also, or arms, of Saturn are either joined and attached to the globular body at its middle and go around with it, or, if they are separated by a certain distance, still revolve at a rate not much inferior to that of Saturn.
— In 1659 Christiaan Huygens published an article on Saturn's Ring in Systema Saturnium. The translation below is based on that made by J H Walden in 1928. A nice outline of the events unfolding is to be read in the title:
— Albert van Helden: ""'Annulo Cingitur': The Solution to the Problem of Saturn"", Journal for the History of Astronomy, Vol. 5, p.155, 1974. This was for the concept of using a word for our moon to describe other celestial bodies that are natural satellites to other planets. But that went all on in Latin, the language Huygens used. In English we see the Oxford English Dictionary give the earliest attestation at 1665 (as shown in justCal's answer with the following description: 1665: Phil. Trans. I. 72 “The Conformity of these Moons with our Moon.”
– OED 2nd edition This is found in good visual quality in Vol 1, No 4, but on page 74 in the article ""A Further Account,Touching Signor Campani's Book and Performances about Optick-Glasses (pp. 70-75)"" This is however preceded by at least Robert Hooke's book Micrographia, which was published in the same year, albeit already in January, and as per imprint was ordered into printing on November 23. 1664: 

This will seem much more consonant to the rest of the secundary Planets; for the highest of Jupiter's Moons is between twenty and thirty Jovial Semidiameters distant from the Center of Jupiter; and the Moons of Saturn much about the same number of Saturnial Semidiameters from the Center of that Planet. (p240)
— Robert Hooke: ""Micrographia"", January 1665. (archive.org) Since the earliest pamphlet by Huygens was also sent to England (as in the Hartlib-source link above), where it might have been translated and shown around early, and surely discussed in the local tongue, and both the Philosophical Transactions as well as Hooke use it without much explanation: an even earlier date seems quite likely for a direct usage of 'moons' in this sense in English."
What is the first horse name recorded in history?,"The Kassites (Babylonia, c. 1531 BC and until c. 1155 BC) named horses and were well-established in horse-breeding. Some of these names have been dated to the reigns of Burna-Buriash II (c.1359–1333 BC) and Kurigalzu II (c.1332–1308 BC). These names are among the few words we have of the Kassite language, and are given in An Early History of Horsemanship Draught animals are indicated by their coats, sires by names. Mares

Earliest evidence of objects intended for future archaeologists?,"Coins, dedications, and other 'ritual' objects have been buried in the foundations of buildings since prehistory.  The function of these artefacts is unclear, but they do not appear to have been placed there for future generations. What you are looking for is usually called a 'time-capsule', and as the Wikipedia article observes: A time capsule is a historic cache of goods or information, usually intended as a deliberate method of communication with future people, and to help future archaeologists, anthropologists, or historians. Wikipedia also has a list of time capsules, broken down by country.  The oldest example on this list seems to be the Samuel Adams and Paul Revere time capsule.  This was located in a cornerstone of the Massachusetts State House, and is: ... believed to have been buried in 1795 by then-Governor Samuel Adams and Paul Revere. The time capsule was opened at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in 2015."
Did Chinese emperors wear a rectangular hat with suspended gems?,"You're describing the mian (冕), a style of classical Chinese head dress that was indeed worn by successive Emperors of China. The basic design consisted of a hat secured to the head with a red string (纓), topped by a rectangular board (綖), with threads of gems (旒) attached to its front and back edges, and two ""ear plugs"" (充耳) hanging off the two sides.  
Click to enlarge: Components of a mian design. In antiquity, the same general style was part of the formal courtly dress, worn by the nobility (士、大夫、卿), regional princes (諸侯), as well as the sovereign (天子). Their difference in status was illustrated by the number of the gem threads - according to the Book of Rites: 天子之冕，朱綠藻十有二旒，諸侯九，上大夫七，下大夫五，士三 The Son of Heaven's mian has 12 liu; the princes 9, the high nobility 7, the low nobility 5, and shi 3. Chinese scholars in the late antiquity believed this meant 12 gem threads on each of the front and back edges. Modern scholars however have reasoned that only the front edge had these threads. Either way, after the unification of China under Qin, designs of the royal crown settled on 12 threads on both ends of the top board. For example, in the 7th century Painting of Emperors of Past Dynasties, seven of the 13 emperors depicted were shown in this style. Han dynasty regulations, however, stipulated that court officials only have the gem threads in the front, not the back. 
Left: The First Emperor of Qin. Middle: Emperor Wu of Jin. Right: Emperor Wen of Sui The mian remained standard until around the Tang dynasty, but its cumbersomeness led it to be increasingly reserved for only the most formal occasions, mainly the highest ceremonial rites (e.g. honouring royal ancestors or making offerings to the heaven and the earth) and coronations, as well as part of the annual new years ceremonies at court. 
Left: Imperial mian from the Mausoleum of Ming's Wanli Emperor. Right: Royal mian of Ming's King Lu. Note the difference in threads. Use of the mian was abolished in 1652, shortly after the Manchurian conquest of China, when it was replaced by traditional Manchu clothing at court. However, after the founding of the Republic, it (or a budget variation thereof) was briefly revived as part of China's official ceremonial dress."
Why were women targeted as witches?,"Extracts from Kayla Theresa Natrella's Witchcraft and Women:
A Historiography of Witchcraft as Gender History
 mentioned in rougon's answer: Jules Michelet: sorceresses filled the role of midwives in every country, and were the only healers for women, because no woman in that period would have consulted or trusted a male physician Ehrenreich and English: correlation between the rise of the European medical profession and the persecution of female healers: “for as the number of more or less qualified practitioners rose, so they became more anxious to exclude rivals.” Larner: women were feared as sources of disorder and as sexual beings in a patriarchal society. Barstow saw the sexual themes in demonological texts as proof that man’s fear of women as sexual beings was the underlying rationale for the witch persecutions she introduces the distinction between sex-related (an act which is predominantly associated with one sex) and sex-specific acts (an act which can only be performed by one sex). She argues that witchcraft is
  sex-related and suggests that women were more prone to suspicion because men considered the feminine nature to be malicious, sensual, evil, and irrational. men viewed women’s “life-bearing and menstruating capacities” as mysterious and dangerous, especially if uncontrolled (by men) Joseph Klaits: the witch craze’s slaughter of women was the result of the spread of woman-hatred in the spiritually reformed elites [He] attributes sadism and the appeal of sexuality and violence, to the treatment of accused witches during the witch persecutions Stuart Clark and Robin Briggs: the society was one dominated by polarized binary thought. As such, if men are associated with positive attributes, then women must be associated with their negative counterparts. If God is the embodiment of good and the Devil, His polar opposite, then, accordingly, men are innately closer to God and women to the Devil. This is even supported by Eve’s original sin in “Genesis” of the Bible. Ropper: wars of religion, disease, and bad harvests due to the “little ice age” already strongly impacted demographics and resources and inspired fear and greater protection of fertility. Furthermore, in such a society, motherhood was the pinnacle of the woman’s life and the ultimate show of success. Since social status correlated so closely with reproductive potential, old women who were past child-bearing years were hated and their barrenness and sexuality regarded with revulsion. The witch killed babies, ground their corpses into powder, and used that powder to enhance her power. She was the anti-mother. Briggs: failure to conceive or carry a fetus to term, as well as masculine impotency, would have been blamed on witchcraft. Since witches attacked women’s abilities to become mothers, then women would naturally have been among the accusers. These witches represented women’s
  deeply embedded fears and received the blame for inexplicable loss of life, illness, infertility, poor harvest, etc. Purkiss: women often were illiterate, men would inscribe the depositions that they submitted and may have intervened in the content the good housewife carefully managed, conserved, and
  protected the household goods. A woman who infringed upon another woman’s territory was
  more vulnerable to suspicion of witchcraft, especially if misfortune befell the family. Margaret Murray: European witches were the remains of a pre-Christian fertility cult which congregated in covens of thirteen
  [...] witches were members of a pre-Christian agrarian cult which influenced the theory that the witch hunt was the Church’s effort completely to eradicate the pagan religion and its worshipper Mary Daly: the intent [of European witch hunts] was to break down and destroy strong women, to dis-member and kill the Goddess, the divine spark of be-ing in women” and to “purify society of the existence and of the potential existence of such women."
Why didn't line infantry tactics try to keep up a constant volley of fire?,"That's actually exactly what they did. In the early 17th century, Maurice of Orange reformed the Dutch army and drilled them to use volley fire. This involved the first rank (i.e. the first row of the line) firing and moving to the back of the line. For obvious reasons, this harmed the cohesion of the formation. By 1670, the French had begun firing by ranks. In a description attributed to General Martinet, the French lines starts with all but the last ranks kneeling, allowing them to fire over the front ranks. Then, progressively from the back, each rank would stand up and shoot. This remained the basis of French linear tactics for the next century, though the number of ranks were subsequently reduced. Shortly afterwards, the Dutch developed platoon firing. In this method, the line is divided into several platoons grouped into three firings. Within each platoon, the front rank shoots while kneeling, the second shoots over them, and the third shoots through the gaps. Firing in close order like this requires more training, however. The last method was adopted by the British to great effect, notably in the Napoleonic Wars. Note that volley fire while on the attack was also possible. For example, Winfield Scott's drill manual for the US Army stated: When the command is given to advance and fire by ranks. The front rank of each file will fire; the rear rank man will then move forward the designated number of paces, in the manner which will be prescribed, and fire at will; as soon as he has fired, the front rank man will advance again, the prescribed number of paces, and, in his turn, fire; and so on alternately."

What did Germany do in World War II about the different rail gauge in the Soviet Union?,"The overall answer is that the Soviets were not rich in railways and destroyed much of it as they retreated. The Germans anticipated this, and had railway commandos rebuild much of the Soviet trunk lines and some feeders to standard gauge. They also maintained several of the wide gauge lines if captured intact and with enough rolling stock. Some efforts, primarily in 1942, were hindered either by the inability of the commandos to keep up with the front, or by the low capacity of a wide gauge line.

"When and why did having long hair become associated with women, and short hair with men?","The First World War is often identified as a turning point in men's hair length. Prior to the war, both men and women commonly kept long hair, at least in western societies (and the Far East). This became problematic during the Great War, where armies encountered severe hygiene issues fighting in the trenches. Under the unsanitary conditions of the front, soldiers adopted short hair to mitigate the scourge of lice or fleas. [T]he men who fought in that war were numerous (65 million) and the 56 million survivors lived a further half century and had an overwhelming influence on those younger ...  Men for the next half century had to measure themselves against the war veterans, to try to give themselves and others the impression that they too could have endured the trenches. That became the measure of manhood. And so the style of the veteran of the trenches - short hair, suntan, dangling cigarette, the taciturn, unfeeling, nonchalant post which does not flinch when someone a few yards away gets shot - becomes the male style of the twentieth century.  - Antony, Michael. The Masculine Century: A Heretical History of Our Time. iUniverse, 2008.  Due to the prestige attached to the veterans, their characteristic hair cut was retained and emulated as the armies demobilised. This was reinforced by the adoption of crew cuts for servicemen during WWII. Obviously there's a great deal of generalisation going on when we speak in such terms as the hair length of entire societies. Some men, even today, kept their hair long. Meanwhile, many women also cut their hair short, especially during the inter-war years. The bob cut for instance became popularised after 1920. This wasn't the first time people cut their hair short, though. As the Industrial Revolution progressed in the 18th century, short hair became attractive to those working with machinery for safety reasons (many women likewise cut their hair short for the same reason when they entered the war factories during the two World Wars). The long, wavy or curly hair portrayed in early centuries thus became a rarity during the 19th century. Nonetheless long hair was not out of the ordinary, and middle to upper class men typical hair lengths remain much longer than would be the norm after the World Wars. Some examples of men with longer hair during the 19th century include: 










 From left to right: 1. British Jurist Charles Hay Cameron. 2. German composer Johannes Brahms. 3. American ornithologist, John James Audubon. 4. Italian violinist Niccolò Paganini. 5. American writer Edgar Allan Poe when young. 6. Anglo-Irish poet Oscar Wilde. 7. Confederate General A. P. Hill.
8. Hungarian composer Franz Liszt.
9. British novelist Charles Dickens in youth.
10. French scientist Henri Victor Regnault.
11. American officer George Armstrong Custer.
12. French composer Erik Satie before going bald. In fact, typical hair lengths has been very variable throughout history. What you call ""obvious identity signs"" are not constant and has never been universally true in history. Although WW1 and WW2 may be said to have kicked off the current fashion trend, it should not be considered either permanent or unprecedented."
What is the reason for the selections of gun caliber size in history?,"Why not an even value, such as 130 mm? The general answer to that is because the design goal is to make the best gun possible, not have the numbers come out neatly. The engineers designing and building the gun don't care if it's in neat numbers. They might start with one neat number, but derived dimensions are subservient to engineering considerations and calculations. This is probably the most important reason why large caliber guns are the caliber they are: there's already tooling to produce the parts in that caliber, particularly the expensive rifled barrels. For example, the German 12.8 cm Pak 44 used tooling in common with the 12.7 cm SK C/34 naval gun used on German destroyers. Then there's ammunition commonality. Just having the same caliber doesn't mean you can share ammunition, there's many other considerations, but it helps. If all your guns can share ammunition that simplifies production, logistics, and supply. For small arms, small differences in ballistic performance are not terribly important; tactics dominate small arms engagements. Instead the problem is supplying large amounts to large numbers of troops who will use it for various tasks, and they have to carry it. Logistics becomes paramount. For this reason, most militaries, in contrast to civilians, have standardized around just a few small arms rounds. One pistol round (9x19mm or 9×18mm), one intermediate round (5.56x45mm NATO or 5.45×39mm Soviet), and one full power rifle round (7.62×51mm NATO or 7.62×54mmR). Large caliber firearms tend to be specialized, vehicle mounted, and fire less ammunition. They fill the roles of anti-tank, anti-aircraft, and artillery. These fields were in an intense arms race, particularly during WWII until roughly the 1980s when electronics took over, so you could get an advantage out of fielding a new round that offset the logistical problems. As a result militaries can afford a lot of diversity in large calibers, but they still tend to cluster around certain historical calibers that they (or who they're buying from) are already producing. Large caliber artillery and tank cannons are often adapted from naval guns and anti-aircraft guns (which also often come from naval guns). Both naval and anti-aircraft guns require long range, high muzzle velocity (naval guns for armor penetration, AA for altitude), and large calibers to pack sufficient explosive or kinetic energy to do damage. Anti-aircraft guns are often preferred because they're designed to be lighter, and more mobile than naval guns. Naval guns have been around for a long time, so tanks and artillery inherit the naming and size quirks of old naval guns. For example, the famous German 88 began life as AA gun which itself began as a naval gun. The US 90mm also started as an AA gun (the 90mm M1 and M2) and was adapted into the M3 tank cannon for the M36 Tank Destroyer and M26 Pershing. There are various ways to name a round. Wikipedia puts it this way. Due to variations in naming conventions, and the whims of the cartridge manufacturers, bullet diameters can vary widely from the diameter implied by the name. There are so many numbers to choose from! Have a look at 5.56x45mm NATO.  Look at all those numbers to choose from! You can use the chamber diameter, the case diameter, the bore diameter, the bullet diameter... If rifling is involved, you can use the diameter as measured at the lands (the smaller diameter formed by the ridges) or the grooves (the larger diameter formed by the troughs between the ridges). For example 9x19mm Parabellum and 9x18mm Makarov do not have the same bullet diameter. 9x18mm Makarov measures caliber between the lands, so the bullet is 9.27mm in diameter. 9x19mm measures between the grooves, so the bullet is 9mm in diameter. And you can just make shit up. For example, no part of 5.56x45mm NATO is 5.56mm. The bullet is 5.70mm at its thickest, same as its parent the .223 Remington. 5.70mm is .224"" so even the .223 Remington isn't .223"". The closest thing to 5.56mm about 5.56mm is the pilot diameter, which is the size of the hole which guides the bullet into the rifling, and even that isn't quite 5.56mm. So the number in the name is just a name, divorced from the actual engineering specifications. Sometimes odd metric designations are because they began life in another measurement. 12.7cm and 12.8cm are actually 5 inch guns. 76mm is 3 inches, etc... Then there's the British ""pound"" system like the ""3-pounder"". This is how much round, solid shot would weigh and goes waaaaay back in British naval history. A 3-pound gun is 47mm which explains why we had 47mm weapons. When you increase the caliber, and keep the length the same, the volume of the case increases by the square of the caliber. That means bigger shells (now you can store less shells), more weight (good luck humping that round, loader), and more material (higher cost per round). Using your example of going from 128mm to 130mm, the brass case of a Mark 10 shell for a US 5""/38 gun is 127x679mm and weighed 5.58kg. A shell case is an open topped cylinder with a surface area of 2πrh + πr^2. 127mm is 283,433 m^2. 130mm is 290,434 m^2. That's an increase of 2.5% or 140 grams of brass (probably more since the base is thicker than the walls). Volume is πr^2h and goes up by ~5% which means more powder. The numbers get worse for the barrel. The 5""/38 is 5683mm long and weighs 1,810 kg. If we increase its surface area by 2.5% that's an extra 45 kg of high quality steel. That extra weight means a stronger mounting which means more weight which needs stronger drives to rotate it, etc. Note that these are very back of the envelope calculations. Point is, even a small change in diameter can have a large effect. Please keep in mind this is not a practical example of scaling up a round, I deliberately left the length the same and ignored a host of other issues because they're outside the scope of the question. It's only rough calculations intended to illustrate the knock-on effects of changing the caliber even by a few millimeters. And yes, as the caliber (radius) changes, but the length remains the same, the volume changes by the square of the caliber; that is not a mistake. If you want to edit it with more accurate calculations that don't clutter the answer, please do. If you want to talk about this more, please do it in chat. Many caliber names trace back to the 1890s up to WWI when changes in gun and ammunition was happening fast, and nobody fussed too much about naming standards because they needed guns for the front NOW. Others are simply their metric versions of older imperial standards. Roughly 6.1 inches. This traces back to the French WWI Canon de 155 C modèle 1915 Schneider which took an earlier 152mm (6 inches) and upped it to 155mm (6.1 inches). Why switch to 6.1"", I don't know. 6 inch naval gun. The ubiquitous 5 inch naval gun. Roughly 4.1 inches. Traces back, in German service, to the 10.5 cm Feldhaubitze 98/09 from 1902. 4 inches. 3.5 inches. Possibly from the British 25-pounder (not the Ordnance QF 25-pounder from the 1930s, but the caliber measurement). The 88 in German service is originally from the ""quick firing"" 8.8 cm SK L/30 naval gun dating back to 1892. 3 inches or 17-pounder. From French Canon de 75 modèle 1897. Adopted by the US to have commonality with French equipment in WWI. 6-pounder. 3-pounder. I can trace this back to the 18th century Grasshopper. In modern times it began with the QF 3 pounder Nordenfelt and the Canon Hotchkiss à tir rapide de 47mm, quick-firing naval guns both designed in 1885. AFAIK only used by the Soviets. They scaled up a German 37mm anti-tank gun in 1932 to make the 45 mm anti-tank gun M1932 19-K.  According to Wikipedia 45mm was chosen because... The reason for selecting 45 mm caliber was the large reserves of the French 47 mm shells which can be converted to 45 mm by milling out the driving bands. Why they chose 45mm instead of 47mm I'm not sure. 2-pounder. 1.5 inch, and 1-pounder. Earliest modern use I can find is the QF 1-pounder pom-pom 37mm autocannon from the late 1880s. 1 inch. Earliest reference I can find is the French 25mm Hotchkiss anti-tank gun proposed in 1926 to replace the 37mm infantry gun with better armor piercing capability. The Japanese used a local variant as the Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun."
"In the Battle of the Coral Sea, how could two Japanese scouts grossly mis-identify two American ships?","Mistaking the Sims for a cruiser is easy: a Sims-class destroyer has the same number of turrets (3) as the majority of American cruisers, while most American destroyers of the time had two, four, or five turrets.  Without anything to provide a sense of scale, it's easy to mistake one for the other, particularly if you're not getting close enough to count the guns in each turret. Mistaking the Neosho for a carrier is harder, but still understandable: the Cimarron-class fleet oilers have a large structure in the middle of a mostly-flat deck, a layout that at a glance is similar to the island and flight deck of a carrier. If you're out looking for the enemy fleet, you're expecting to find carriers sailing in the company of cruisers.  In psychology, this is called priming, and as long as the ships you're seeing aren't too different from the ones you expect to see, it's nearly certain that you'll misidentify them. Spotting three destroyers that don't exist is harder to explain, but again, priming plays a role.  A cruiser and carrier will not be operating alone, so when you're looking for the rest of their escorts, there's a decent chance that you'll misidentify a dark patch of ocean, the interference pattern between the two ships' wakes, or other things as poorly-seen destroyers."
Why aren't there major cities on the Atlantic coast of France?,"First because most cities in France are much smaller than cities in the US.  Compare a list of French cities by population with the same for the US.  There are 11 cities in the US bigger than the 2nd largest in France (Marseille at ~855,000) and 34 bigger than the 3rd largest (Lyon at ~500,000). Second, it does have big Atlantic coastal cities... by French standards. Nantes and Bordeaux are both definitely ports, they're just up large, navigable rivers. Bordeaux is up the Garonne River and Nantes is on the Loire.  An oceanic port on a river is a great advantage for transportation inland, and by being far up river away from the coast they provide a sheltered harbor.  Portland, Oregon is the same way, a major port located 70 miles up the Columbia River from the Pacific Ocean. Finally, the Atlantic coast of France is about 3 times shorter than the Atlantic coast of the US. So there's less space for cities. I'm going into speculation here, but geography may also play a part: it's possible the Atlantic coast of France contains less natural harbors than the US does, or the winds in the Bay of Biscay made it difficult to obtain landfall.  I'd love for someone to address that. But even with all that, France just isn't very Atlantic-centric and that's where it's history comes in.  When cities in France were being founded there was nobody to trade with across the Atlantic.  Gaul (what the Romans called the area) was conquered by the Romans in 51 BC and by the time Europeans started trading with America France had already established her cities for a thousand years. Her oceanic trading partners would be to the north (Britain, Norway, Germany, Baltic States, Russia) or to the south (Italy, North Africa, Balkans, Ottoman Empire). Being a continental nation inland trading along rivers was more important.  Of the 10 most populous cities in France, 5 are on inland rivers (Lille, Paris, Lyon, Toulouse, and Strasbourg), 3 are on the south coast (Nice, Montpellier, Marseille), and 2 are on the Atlantic (Bordeaux, Nantes)."
"When did the practice of formally ""declaring war"" cease and why?","Theoretically, wars are still supposed to be declared. To quote the Hague Convention III of 1907: The Contracting Powers recognize that hostilities between themselves must not commence without previous and explicit warning, in the form either of a reasoned declaration of war or of an ultimatum with conditional declaration of war. However, after searching through some sources I have to agree with you - I cannot find any post-WWII war that has been formally declared. The last declaration of war I could find was Soviet Union to Japan in 1945. Every war that the United States participated in after that was declared as ""military engagement"" or ""police action"". United Kingdom behaved similarly, and so did Soviet Union (I don't have a link but Soviet Union always ""restored order"" or supported a party on its request). I blame the Cold War, none of the sides wanted to admit that they were leading wars of aggression. Same tendency continues however, see for example 2008 South Ossetia War declared as ""humanitarian intervention""."
What is the origin of the stereotype that Polish people lack intelligence?,"Personally, I suspect this is mostly an American (USA) stereotype, which chiefly originates from a couple of factors. We had a couple of large waves of East European immigration in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which brought large numbers of Poles who knew little or no English. As human beings, we tend to perceive those who have trouble expressing themselves in our own language as possessing substandard intelligence. This is particularly a problem with Americans, as the vast majority of us don't know any language besides English, so the roles are never reversed for us. The exemplar here is Psychology professor Carl Brigham, who in 1923 published a very influential study that made this exact mistake (using English aptitude tests on immigrants to measure intelligence). Immigrants of the era tended to enter at the lowest stratum of society. Polish immigrants were no exception, and in fact tended to get work primarily in menial jobs that even other immigrant groups avoided. Anti-Catholic prejudice of the era tended to act to keep Polish families there for an extra generation or two. It's fairly common to believe that those socially below you are of lesser intelligence than yourself. (If you don't believe that, you might start to believe that you don't inherently deserve your own lofty status. Not a pleasant line of thought there.)"
Why did Hitler not order the use of poison gas in combat?,"Re: Pierstorff's explanation, I haven't heard the biological weapons explanation before. As the primary motivation for Hitler's restraint, I don't think it's correct. From my understanding, bio weapons were rather primitive on all sides and the Japanese were actually the most advanced in this regard, not the Allies. [EDIT: I'm not sure where I first heard all of this, but here's a confirming source that I do trust--Derek Lowe of In the Pipeline  ] I'm really surprised no one has mentioned tabun yet. This nerve agent was the first ever produced, the forerunner of sarin and VX. Hitler made a lot of it, and the Allies weren't even aware of nerve gases until they captured some tabun from the Germans fairly late in the war. The Germans could have wreaked real havoc if they had used it at a critical juncture. With an effective delivery system, they might have been able to turn back Operation Overlord (D-Day), prolonging the war for god knows how long. (Nerve gas tends to be much more effective than other gases, especially if the enemy doesn't know what the hell it is.) Here's the punch line: the reason why Hitler didn't use any gas (tabun included) was because his advisers thought the Allies had tabun as well. Apparently all of the prerequisite chemical work had been done by American scientists and were published in ordinary academic journals years before (the discovery of tabun was a natural consequence of pesticide R&D.) They just assumed that the Allied military had taken note of the research and prevented further publication in order to use it as a secret weapon if Germany used gas first. In reality, Allied military scientists had completely overlooked it. So, fearing the Allies' hefty air power could saturate German cities with tabun at a moment's notice, Hitler refrained from using any gas. I think this is a fascinating example of MAD functioning many years before the phrase entered common usage re: nuclear war... with the added twist that the threat from the other side was entirely imaginary.  It also seems to be an unusual example of Hitler showing fear, sensibility, and/or restraint. "
Why did the German army execute so few soldiers in World War I compared to most other armies?,"Alexander Watson says more about this in chapter 7 of The Cambridge History of the First World War, Volume II: The State: The Germans were most sparing in applying the death penalty because
  their justice system was staffed by professional legal personnel and
  influenced more than that of other forces by civilian norms. Their
  courts’ concern with justice for the individual was bitterly
  criticised after the war by conservatives, who claimed wrongly that it
  had damaged discipline and morale. In Military Executions during World War I, Gerard Oram argues that the German military code, dating from 1872, was arguably the most liberal of all the belligerents of the First World
  War. Without doubt the construction of the state governed by law, or
  Rechtsstaat, played a large part in this. The law was more tightly
  constructed than the British code. Desertion, for example, was not as
  loosely defined as it was in the British code. Sentencing and the
  rights of soldiers were also written into the law rather than being
  left to the whim of the commander-in-chief. This caused some consternation to General Ludendorff and his staff, who clearly felt constrained by the nature of German military law The table below is from Walker (chapter 7 - Table 7.1 Military executions, 1914–18.)  (asterisk in table) ""America’s executions were all for non-military crimes (murder and rape). Ten soldiers were executed in France and twenty-five in the United States."" On the low percentage for US executions, Walker writes: The lenience of the US military was solely due to President Wilson1,
  who commuted all death sentences for military crime; only murderers
  and rapists were executed. Other forces embraced the death penalty as
  a deterrent more wholeheartedly. 1 In US courts-martial, 24 death sentences for desertion were imposed. All were commuted by Wilson. See Charles Glass, 'The Deserters: A Hidden History of World War II' None of the aforementioned sources cite any figures for desertions, perhaps because such numbers can only be guessed at to a large extent. With reference to the British and German armies: Both...had a rather difficult time defining desertion and devising
  effective deterrents for it. Often commanders were reluctant to report
  it, because a high desertion rate reflected badly on an officer's
  leadership. Source: Robert Weldon Whalen, in a review of Christoph Jahr, 'Gewohnliche Soldaten: Desertion und Deserteure im deutschen und britischen Heer 1914-1918', The American Historical Review, Vol. 106, No. 5 (Dec., 2001) This 1914-1918-online. International Encyclopedia of the First World War article does offer some figures, but they are too limited for us to draw any firm conclusions on comparative desertion rates among the belligerents. We may accept, though, that For Britain, Germany and France, deserters - with all the caveats
  linked to judicial statistics that are difficult to interpret - appear
  never to have numbered more than 0.5 percent of men in uniform before
  1918. Although the number of German executions was low (despite the mass desertions - up to 180,000 - in the summer and autumn of 1918), those convicted were more likely than their British counterparts to have their sentences carried out: 48 soldiers executed out of 150 capital convictions, or 32%. The British, on the other hand, 'only' executed 11% of those convicted. Nonetheless, the relative leniency of the German military code during WWI is in stark contrast to that of WWII when, under the Nazis (who blamed deserters, among others, for Germany's WWI defeat), the total number of death sentences handed down for desertion were about
  22,750 with a probable 15,000 executions (65 percent) carried out. Source: David H. Kitterman, 'Review: The Justice of the Wehrmacht Legal System: Servant or Opponent of NationalSocialism?'. In 'Central European History, Vol. 24, No. 4' (1991), citing Manfred Messerschmidt and Fritz Wullne, 'Die Wehrmachtjustiz im Dienste des Nationalsozialismus: Zer- storung einer Legen' (1987) The WWII British army, on the other hand, did not execute any soldiers for desertion. Also worth noting is the WWI Italian execution rate, much higher than that of any of the other belligerents. This was due to the ""harsh"" military code and its strict implementation by the Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, Luigi Cadorna. The Italian military code was passed in 1869 and was based on its
  Sardinian predecessor (1840). It was particularly harsh, particularly
  with its very broad definition of desertion. During the First World
  War, Cadorna, the Italian Commander-in-Chief, made ample use of this
  in imposing a brutal disciplinary regime on his troops. Military
  crimes, which included desertion and insubordination, were punishable
  by being shot in front, but so-called ‘dishonourable’ crimes such as
  treason or murder were punishable by being shot in the back. Sentences
  were normally carried out within twenty-four hours, but sentences
  passed by extraordinary drum-head courts – including death sentences –
  were carried out summarily and ‘ad modum belli’. This allowed
  Cadorna to apply strict discipline from the moment of Italy’s entry to
  the war. In July 1915 he warned that ‘every soldier . . . must be
  convinced that his superior has the sacred duty to shoot all cowards
  and recalcitrants immediately’. Source: Oram The Wikipedia article on Cardona notes that: David Stevenson, Professor of International History at the London
  School of Economics, describes him as earning ""opprobrium as one of
  the most callous and incompetent of First World War commanders."""
How were concentration and extermination camp guards recruited?,"Short answer – it was less ""hiring"" and more ""drafting"". No pre-screening happened that I could find evidence of (well, except for the general ""has to be a good Nazi"" principle, which might count towards that), but being soft on incarcerated was strongly discouraged, which led to a predictable result of ""refining"" the most harsh guard possible. The camps were primarily guarded by the SS-Totenkopfverbände – a special division of the SS. One didn't join the camp guards – one joined the SS. At that point, it didn't really matter what one wanted – members of the SS were expected to follow orders as much as soldiers were. If you were assigned to SS-Totenkopfverbände, you went to guard the camp. While technically there were no ""screening for sadism"", SS were comprised of people who either truly accepted Nazi ideology or successfully faked it. Thus, they indeed were ""pre-screened"" for being 1) obedient (because of patriotism), 2) dismissive towards certain groups of people. As concentration camps held people who a Nazi would consider subhuman, the treatment of inmates would be... not good. In fact, Theodor Eicke, commandant of Dachau (the first concentration camp and the model for subsequent camps), encouraged his people to treat inmates with ""inflexible harshness"": they were the enemies of the state, after all! And that attitude was replicated in other camps – the Dachau camp was a training facility for the SS guards. As such, anyone who completed that training would appropriate the behavior of his SS teachers. In the last days of WW2, SS formed so-called ""SS-Mannschaft"" (Auxiliary SS) – a ragtag bunch of personnel drafted from Volkssturm, Army and basically any other source SS could get people from to try and keep camps running to the last moment while personnel of the SS proper could escape. These troops did not go through the usual SS selection process and did not get the same training as SS-TV personnel, so their behaviour could be very varied. But due to the chaos caused by quickly progressing Allied offensives, almost no documentation exist on what happened in camps in those days. P.S. While searching for sources for this answer, I kept finding stories about dismissal of guards deemed ""too kind"" to prisoners. I couldn't track down any of these to a reliable source, but there might be some truth to them. If true, it would serve to further reinforce the Eicke principles. P.P.S. Regarding your ""parole to criminals"" question – they weren't drafted to be camp guards, but you might want to read up on Strafbatallions (Army version, pretty tame and generally drafted from minor offenders) and Dirlewanger Brigade (SS version. It was initially supposed to be drafted from poachers. That idea was quickly lost, and the unit was drafted from murderers, burglars, criminally insane and so on. It had its debut during the occupation of Poland, and quickly earned itself the reputation of being a congregation of slaughterers, looters and rapists. Believe or not, but things went downhill from there.). Sources: Комендант Освенцима. Автобиографические записки Рудольфа Гесса.

What led some people to (correctly) believe that there was no land under the ice cap at the North Pole?,"The answer lies in your second map, and the extensive exploration of Siberia's Arctic sea coast through the 1600's in search of a Northern Passage. Note how well mapped that area has become in the intervening century.  Russian settlers and traders on the coasts of the White Sea, the Pomors, had been exploring parts of the northeast passage as early as the 11th century. By the 17th century they established a continuous sea route from Arkhangelsk as far east as the mouth of Yenisey. This route, known as Mangazeya seaway, after its eastern terminus, the trade depot of Mangazeya, was an early precursor to the Northern Sea Route. Further, the process by which icebergs are formed by calving from glaciers was well known. The absence of large icebergs in the Arctic Ocean north of the Kara Sea would have strongly suggested the absence of any glaciers, and thus any land, in that corner of the world. Update In regards a comment about the sinking of the Titanic: Titanic sank just south of Iceberg Alley, off the southern tail of the Grand Banks. That is ~1900 km south of Greenland, and ~3800 km south of the Arctic Ocean north of Iceland and Ellesmere Island. "
"In the ""Christmas truce"" of 1914 were there any football (soccer) matches between British and German troops?","This depends a bit on the definition of ""match"": modern rules 90 minutes kicking, level playfield, three referees, 11 players on each side, two nicely timbered goals, etc. Most popular accounts now seem to imply this. If it's that, then it's a resounding no. But bringing a ball to the trenches (in itself quite an astonishing thing to do?) and playing with it going about between British and German soldiers?  That occured. Multiple times. Although not nearly as often in reality as later reported. And much less organised as ""match"" implies. Even one 'real match' (or very few) might have occurred, against all unlikeliness. But most likely more like older forms of football. The important thing to distinguish here is that they did play, with 'a football', of whatever material, sometimes. And that they were really eager to do so on a very broad level. For the participants during the events and even more so later, in the aftermath of the war. Soldiers wanted to play. And people wanted to believe that they did. As time progressed, that desire apparently grew ever stronger despite the evidence for that not being able to match the pace. What did not occur – despite being now almost the norm in cultural memory – is the practice of widespread organised football matches.  Despite being really one 'nice thing' about the war, and in itself a single occurrence would be quite remarkable, the representation in memory is not 'untrue' but somewhat inflated.  So, yes, ""the football matches during the Christmas Truce"" are one of the myths surrounding the trenches. But at the same time that 'myth' is certainly based on quite a solid foundation, compared to others. 
  A re-enactment of the 1914 Christmas Truce in Ploegsteert, Belgium (AP)
  Christmas Day truce 1914: Letter from trenches shows football match through soldier's eyes for first time, Independent, 2014 His letter to his “dearest mother”, describing the famous moment former enemies risked their lives to walk out into no-man’s land to wish each other a happy Christmas and play football, has been released by Royal Mail with his family’s permission.  
  This is supposedly a real picture from 1914: 
Dokumentiert: Briten und Deutsche trafen sich während des Ersten Weltkriegs im „Weihnachtsfrieden“ 1914 auf improvisierten Fußba (Foto: pr) Comment to that picture, also used on the cover of a book cited later here: it may be from 1914. But I fail to see German soldiers in the picture, the field doesn't look like no-man's land and the people are quite scantily clad for the expected temperatures… This picture is copied thousands of times across the net, only rarely source attributed. Sometimes the source is given as 'Imperial War Museum'. Nice. Only that I can not find it there.
If anyone can contribute to identification or other details, please do so. From another account: In addition to the exchange of food and souvenirs, another standard element of many individual truces was a proposal to engage in a football match. Considering that both the British and Germans were enthusiastic footballers, and that international fixtures had been recently regulated after the creation of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) in 1904, it is hardly surprising that the thoughts of the opposing troops would turn to the possibility of a game. Although in most cases a proper match was impractical for many reasons, including lack of a ball and a suitable patch of ground, it was apparently frequently suggested. Wedderburn-Maxwell, for example, wrote that the two sides “wanted to have a football match yesterday afternoon but couldn’t get a ball.” On Christmas morning, the officers return to No Man’s Land and coordinate the burial of the dead. After the bodies are interred and a service is read over the graves, fraternization resumes with a hastily arranged football match and card playing, and there is even a juggler entertaining the troops. The next morning Horstmayer, the German officer, walks over to the French line.      British and German soldiers met in No Man’s Land, gossiped, exchanged cigarettes. In some places they played football. They met again the next day. Then, after strong rebuke from headquarters,  ring gradually started again. No one was punished for participation, and very few of those who took part allowed the event to alter their view of the war. The truce did include shared drinks and spontaneous games of football, but it also featured solemn burial parties and moments of treachery. Furthermore, the manner in which the details of the truce were accepted by the British public demonstrates that the home front was ignorant neither of the conditions on the Western Front nor the attitudes of the soldiers who served there. Consequently, the holiday armistice, in itself a fascinating and complex episode, also serves as a means of achieving further insight into the experiences and attitudes of soldiers on the Western Front, the views of the British public toward the war, and the way the discourse of the war has evolved over the past century. As a result, the 1914 Christmas truce, an event that at first glance appears to confirm the popular interpretation of the First World War, can be used to challenge that view and contribute to a more complete understanding of both the conflict and the development of the war’s orthodox narrative. Spent a very quiet Xmas day.
    Troops fraternized with enemy on 6th Div. front and held a concert and football match. Pork for dinner.
    —J. S. Fenton, 2nd Field Company Royal Engineers, diary entry for 26 December 1914
    (Chapter: “a Great day with our enemies”) While all these accounts provide details that could be found in certain of the 1914 holiday truces, they tend to treat the armistices as more consistent and homogenized than they actually were. The Christmas truce was certainly a moment of “peaceable behavior,” as Gilbert notes, but participation was motivated more by the holiday season than by a desire to lay down arms. Certainly the cease-fire was inspired partly by the idea that the enemies opposite were men like themselves, but few soldiers participating in the truce would have believed that, by  ghting a war that they perceived as necessary, they were not behaving decently the remainder of the time they spent in the trenches. The football match that De Groot claimed was inspired by the atmosphere of the truce did occur, but it was the exception rather the rule.  Terri Blom Crocker: ""The Christmas Truce.  Myth, Memory, and the First World War"", University Press of Kentucky: Lexington, 2015. The German Wikipedia concludes: In a letter published in the Times, the German lieutenant Niemann explained that in his sector at Frelinghien-Houplines a football match had been played which had run out 3:2 for the Germans - a symbol of Christmas peace which contributed to the formation of legends. However, the truth content can no longer be verified today. What is certain, however, is that there was an unorganised kick between the opponents, but that it was not played on a goal, let alone with a referee. The Football Times: The same book shares an account from the German perspective as Lieutenant Johannes Niemann of the Saxon 133rd Regiment told of a football match between the Germans and the Argyll and Sutherlands Highlanders deployed in the BEF: “A Scottish soldier appeared with a football which seemed to come from nowhere and a few minutes later a real football match got underway. The Scots marked their goal mouth with their strange caps and we did the same with ours. It was far from easy to play on the frozen ground, but we continued, keeping rigorously to the rules, despite the fact that it only lasted an hour and we had no referee.
  Source: If Only For A Day: The Christmas Truce Of 1914 So it seems that these matches did in fact occur, well, some of them, but were much more often only proposed or reported as rumours, most accounts attesting the matches as occurring in ""that other unit"". It is therefore not quite right to assume that within the hour peace broke out along the lines and almost a league being devised ad hoc to 'shoot it out on that kind of field'.  Kicking around and playing did occur; a real match is attested for very few times and quite unlikely for most, later reports. An organised match in our current sense of the word and how some have been reported: remains uncertain. Most participants on both sides of the truce probably regarded it as an unexpected holiday and some availed themselves of the opportunity to play their favourite game. […]    Klemm received a cap badge from a British soldier and noted ‘everywhere you looked the occupants from the trenches stood around chatting to each other and even playing football’. Niemann, as described above, recollected that later, a Scottish soldier brought out a football and ‘a real football match got underway’.37
  37. Chandler, ‘Diary and Letters’; Klemm, ‘Letter’; MacDonald, 1914–1918; and Niemann, ‘Das Spiel endete 3:2 für Fritz’, 32.
  View all notes There are no British descriptions of this game but Private Collier of the Argylls recalled ‘some of the men in the Platoon on our left had made a “ball” from paper, rags and string and went their “dinger” for about twenty minutes, until the ball fell to pieces and that was that’.   The two stories of the 133/Saxons’s officers, Klemm and Niemann, are essentially similar to Niemann’s post-war history of the battalion reporting soldiers of both sides chasing hares amongst the cabbages and then playing football. (Niemann, Das 9. Königlich Sächsische Infanterie–Regiment Nr.133; the official war diary of the 133 is missing from the Sächsisches Staatsarchiv in Dresden.) None of the British officers of the 2/Argylls mention playing football, but all agree that an ‘international’ match was discussed. With 1,000s of young men standing around in No Man’s Land on Christmas Day unable to really converse with each other once impromptu sign languages were exhausted and trinkets exchanged, somebody would have kicked something, and somebody would have kicked it back. Then, perhaps somebody would have hurried to inflate a ball received for Christmas or carried in their packs. It is certain that soldiers did not play a football match in No Man’s Land with stretchers for goalposts and the padre declaring Captain Blackadder offside, but with so many young men milling around, kickabout games of football with tin cans, paper wrapped with string, straw-stuffed balaclavas or perhaps with a real ball inevitably occurred, the players cheered on by their brother soldiers. However, many, including historians, know that if any football was played, it would have been in the form of improvised kickabouts and many websites, including some pages of Football Remembers, do mention football games (plural) away from their headlines. Iain Adams: ""A Game for Christmas? The Argylls, Saxons and Football on the Western Front, December 1914"", The International Journal of the History of Sport, Volume 32, 2015 - Issue 11-12, 2015 DOI One German author, not a historian but quite thorough has sifted through quite a lot of letters and other documents relating to that fact. In   Michael Jürgs: ""Der kleine Frieden im Großen Krieg: Westfront 1914: Als Deutsche, Franzosen und Briten gemeinsam Weihnachten feierten"", Bertelsmann: Gütersloh, 2009, he lists numerous of these occasions. One thing even this author – so eager to display the humaneness in war – soundly rejects in his conclusions is that these ""matches"" even produced reliable results in the form of ""Argylls 2: Saxons 3"", relegating this level of detail into the realm of legend.  The spontaneous truces around Christmas are certainly not a myth. The football playing occurring around these are probably not a myth.  The amount of playing that took place in every instance, the area of distribution along the front, or the amount of playing that took place overall, is very probably grossly inflated and very heavily distorted in the popular imagination and remembrance. This one is much too nice to not wanting to believe the most inflated account to be true."
‘Avoid sleeping on your back’ & ‘breathe in toilet smells’ were seen as precautions against the Black Death. Why did doctors think these would work?,"This cannot be answered comprehensively here. But a few key points might be revealed. The precautions mentioned in the question are by far not the only ones that were given, just mere examples. At the time, medical and lay authorities throughout Europe sought to give rational explanations for the virulent plague, which was clearly contagious. They issued many treatises trying to explain to the public the causes, symptoms, and treatment of the disease, which was in general blamed on celestial, terrestrial, and miasmatic facts as well as contagion (transference from infected persons). The plague was attributed to any and all of the following: corrupted air and water, hot and humid southerly winds, proximity of swamps, lack of purifying sunshine, excrement and other filth, putrid decomposition of dead bodies, excessive indulgence in foods (particularly fruits), God’s wrath, punishment for sins, and the conjunction of stars and planets. [emphasis added] — George Childs Kohn: ""Encyclopedia of Plague and Pestilence: From Ancient Times to the Present"", Facts On File: New York,3rd2008, p31–33. The prevailing theories to consider are hippocratic humoralpathology (humorism); that is: imbalances of juices cause illness and re-balancing them cures the illness. Applied to the theory of miasmas that means avoiding bad air is best, but using good smells can also re-balance the causative principle of the badness. Toilet smell is just a subtype of miasma (roughly ""bad airs"") coupled with the widely held belief that food is concocted and rotting in the process of digestion. The Black Death is indeed partly airborne when the infection is bubonic plague with lung involvement. Concerning to actually ""breathe in toilet smells to avoid the plague"":
this was indeed a desperate attempt to fight fire with fire. But a rare one. The principle of ""And whoever smells you also gets it."" (p51) was the prevailing theory adhered to.
— Samuel K. Cohn: ""Cultures of Plague: Medical Thinking at the End of the Renaissance"", Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2010; listing countless examples across Europe for bad smells to avoid. This theory in favour of bad smells had some supporters of a certain calibre: The smells did not have to be sweet; any strong smell might serve the purpose. Smoking or chewing tobacco was thought to bring immunity. In the 18th century it was said that the cess-pits in London had been opened during the Great Plague in an attempt to ward off the disease. In 1665 Dr Francis Glisson recommended as his ‘constant antidote’ a piece of dried manure of someone who had died of the disease, kept in a house in a porous box for ‘the best antidotical perfume’. Many of the nostrums and antidotes were unconvincing, and this one in particular sounds like the advice of a crank or at least an eccentric, but Glisson was a Cambridge man, who was Regius Professor of Physic for more than 40 years, a Fellow of the College of Physicians and an original fellow of the Royal Society. — Stephen Porter: ""Disease and the City 17th Century: Plague"", Gresham College Lecture, 2001. This was a minority opinion and only fashionable for a time. By far the most widely accepted cause of the plague, however, was foul odour caused by putrefaction. In the words of a medieval alchemical poem:
""And when evyl substance shal putrefie Horrible odour // are gendered therbye //
As of dragons, and men that long dead be, // Their stinke may cause great mortalitie."" — Constance Classen, David Howes and Anthony Synnott: ""Aroma — The cultural history of smell"", Routledge: London, New York, 1994, p59. But also note the emergence of principles as forerunners of Paracelsus and Hahnemann's homeopathy (similia similibus curantor): In fact, the fumes may not have purified “corrupted air,” but they would have acted as a stimulant and made a patient feel better. Others believed in battling stink with stink, a variation on the poison-versus-poison tactic advocated by later Paracelsians. This distinctly minority view advocated the use of nasty-smelling matter, including buckets of human waste, or the burning of foul-smelling materials like sulfur, leather, gunpowder, or human hair. Fire alone was also considered effective in purifying the air, whether in or out of doors. In 1348 papal physician Guy de Chauliac had Clement VI sit between two great fires in the main hall of his palace in Avignon for this very purpose. Fire’s natural drying effect counteracted the vile humidity that, he believed, sustained the corruption. — Joseph Patrick Byrne: ""Daily life during the Black Death"", Greenwood Press: Westport, 2006, p49. There were mono- or combined applications of different medicinal plants. Approaches that we know from homeopathy were also celebrated at that time, consciously or unconsciously: ""Stinking roots expel the stinking plague"" (expel like with like). This also applied to the root of valerian (Valeriana officinalis L.). — Ellen Wulfers: ""Heilpflanzen als Mittel gegen die Pest im Mittelalter und in der frühen Neuzeit*, Schweiz Z Ganzheitsmed 2014;26:34–44. DOI: 10.1159/000358109 (my t) More in line with current thinking would of course be the notion that once you combine bad aroma as cause for illness with the insight that for certain illnesses some survivors develop a level of immunity. It can hardly be argued that the concept would have been totally new to medieval doctors: The Athenian epidemic of 430-426 BC, […] In his remarkable documentation of the epidemic, Thucydides (who survived the disease) not only left us a clear clinical picture of the pestilence but also identified its infectious nature and the fact that it conferred at least partial immunity on survivors. This should not be read as as some form of thinking that lead to vaccinations but more like some kind of resistance training: What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Counteracting bad with bad is largely discredited by now, but it is not entirely unreasonable for seeing the deficiencies of effect of the other guidelines and then trying to do just the opposite. While those remedies that are outlined in this answer and which might be read as ""they work"": they did not always work and 'mis-applying' some apparent principles will have added to that. Sleeping on your back was thought to be associated with sudden infant death – and is now associated with late still births. A nice empircal observation is that people primarily sleeping on their back tend to snore, get apneas and do not wake up as rested as others. Sleeping on one's back is therefore generally unhealthy and best to be avoided as a general health advice. Bad air, the wrong type of food, lack of sleep, too much blood, or fright could affect the balance of humors and cause disease. Relocation to a place with good air, a diet of the right food, sound sleep, phlebotomy (controlled bleeding), or soothing music could heal. This matrix was the heart of Galenic medicine, which served as the model for Arabic, Byzantine, and western European medical theory and practice over nearly two millennia. — Byrne/Aroma, p 17, emphasis added. Notice that 'sweet smells' is what inspired the design of this mask:

This is not intended as a particulate filter but the beak is filled with herbs, spices and oils. An unintended consequence of this gear is that not only the transmission vector of fleas carrying the Yersinia pestis have a harder time to get to the wearer. Another is that also the directly airborne infectious droplets are somewhat filtered and some of the ingredients providing aroma might actually have had a bit of antibacterial like effect. The plague doctor Notradamus is reported to have used a mixture consisting of rose petals, cypress, iris, cloves, calamus, tiger lily and aloes.
Tiger lily as an antibiotic? Another unintended discovery might be possible there. tl;dr Any religious significance might be added on top of that. But the core is a long standing tradition of empirical science. There was the observation, there was the theory and it often seemed to work according to theory. (Please do not judge this on any post-Galilaen concepts, it's history of science.)
There was some apparent contemporary evidence that this worked and there is modern evidence that the advice given in these writings was not entirely hopeless, despite the desire to paint it as peculiar and even ridiculous."
Where did Medieval Europe's gold come from?,"In the Greek and Roman Era there were a number of sources in Europe tapped for gold.. These were often alluvial (alluvium is loose soil or sediment, usually around water) deposits near the mouths of rivers in Lydia, Greece, Egypt, and Asia Minor. Later more standard mines were found in the Balkans. Rome found similar river deposits in North Italy, Spain, and the Rhine and England.  Later they found mines in Spain, and Dacia in the Balkans. These deposits were mostly mined out, or are too small for the current voracious need for Gold. Gold in the Ancient World Electrum coins were outlawed by King Croesus (560-546 B.C.) and gold or silver coins were issued. Pure metal coins were necessary to
  encourage trade relations with Greece, where electrum was not found
  native in the alluvial deposits. The Greeks would not accept electrum
  coins in trade. The early source of the gold for coinage was gold
  mined from the alluvial deposits in Lydia and Greece. Thasos was a
  rich land south of Thrace that had prolific gold mines and a
  controlling interest in mainland silver mines during the sixth century
  B.C. In Greece, the right to issue coins was reserved for political
  authorities and heads of state. In 546 B.C. the Persians overran Lydia and adopted the use of coinage
  without changing the Lydian style or technology. However, they did
  bring a wealth of gold taken from Egypt. At their peak, they looted
  40,000 pounds of gold a year from Egypt. This was mostly Ethiopian
  gold now melted into the Asian melting pot. The Persians also had
  their own gold supply. The Arabian shore of the Red Sea offered
  alluvial deposits so rich that the Greek historian Diodurus wrote that
  the alluvial mud positively glittered. Gold mines used to provide new
  gold to early mints were in operation at Phoenicia, Syria, Phrygia and
  Lampsacus. The river Oxus, known today as Amu Darya, which emptied
  into the Caspian Sea, was legendary to the Greeks for its alluvial
  gold. Meanwhile, Lampsacus, at the Dardanelles, issued electrum
  coinage in the fifth century B.C. and changed to gold in the fourth
  century B.C. to encourage trade with the Greeks. A primary Greek deposit of alluvial gold was the river Pactolus which
  drained the Anatolian Highlands. Today the exact location of the river
  is uncertain and the gold strata are no longer being eroded. It was
  the gold from these sources that King Croesus used to issue the first
  true coinage backed by his crown. Because Greece as a whole had
  inadequate gold resources to support an extensive gold coinage,
  silver, for the first time, became the medium of exchange and the gold
  to silver ratio was set at 1:13. A noted exception to the silver
  coinage was the issue by Athens of gold coins from 407 to 404 B.C. to
  pay for the Peloponnesian War. Philip I of Macedonia issued a prolific gold coinage after the
  conquest of northern Greece in 348 B.C. Philip II provided the Greeks
  with their first practical gold coinage from the gold mines at Thrace,
  Macedonia. So much gold became available that the ratio of gold to
  silver changed to 1:10. . Inflation had been introduced into
  civilization. Modern hindsight might well call this the fifth Horseman
  of the Apocalypse (after Death, War, Famine, and Pestilence).
  Alexander the Great increased the gold coin supply from bullion taken
  from the Persian treasuries. Gold was again being recycled and not all
  coinage was produced from gold mined for coinage.  ROMAN GOLD COINAGE The growth of Rome began at a time when the world supply of gold was
  mounting to a very great volume and was widely disseminated. Like
  Greece, the Romans began their rise to power with very little gold in
  their natural resources. The first Roman gold came from the river Po in the western Alps and
  from southern Piedmont. Rome was slow to acquire vast amounts of gold
  and even forbade burial of gold with the deceased after 450 B.C. The
  Second Punic War gave Rome the prize that changed its gold position.
  The acquisition of Spain brought stupendous amounts of gold to Rome.
  Gold came from the mines and alluvial deposits in the Aduar Basin, the
  Malaga district, the Plains of Granada and the slopes of the Sierra
  Nevada Mountains. Gold is still found in these places today. Rome also
  got, from the treasuries of Syracuse, 2700 pounds of gold. Roman conquest brought gold to the Imperial treasury from the far
  reaches of the Empire. Gold was recycled to produce many of the gold
  coins issued during the time of the Roman Empire. Roman Imperial gold
  coins circulated far beyond the frontiers on a vast scale, making it
  the first world coinage. The coins most circulated were those of
  Augustus. The gold for these coins was mined, and the coins minted, on
  a large scale, at Lugdunum in Gaul and at Calagurris in northern
  Spain. There has been prolific gold mining at these sites since
  antiquity. Caesar provided another source of gold with the conquest of
  Britain. The geographer Strabo wrote that gold was one of the
  commodities exported to Rome after Caesar’s triumph in Britain. The
  Romans extracted gold from mines at Wales, Devon and Cornwall. The price of mining gold took a leap when the Romans developed
  hydraulic mining in the Spanish mines. Rivers were re-channeled and
  destroyed. Strabo wrote that this method produced more gold than the
  deep mines. Some of the Roman mines in Spain were 650 feet deep.
  Slaves in the mines never saw the light of day. The mines were worked
  until they collapsed on their inhabitants. Roman Egypt issued the first coinage in that ancient land. The first
  systematic mining and use of gold occurred in the Nile Valley, yet the
  Pharaohs did not issue a coinage apart from a very few and minor
  issues. After the death of Alexander the Great the Ptolemies became
  the ruling class in the land of the Pharaohs. They promptly issued a
  prolific coinage of heavy gold coins. As the influence of Rome expanded to include most of the known world,
  their sources of gold and their hunger for it expanded as well. Gold
  was taken from the Rhine River, from mines at Vercellae and from
  Transylvania. It was brought in trade from the Atlantic coast of
  central Africa, and from the sources of the Egyptians. Gold from all
  over the world flowed into Rome. The wealth of gold reached a point
  where massive statues of pure gold were displayed. The wife of Emperor
  Claudius, Agrippina, in A.D. 49, wore a tunic of plaited gold thread.
  She poisoned her husband five years later so that her son, Nero, could
  become emperor. Then Nero had her murdered five years later. All this Roman gold was scattered over Europe and Asia when the
  barbarian invaders sacked Rome. This sacking ended the systematic
  accumulation of gold on a large scale in Europe until after the Dark
  Ages."
Why did China shut itself out of the world in the 15th century?,"Well there were a few reasons Imperial China didn't need the outside trade, they were a large country that didn't have need for resources from the outside and their technology at that point was sophisticated enough for what they needed.  I've often wondered what would happen if they did not stop their explorations with Zheng He as some of the archaeology I have seen on ships from that era were innovative and very interesting.  They seemed to be able to sail fairly far with their ships, which were extremely large (although I don't know converted numbers off the top of my head) although there were issues with rising piracy in the Malay Peninsula as well as storms.   Recent conservation efforts have shown numerous ship wrecks off the Chinese coast on the way to the Malay Peninsula, wrecks that are only now being explored and providing insight into shipping that DID continue after the Qing closed off the country. Look at recent issues of Archaeology magazine for more on the wrecks, they had a couple of stories recently that were interesting on how the shipping continued as the merchants converted to Piracy (or basically being called pirates) by continuing trade against Imperial Edicts."
Has there ever been a peaceful overthrow of a dictator or monarch?,"The abdication of King Edward VIII of United Kingdom in 1936 was achieved without any bloodshed and resulted in ascension and coronation of his brother George as King of the United Kingdom. Although legally an abdication there is no doubt that his hand was forced by Parliament as well as Prime Ministers of several Commonwealth dominions. On 16 November 1936, Edward invited British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to Buckingham Palace and expressed his desire to marry Wallis Simpson when she became free to remarry. Baldwin informed him that his subjects would deem the marriage morally unacceptable, largely because remarriage after divorce was opposed by the Church of England, and the people would not tolerate Simpson as queen. .... The Prime Ministers of Australia (Joseph Lyons), Canada (Mackenzie King) and South Africa (J. B. M. Hertzog) made clear their opposition to the king marrying a divorcée; .... It was clear that Edward was not prepared to give up Simpson, and he knew that if he married against the advice of his ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis. He chose to abdicate. Assent of the Dominion Parliaments was required because the Statute of Westminster 1931 stated (my emphasis: And whereas it is meet and proper to set out by
way of preamble to this Act that, inasmuch as the
Crown is the symbol of the free association of the
members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and
as they are united by a common allegiance to the Crown,
it would be in accord with the established constitutional
position of all the members of the Commonwealth in
relation to one another that any alteration in the law
touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style
and Titles shall hereafter require the assent as well of
the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament
of the United Kingdom : The Greek monarchy has twice been abolished (1924 and 1974) and replaced by a republic consequent to referenda on the issue in 1924 and in 1973. In March 1815 Napoleon returned from Elba and overthrew King Louis XVIII, beginning The 100 Days. Firing no shot in his defence, his troop numbers swelled until they became an army. On 5 March, the nominally royalist 5th Infantry Regiment at Grenoble went over to Napoleon en masse. The next day they were joined by the 7th Infantry Regiment under its colonel, Charles de la Bédoyère, who was executed for treason by the Bourbons after the campaign ended. An anecdote illustrates Napoleon's charisma. When royalist troops deployed to stop the march of Napoleon's force at Grenoble, Napoleon stepped out in front of them, ripped open his coat and said ""If any of you will shoot his Emperor, here I am."" The men joined his cause. Marshal Ney, now one of Louis XVIII's commanders, had said that Napoleon ought to be brought to Paris in an iron cage, but on 14 March, Ney joined Napoleon with 6,000 men. Five days later, after proceeding through the countryside promising constitutional reform and direct elections to an assembly, to the acclaim of gathered crowds, Napoleon entered the capital, from where Louis XVIII had recently fled. A popular rumour is that Louis fled in such a rush ahead of Napoeon that, when the latter sat down for dinner in the palace, the seat was still warm."
Does any country have an official celebration for the annexation of foreign territory?,"Turkey celebrates ""Conquest Day"" on May 29th to commemorate the Fall of Constantinople. On this occasion in 1453 the Ottomans took the Byzantine capital, and then made it their own capital.   American Historical Review editor Robert A. Schneider summarized Gavin D. Brockett's paper ""When Ottomans Become Turks: Commemorating the Conquest of Constantinople and Its Contribution to World History"": In the modern Turkish Republic, May 29 celebrations have been a way of appropriating the imperial past for the national present. After an initial period of ambivalence following the founding of the republic, public memory embraced the quincentenary of Constantinople’s conquest in 1953."
Did anyone in ancient times want to abolish slavery?,"I don't see Gregory of Nyssa mentioned here. Fourth century Christian bishop, has a couple homilies in which he upbraids slave owners for the presumption that they could own human beings. Excerpt (quoting Eccl 2:7 where the author says ""I got me slaves and slave girls""): “I got me slaves and slave-girls,” he says. For what price, tell me? What did you find in existence worth as much as this human nature? What price did you put on rationality? How many obols did you reckon the equivalent of the likeness of God? How many staters did you get for selling the being shaped by God? God said, let us make man in our own image and likeness (Gen 1:26). If he is in the likeness of God, and rules the whole earth, and has been granted authority over everything on earth from God, who is his buyer, tell me? Who is his seller? To God alone belongs this power: or rather, not even to God himself. For his gracious gifts, it says, are irrevocable (Rom 11:29). God would not therefore reduce the human race to slavery, since he himself, when we had been enslaved to sin, spontaneously recalled us to freedom. But if God does not enslave what is free, who is he that sets his own power above God’s? It's definitely a question whether Gregory lived this out -- I believe his brother seems to have owned slaves, for instance -- but the abolitionist sentiment is definitely there. (Translation is from Gregory of Nyssa, Homilies on Ecclesiastes, Stuart Hill, ed. [Berlin: de Gruyter, 2012], 74)"
Why did it take so long to abandon sail after steamships were demonstrated?,"I think it comes down to a few basic factors: Early steam engines weren't very efficient or reliable. So it made sense to retain sails as a backup should the steam engine(s) breakdown or should the ship run out of fuel (especially on longer oceanic voyages were replenishment was uncertain). Wind-power is essentially free (once you've invested in the masts & sails in the first place), whereas you had to keep buying coal. As the steam engines were inefficient it made sense to have sails to supplement steam. This could be in the form of using them both together to add a few knots to the ship's speed or using one or the other as circumstances demanded (i.e. steam into the wind, sail down wind). Sailors are a superstitious and conservative folk, they knew sails and sailing, and it took some time to wean them off. The transition was dependent on a number of later technological changes, such as improvements in boiler design (to improve power, reliability and efficiency), the introduction of iron hulls and the introduction of the screw propeller, to make steam power capable of replacing sail. Steam was introduced into naval service when it could improve an existing system, or provide a new method of carrying out essential business. It did not revolutionise the conduct of operations at sea overnight. Early steam engines were expensive, heavy, uneconomic and ill balanced. They were far from ideal power plants for wooden ships. ... The 1840s witnessed a number of vital technological developments, of which the screw and the iron ship were the most obvious. Equally important breakthroughs in iron production, boiler design, bearings, lubricants, manufacturing and control systems were essential to the development of modern warships. Many of these technologies were drawn from other engineering sectors. By 1850 steam ships were effective and reliable enough to be used globally, while fuel supplies. engineering back-up and vital docking accommodation were spreading to meet the need. Although a few key commercial routes already carried steam shipping, this was a luxury market, catering for passengers and mail, not bulk produce. … [For a warship] it made sense to fit a square rig so the ship could cruise under sail, saving the coal for tactical demands, and emergencies. The Sail and Steam Navy List, R. Winfield (2004), pg.17"
Why didn't the Norsemen colonize North America?,"They actually did try, they just failed. The main problem was that all they really discovered was marginal territory for the purposes of Norse culture. Meanwhile they had to compete with other native cultures that were designed and optimized to live in those places. The base they had to operate out of for North America was Greenland. This itself was probably the most marginal territory of all the Norse domains. Greenland was discovered and colonized during the Medieval warm period, at which point Norse agriculture would have been most productive there. It was all the Greenlanders could do to hold on themselves, and as the climate turned around heading toward the ""Little Ice Age"", the colonies there shrunk down to only one, which was never heard from again after 1410. As the climate cooled, the arctic mammal hunting ancestors of the Inuit moved into the territory to the North and West of the Norse colony. The colder weather made the colony's territory much more suitable to Inuit (""Thule"") culture than to Norse. That probably didn't help much. This was the flip side of the coin. While all this territory they were finding was marginal for Norse agricultural purposes, it was in fact already inhabited by native cultures who were good at living there.  When European peoples did finally make successful colonies, it was further south where the climate worked better for their agriculture, and after they'd invented force-multiplying things like printing presses and guns. The Climate and population density down there was also a much better environment for the spread of European diseases, which were what really paved the way for the North American colonies.  Of course the Greenland settlements were around for 5 centuries, which as failures go, isn't too bad.  The Sagas document Norse attempts to settle past Greenland, but none lasting for more than 2 years. All mention bad relations with the natives, but one suspects that could have been overcome with reinforcements the way it was in British North America, if there had been a good supply of those forthcoming. But obviously that wasn't going to be Greenland. The next settlement over, Iceland was doing better, but not that much better."
Why are many African-Americans in Mississippi concentrated in the northwestern area?,"You are describing part of what is referred to as the Black Belt in the American South. It can be seen here in a map of majority-black US counties.  Your suspicions for the reason for this are quite correct. This corresponds to the interior of the old cotton belt. This area was historically the richest river-fed southern soil, with the largest plantations, using the largest percentage of enslaved African-Americans. You'll note that for the north/south-oriented western portion, you can practically make out the outline of the Mississippi river. After full-blown slavery was outlawed, this area largely set up a sharecropping system under the ownership of the same plantation masters that was as close to the old slavery system as could be legally countenanced. The workers were technically free, but living under a kind of debt peonage system where they didn't own anything, worked for someone else for a percentage, and would have trouble putting away enough money to afford to go seek their fortune elsewhere. Millions did anyway, of course, but the majority stayed. The politics of this area and the states it passes through have been largely divided on racial lines since the Civil War ended. It would probably be most accurate to say that, perhaps due to the potential political power of that many black voters, there's generally been a dominant White Supremacy party wing in every state that has a large Black Belt component since the Civil War ended*. Until the 1950's and '60's most of the black citizens in this area were not allowed to vote. The effort to realize their voting rights in the 1950's and '60's effectively destroyed the New Deal Coalition which the White Supremacists were part of.  This faction eventually landed in the Republican party in the new sixth party system, with the newly-enfranchised black voters almost unanimously going over to the other party, for what should be obvious reasons. This is how we got to today's party affiliation demographics in states like Mississippi, where about three quarters of whites identify or lean Republican, while blacks identify or lean around 6 in 7 Democratic. I shouldn't leave off without mentioning the tremendous cultural impact this region has had on the greater US, and the world. Jazz, Blues, and Soul were invented here. Indirectly, Rock, Hip Hop, and Gospel trace their cultural lineage here as well. This means it is the cradle of most popular music (at least in English-speaking areas) worldwide. The African-American Vernacular English dialect originated here (which is why it is somewhat similar to Southern American English), before the post-Reconstruction diaspora spread it to large cities all over the US. This is the dialect of English used predominantly in all those forms of music, as well as the one seen in other US popular culture exports on TV and movies whenever a character is meant to sound like  they hail from a tough (iow: poor) urban environment. * - Obviously this gets controversial as we get into modern politics, and I'm really sorry for that. I'm not here to hurt feelings, but modern voting patterns were part of the question. Those evolved slowly from historical voting patterns, and historically southern political White Supremacy is an incontrovertible fact, literally encoded in law."
Was Anne Frank's story common?,"No, Anne Frank's story is completely exceptional - both in circumstances and the fact that she hid for so long (and her father survived). This is a typical case of Survivorship bias. Most Holocaust victims left no memoirs (and no surviving relatives either), and did not even have their names recorded as they were murdered. This is why just about everyone knows about Auschwitz which had a forced labor section and thus quite a few survivors, but few have heard of death factories like Sobibór, Treblinka,
Bełżec, Chełmno, Maly Trostenets, Majdanek where survival rate was on the order 1:100,000. Even fewer are aware that only about 50% of murders happened in the camps. East of the Molotov-Ribbentrop line people were mostly shot at random places

Which year in history had the highest ratio of non-natural deaths?,"The actual year would be in prehistory, when the human population were more concentrated. In terms of recorded history, the initial outbreak of the Plague of Justinian in 541 had an estimated death toll of 25 million. Most estimates of world population gives about ~200 million for the 6th century. The plague thus killed roughly 10-13% of the global population. For reference, the 1918 flu pandemic killed perhaps 50-100 million. The global population at the time was about 1,860 million, however, so the ratio works out to be 2.7-5.4% of the total population. A.D. 541 also have additional ""advantages"" in terms of higher infant, maternal, and child mortality were far higher in some parts of the world, relative to the industrialised nations of 1918."
"Why can I visit battlefields, but not battleships?","Respect, preservation, and safety. While it's possible there may still be remains on a battlefield, people do their best to find and remove the bodies and bury them properly.  Sunken ships often have bodies trapped inside. The bodies were never properly buried, the ship itself is their grave. Diving on the ship can disturb the bodies. The divers may publish photos and videos including the bodies distressing the family, as happened with the SS Edmund Fitzgerald. They may take trophies and disturb the increasingly fragile wreck. While some divers will be respectful, others will not. It is much more difficult to police and limit the behavior of divers on an underwater wreck than visitors to a battlefield on land. Wrecks have dangers far in excess of a land battlefield. They feature restricted spaces, restricted visibility, dangerous currents, unstable structures, and lots of things to get snagged on. With a limited air supply, it's very easy to die in a wreck. Six people have lost their lives diving on RMS Empress of Ireland. The legality of diving on a wreck depends on the jurisdiction and designation of the wreck."
What were Germany's long-term aims in World War I?,"Territorial annexation goals do not tell the whole story. It's the economy, Stu…
Of these annexationist fantasies there were quite a lot going around during the war, and quite significantly: before the war. Obviously, they weren't all identical, but they tended to coalesce around a certain kernel of aims. It was for Germany to become the undisputed hegemon of continental Europe, and as such the leading world power. More important are the relational shifts the German side envisioned. Economic and other power parameters should be altered in favour of Germany, permanently. As such any British influence should be kept 'from the continent', France and Russia diminished in their roles and abilities. The rest would then follow 'naturally'. Wherever an inhabitant was speaking the German tongue, that settlement was ripe for incorporation into the Reich, wherever no-one speaking German could be found but the land was still 'in Europe', that should be added to an economic free trade union under German leadership. Some would term that zones or spheres of influence, or even 'puppet states'. But these words look like slightly outdated propaganda vocabulary. In short: a continental power bloc, led by Germany, but not in all its parts called 'Germany'. That is: some kind of 'union', in 'Europe', focussed on economic integration, and common defense. They tried to think of a nice name for that. And they came up with: — 'Mitteleuropa'. Yep. I know. This sounds like to create in the reader's mind an allusion to the ""European Union"". As it is now. Alas, that contraption of words was just not that popular back then. But it was thought of! An it was thought of a union of common interest, standing together combined, ""against all English speaking countries"" (as they were seen as much more aggressive; the whole following piece is not typical for German conservative Weltanschauungen, but illustrates nicely how essentially Napoleonic maps would be sold under Germanic hegemony): — Leroy-Beaulieu: ""Über die Vereinigten Staaten von Europa"", Die Umschau, Vol 4, No 37, 8 Sep, 1900, p724. In other parts of the world they thought of creating an enlarged and continuous empire, by acquiring large parts of Africa, surrounding their previous possessions and adding to that a few strategic bases around the world, like they had in China or the South Sea: Tangier, Cape Verde, Goa, Ceylon, Azores, Saigon. This sounds very much like, and will look like in the maps I'll present to you very much like the German nazi plans for Lebensraum and colonial empire for world domination we saw in World War Two. And they are almost identical. Germans are said to be good at 'recycling', in this case ideas. There are then much less grandiose plans of the madman Hitler, but a much less creative continuity of German foreign policy and strategic goals. To be clear: imperial Germany was a deeply racist and conservative state, with ample antisemitism going around. But still the fate of Eastern Europe's population was not one of extermination of Jews or Helot-like slavery for the slavs.
While such tendencies existed already in the practical administration of Ober-Ost and in the minds of some of the German officials and military there, the added extremism of genuine nazism came a short time later. What we have in 1914 is an atomising analysis of ethnicities in the East, a divide and conquer plan for Russias minorities, like Whiterussians, Ukrainians, etc. And a line of planned expansion that comes awfully close to the nazi-plan of an AA-line. The imperial German goals were shared to a degree by the administration, government, and military, the Kaiser, the politicians and for large part the general public. As a not only 'added benefit', a rally around the flag should strengthen the patriotic feelings and conservative power base: war would bring about Burgfrieden to silence proletariate, workers, social democrats and glorify a charismatic since victorious leadership; expansion into the East was primarily in settling and Germanising the land, thus diverting from the numbers of red-leaning workers automatically. These thoughts are analysed under the motto: 'primacy of domestic policy'. The date when these deliberations left academic discourse and entered public and political debate would have to be set to the era of Neuer Kurs (new course) under Wilhelm II and his chancellor Caprivi. The end of Bismarck's ""Germany is saturated"" and onwards to Wilhelm's ""our place in the sun"": The exploratory talks of German diplomacy with the aim of ""achieving agreement on the approach of the central European powers simultaneously affected"" had, however, come to nothing in Paris, Vienna, Madrid, Rome and London in view of the heterogeneous points of interest, but above all also because of the fundamental reservations in France.  The trade agreement policy pursued by Caprivi prompted the head of the trade policy department of the Foreign Office, von Berchem, in its internal preparatory stage, to consider the anti-Russian concept of a trade policy alliance on the basis of differential tariffs once again as urgent. However, Caprivi, encouraged by memoranda with contrary opinions, considered such plans, which were also described in the Foreign Office as ""dreams of the future"", to be somewhat unrealistic. After all, Caprivi took the ""Central Europe"" plans seriously enough to use them to promote the trade agreement policy of the ""New Course"" in the Reichstag: ""If the European states want to maintain their position in the world, they will not be able to avoid being closely aligned. It is not impossible that the time will come when they will realize that they have smarter things to do than suck each other's blood, because in the economic struggle for existence they will be forced to use all their strength."" With this emphasis Caprivi won widespread support across the factions. Even in the ranks of Socialist MEPs, the keyword ""United States of Europe"" made an impression.  […] As little effort was made to allay such fears, so little was the concept of an alliance of equal rights and obligations for the nations have ever been in the vicinity of the German ""Central Europe"" discussion. A constantly recurring topos remained, especially in the light of the naval propaganda that began at the turn of the century, the talk of ""one last great division of the earth"". The advocates of a Central European economic bloc were referring to the German Empire's delay in ""dividing the world"" and accordingly propagated a return to the continental power base. Gustav Schmoller, in a much-noticed ""secular view"" of European trade policy in the 19th century, assumed a quasi natural trend towards the formation of hermetic large economic areas. In addition to American high-protection customs policy, it was the British plans to establish an Imperial Customs Union that provided the advocates of a Central European economic bloc with their most important arguments.  — Peter Theiner: ""'Mitteleuropa': Pläne im Wilhelminischen Deutschland"", Geschichte und Gesellschaft. Sonderheft, Vol. 10, Wirtschaftliche und politische Integration in Europa im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert (1984), pp 128–148. These considerations developed in the process and had almost always in common the aporia that Kurt Riezler, a politically intimate advisor for Bethmann-Hollweg and author of the Septemberprogramm, had noted as early as 1915 and whose violent implementation was reserved for National Socialist expansion: Evening: long discussion about Poland and the possibility of a looser annexation of other states to the Reich - Central European system of differential tariffs. Great Germany with Belgium, Holland, Poland as close, Austria as wide protective states.(p198) ""I always drill at a German supremacy over Central Europe and all small states under the guise of a Central European confederation without loss of German power.""(p253) Yesterday we sat for a long time with the Chancellor to discuss my new Europe, i.e. the European enhancement of our will to power. The central European empire of the German nation. The nested system customary in joint-stock companies, the German Reich a joint-stock company with a Prussian share majority, any addition of new shareholders would destroy this majority, on which, as the Prussian hegemony, the Reich stands. Hence around the German Reich a confederation of states, in which the Reich has the same majority as Prussia has in the Reich - hence Prussia has the actual leadership in this confederation. To solve the Belgian question in such a way that it does not stand in the way of this future development, but on the contrary helps to bring it about itself. Then treat Austria in such a way that it grows into it by itself. […] Then strengthen the European idea in Scandinavia and Holland […] This Mitteleuropa  is the economic and political task of world history.(p268) — Karl Dietrich Erdmann (Ed): ""Kurt Riezler, Tagebücher, Aufsätze, Dokumente"", Vandenhoek & Ruprecht: Göttingen, 1972, (p253). As such any analysis of this subject cannot refrain from looking at the seminal work of the German historian Fritz Fischer. He summarised these undeniable continuities in his first major work called ""Griff nach der Weltmacht, die Kriegszielpolitik des Kaiserlichen Deutschland, 1914–18. (1961)."" ('Germany's grab for world power', translated into English as only the second part of the title: Germany's Aims in the First World War. In this book the Septemberprogramm first came into the public eye. The book caused a scandal among right-wing leaning German historians at the time, as one of the implications from that (which Fischer did not make explicitly at the time), would have been that the 'war guilt paragraph' of the Treaty of Versailles that blamed Germany alone for the 'outbreak' of the war would have been an accurate description. (That's not the case though, as Austria, France, Britain and Russia at the very least very much also contributed to that. While much too apologetic, cf eg Christopher Clark's 'Sleepwalkers'). After some fierce debates, and a few more studies reaching the same conclusions, Fischer's own main findings are no longer under dispute or even doubtful. His own later works just add to that mountain of evidence. (Also look at his other works, like ""War of illusions : German policies from 1911 to 1914"" that shows how this was very well part of the programme, before the world war started… In terms of historical philosophy, a Hegelian inevitability of the next war informed much decision making.) It should be emphasised that Riezler's Septemberprogramm, was itself not public knowledge at the time in 1914. It was a kind of most common or least common denominator compromise that chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg sought to appease  all sides in the debate: The Alldeutschen, the Navy League, the military on land as well as the navy itself, the industrial capitalists, the agrarian capitalists and so on. It is most significant for how it formed a picture of the base of discussions that existed before the war and how the different ideas waxed and waned around those visions of grandeur but had to adopt to 'realities on the ground' as well as changing desires of annexationists and economic planners. Especially the Alldeutschen had this to say, in 1894 in one of its first publications, the 'Alldeutschen Blätter', to which the internal 'compromise' offer of 1914 war aims in Septemberprogramm has to be read: To the East and Southeast we must gain elbow room in order to secure for the Germanic race the living conditions it needs to develop its full strength, even if such inferior peoples as Czechs, Slovenes and Slovaks (…) were to lose their existence, which was useless for civilization (…) German colonization, German industriousness and German education (…) were to serve as a binding agent as far as Asia Minor, through which large and future-rich economic areas (…) would join us. Buy it at the kiosk! These early Alldeutschen demands were in comparison quite moderate. In 1908 they make the outspoken antisemite Claß their new chairman. And he radicalises ever more for the next 30 years. In 1909 already Claß propagated as an alleged 'conclusion from history' that Germany had to direct its expansion policy primarily towards the East. He accused the ruling circles of the Empire of having pursued a ""weak"" foreign policy since 1890 and demonized the Social Democrats as well as the members of the Centre Party and the Free Democrats as ""pests"". Claß called for another war aim in itself: war! And for a dictator – and in the event that he would lead Germany into a great war, he declared: So much the better for our people! Then the war will make them well, and misery and tears will reawaken their moral strength, and the cannon thunder will disperse the clouds; they will prove their heroic strength and find their heroism again, and return home from the bloodbath of battle, strengthened and richer, despite all the losses of life and property. Then the way into the future would be clearer for us all the more!
— Einhart (Claß pseudonym): ""Deutsche Geschichte"", Dieterich: Leipzig, 1909. As the Septemberprogramm summarises itself: Securing the German Reich to the East and West as far as possible. To this end, France must be weakened in such a way that it cannot be reestablished as a great power, Russia must be pushed off the German border as far as possible and its rule over the non-Russian vassal nations must be broken. This leads to researchers concluding: Fischer irrefutably demonstrates, as was already evident with particular clarity from the work of G. Gratz and R. Schüller, which he did not cite, the extent to which the interests of German industry determined the German war aims. Especially in view of the emphasis Fischer places in the main part of his work on the intentions of economic domination and exploitation of the territories in the German sphere of power, […]
[…] he says that the Upper Silesian industry had brought Polish mines and Polish ore ""up to Radom"" under its control through strong capital participation, that German heavy industry was interfering in the Ukrainian and Caucasian raw material areas of Krivoj Rog and Ciaturi (Thyssen's interest in the ores of the Danube region and the manganese of the Caucasus), and that the German banks were expanding their relations with the Russian banking world with regard to the armaments business; he also mentions the strong German economic interests in Romania…

Here, we'll look at nice maps now. First Mittelafrika (as also discussed here)  
 Now Mitteleuropa: 


 Notice the arrows to indicate that Persia and India were next on the list of directions to expand power into. And how well the Peace Treaty of Brest-Litowsk was used as an achievement and a spring board.
(Src: Fischer, War Aims) If that sounds like Fischer making things up, or an overstatement? Then we might look at more contemporary publications? One would be ""Germany's future"" from 1917 (archive.org). From that we see the following snapshots: 
 For a contemporary look at 'Europe', based initially on Septemberprogramm, but with the successes later in the war, the possibilities for a grab of land expanded, a bit: 

(Src here: Maps from the British Dominions Year Book 1918. Edited by Edward Salmon and James Worsfold. London: Eagle, Star and British Dominions Insurance Co. via Perry-Castañeda Library
Map Collection.) Remarkably, to label the vast territory, now only the first two letters would fit into the old borders of the Reich… A pipe-dreamish optimistic way – that was minority position – is recorded in the Imperial War Museum: 
Alban Rumann, 1915, Germany. IWM (Art.IWM PST 7215), In that vision, England is a German colony, Scotland free as an independent kingdom, the whole of France of similar status, but apparently administered from Berlin like Alsace was before 1914, Belgium, northern France as conquered in 1914 and the Baltic region annexed directly. Much of the Eastern Europe hinterland is given to Austria-Hungary though and Poland nominally independent. Plus: as a direct 'war aim', these colourful maps have to be labeled 'allied propaganda', not entirely accurate.
While German plans really envisioned a quite agronomically oriented expansion into the East, for the state territory itself, most plans were a bit more modest, calling for vast annexations of directly adjacent lands, and a fragmentation of bordering and then in consequence German-dependent states carved up along ethnic lines, according to nationalist thinking, if possible. If not, then 'made possible'.
These exact ideas displayed in the maps from the British Dominion Yearbook of 1918 were not widely shared in Germany.
But these ideas were all on the table indeed, and this question asked for 'long term plans'. In effect Germany's elites and masses were confronted with the choice, over time, of trying:
(1) to preserve the Small Germany, which Prussia dominated and millions of whose inhabitants, German-speaking or otherwise, were branded as enemies—in short, a basically unstable German situation;
(2) to escape from that instability by creating a Great Germany, with Austria and parts of its empire absorbed;
(3) to go further and seek a German-dominated Mitteleuropa running from the North Sea to the French Alps, from Alsace-Lorraine into Western Russia, and including as at least economic satellites the former members of not only the Austro-Hungarian but the Turkish empires as well.
As Fischer has persuasively argued, Mitteleuropa was the choice that most of the elites for converging reasons came to embrace shortly before 1914.

What did people in 13th century England know about Greek mythology?,"Quite a bit, actually. Graeco-Roman mythology was a significant part of the education curriculum. Much of the educated elite would have been broadly familiar with ancient Greek mythologies through its Latin form, albeit overlaid with a Christian point of view. In High Medieval England, an anthology of six works known collectively as the Liber Catonianus (aka Sex Auctores) became a standard textbook of sorts. Widely used in English schools, they notably included: Together, these texts provided medieval English students with a somewhat surprisingly rich education in ancient Graeco-Roman religion and culture.  Both Claudian and Statius were Ancient Roman poets, while the Eclogue is dated to between the 9th and 10th centuries, written perhaps by a Saxon theologian called Gottschalk of Orbais. A translation is available here, which gives you an idea of what a 13th century student in England would've known. It contains many Graeco-Roman myths familiar even to a modern audience, for example the myth of Proserpina. Moreover, its status as a standard text for instruction means we can expect the educated class to be reasonably familiar with its contents. Much of the myths related by the Eclogue would also have been widely available in the form of two more sources: Metamorphoses by Ovid, and the works of Virgil. Both Roman poets drew considerably on Graeco-Roman mythological traditions, and were held in extremely high literary esteem by Medieval Europeans. Virgil's Fourth Eclogue was even perceived as a messianic prediction of the birth birth of Jesus. Their popularity during the Middle Ages was a significant influence on writers of the time: Metamorphoses clearly had a big impact on the works of Chaucer, for instance. Given their status as Medieval pop culture blockbusters, most educated people in the 1200s were likely familiar with their works. Note that all of this were Latin, at the time the lingua franca of Western Europe including England. The relative abundance of information on Classical mythology were likewise transmitted from mainly Romans via Latin poetry. Whatever knowledge of Greek traditions existed was, therefore, filtered through a Roman viewpoint. Further Reading:
Orme, Nicholas. Medieval Schools: From Roman Britain to Renaissance England. Yale University Press, 2006.
Hunt, Tony. Teaching and Learning Latin in Thirteenth-Century England. Boydell & Brewer, 1991.
 Wallace, David, ed. The Cambridge History of Medieval English Literature. Cambridge University Press, 2002. Apart from Latin works such as those mentioned above, classical texts were largely ""lost"" to Western Europe during the Middle Ages, due to the knowledge of Greek becoming very rare in the Latin West. In the 13th century, however, a rediscovery was just beginning to occur. Many classical texts had been translated into Arabic following the rise of Islam. Starting with the reconquest of Toledo in 1085, a large collection of such ""lost"" works fell into European hands. The Arabic translations were relatively easily re-translated into Latin, and in this way classical knowledge spread throughout Latin Europe again. Of course, these were still transmitted in Latin. So if any text on Greek mythology reached 13th century England in this way, literacy in Latin would still be required to understand it first hand."
Did medieval peasants work 150 days a year?,"Probably not. The one economist this number can be traced to now says its a huge underestimate. In 1986 economist Gregory Clark wrote a working paper that (according to citers) contained this estimate. It doesn't appear he published it, but it got cited. He actually did for real publish a new paper in 2018 raising that number up to an estimate of 250-300 days. That's quite a revision! However, in the meantime a popular book was published by a sociologist that used that earlier lower number of 150. ""The Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure"". Since then this number went wild on the internet (likely because its a shocking number, or perhaps because people like that number and want it to be true). Whatever the reason, it seems I see this on Twitter (largely because someone I follow is debunking it) at least once a week, often with a variant of that picture. Its happened enough that since April there's been a Twitter community note for it:  User u/LordEiru on r/badhistory did a deep dive on this. The whole story is worth reading (although a bit aggressive for my tastes). They did include several links to the sources involved. The Clark citation is by comparison more fair and accurate. That is
not to say it is without issues, however. First, the citation is to a
working paper that does not appear to have ever been published fully –
Clark himself does not list it anywhere on his publications, and other
attempts to find it only make reference to it having been cited in
Schor’s work. Nonetheless, it would be reasonable to ask if work from
1986 is still an authoritative source on the subject or should be used
as evidence. The answer is very hilariously no: Gregory Clark doesn’t
believe that Clark 1986 is correct. The Atlantic published an article
on the debate over the working hours subject on May 6th, 2022, in
which Clark is quoted as rejecting the prior conclusion and noting his
current work on the subject instead estimates nearly 300 days of labor
per year – quite in line with the 308 days estimate by Keynon. Here's a link to the Atlantic Article where Clark's work is mentioned. Sadly, being an overworked peasant myself, I'm stuck soundly on the wrong side of its paywall."
Why were the West African islands uninhabited?,"First off, I'd ask you to look at my answer to a similar question about Madagascar and New Zealand. In particular it points out that historically uninhabited landmasses got populated by humans in one of 3 ways. In fact, one could probably extend #3 to say that pretty much every culture making use of method #3 above prior to the Renaissance was either Austronesian or Norse. There's probably some exceptions, but none come immediately to mind. A farming culture might have the capability of devoting enough resources and specialists to support open-ocean navigation and colonization, but still most cultures have better things to do. So of the islands on the East side of Africa you mentioned: The West side of Africa islands you mention on the other hand are all hundreds of KM from the African coast, and the Austronesians and Norse are quite inconveniently far away (and would have to go way out of their preferred latitudes to get there)."
Where would the first nuke have been dropped in Germany? [closed],"For practical purposes, the decision to deploy all B-29 bombers in the Pacific Theatre had an untended side effect: Only Japan could be targeted by the Manhattan Project deliverables. Both Little Boy and Fat Man were 10 feet long and over 5 tons, significantly beyond the delivery capabilities of either the B-17 (3 ton maximum payload) or B-24 (4 ton maximum payload) even at minimum range. This left only the B-29 as a capable American bomber, and by its deployment only the Pacific Theatre as delivery zone. General Groves discussed these points after the war in a recall of an interview with F.D.R.: .... The plan had always been to bomb Japan because we thought the war in Germany was pretty apt to be over in the first place and in the second place the Japanese building construction was much more easily damaged by a bomb of this character than that in Germany. I urged President Roosevelt that it would be very difficult for various reasons. The main one was that the Germans had quite strong aerial defense. They made a practice, as every nation does, that when a new plane came into the combat area, that they would run any risk that they could to bring such a plane down so that they could examine it and see what new ideas had come in so that they could make improvements and also would know the characteristics of the plane so that they could prepare a better defense against it. We had no B-29’s in Europe. If we had sent over a small squadron or group as we did against Japan of this type, everyone of them would have been brought down on the first trip to Germany. If they hadn’t been, it would have been through no lack of effort on the part of the Germans. The alternative would be to bring a large number of B-29’s over to to England and that would have been a major logistical task and the other possibility would have been to have used a British plane which would not have been a bit pleasing to General Arnold and also would have created a great many difficulties for our general operation because then it would be an Allied operation with the United States furnishing the bombs and everything connected with it but using a British plane and a British crew to actually drop the bomb and it would have raised a tremendous number of difficulties."
Why are many African nations poor?,"For a country to be economically prosperous you need a couple of things: You need the rule of law in the economy. A country where people can steal, cheat or break contracts as they wish makes it very difficult to conduct business. You need ownership rights. If you do not own the land, factory or house that you are using to make money, you will not invest in it as the investment is likely to be taken away from you. You need a high life expectancy, and you need inheritances. If you are likely to die soon, you won't try to build a business long term. Instead you will try to steal others money, since making your own fortune will take too long. Similarly you will not try to amass a fortune  if you can't pass it on to your offspring. Some things that therefore prevent prosperity are wars, socialism and diseases. Africa has been quite uniquely ravaged by all three during the 20th century. During the 18th and especially 19th century it was ravaged by the western powers who of course based their whole interest there in stealing.[1] It is notable that natural resources do not figure in the list. In fact, having plenty of natural resources are often a curse, as it will attract people who aren't interested in keeping 1, 2 and 3 alive and well. The natural resources in Africa are sometimes a cause for war, and almost always a cause for large-scale corruption and a practical collapse of the rule of law.

Why are military uniforms often flared or poofy above the knee?,"These are jodhpurs, a style of pants developed primarily for horseback riding. Their intent was to allow flexibility in the hip and thigh while the more narrow lower portion worked well with riding boots and didn't get caught up in stirrups. "
How did Genghis Khan's army feed so many horses?,"Let's do the math: 100,000 mounted archers * 4 horses each * 10 kg/day * 250 days/campaign = 1,000,000,000 kg of forage required each campaign. As noted here annual forage yield of meadow steppe is about 2000 kg/ha; of typical steppe about 900 kg/ha; and even desert steppe yields 200 kg/ha. Thus the area required to support Genghis's cavalry for a campaign ranges between 500,000 to 1,000,000 ha, or 5,000 to 10,000 km^2. A single day's forage could be found in an area of 20 to 40 km^2, which seems quite a reasonable campground size for an army of 100,000 cavalrymen. Of course, given this forage requirement, it is no surprise that Genghis's army moved so rapidly - if it didn't it was going to starve.
;-) Update:   Genghis's army rode ponies, not full horses, reducing forage needs accordingly. Update 2:
Let me rephrase - The Mongols (and other steppe peoples such as Manchus and Turks) rode breeds of horse that average a bit under the modern 14 hands height limit for a pony. Let's say typically 13 to 15 hands. This is about one hand shorter than the height of a typical riding horse, of 14 to 16 hands. As fuel requirement generally goes as the cube of height, ceteris paribus, a horse/pony only 14/15 as high would require about 20% less feed. Make it 15% less to allow for cooler temperatures and a consequently faster metabolism for the breed."
What was the status of Arab Christians during the crusades?,"Most of the information I have found indicates that the Arab Christians were caught in the crossfire between the Muslims and the Christian Crusaders. In fact, they were often slaughtered along with the Muslims. Most likely this was because the Crusaders did not want to risk being infiltrated by Muslims posing as Christians.  Ironically, the Crusades indirectly contributed to the decline of Christianity in the Middle East. At the time they took place, Arab Christians actually constituted a majority of the population in many areas. This was not only due to the deaths attributed directly to the Crusades, but also to the introduction of diseases brought into the area by the Crusaders. Also, the eventual and gradual diverting of internationl trade led to many of the Arab Christians leaving the area to follow the trade routes that they depended on for survival.  Ultimately, it does not appear that the Arab Christians at any time were ever significant contributors to the Christian war efforts during the Crusades."
Why didn't Europeans before Gutenberg print with woodblocks?,"First I would say that during the medieval period the demand for books was much lesser than after the books became comparatively cheap after Gutenberg. The key here is the expense a quickly worn out woodblock presents that could only be used for one page. Whereas you already mentioned the crucial innovation for European book printing Gutenberg is known for: moveable type! Xylography is expensive. Although that is just one societal pre-condition for a breakthrough, or in this case: explosion. For the demand part, cf Lotte Hellinga: ""The Gutenberg Revolutions"", p207–219, in: Simon Eliot & Jonathan Rose (Eds): ""A Companion to
The History of the Book"", Blackwell: Malden, Oxford, 2007. And: The emergence of a literate middle class in the later Middle Ages created a demand for new types of books. These tended to be popular works of a recreational or technical nature, which were often in the vernacular. We know very little about the beginnings of the book trade outside of the monasteries and universities, but certainly there was an independent trade by the late twelfth century. University stationers were free to engage in outside trade and no doubt did so. Books seem most often to have been made to order, but also occasionally for speculation--with no specific buyer in mind. Some orders were large: in 1437 a wholesale bookseller sent an order to a scriptorium in the Low Countries for 200 copies of the Seven Penitential Psalms, 200 copies of Cato's Disticha in Flemish, and 400 copies of a small prayer book.
— Richard W. Clement: ""Medieval and Renaissance book production"", Utah State University Library Faculty & Staff  Publications, Paper 10, 1997. (Online) Keep in mind that a woodblock in action seems like a great time and cost saver compared to a slow scribe. But that block needs to be perfect. One error and you need a whole other block to start from scratch. Then there is a slight misconception apparent in how the question is framed. It is correct to describe Gutenberg's innovation as printing (with moveable type). But one of the things he 'stole' to combine it into something fresh was that he took a press from wine making – or even paper production –for his purposes. This press and its great forces is the biggest cause for wearing out a woodcut so quickly. Using much less force – doing that by hand – is called a rubbing. This technique was apparently used by ancient Egyptians and never ceased to be used on a variety of materials. The techniques of stamping and modeling were also known and used. That leads to the supply side of the equation. It features the materials needed. Vellum, parchment and papyrus are not really well suited for printing and paper was late to the party in Europe. Earliest book on paper, partially, and imported, made in Europe seems to be the Missal of Silos, dated to 1151. Second: but they did print with woodblocks before Gutenberg: A deceased Abbess of Mechelen in Flanders in 1465 had ""unum instrumentum ad imprintendum scripturas et ymagines … cum 14 aliis lapideis printis"" (""an instrument for printing texts and pictures … with 14 stones for printing"") which is probably too early to be a Gutenberg-type printing press in that location.
— WP: Woodblock printing Or put in another way: The so-called wood plate printing belongs to the common printing technique of the 14th century. It was popular in Europe until Johannes Gutenberg invented letterpress printing and was used to print any kind of text on paper.
— Ein frühes Druckverfahren – der Holztafeldruck (my translation) It is just that Gutenberg's inventions (let's call it like that for the purpose of this question) was so disruptive that we now tend to overlook 2 centuries of printing in Europe, because of their small scale. Exactly dating this block printing of whole books seems contested. But it seems to be at least accepted by some between before 1420 and 1451. If we had as many early prints as we have Greek pots, we would ont have to guess about practically all the beginnings of printmaking Few early prints can be dated precisely. A Dutch Madonna has 1418 carved on the block, but the surviving impression is too heavily painted and damaged to reproduce clearly. The next preserved date, 1423, occurs on a south German Saint Christopher, whose drapery flows in the wind as it then did in paintings. (After about 1460 northern drapery straightens out and
and breaks at angles.) The earliest datable Italian print was the subject of a miracle in 1428, when it was tacked to a schoolroom wall in Forli. There it certainly would have yellowed until it was thrown away had not the school caught fire one february day. The crowd that gathered outside saw this paper shoot up out of the flames, hover over the hot updraft, and flutter down into their hands. With cries of ""Miracle!"" (and who could resist?) the print was carried into the cathedral.

It is a portrait of St. Christopher dated 1423 preserved in the John Rylands Library, Manchester, England:  This is of course not the only acceptable view on that matter: Printing onto cloth had spread much earlier, and was common in Europe by 1300. ""In the 13th century the Chinese technique of blockprinting was transmitted to Europe,"" soon after paper became available in Europe. The print in woodcut, later joined by engraving, quickly became an important cultural tradition for popular religious works, as well as playing cards and other uses.
 — Prologue To Graphic Design  – The Asian Contribution Woodblock printing> That means once the demand was recognised different techniques were experimented on to improve on the works of scribes at roughly the same time. Woodblock printing was used quite early on but was quickly diagnosed with all its problems and people realised that for quick, cheap and large volumes, woodcut just wasn't cutting it. One interesting side note for ""why not for [insert your deity]"": The printing trade in Europe was one of the first business sectors governed by capitalist principles, whereas the invention and subsequent development of book printing in East Asia were motivated less by financial interests than religious considerations or initiatives of monarchs devoted to the dissemination of certain texts. Thus it comes as no surprise that the earliest printed products were texts of a religious nature. The oldest woodblock print, a Buddhist Dharani-Sutra scroll probably produced in China between 704 and 751 and measuring only eight centimeters in height but six meters in length, was discovered in southeastern Korea in 1966. While Arabian woodblock prints are known to have existed since the tenth century, religiously motivated respect for the written word handed down in manuscript form prevented the establishment of printing firms in Islamic countries until well into the eighteenth century.
Book printing was not always welcomed with open arms in Europe. The Church feared that heresies would be disseminated, primarily in vernacular publications. […] It is astonishing to realize that a number of universities initially had reservations about book printing. Although every university city in Germany, with the exception of Greifswald, had a printing shop in the fifteenth century, publications by faculty members were quite rare.
 — Urs Leu: ""Not everyone was pleased about the invention of book printing. The church and some universities were skeptical."" Swiss Nationalmuseum  Addresssing the update to the question: While woodblock printing is arguably more suitable for the Chinese writing system than the scripts used in Europe, this shows that it is clearly possible to use woodblocks for book printing on a large scale. Saying ""woodblock printing is impractical"" is not a very good explanation. Cynthia Brokaw: ""Publishing and Popular Literature in Imperial China""
(DOI: 10.1093/acrefore/9780190277727.013.151)
By the 18th century, the population increase and growing demand for texts—and the spread of woodblock printing to the interior and hinterland—ensured the dissemination of a common core of universally popular fictional works throughout China Proper. It was not, however, until the early 20th century and the widespread adoption of mechanized printing, that a true mass readership developed. Describes precisely why ""woodblock printing is impractical"". It is expensive and slow and the matrices wear out too quickly under stress. Cost can be driven down with metal while volume increases. Continuing a trend that began in the late Ming, the cost of cutting woodblocks—by far the most expensive part of the production process—declined, so that investing in commercial publishing became a reasonably attractive enterprise. For cutting a woodblock you need an expert. For typesetting in metal you arguably need also an expert, but one on a much lower level of expertise. While Gutenberg himself and many other prints after the 42-line bible displayed remarkable craftsmenship, after the incunable era the overall decline in typographic quality for example was readily apparent and only repeated in modern times with the introduction of word processors and DTP. Comparing the differences between China and Europe, one is also easily mislead by the just quoted article: Although scribal manuscripts still dominated and continued to exist in China until at least the nineteenth century, China has the longest history of printing in the world.[…]
The nature of Chinese written language limited the practicability and potential use of movable-type printing in China. Since the language consists of thousands of ideograms, grouping and assembling the types is labour intensive and required considerable linguistic knowledge from the workers. Movable-type printing is economically suitable for large quantities for a single run, whereas block printing is more desirable for small quantities produced over long periods of time. The latter was ‘precisely the pattern of book demand and supply in traditional Chinese society’, therefore movable-type did not replace block printing.[…]
Through the examinations of printing technologies, literacy and urbanisation, books prices and access to and control over knowledge, it concludes that the circulation of books in China was substantially smaller than in Europe. It has also analysed the demand for and supply of books containing potentially useful knowledge. The limited data available shows that there was continuity under Song-Yuan-Ming dynasties and that could be correlated with slow but steady technological advance over these centuries. On a per capita basis, growth of book production and circulation declined significantly from the Qing onwards. The decline can be linked to stronger state control over the dissemination of knowledge which can be dated to the early Ming but intensified under the Qing, even though commercialisation of book production expanded under both dynasties. Hierarchy in the Chinese knowledge system is apparent. Books on useful knowledge constituted but a small share of a larger number of books produced, published and preserved throughout the Chinese history. Priority was accorded to Confucian classics and histories. Books may have played a more limited role than was the case in Europe as conduits linking theoretical to tacit knowledge.

How severe were the casualties in ancient/medieval battles?,"It all depends on which era you are talking about. There are mostly 3 different medieval eras; early, high, and late middle ages. In Medieval Warfare: A History there is a chapter that talks about it. In the early and partly high middle ages, people were few and only the nobles and the clergy fought in wars. Those two groups were pretty important and, as time went on, heavily armored and well equiped. In impoverished enviroments it was also better  to take ransom, rather than lives. So battles were fought mostly on small scale, and casualties from the battle itself were few. The percentage according to the book (if I am not mistaken it was 5% exactly) was that low for the battle itself - excluding marching deaths, illness, and other factors. Later on though, during the high and late middle ages, the European war-machine became more sophisticated, population increased, and the middle class arose and took part in non-equestrian battles using pikes and other less glorious but just as effective weapons. This led to large scale battles with more casualties on the ill equiped. So yes, as TomAu and fred2 said, there was a time when war took a great toll. And this is especially true during the late middle ages and the introduction of gunpowder."
"Why couldn't Japan crack the Navajo Code in WW2, when they captured a Navajo native speaker?","Question: Why couldn't Japan crack the Navajo Code in WW2, when they captured a Navajo native speaker? Because it wasn't enough to just speak Navajo,  they still had to know the code. So let's say in the code a turtle signified a company of soldiers and up the hill signified heading to the south coast of the island.  It would take a Navajo speaker to tell you 3 turtles were headed up the hill.  But if you didn't know what that meant, you had no hope in understanding the code. The code was spoken over wired telephone lines which the Japanese tapped into.  The messages might have been broken if the given Navajo speakers were situationally relevant to the message.   But being POW's,  they were often given the messages to translate removed from the battlefield both by time and distance.  This meant they couldn't compare the messages to actual events on the battlefield to try to decipher them.  They could not just read,  3 turtles crawled up the hill, and see three companies of men began to head down to the south coast, and associate the two events. From Comments: @Oleg Lobachev  How hard is it to learn the needed amount of Navaho anyway? An intelligence officer could do this and then observe the field... – It's basically impossible to learn in a few months in order to be helpful to the Japanese, especially in a wartime Japan, removed from any resources.  What resources would a Japanese code breaker have to learn a language if the population who speaks that language is behind enemy lines and few language texts exist? PBS
Although Navajo is the most-spoken Native American language in the U.S., it is rarely spoken outside of the Navajo reservation. An unwritten language without a traditional alphabet or symbols [a written language was developed prior to WWII], Navajo's extreme complexity of syntax makes it unintelligible to anyone without extensive exposure and training. . from Kentaro
Sorry I reversed my upvote. The reason is your above claim without any proof.
–  (This claim without any proof) @JMS My understanding is that the Japanese knew the Marines were using a Navaho Indians as code talkers. My apology,  the comments are too tight a space to give sources, so often I don't even try.  I say the Japanese knew the Marines were using Navajo Indians as code talkers,  because they sought out a Navajo POW and enlisted him to help break the code.  Thus the Japanese knew they were dealing with not only an American Indian code, but specifically one based on the Navajo language. Joe Kieyoomia was a Navajo soldier from New Mexico, who was not a code talker.  He was captured by the Japanese when the Philippines fell at the beginning of the War.  The Japanese tried unsuccessfully to put him to work trying to crack the Navajo code. Joe Kieyoomia
The Japanese tried unsuccessfully to have him decode messages in the ""Navajo Code"" used by the United States Marine Corps, but although Kieyoomia understood Navajo, the messages sounded like nonsense to him because even though the code was based on the Navajo language, it was decipherable only by individuals specifically trained in its usage. . @Swansea
@JMS Why weren't the Japanese deliver intercepts to the Navajo POWs and back to Japanese intelligence in a timely manner, like you wrote? To use the example in my quote, why didn't the Japanese report, after the US called ""Apache support"", everything that followed including helicopter gunships to the Navajo POWs? from Kentaro
@So, I need the source! You don't have to hurry, your answer is not bad, so I'm waiting for your effort. Anyway, thanks ( on how the JIA associated the Navajo Language with the unbreakable code. ) @Kentaro,  It seems like interrogations of the many Marine POW's the Japanese captured would be the obvious source. I'm not stating that as a fact, although it probable is how they found out.  I did find this source which claims a Japanese interrogator Goon pieced it together upon interrogating Joe Kieyoomia.  That doesn't seem reasonable that this Translator thousands of miles removed from the battle field in Nagasaki would piece this together.  I think captured POW's who would certainly have been questioned vigorously on knowledge of this code would be the more reasonable source.  Then Goon got involved when the Japanese searched their camps for a native Navajo speaker.  That's just my hypothesis.  The Japanese knew about Joe Kieyoomia because when they captured him in the Philippines they mistook him for an ethnically Japanese person.   It took some time for him to convince them he was Navajo.     Here is that source. Code Talker: The First and Only Memoir By One of the Original Navajo Code Talkers
Despite the United States' insistence upon secrecy, the Japanese somehow learned that the unbreakable code being utilized by the Americans had something to do with the Navajo language.  No one knows exactly how or when this information was obtained, but it has been hypothesized that a Japanese translator with the surname Goon first associated the Navajo language with the unbreakable code while participating in the interrogation of Joe Kieyoomia.  Kieyoomia, a Navajo man who has survived the Bataan Death March, was questioned by Goon and tortured by his Japanese captors in their attempt to force him to crack the code.
.... Several Navajo prisoners reported, postwar that the Japanese had tried to get them to figure out the marine's code.  None of these captives were code talkers, and none shed any light on the complicated secret language."
What is the historical basis for the Exodus?,"I'll summarize what the Jewish Study Bible, 2nd edition says about the subject.  This material is from the introduction to Exodus and two essays: ""The Religion of the Bible"" and ""Archeology and the Hebrew Bible"". Positive evidence: We know that Semites of similar ethnicity to the Hebrews had for centuries migrated to Egypt in search of food and water during famine; others were brought there as slaves.  Some of the Asiatics (as the Egyptians called them) were engaged in royal building projects, like the Hebrews of Exodus.  The name ""Moses"" is of Egyptian origin--the etymology in the Bible is invented.  It seems odd that the Israelites would invent a story about being slaves in another land and invaders of the land they inhabited.  The numbers are certainly exaggerated--the wilderness could never have supported 600,000 Israelite men plus women and children--but it's not implausible that the exodus has a historical kernel of truth. Negative evidence: There is no reference to the exodus in Egyptian records, although Egyptian records typically record only victories and not defeats.    There is no extrabiblical evidence of the ten plagues or of a massive escape of slaves.  All attempts at identifying archeological evidence for the sojourn in Egypt and for the exodus have been unsuccessful.  The conquest of Canaan portrayed in Joshua and Judges, where the Israelites utterly destroy the native Canaanites, directly contradicts archeological evidence.  Canaanite sites show no evidence of large-scale destruction at the end of the Bronze Age, and early Israelite sites are very similar to older Canaanite sites.  Even the Israelite religion was similar to that of the Canaanites--in the oldest poetry of the Bible (like the Song of Deborah and the Blessings of Jacob), Yahweh seems to be a mixture of features attested in Canaanite and Ugaritic religions for the creator god El, the ""old god"", and the storm god Baal.  Even the Jerusalem Temple built by Solomon was a typical Canaanite shrine, with a ""holy of holies"", an altar, cultic pillars, and elaborate decorations of palmettes, lotus, bulls, and cherubim."
What were the acceptance criteria in universities of medieval Europe?,"More details can be found in the related Wikipedia article. University students typically had one of three sponsors: The admissions criteria and payments were set by the respective sponsors. That is the church and crown had their own ""feeder"" schools, and chose the best students of these to take university degrees, and generally paid for the students' education. These choices were made on the basis of public policy. Wealthy families might ""home school"" their children, perhaps hiring tutors affiliated with universities, then sending those children to whichever universities would accept them, with the family paying the way."
Why didn't Japan take Pearl Harbor when they had the chance?,"The ""they couldn't"" make the airborne assault with paratroopers is underscored by the fact that their longest range transport planes had ranges (one way) of at most 3300 km (about 1700 NM) so even on a one way trip they could not reach Hawaii.  But the idea is dead in the water for a number of very basic reasons, the two primary ones being Strategic and Logistic. Objectives The Japanese planned to occupy the Philippines as part of their plan for a ""Greater East Asia War"" in which their Southern Expeditionary Army Group seized sources of raw materials in Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies while the Combined Fleet neutralized the United States Pacific Fleet. In military terms, the attack on Pearl Harbor was not the main effort.  It was a supporting effort to the main effort in the Philippines and points east in the Dutch East Indies. A point on fundamental military doctrine: you weight1 the main effort The whole point of attacking and neutralizing the US fleet at Pearl Harbor was to buy time to take over parts of Southeast Asia.  The reason to do that was to consolidate their natural resource access requirements.  Taking the Philippines was the more critical task in that strategy, since that would eliminate ""in region"" American interference with getting oil and other materials from Southeast Asia.  Japan successfully invaded and occupied the Philippines, and in so doing removed the Americans from that geo-strategic position.  [The attack on Pearl Harbor was synchronized pretty well with the attack on the Philippines2. The logistic problems to any follow-up parachute assault after the Pearl Harbor attack (if it succeeded) were numerous. Two prime ones are: Their planes could not fly far enough to drop an airborne division on Pearl Harbor from Japan.  They'd have had to build forward air bases to make such an airborne attack even possible.  As they didn't have any territory on which to build forward bases, they'd have had to invade and take islands to build them. Even if they had taken Midway before Pearl Harbor, they'd have had to modify those transport aircraft to get more range out of them; it is 1300 NM from Midway to Pearl Harbor which is a 2600 NM round trip. Building forward bases ahead of time from which to stage the parachute division (established in 1938) would have ruined the surprise for the attack on Pearl Harbor. Strategic surprise was an element of the achieved tactical surprise. The other problem is extended supply lines: They'd then have to support a light division across thousands of miles of ocean, but their main effort was in the Philippines.  Militarily, it would have been a lousy idea to drop a division (if they even could) on Hawaii and then try to take / hold Pearl Harbor. The subsequent attacks on Wake Island and Midway were aimed at extending their basing ability to provide land based air, once the ""we'll knock the American Fleet out and they'll stay out of our way"" strategy failed.  Those two campaigns were not supplements to the Pearl harbor attack, in a temporal sense; they were sequels. The attack on Pearl Harbor was informed by, and gained support in the Imperial General Staff from, the successful attack on Taranto by British carrier based aircraft in November of 1940. Admiral Yamamoto ordered the Japanese naval attachés in London and Rome to  make detailed studies of the Taranto raid Given the cost and near failure of the German paratroop attacks on Crete, from nearby Greece, it is doubtful that the Japanese would conclude from that operation that an airborne assault across many thousands of miles of ocean would be a good idea.  (Riffing off a point made by @TomAu in his answer).  A further example of the risks of an airborne assault was the German airborne assault on the Hague.  This was an attack against a well defended position which caused significant losses in troop transport assets.  (@BasJansen, thank you).  If you look at how spread out the Japanese areas of control and occupation were, risking major losses to their air transport assets that were needed to support all operations would be another argument against this high risk operation if it were suggested to the Imperial General Staff. 1 Then the weight of effort (Schwerpunkt) would be in that area. The second key element was concentration at the weight of effort (Schwerpunktbildung)."

"Transatlantic Zeppelin trips usually took > 100 hours. How did they stock enough food, and where did they sleep?","The Hindenburg was originally built with 25 double-berthed cabins which accommodated up to 50 passengers. While the ship was laid up in Frankfurt during the winter of 1936-1937, 9 more cabins were added, accommodating an additional 20 passengers. The capacity was then 70 fare-paying passengers. The arrangement of cabins on the Hindenburg in 1936 is shown here: 
 - source: Wikipedia The crew accommodation was more limited. The Hindenburg carried about 50-60 crew members (it varied from 47 on its maiden flight to 61 on its final flight). The commander had a private cabin just forward of the control car. Other officers shared a compartment with twelve bunks in the same area, while the remaining crew shared 2 crew areas, one with 22 bunks just aft of the passenger accommodation and another with twelve bunks closer to the stern. 100 hours is just over 4 days. Storage for food etc. to feed 120-130 people for four days would really not be a problem on an airship the size of the Hindenburg. There are a number of websites with cutaway diagrams of the Hindenburg (and other Zeppelins), including the one on airships.net. These give a good idea of how storage and cabin space were distributed."
Why would silk underwear disqualify you from the United States military draft?,"In order to understand this question, you can't apply todays morals standards to the 1960s military establishment. An article from another website discussing 11 ways people dodged the draft  had this entry (emphasis mine): The artist in the magazine article you show just didn't define the underwear well, making them look a little too much like men's normal underwear. The practice is noted in the Wikipedia article on the History of cross-dressing: Conversely, men would dress as women to avoid being drafted, the
mythological precedent for this being Achilles hiding at the court of
Lycomedes dressed as a girl to avoid participation in the Trojan War. (An unsourced entry, but I liked the historical connection...) If you are still unsure concerning the reference indicating that a method of avoiding the draft was dressing like a woman, a little more context might be in order. Here is a link to the same September 1, 1966 issue of Esquire from which the OPs artwork was taken. The magazine cover shows a young man applying lipstick with the headline reading: How our red-blooded campus heroes are beating the draft."
Were defendants at the Nuremberg trial allowed to deny the holocaust?,"Theoretically, yes they were. The first law against Holocaust denial in Germany was passed in 1960, some time after the Nuremberg trials had taken place. As tall an order as it may have been for people to pretend that they hadn't known about something that even many civilians watching the trials knew about, to pretend that it hadn't happened at all would have been absurd. Even after 1960, it wasn't a piece of legislation that prevented perpetrators from telling this lie. In the famous trials of those who worked in the Operation Reinhard death camps, for example, the amount of evidence that concerned what the camps were for was insuperable. What remained was for them to claim that they were not there at that time, that they actively shirked their responsibilities or that they acted out of fear for their own lives. These claims were also thrown out of court, but the nature of the West German judicial system was such that the ""real perpetrators"" were people like Hitler and Goebbels, and Himmler, etc. The most these people could expect to receive was a few years for aiding and abetting. (Josef Oberhauser, for example, was found guilty for the murder of over 100,000 people and received 4.5 years in prison). The reason for this is that a substantial portion of the German judiciary (and constabulary as well, for that matter) were suspect, and needed to be immune from prosecution. Somebody, after all, had to run the country. It might be one thing to suppose that a defendant could have told such a whopping lie to a journalist, but to tell judges, prosecutors and witnesses something that flies in the face of their own lived experience would have been unheard of. No easier, in other words, than to say that there had never been a war in the first place.

Also, Jesus was of the house of David, so the Star of Bethlehem being designed as a Star of David should be especially unsurprising "
Is there any evidence of armies enrolling women in fighting roles in significant number in antiquity or the middle ages?,"SHORT ANSWER In antiquity, the Scythians (Eurasian nomads) and the Sarmatians (nomads of Iranian origin who moved westwards, gradually overwhelming the Scythians) had significant numbers of female warriors. Estimates based on archaeological discoveries range from 15% to over 30% of women who were warriors. The precise role of these fighters remains unclear, as do the reasons why these related cultures had female warriors while other, similar, cultures apparently did not. Note:'Scythians' is sometimes used to include 'Sarmatians' while at other times it refers only to the people west of the Don River. This, as Wikipedia notes, has led to a fair amount of confusion. MAIN ANSWER Archaeological finds, with the aid of science, over the last 25 years have provided an increasing amount evidence that Scythian women and those of their eastern kin the Sarmatians (among whom the Sauromatae are most frequently mentioned) fought in significant numbers, and that the writings of Herodotus and other ancient historians on this subject have at least some basis in fact. Earlier finds have also been reassessed as it was previously assumed that any grave containing weapons belonged to a male. Deborah Levine Gera, Professor of Classics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in Warrior Women: The Anonymous Tractatus De Mulieribus asserts: The presence of...Scythian women warriors in the pages of Herodotus
  and Ctesias reflects some kind of historical reality, for there is
  evidence that some Scythian women rode on horseback, used bows and
  arrows, and went into battle. Archaeological remains indicate that
  there were female Scythian warriors, chiefly - but not solely - among
  the Sauromatae,..  This Sarmatian female warrior tomb ""was found with more than 100 arrowheads, a horse harness, a collection of knives and a sword"". Source: ZME Science In The Scythians 700-300 BC by the archaeologist Dr. E. V. Cernenko, the author asserts: Almost the whole of the adult population of Scythia, including a large
  number of the womenfolk, fought on campaign. What evidence is there for the above, other than Herodotus? For the archaeological evidence, the Smithsonian article The Amazon Women: Is There Any Truth Behind the Myth? from 2014 relates the following from the early 1990s: ...a joint U.S.-Russian team of archaeologists made an extraordinary
  discovery while excavating 2,000-year-old burial mounds—known as
  kurgans...outside Pokrovka...near the Kazakhstan border. There, they found over 150
  graves belonging to the Sauromatians and their descendants, the
  Sarmatians. Among the burials of “ordinary women,”... There were
  graves of warrior women who had been buried with their weapons. One
  young female, bowlegged from constant riding, lay with an iron dagger
  on her left side and a quiver containing 40 bronze-tipped arrows on
  her right. The skeleton of another female still had a bent arrowhead
  embedded in the cavity....On average, the weapon-bearing females
  measured 5 feet 6 inches, making them preternaturally tall for their
  time. The last sentence is interesting as it deals with the perception that women are physically much less well equipped to fight compared to men; these women seem to have been an exception. It is also worth considering that a child, male or female, brought up from a young age to ride horses and use a bow and arrow, is likely to become a formidable adversary. The Smithsonian article continues with In recent years, a combination of new archaeological finds and a
  reappraisal of older discoveries has confirmed that Pokrovka was no
  anomaly. According to Kathryn Hinds in Scythians and Sarmatians, the Pokrovka graves were those of ""ordinary people"" (not royalty), and following figures give an idea of the percentage of female warriors, at least within one community: The vast majority of the men — 94 percent — were buried with
  weapons... 15 percent of the women were warriors, buried with arrowheads and
  other weapons. Other discoveries suggest a higher percentage. This article from the Irish Times seems to refer to a more recent find: A team of archaeologists investigating 2,400-year-old burial mounds
  built by the Scythian people on the upper reaches of the river Don has
  found that five of 21 graves contained the bodies of young women,
  accompanied by their weapons. The article also quotes Dr Valery Gulyayev, of the Russian Institute of Archaeology: ""Usually such women are found in large kurgans, buried with the same
  rituals as for men,"" ... ""They are buried with womanly things -
  mirrors of silver and bronze, necklaces of gold, glass or clay,
  earrings. But alongside these they are buried with weapons - a quiver,
  bow and arrows, and, often, two throwing spears. The National Geographic article Amazon Warriors Did Indeed Fight and Die Like Men cites archaeological finds of Scythians which have been subjected to scientific testing: Archaeologists have found skeletons buried with bows and arrows and
  quivers and spears and horses. At first they assumed that anyone
  buried with weapons in that region must have been a male warrior. But
  with the advent of DNA testing and other bioarchaeological scientific
  analysis, they've found that about one-third of all Scythian women are
  buried with weapons and have war injuries just like the men. The women
  were also buried with knives and daggers and tools. Unfortunately, the article doesn't say which specific find the above relates to, but there is again some evidence here of 'significant numbers'. The New Yorker article The Real Amazons, citing Adrienne Mayor, research scholar in the Classics Department at Stanford University, says: ...in some archaeological digs in Eurasia, as many as thirty-seven per
  cent of the graves contain the bones and weapons of horsewomen who
  fought alongside men. (“Arrows, used for hunting and battle, are the
  most common weapons buried with women, but swords, daggers, spears,
  armor, shields, and sling stones are also found,” Mayor writes.) In the light of the archaeological evidence, there has unsurprisingly been some reassessment of ancient sources. Further, it should be noted that Herodotus was not the only writer to refer to female warriors; there is also Ctesias, Hippocrates (see the passage cited here) and - as J Asia mentioned in his comment - Diodorus. They have embellished in parts and got some details badly wrong, but the archaeological evidence seems to support the assertions of a significant number of female warriors among some of the Scythians and some of their kin, perhaps most notably the Sauromatians. Role of female warriors The precise role of female warriors is unclear but it is most likely that they (1) defended the community while the main body of fighting men were away, and (2) were 'called up' and fought alongside men in times of great need, such as the Persian invasion under Darius I (ruled 522 to 486 BC). Their involvement in the army may well have gone beyond these, but archaeology has yet to conclusively prove this. Reasons for significant number of female warriors Also unclear is why these two cultures had significant numbers of female warriors while others around them apparently did not. None of the sources cited here deal with this directly, but several suggest that the prominent role women played as rulers is significant. For example, one archaeological dig found that over 70 % of the central graves (i.e. those of highest status) had female remains. David W. Anthony, in The Horse, the Wheel and Language, notes an interesting point about the Scythians and the Yamna people ""dating to 3300–2600 BC"" who were there much earlier,  About 20% of Scythian - Sarmatian ""warrior graves"" on the lower Don
  and lower Volga contained females dressed for battle as if they were
  men...It is at least interesting that the frequency of adult
  females in central graves under Yamnaya kurgans in the same region,
  but two thousand years earlier, was about the same. Perhaps the people
  of this region customarily assigned some women leadership roles that
  were traditionally male. This, though, is only the beginning of an answer, but we can also consider the prominent role played by archers on horseback where physical strength (though not unimportant) plays less of role than it would in close-quarters  combat (as suggested by orangesandlemons in his comment). We should also not forget that in any society, there are always some women who are physically stronger than some men. A further point worth mentioning is that there may have been much less gender distinction in the division of labour than in other cultures; this is in evidence among modern Kazakh nomads where boys and girls compete directly ""in riding exercises and games"" (DNA testing showed that one girl had the same common ancestor as a 5th or 4th century BC female warrior buried at Pokrovka). All-female society and Thracian female warriors Two further points worth commenting on are first, the claims (particularly in Herodotus) concerning an all-female warrior society and second, claims that there were significant numbers of female Thracian warriors. On the former, As yet, Davis-Kimball (2002) notes that there is no archeological
  evidence linking all the storied versions (e.g., no excavated
  settlement suggests that women warriors lived in societies without
  men). On the latter, there is a lack of sufficient evidence, as demonstrated in Fingerprinting the Iron Age (Nicolae Popa, Simon Stoddart, eds.).

When/how did Harry Truman give the order to bomb Hiroshima?,"Truman retained mission authorization within  the Oval Office, but all further details were delegated through the normal chain of command to Colonel Tibbets to plan the mission.  Once the Japanese response to the Potsdam declaration, Mokusatsu, had been sent and received, it would have been tacitly understood all around that  any further decisions could only be implemented on a best efforts basis. Mission authorization was given and Tibbets arranges a suitable date according to weather forecasts.  Aboard the Enola Gay the bomb was armed after take off and its safety devices removed about 30 minutes before it was dropped. Conceivably that latter process could be reversed, but I am unsure that it would have been attempted. The bomb could always have been dropped at sea for disposal, though General Groves would likely have been most disappointed at that result. Note that any last minute communication from the Japanese would have been received with extreme skepticism, as merely a delaying tactic. It is unlikely to my mind that any such would have had the slightest bearing on the Hiroshima mission.  The key point here is that there were no special go/no-go arrangements for the mission. Once authorized it was expected to take place at the earliest suitable opportunity. No arrangement for recall subsequent to launch was planned for because any abort decision was up to the commander of the mission, Colonel Tibbets. "
What language did Gaius Julius Caesar speak with Cleopatra?,"Most likely Greek. This is the only language which we know they definitely had in common, and both were highly proficient in it. High-born Romans learnt Greek and Julius Caesar was no exception: According to the 1st century C.E. Roman historian Suetonius, Julius
Caesar spoke mainly Greek and not Latin, as was the case with most
patricians at the time. Richard A. Billows, Professor of Greek and Roman History at Columbia
University in New York, elaborates on Caesar's education: The formal side of his education consisted of being taught to read and
write both Latin and Greek, given a grounding in the classic poets of
Rome (Ennius, Naevius, Terence and others) and Greece (Homer, some of
the lyric poets, the Athenian dramatists and others), and then taught
a smattering of Greek philosophy, but above all the art of rhetoric. Source: Richard A. Billows, 'Julius Caesar: The Colossus of Rome' (2009) Cleopatra, being of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt, spoke Greek: Most historians agree that Cleopatra did not speak Latin and that she
spoke Greek, which was her native language. The historian Plutarch was
not convinced that she actually did speak Egyptian, and many modern
scholars agree with him. Some languages that she may have spoken were
Persian, Syrian and Arabic. However, there is no true historical proof
that she spoke anything other than Greek. Plutarch also mentions Ethiopian, Trogodyte, Hebraioi, Parthian and others not specified. One of the latter may have been Latin but we can only speculate on that as, Plutarch is our only ancient source for Cleopatra’s knowledge of these
languages. Note that Latin is not included in the list. It is possible
that Latin was one of the many other languages with which Plutarch
credits Cleopatra, but Julius Caesar and Mark Antony spoke Greek, so
communication would not have been a problem. Source: Prudence J. Jones, 'Cleopatra: a Sourcebook' (2006) Duane W. Roller, Professor of Classics, is more open to the idea that Cleopatra spoke Latin but nonetheless concurs that she would have spoken Greek with Julius Caesar and other Romans. A Note on Plutarch's use of Arabic Although somewhat off-topic in relation to the question, the mention of Arabic has generated a fair amount of discussion in the comments. This is evident in the academic literature: The meaning of the term ‘Arab’ in antiquity has been hotly debated for
many decades. One reason for this has been the search for a single
definition which could be applied to all the numerous references to
‘Arabs’ and ‘Arabias’ in the ancient sources. As noted above, the vast
majority of these sources were written by authors looking at the
ancient Near East from the outside. Source: G. Fisher (ed), 'Arabs and Empires before Islam' (2015) Plutarch's reference probably relates to one of the languages spoken on Arabian peninsula, possibly Nabataean Arabic. Modern scholarship postulates that the spoken form probably predates the written form by several centuries, perhaps as early as the 4th century BC. Consequently, Arab speakers used other languages for writing, principally Nabataean Aramaic in the
north of the Peninsula, and Sabaʾic in the south. Thus an Arabic
speaker would either learn the language and script of Aramaic or
Sabaic in order to be able to write, or employ someone to write, in
these languages for him/her. Source: Fisher On the importance of Nabataea to Egypt, Across the Red Sea was the Arabian peninsula. Although only small
parts of it were ever under Ptolemaic control, this region was a vital
part of the Ptolemaic kingdom’s economy. The great Nabataean trading
center of Petra began to flourish in the late fourth century b.c., and
a certain Anaxikrates explored the Red Sea for Alexander, reaching the
wealthy aromatics-producing regions at its southern end. By the third
century b.c. the trade route from Petra to these districts was well
known, and frankincense and myrrh, the two most famous aromatics, were
exported to processing factories in Alexandria. Knowing the Arabian
language may have assisted Cleopatra in diplomatic and mercantile
negotiations, and she may have acquired some Arabian territory in the
30s b.c. Source: Billows"
How serious was Fermat's statement about the ancients?,"Other answers are good but I would like to add a bit of context. The OP states that it should have been clear by 1600 that some advance had been made since Roman times. However, the idea that by then contemporary sciences and arts had surpassed old ones was new and very controversial. The querelle des Anciens et des Modernes was a famous and heated literary debate in France about that issue, and it should be noted that its central phase started with a poem in 1687, more than 20 years after Fermat's death. Therefore, when Fermat said that it was being proved that he was making some advance beyond what Roman and Greeks had known, he was far from stating the obvious - although with our hindsight we might think so."
Did Roman unmarried men have a preferred hand and finger for wearing their seal ring?,"Pliny the Elder wrote about wearing finger rings in volume 33 of his Naturalis Historia. He states: ""The worst crime against mankind was committed by him who was the
  first to put a ring upon his fingers: and yet we are not informed, by
  tradition, who it was that first did so."" So he clearly wasn't a fan of finger rings! However, having made that point, he goes on to say: ""Whoever it was that first introduced the use of rings, he did so not
  without hesitation; for he placed this ornament on the left hand, the
  hand which is generally concealed, whereas, if he had been sure of its
  being an honourable distinction, it would have been made more
  conspicuous upon the right."" The implication being that rings were traditionally worn on the left hand (at least by men). He then reinforces the impression that rings were worn on the left hand when he says: And if any one should raise the objection that this would have acted
  as an impediment to the right hand, I can only say that the usage in
  more recent times fortifies my opinion, and that the inconvenience of
  wearing rings on the left hand would have been still greater, seeing
  that it is with the left hand that the shield is held. From there he goes on to discuss how rings came to be introduced to Rome."
Did the Soviet army intentionally send troops (e.g. penal battalions) running over minefields?,"There are a few recorded instances of Soviet penal troops being intentionally sent over mines, at least according to survivors: It is hard to judge
  whether there was a deliberate sacrifice of penal soldiers, but Pyl’tsyn describes how
  Batov, commander of the army to which his penal battalion was attached,
  deliberately sent its soldiers—all of them temporarily demoted officers—across a
  minefield, where they suffered 80% casualties. Pyl’tsyn, who also advanced across the
  minefield but survived without a scratch, regarded this order as criminal and claims
  that tanks with ploughs for making passages in the minefield were actually available.
  The survivors of this action were not pardoned because Batov would not release an
  uninjured soldier from a penal unit. Significantly, Pyl’tsyn does not reproach his
  superiors for a mission in which the penal company he commanded spearheaded the
  attack across the Oder River. Only four men survived without injury by the time they
  had captured the bridgehead, while Pyl’tsyn himself was gravely wounded in the head. Quoted from: Alex Statiev, ""Penal Units in the Red Army"", Europe-Asia Studies, 62:5,
721-747 The full name of the soldier is Aleksandr Pyl’tsyn, and the story is cited to his memoirs in Russian: ""Batov"" refers to the commander of the 65th Army, Pavel Batov. I'm not sure if there are other stories corroborating something like this."
"In 19th century France, were police able to send people to jail without a trial, as presented in ""Les Misérables""?","This is a plausible description.
Probably not 'the norm' in how it went down exactly, but easily filed under 'could have happened'. But it is essential to not generalise this too far. Since the revolution there was a general right for an accused to have a trial. That was copied from English law and survived throughout the 19th century unharmed until 'Vichy'. What makes this scene plausible is that it is just for this one 'crime': prostitution. The notion of tolérance developed naturally from the Augustinian dictum that prostitutes have a place in society, albeit the lowest one, because they channel potentially subversive passions away from socially disruptive violence. But for authority to tolerate prostitution did not mean that it condoned or officially protected this activity, or that it tacitly agreed to look the other way so as to let this useful function prosper. On the contrary, toleration entailed strategies of enclosure and containment similar to those Parent advocated in dealing with poudrette, the refuse from water closets, or the remains of horse carcasses. A maison de tolérance was, ideally, carefully designed to process live flesh as was Parent's dissection table to process dead flesh. Indeed, Parent applied to hospital dissection rooms the same description he used for prostitution: they are, he says, “a necessary evil that must be tolerated"". The essential ambiguity in the program of toleration derives from its shaky legal support. No law on prostitution was passed in France during the entire course of the nineteenth century. Because Article 484 of the Penal Code left in force all ordinances of the Old Regime not specifically abrogated, subsequent police prefects, searching to establish a legal basis for their arbitrary powers, cited a motley variety of precedents in legislation that seemed indirectly or inferentially to relate to prostitution. Among these were laws penalizing the sale of obscene publications, justifying administrative steps to control ""calamitous scourges,"" authorizing municipal surveillance of public health, and other such measures that only through violent acts of interpretation could be seen to justify the right of a civil authority to imprison prostitutes without trial. It was essentially in this right that l'arbitraire consisted. The prefect of police, acting through his agents on the morals brigade, had the right to arrest any woman who, in his judgment, was soliciting on the street. It sufficed for him to have detected ""a provocative look"" or an ""indecent gesture."" The arrested woman had no recourse to a court of law. Indeed, she was for all intents and purposes already placed outside the law by the very fact of her accusation. As soon as the commissaire in her quartier had written up a procès-verbal of the offense, the woman was arbitrarily subject, as a report of 1819 puts it, ""to incarceration by administrative decision."" Her hearing before the Bureau of Morals was a purely procedural matter. Parent supported these policies fully, arguing that civil liberties are a privilege that prostitutes renounce when ""they abandon themselves to the disorder of the passions and to all the excesses of a dissolute life"". The population as a whole, he claims, approves of exceptional repressive measures to control prostitution, ""whatever their severity and illegality,"" and the prostitutes themselves, ""feeling their abjection, … realize that they cannot possibly lay claim to rights they cherish but of which they have rendered themselves unworthy"". So, in Parent's mind, authority does no more than discipline and punish those whose disorderly excess it is the universally acknowledged task of government to control. Why, then, was no law passed empowering the police to administer society's repressive will?' Parent's attempt to answer this question is one of the few occasions when he deliberately turns away from verifiable evidence and allows himself to hypothesize: the lawmakers, he surmises, ""not having the documents necessary to enable them to act with full knowledge of the facts, intentionally left everything vague, thereby abandoning the repression of prostitution to the administrative authority"". This is evidently an invitation to adopt Parent's own book as the heretofore lacking basis for legislation. And indeed Parent goes so far as to draw up the text of a law whose passage would remove the administration from the ""false position"" he considers it to be in.

— WP: Napoleonic Code The really curious thing is how much leeway the police indeed were given –  and how arbitrarily the interpretation of legal logic applied here: The legality of prostitution was left conveniently vague; women were, however, allowed to engage in the trade so long as they followed police regulations governing their conduct. Violation of the rules resulted in something euphemistically referred to as ""administrative detention,"" or imprisonment without trial. These arbitrary actions, indefensible from any legal standpoint, were nevertheless theoretically confined to women who had put themselves ""outside the law"" by their registration with the police. Such theoretical limits did not hold in practice. The subjection to this system of other working-class women developed slowly but surely, expanding from a minor loophole in the regulations of the police des moeurs. The police did not get, nor did they expect, voluntary registration on the part of all prostitutes. Consequently, it was decided early in the regime that if sufficient presumption of prostitution existed, the prefecture could register a woman ""by office,"" that is, against her will, making her subject to all the rules. From this policy there developed a necessary accompaniment, the concept of the ""clandestine"" prostitute, a woman who engaged in prostitution without police supervision of any sort; any woman was potentially clandestine, particularly if her conduct was ""irregular."" To this mixture was added the self-expanding mandate of the police des moeurs. This creeping bureaucracy was founded on the basis of a few apparently trivial administrative decisions, with the modest ambition of ensuring that all registered prostitutes reported for their medical examinations. It ended as an administrative department with a budget of over 100,000 francs a year and a self-defined mission of purging society of its impure elements. ""The police do not have a social mission of public moral reform,"" one of their critics reminded them at the end of the century. But by then it was too late. By the late 1800s there had developed a virtual mania over prostitution. Arrests in Paris alone numbered in the thousands every year.
— Jill Harsin: ""Policing Prostitution in Nineteenth-Century Paris"", Princeton University Press, 1985. Note that within the story the police is found to have overstepped the line, somewhat! The quoted laws: The matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipal police. According to the terms of articles nine, eleven, fifteen, and sixty-six of the code of criminal examination, I am the judge.
[In the French original it is: Le fait dont vous parlez est un fait de police municipale. Aux termes des articles neuf, onze, quinze et soixante-six du code d’instruction criminelle, j’en suis juge. J’ordonne que cette femme soit mise en liberté.] In the real law books from 1808 we see: 9:
The judicial police will be exercised under the authority of the imperial courts, and according to the distinctions that will be established:
By the country guards and the forest rangers,
By the police commissioners,
By mayors and deputy mayors,
By the imperial prosecutors and their substitutes,
By Justices of the Peace,
By gendarmerie officers,
By the Commissioners-General of Police,
And by the examining magistrates. 11:
The police commissioners, and in municipalities where there are none, the mayors, or in their absence, the deputy mayors, will look for police contraventions, even those under the special surveillance of the forest and countryside guards, against which they will compete and even prevent. They will receive the reports, denunciations and complaints, which will be related to police contraventions. They shall record in the reports they draw up for this purpose, the nature and circumstances of the contraventions, the time and place where they were committed, and the evidence or clues to be used by those presumed guilty. 15:
The mayors or deputy mayors shall hand over to the officer by whom the public prosecutor's office at the police court will be filled, all documents and information, within three days at the latest, including the one in which they have acknowledged the fact on which they have proceeded. 66:
The plaintiffs shall not be deemed to be civil parties unless they formally declare so, either by the complaint or by a subsequent act; or if they do not, by one or the other, make a claim for damages, they may withdraw within twenty-four hours; in the event of withdrawal, they shall not be liable for costs since it was served, without prejudice, however, to the damages of the defendants, if any. The seems a bit strange for the case of ""66""? Well, let's look at 166: Article 166 The mayors of the communes, not being the chief town of a canton, will know, concurrently with the justices of the peace, of contraventions committed within the extent of their commune, by persons caught in flagrante delicto, or by persons who reside in the commune or who are present there when the witnesses are also resident or present there, and when the claimant party will conclude for his damages and interests to a determined sum, which will not exceed that of 15 fr. They will never be able to know of contraventions attributed exclusively to justices of the peace by article 139, nor of any of the matters, knowledge of which is attributed to justices of the peace considered as civil judges. Article 167 The public prosecutor's office will be exercised with the mayor, in police matters, by the deputy; in the absence of the deputy, or when the deputy replaces the mayor as police judge, the public prosecutor's office will be exercised by a member of the municipal council, who will be appointed for a full year by the imperial prosecutor for this purpose.
 — ""Code D’instruction Criminelle De 1808"",Texte publié dans « Le moniteur universel » (en plusieurs livraisons, à partir du 18 novembre 1808) (own translation) While these excerpts of legalese may seem a little incongruent to their impact on the story, there is also 'an actual eyewitness account' of such a scene, said to have taken place in 1841: It was on the 9th of January. […] He went along the Rue Taitbout, […]
He was thus waiting, like an orderly on duty, when he saw a young man, well and stylishly dressed, stoop and pick up a great handful of snow, and put it down the back of a woman of the streets who stood at the corner of the boulevard in a low-necked dress. The woman uttered a piercing shriek, fell upon the dandy, and struck him. The young man returned the blow, the woman responded, and the battle went on in a crescendo, so vigorously and to such extremities that the police hastened to the spot. They seized hold of the woman and did not touch the man. Seeing the police laying hands upon her, the unfortunate woman struggled with them. But when she was securely seized she manifested the deepest grief. While
two policemen were pushing her along, each holding one of her she ""I have done no I assure arms, shouted, harm, you! It is the gentleman who interfered with me. I am not guilty ; I implore you leave me alone !
I have done no harm, really, really!"" "" Come, move on ; you will have six months for this business."" The poor woman at these words, "" You will have six months for this business,"" once more began to defend her conduct, and redoubled her supplications and entreaties.
The policemen, not much moved by her tears, dragged her to a police-station in the Rue Chauchat, at the back of the Opera. This excerpt is from the alleged witness of that scene: Victor Hugo himself. — Victor Hugo: ""Things Seen"", Colonial Press: New York, Boston, (no date given), archive.org, chapter ""Origin of Fantine"" p42–47.

What is the oldest authentic example of people complaining about modern times and the young?,"The counts of the indictment are luxury, bad manners, contempt for authority, disrespect to elders, and a love for chatter in place of exercise. … Children began to be the tyrants, not the slaves, of their households. They no longer rose from their seats when an elder entered the room; they contradicted their parents, chattered before company, gobbled up the dainties at table, and committed various offences against Hellenic tastes, such as crossing their legs. They tyrannised over the paidagogoi and schoolmasters. “[Young people] are high-minded because they have not yet been humbled by life, nor have they experienced the force of circumstances.
...
They think they know everything, and are always quite sure about it.” “The beardless youth… does not foresee what is useful, squandering his money.” Our sires' age was worse than our grandsires'.
We, their sons, are more worthless than they;
so in our turn we shall give the world a progeny yet more corrupt. In all things I yearn for the past. Modern fashions seem to keep on growing more and more debased. I find that even among the splendid pieces of furniture built by our master cabinetmakers, those in the old forms are the most pleasing. And as for writing letters, surviving scraps from the past reveal how superb the phrasing used to be. The ordinary spoken language has also steadily coarsened. People used to say ""raise the carriage shafts"" or ""trim the lamp wick,"" but people today say ""raise it"" or ""trim it.""
When they should say, ""Let the men of the palace staff stand forth!"" they say, ""Torches! Let's have some light!"" Instead of calling the place where the lectures on the Sutra of the Golden Light are delivered before the emperor ""the Hall of the Imperial Lecture,"" they shorten it to ""the Lecture Hall,"" a deplorable corruption, an old gentleman complained. Later than these, there are many examples of this thought being echoed from the 17th century onwards. Note: * Frequently misattributed to Socrates, probably due to its similarity to several passages in Plato's Republic: when the young are to be silent before their elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and making them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes are to be worn; the mode of dressing the hair; deportment and manners in general. And though only the best of them will be appointed by their predecessors, still they will be unworthy to hold their fathers' places, and when they come into power as guardians, they will soon be found to fall in taking care of us, the Muses, first by under-valuing music; which neglect will soon extend to gymnastic; and hence the young men of your State will be less cultivated.

How would a king's servants prove that they are on a task given by the king?,"Livery is sufficient for what we today might call low trust transactions.
For higher trust transactions, the noble (lord or king) could give the bearer a sealed document - those who had legitimate business with the noble would recognize the seal. Even those who could not read would recognize the fact of the seal, and many would recognize the heraldry. At a very abstract level, aristocracies are autocracies. While there may be a legal code, practical enforcement of anti-fraud law is through intimidation.  Any member of the lower class interfering with any member of the upper class is subject to summary justice (nominally any non-lethal penalty; practically any penalty at all).  Any member of the upper class interfering with any other member of the upper class is going to have to consider the power calculus - will this interference be worth the trouble it causes me.    Remembers, summaries are kind of like Box's law - all summaries are wrong, some are useful."
Were there large scale protests after earlier presidential elections in the US?,"You could call this a 'large scale protest'. Following the Presidential election held on 6 November 1860, I assume once the votes were counted and reported by telegraph it was known by 7 or 8 November that Abraham Lincoln had won. The state legislature of South Carolina voted on 9 November to declare Lincoln's election a hostile act and initiated a process by which the state formally seceded from the United States the following month, hence the Confederacy and Civil War."
Why aren't there any Chinese colonies?,"They did. Depending on the preferred definition of ""colonies"", Chinese states in fact established innumerable colonies throughout history. Certainly the most common form was overland colonies created in conquered ""barbarian"" territories. This processes lasts up till today; Beijing's sinicisation and settlement policies in Tibet and Xinjiang are viewed with some justification as colonialisation. While not overseas like how we usually envision ""colonies"", this isn't unique to China. In Europe, the colonial expansion observed in Tsarist Russia similarly spread overland. In the earliest times, there's also a certain similarity to the Roman and Greek colonies of classical antiquity. More stereotypical colonies were also founded later, though in most  cases they were eclipsed and swept away by the more successfully European colonial empires. See below for some examples on the differing forms of Chinese colonialism. The Zhou tribe from modern Western China conquered the Shang Dynasty circa 1046 BC. One of the first recorded acts of the new dynasty was to dispatch members of the royal family and other loyal supporters throughout the Central Plains. This took the form of armed settlers establishing garrisoned cities, from which natives were ruled by loyal Zhou vassals. These were colonies much in the same manner as the Roman Republic's coloniae.  (Map of the Early Zhou Dynasty. Circled dots represent ""states"" established by the Zhou royal court. These were similar in nature to the cities states (or colonies thereof) of Europe during classical antiquity.) Originally, the Zhou dynasty was largely a network of city states exerting loose control over territory in between. Barbarian tribes dominated much of this space, and at times became serious existential threats to the Chinese states. Most of these, especially near the centre of Zhou civilisation, were gradually subdued, colonised, and assimilated. By the Warring States period, the external borders of Chinese civilisation had made dramatic advances.  (Not explicitly shown is the expansion of the states into previously encircled barbarian lands) Notice the northeastern expansion of Yan around modern Liaodong and into Korea; the southern expansion of Chu towards Vietnam; the northern expansion of Zhao towards the steppes; and the dramatic expansion of Qin in pretty much all directions. This was colonisation, in the same way that Russia colonised Eurasia. Additionally, Chinese settlers established lasting colonies in the Pacific, such as Hainan or Taiwan. These were very much comparable to the overseas settler colonies of Western European powers, such as the Spanish and Portuguese in South America, or Britain in Oceania and North America.  Lastly, although Chinese commercialism were traditionally restricted by prejudice, it eventually began to flourish. Overseas trade became active (albeit with ups and downs) during the Song and Ming dynasties. By the early modern period, some Chinese settlements began to take shape in South East Asia. Examples include Sulu, and parts of modern Malaysia or Indonesia.  Apparently, some Chinese also settled o northern Borneo and perhaps also in the Sulu area ... there was also a rather large Chinese group in the Palembang region.  Guillot, Claude, Denys Lombard, and Roderich Ptak, eds. From the Mediterranean to the China sea: miscellaneous notes. Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 1998. These were more similar in nature to the trade posts established by European maritime powers during the first wave."
What's the rationale for shipping coins back to Spain from its colonies?,"According to Manuel Moreyra Paz Soldán, El Virreinato de Perú, 1980, p. 79, the coinage embarked on ships corresponded to: Spain also suffered several coinage crisis during the 17th and 18th centuries that reduced the amount of silver in the coins (called ""de vellón"" (goldish) because they had a lot of copper to compensate).  The coins coming from America were more appreciated due to their purity in silver. In fact, they used to leave the country so fast towards Europe that they made the crisis in Spain even worse."
Did a significant number of women drive in late 1950s/1960s USA?,"Looking at driver's licenses held by women and considering that manufacturers were aiming certain car models specifically at women, female drivers were not uncommon or unusual in the US in the 1950s and 1960s, or even before that. As you allude to in your question, this is in marked contrast to the UK. In the 1950s in the US, about half of adult women had a driver's license. In 1960, with 39% (or 34 million) of registered drivers being women (compared to 53.2 million men), around 55% of women had a license. By 1965, 40.8% (or 40.2 million) of registered drivers were women (compared to 58.3 million men). In the 1960s in the UK, on the other hand, men were more than twice as likely as women to have a driving licence. There was certainly nothing unusual about women being behind the car wheel. Even in the early days of the automobile, women were making their mark as drivers - see Alice Ramsey's 1909 trip across America, for example. As early as 1916, The Girl Scouts initiated a “Automobling Badge” for which girls had to
demonstrate driving skill, auto mechanics, and first aid skills. The US car industry recognized the importance of women drivers from at least the 1920s: Beginning in the 1920’s and 1930’s many major automobile manufacturers
recognized the growing trend of women driving for fun and necessity.
They began to gear their print ad campaigns to women... Source: Antique Automobile Club of America Museum, 'Women's Automotive History Highlights' Even in 1926, Ford was advertising its Model T Tudor Sedan for women, claiming that Inquiries reveal why women are so highly enthusiastic about the
present Ford car  In the same year, another advertisement says the Model T Coupe is an ideal car for women's personal use  In 1954, Nash motors specifically targeted women with their Nash Metropolitan, described as a “commuter/shopping car”.

As today, the level of car ownership and usage was not evenly distributed among social groups, and it also varied among urban, suburban and rural households.

industrial developments.... traffic engineering encouraged the growth
of suburban communities that favored safety and privacy but were
unfriendly to walking and to transit systems (Jones 2008, 120-2).
Already in the 1950s, strip developments on roads and then shopping
malls were constructed to centralize retail outlets. Supermarkets
expanded to embrace a full range of food and then to add other
household commodities such as stationery, toiletries, and white goods.
Even if these centers were accessible by bus, women could not carry
large loads, especially if accompanied by young children. They could
not function effectively as household managers if they were stranded
in spread-out suburbia. Source: Margaret Walsh, 'Gender and Automobility: Selling Cars to American Women after the Second World War'. In Journal of Macromarketing (August, 2010) Comparing the US and the UK in the 1960s In the US in 1960, approximately 55% of adult women had a driver's license; his percentage had increased slightly by 1965 (calculated from data here and here). In contrast, in the UK in the 1960s, the figure for women was less than 20% of adult women. Even in 1975, women held less than 30% of driving licences (i.e. 70% for men) in the UK."
Did the Romans leave any technical instruction manuals behind?,"The only book to survive from ancient Rome on architecture is Marcus Vitruvius Pollio's De architectura, found by the Renaissance scholar Poggio Bracciolini in 1414 after being largely forgotten. Bracciolini was one of a number of humanists ""devoted to the revival of classical studies"". However, it had been referred to by several churchmen, chroniclers and scholars during Medieval times, but comprehension was perhaps hindered by lack of understanding of some technical words and also missing illustrations. An English translation is available here.  ""1521 Cesare Cesariano Italian translation of De Architectura Libri Decem (The Ten Books on Architecture) by Marcus Vitruvius Pollio."". Source & Attrib. Numerous works have been lost to fires, wars, accidents, floods etc., and some because they were not considered worth copying by later scribes (or they came low on the list of priorities), but some other technical information did survive (for example, Frontinus' De aquaeductu was found, also by Poggio Bracciolini, in 1425 and made use of during the Renaissance). However, while there were people throughout the medieval period who could understand the language in which it was written, this is not the same as understanding and being able to exploit the knowledge contained therein. Vitruvius himself wrote at the beginning of his manuscript: The architect should be equipped with knowledge of many branches of
  study and varied kinds of learning, for it is by his judgment that all
  work done by the other arts is put to test. This knowledge is the
  child of practice and theory... Cited in: The Oxford Handbook of Greek and Roman Art and Architecture A certain degree of basic technical knowledge is certainly helpful. More importantly, skilled craftsmen would be needed to do the actual building. These were lost, along with Roman concrete. As Wikipedia on Roman Technology surmises, Roman technology was largely based on a system of crafts. Technical
  skills and knowledge were contained within the particular trade, such
  as stonemasons. In this sense, knowledge was generally passed down
  from a tradesman master to a tradesman apprentice. Being that there is
  only a few sources from which to draw upon for technical information,
  it is theorized that tradesmen kept their knowledge a secret. Further, the kinds of building projects for which the Romans are famed (for example, aqueducts) require enormous resources. In the wake of the fall of the Western Empire and the economic decline that went with it, few states had such resources. Note that the most prominent structures erected in the Middle Ages - churches and castles - were built by those who could command the wealth and human resources to do it. Note also that Roman architecture did not completely disappear; for example, the basilica was used in churches by the Merovingians and the Carolingians.

Are there photos/footage of the Titanic sinking?,"Short answer: No. The only film footage of the RMS Titanic shows her being towed into the outfitting wharf at Belfast in February 1912, and moored at Belfast. A clip of Lusitania leaving port has often been shown as a substitute for Titanic's maiden voyage commencement (including in the 1958 film 'A Night to Remember*). No footage of Titanic leaving Southampton is known to exist. There is almost certainly no footage of the actual sinking. Put simply, it just wouldn't have been practical to film it. In 1912, motion picture equipment was large and cumbersome. Even ordinary photography, with 'simple' cameras like this, in 1912 required a lot of light to produce a reasonable image. I'm pretty sure someone would have noticed, and commented on, magnesium flash powder being set off from one of the lifeboats during the sinking.  Sadly, the video in your original question appears to be a fake.  The truth is that the best video we have of the actual RMS Titanic has been that filmed since she was re-discovered by Robert Ballard on the Atlantic seabed in 1985."
Why did Chamberlain act to appease Hitler leading up to the outbreak of World War 2?,"I would say it was a combination of a few reasons that made Chamberlain, and by extension, the British government during that time, willing to appease Hitler ambitions. First it had been less then two decades since WWI, which Britain was a major player in, and the memories of the horror of trench warfare, mustard gas and other supplementaries that that came with ""The war to end all wars"" would have put the kibosh on any hawkish actions that would have led to another war of that magnitude, as 1939-1945 would prove it would be. This is why Chamberlain figured if appeasing Hitler with such actions and ""treating him with kid gloves"" prevented sending his nation into another great war, so be it.  Second, the Nazi government's darker side was for the most part, mostly unknown, hadn't happened yet (aka the ""Final Solution""), and what little had leaked out was dismissed or ignored. Meanwhile the powers that be in the Western World saw their hardline take on communism as a wonderful thing, which earned them a bit of leeway in annexing half of central Europe. Third, England didn't have many allies at the time that would have joined them should they declare war on the Germans. Italy and Spain were firmly in the Axis camp, the United States was staunchly isolationist in nature, and Russia wasn't much happier to deal with Britain then it was with Germany. While Britain had her colonies, most were far from Britannia and not of a size to where they could match Germany's military might, plus most were vulnerable to a resurgent Japan, who was also in the Axis camp.

How and when was the modern company ownership structure invented?,"The governance model for early corporations is the chartered city; a community granted town privileges and, if also free, independence from feudal obligations to local sovereigns or lords and debt of fealty only to the reigning monarch (ie king or emperor). In such communities the interests of its residents were represented by a council of the leading citizens, who had the responsibility for making the bylaws of the community - civil regulations governing the operation of the town. The council would select one of their own as mayor, who had responsibility both to preside over the council meetings and to oversee the day-to-day management of the community. In the former role, the mayor was president of the council. With the development and wide-spread adoption of double entry bookkeeping, it became possible to properly track the balance of an organization's assets against the two main classes of equities (or claims) against those assets: Further, double entry bookkeeping complicates the  ability of a corporate officer to engage in embezzlement, increasing the confidence of passive investors that their interests are being fairly represented. About 1600 these two developments come together with the concept of a corporation under a royal charter, creating limited liability for those who merely invest in the organization. Combined with the increased confidence in fiduciary accountability accompanying double entry bookkeeping, and the governance model of the charter cities, this attracts passive investors in sufficient quantity to allow large corporate entities to arise.  The interests of the passive investors are represented by a council of directors that becomes termed the board of directors. From amongst their own number the Board appoints officers of the corporation including one responsible for presiding over the officers - the president. Over time the spatial separation between the investors and the corporate operations makes clear that the two functions must be separated into a president of the management team, and a chairman of the board. In the 20th century the increasing complexity of corporate structures, with subsidiary corporations and holding companies spun off for additional risk management, requires a multiplicity of presidents (for each corporation) and chairmen (for each board). The terms Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer emerge at this time to distinguish the most senior of the chairmen and presidents respectively. The truly modern corporate structure - a plethora of holding companies (ie holding the key conglomerate assets, including subsidiaries) and subsidiary operating companies (holding the key conglomerate long term liabilities) - is a product of both modern computing (enabling the vastly increased number of transactions) and modern corporate income tax legislation (creating differential tax rates by corporate type for various asset financing arrangements). In that sense, the modern structure has only occurred in the last three decades or so, since personal computers became ubiquitous in the office environment."
How literate were common people in Medieval Europe?,"Here are some semi-random quotes. I do not have time to chase the references, but they are coming from a modern professional historian, not from a You-tube personality, so I'd take his numbers seriously. Robert A. Houston,  ""The Growth of Literacy in Western Europe from 1500 to 1800"". Houston is a professor of History at St.Andrews and wrote a book on the subject: ""Literacy in Early Modern Europe: Culture and Education, 1500–1800,"" London 2001. Literacy is a relative concept that has meaning only in specific economic and social contexts, but historians tend to rely on universal, standard and direct indicators such as the ability to sign one’s name on a document. Using this measure it is clear that there were social distinctions in the ability to use a writing instrument throughout the early modern period. At the end of the Middle Ages, the ability to write was restricted to less than 10% of men and hardly any women possessed it. The change in literacy rates was halting and irregular. Judged by signing, the most pronounced early expansion occurred among the middle and upper classes, among men and in towns. In northern England the illiteracy of the gentry fell from about 30% in 1530 to almost nil in 1600, but that of day labourers stayed well above 90%. You can find more numbers in his article (in particular, numbers in relation to different areas of Western and Central Europe). Yes, the ability to read is different from the ability to write, but in Houston's statistics he focuses on the ability to just write own name, which is the bare minimum of literacy and (IMHO) probably was highly correlated with the ability to read (at least in some language, be this Latin or vernacular). Edit 1. Regarding Mark Olson's request, below are estimates of literacy at the end of the medieval times/early modern times from other authors. All the books that I found which deal with numerical estimates of literacy in late medieval and early modern times favor the ability to sign as an estimator of the degree of literacy. In addition to Houston's book (whose book has the entire chapter comparing different methods, including ones which I find rather exotic, such as materials of Spanish Inquisition trials): D. Cressy, Literacy and the Social Order. Cambridge University Press, 1980. R. O'Day, Education and Society, 1500-1800: The Social Foundations of Education in Early Modern Britain. Longman, 1982. Adam Fox, ""Oral and Literate Culture in England, 1500–1700."" Oxford University Press, 2000. Cressy is especially thorough with providing numerical data and its statistical analysis. Day compares for instance the analysis of literacy in Northern England in Jo Ann Hoeppner Moran. ""Literacy and Education in Northern England, 1350-1530: A Methodological Inquiry."" Northern History, 17 (1981): 1-23. based on estimates of the number of parochial schools and argues that Cressy's methodology is provides more reliable estimates. On page 20 of her book O'Day says that Moran's numbers indicate that 15% of the total population of York diocese had undergone basic schooling by 1530, while Cressy indicates 10%. O'Day characterizes as ""wildly optimistic"" the estimates of 30% literacy in the late 15th century. Moran's article is the only one that I found which provides numerical estimates of literacy in England in 13-15th centuries. She notes, however, lack of extant records and bases her estimates on availability of schooling (making the numbers less reliable, at least according to O'Day). Some of Moran's research results are summarized by O'Day as follows: From this source [availability of schooling] she concludes that some 15% of the population of York diocese attended a school in the late 15th century, as compared with perhaps 9% in the early 15th century and some 4.7% in the late 14th century. But it may be suspected that these figures err considerably on the generous side. Dr. Moran based these estimates on calculations which assumed a regular and constant size for the schools concerned. Later evidence suggests that consistency in this respect was not a feature of early schools. From reading Cressy's book, I think, I found the original source of the claim that about half of English population by the end of 15th century was literate. He attributes the number to Thomas More:  Cressy then proceeds:  While Cressy's book contains mass of numerical data related to literacy (based on various archival work), it is all broken into subcategories according to occupation and geography and, in the book, I could not find aggregate overall numbers. But, in his later paper, from 1993, ""Literacy in context: meaning and measurement in early modern England"", Cressy writes:  Thus, according to this estimate, the rate of literacy in mid-16th century England was about 12.5%. Another estimate (dealing with the end of the medieval time and, thus, closer to the OP), based on the signage records appears in Adam Fox, ""Oral and Literate Culture in England, 1500–1700."" Oxford University Press, 2000.  Based on the early arguments from Schofields 1973 article (which is widely cited and described as the breakthrough leading to transition from qualitative to quantitative estimates in literacy during early modern times), Fox then estimates that these numbers should be doubled to get an estimate of the reading capacity, thus, getting: 10% adult male reading and 2% adult female reading in England in 1500. Lastly, regarding criticisms of usage of signage as a mean of estimating rates of literacy (ability to read) in late medieval/early modern times: In their books O'Day, Cressy and Houston analyze in detail other available methods, note merits and demerits of each and, in the end, conclude in favor of signage. (This again follows Schofield's 1973 article.) In particular, they do discuss arguments similar to the one in Adam Baker's comment below, suggesting that for some people signing with a symbol/picture instead of the written name was a choice rather than the result of illiteracy. Reproducing these arguments here would take too much space and my answer is already too long, so I will refrain from doing so. I am unsure about the origin of the claim that (generically) women were prohibited from ""signing anything."" I do not exclude that this was indeed the case in some places and at certain times. However, as fas as late medieval/early modern England goes, the claim  is plain wrong. For instance Cressy documents striking difference in signage among women in London and elsewhere by the late 17th century: The percentage for both categories started near zero in 1500 and increased only to about 20% outside of London by the late 17th century. At the same time, in London, it reached about 50% by late 17th century. As far as I can tell, this dynamics completely invalidates the conjecture that women (at least in the discussed time period) were prohibited from signing their names. Ditto the numbers provided by Houston in his article and the book for other parts of Europe: They indicate slow (but uneven) growth of female literacy (as measured by name signage) elsewhere in Europe, indicative of improvement of education rather than abolishing of some laws prohibiting signage."
"Did active frontiersmen really eat 20,000 calories a day? How does this compare to other highly-active people in recorded history?","The 10,000 calorie figure - or perhaps slightly lower - is about right as a ceiling for maintaining muscle mass over months of hard work with downtime only to sleep. Across the centuries, workers with the most physically demanding jobs consumed comparable amounts of food: My mind goes immediately to the navvies of the mid-19th century, who were famously well-fed on meat due to the demanding nature of their jobs: navvies had to be strong, fit men – agricultural labourers who joined up could not, at first, stand the pace They ate quite a generous diet to keep up their strength: Joseph Firbank (contractor for many railways including the Settle & Carlisle) ‘mentions quite casually that his navvies consumed on average two pounds of meat, two pounds of bread, and five quarts of ale a day That's 2304 calories for the meat if it's analogous to ground beef (which is far more likely for grain fed British cows than for hunted game), about the same for the bread, and 2500 for the ale. However, this was not sufficient for the navvies: They were also known for poaching fish and game...it’s highly likely that the navvies supplemented their diets by poaching. It's hard to say whether they poached due to hunger or simply for variety in diet and the thrill of something to do, but these hard-working laborers scarfed down 7500 calories and still had an appetite for more. I can see explorers, without fixed working hours and burning additional calories shivering in the brutal Canadian north, wanting to eat more than that to sustain themselves. Speaking of beer, the pyramid builders drank about the same amount - five liters (just over 5 quarts) per day. It's hard to say how Egyptian beer, sweetened with honey, would compare calorie-wise to what the navvies had, but our attempts to recreate ancient ale clock in around the same - 300 for a pint of Midas Touched compared to 250 for a typical ale. Along with the beer, the workers received ten loaves of bread and somewhere between half a pound and a pound of meat per day (spreading the 4000lbs figure across 4-10,000 estimated workers). Given the monumental (ha!) costs of building the Pyramids, I can't imagine these workers would be fed so generously if they didn't need the calories for their work. Another highly standardized diet is the one fed to soldiers. Since the 80s, the American soldier's diet has been precisely tailored for the demanding activities that soldiers do, and consists of three daily ""meals, ready to eat"" - under 4000 calories. However, your explorer's routine is probably closer to the experience at Ranger school: Typical ruck marches with 50- to 80-pound backpacks will burn 500-700 calories per hour.  Place that level of work into an 18- to 20-hour day, and you expend roughly 10,000 calories in one day. According to this source, Ranger trainees get 2 MREs per day - 2500 calories - and lose 20-30 pounds after two months. Needless to say, that is not a sustainable pace for explorers who may be on expedition for seasons or years. We have a bit more insight into the calorie demands of survival situations through the reality show Alone. Towards the end of the competition, the contestants typically eat very little and it shows - one contestant lost 80 pounds in 2 months, equivalent to burning 5000 calories per day just staying in one spot. For a rower - having to work all day on top of hunting and putting up/tearing down the campsite - the calorie demands would be considerably more."

"Did Rothschild say this famous quote? If yes, what did he mean by it?","The actual quote which is attributed to Mayer Amschel Rothschild is: Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws! A number of sources (such as this one) claim that this statement was made in 1838 (which would have been a difficult feat as he would have been dead for 26 years by then). Wikiquote claims that there is no way to verify by whom, when or why it was made. It notes: No primary source for this is known and the earliest attribution to him known is 1935 (Money Creators, Gertrude M. Coogan). Before that, ""Let us control the money of a nation, and we care not who makes its laws"" was said to be a ""maxim"" of the House of Rothschilds, or, even more vaguely, of the ""money lenders of the Old World"". It is adapted from another well known quote: Let me make the songs of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws. This is in turn attributed to the Scot, Andrew Fletcher: In An Account of a Conversation he made his well-known remark ""I knew a very wise man so much of Sir Christopher's sentiment, that he believed if a man were permitted to make all the ballads, he need not care who should make the laws of a nation."""
How much evidence is there regarding the naval punishment of keelhauling?,"It would seem that by the mid-18th Century, the act of keel-hauling was considered (by the British public, at least) to be a Dutch punishment. A contemporary dictionary gives the following definition: Keel-Hauling, a punishment inflicted for various offences in the Dutch Navy. It is performed by plunging the delinquent repeatedly under the ship's bottom on one side, and hoisting him up on the other, after having passed under the keel. The blocks, or pullies, by which is is suspended, are fastened to the opposite extremities of the main-yard, and a weight of lead or iron is hung upon his legs to sink him to a competent depth. By this apparatus he is drawn close up to the yard-arm, and thence let fall suddenly into the sea, where, passing under the ship's bottom, he is hoisted up on the opposite side of the vessel. As this extraordinary sentence is executed the a serenity of temper peculiar to the Dutch, the culprit is allowed sufficient intervals to recover the sense of pain, of which indeed he is frequently deprived during the operation. In truth, a temporary insensibility to his sufferings ought by no means to be construed into a disrespect of his judges, when we consider that this punishment is supposed to have peculiar propriety in the depth of winter, whilst the flakes of ice are floating on the stream; and that it is continued till the culprit is almost suffocated for want of air, benumbed with the cold of water, or stunned with the blows his head received by striking the ship's bottom. An Universal Dictionary of the Marine, W. Falconer (1784)  Interestingly, this seems to suggest that the act was (a) repeated more than once for a given punishment and (b) was not directly, or intentionally, fatal. A footnote in ""The Life and Works of Sir Henry Mainwaring"" (from a work by Boteler) suggests that keel-hauling might have evolved from the punishment of ducking: Ducking 'at the main yard arm is, when a malefactor by having a rope fastened under his arms and about his middle, and under his breech, is thus hoised up to the end of the yard ; from whence he is again violently let fall into the sea, sometimes twice, sometimes three several times one after another ; and if the offence be very foul, he is also drawn under the very 
  keel of the ship, and whilst he is under the water a great gun is given fire right over his head.' Dialogical Discourse of Marine affairs, Nathaniel Boteler (1685)"
Did the Germans purposefully arrange to send Lenin to Russia to start a revolution?,"A Russian revolution caused by the Bolsheviks was most definitely the goal of the Germans when they allowed Lenin to pass through their lands. Germany wished to undermine, or end, the Russian war effort and sending Lenin back was done for that purpose. If true, who came up with the idea and was there any consideration that a communist Russia could eventually be a threat to Germany? The historian Richard Pipes writes in his book The Russian Revolution that based on disclosed German papers made available after WWII the German Foreign Secretary at the time of Lenin's passage Richard von Kühlmann was either the person that came up with the idea, or at the bare minimum signed off on the idea of letting Lenin pass through German lands to return to Russia. Lenin was even decried as a ""German agent"" when he finally returned. As to whether there was any consideration of a future threat from a communist Russia, the answer seems to be no for two reasons. The first reason is that Germany was primarily concerned with the demands of World War I. Surviving the war was paramount. The second reason is that, according to former professor Albert L. Weeks, Lenin was a Germanophile. Weeks argues that Lenin viewed Germany as the central linchpin to an eventual proletarian revolution. Weeks further discusses the close relations enjoyed between the two nations after World War I, and how this relationship extended back into the 19th century. The relationship still exists today, see e.g. pipelines, or former German politicians heading Russian companies. How much did the arrangement cost the Germans, money-wise? According to Pipes, relying on numbers from Eduard Bernstein, the German government sent ""more than 50 million deutsche marks in gold"" from 1917 to 1918 to help the Bolsheviks establish and hold power. In 1917 US Dollars, 50 million marks would mean $9,041,591 — adjusting for inflation this equals about $172,910,538 in 2017 US Dollars. The investment was substantial, and at least with respect to achieving the goal of ending Russian involvement in World War I, the investment paid off."
How many people in the US starved to death during the Great Depression?,"According to my quick reading of the Life and death during the Great Depression by José A. Tapia Granadosa and Ana V. Diez Roux, the only noticeable increase of mortality was suicide, with a noticeable decline of mortality in every other category. It's interesting that this paper was written in 2009, before the (shall we say) sensationalist Russian claim of 7 million deaths. According also to Michael Mosley, life expectancy actually rose through the Great Depression. In his Horizon programme Eat, Fast and Live Longer he claims From 1929 to 1933, in the darkest years of the great depression when people were eating far less, life expectancy increased by 6 years."
"When did the U.S. Army start saying ""oh-six-hundred"" for ""6 AM""?","The US military did not use the 24-hour clock system at the time depicted in that movie (emphasis mine). During World War I, the British Royal Navy adopted the 24-hour clock
in 1915, and the Allied armed forces followed soon after,[22] with the
British Army switching officially in 1918.[24] The Canadian armed
forces first started to use the 24-hour clock in late 1917.[25] In
1920, the United States Navy was the first United States organization
to adopt the system; the United States Army, however, did not
officially adopt the 24-hour clock until World War II, on July 1,
1942.[26] I haven't located the original order yet, but did find mention of a training circular put out within a month, from a US Army publication from 1942. See circular #51, first on the list:  Another US Government document, labelled Information Digest, published on 17 June 1942 posts notice of when the US Army will start using the 24-hr clock (center paragraph):
 This confirms July 1st as starting date for the official use of the 'military time' system, for all Official messages, dispatches, orders and reports... How early did others adopt this system? The above linked Wikipedia article mentions that the 24-hour clock was adopted in organizations within other nations as early as the late 19th century (Italy in 1893).  None are listed as early as the 1830s: A report by a government committee in the United Kingdom noted Italy
as the first country among those mentioned to adopt 24-hour time
nationally, in 1893.[22] Other European countries followed: France
adopted it in 1912 (the French army in 1909), followed by Denmark
(1916), and Greece (1917). By 1920, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, and
Switzerland had switched, followed by Turkey (1925), and Germany
(1927). By the early 1920s, many countries in Latin America had also
adopted the 24-hour clock.[23] Some of the railways in India had
switched before the outbreak of the war.[22]"
No speed limit on German highways - why?,"Before the war, only a limit of 30 km/h inside towns was in force, but no other general speed limits. In the Third Reich, there was a general speed limit of 40km/h inside of towns, and 80km/h outside. This was mostly to conserve resources for the war (and because several high ranking Nazis had been killed in accidents on the new Autobahnen).
Being a war-time law, it was nullified in 1952 by the Bundestag - without replacement. At that time, most European countries didn't have speed limits. Up to 1957, no speed limits were in force in (West) Germany at all. In 1957, a speed limit of 50 km/h inside towns was introduced.
Only in 1972, a speed limit of 100 km/h on roads outside of cities (except on the Autobahn and on Autostraßen with at least 2 lanes per direction of traffic) was introduced. A good overview of the 50 km/h limit can be found here (in German). A general speed limit was often discussed (see the second article quoted by Hauser), but never introduced. In a recent poll, 89 percent were against a general speed limit on Autobahnen. Politicians don't want o oppose this. Also, German car manufacturers say that most of the inventions they made (especially for security), were made because they were needed to safely travel at high speeds. On a more practical level, they fear for their position in the market, as they make the kind of cars that are best for the Autobahn. They have the money (to contribute to parties and candidates) and one of the killer arguments (""every seventh job in Germany directly or indirectly is dependent on making cars""), and they use both. A long (and somewhat unstructured) article on that topic can be found in Der SPIEGEL. "
How did Medieval armies survive the use of mail armor in the deserts of the Middle East?,"I don't have much historical evidence to bring to this one, but I've worn heavy SCA armour on hot days (hot by British Isles standards) and discussed the problem with people who have done so in hotter climates (Texas and Israel, most notably). So, first and foremost, they probably would not have worn the armour unless they were expecting to go into a fight. If they were travelling from one place to another, you might possibly wear the helm and a breastplate, but not much more. They'd only armour up fully before a battle. The concepts of today's guerilla warfare didn't really apply; many of the Crusader battles were sieges, one way or another, so they were pretty predictable. Second, chain mail is heavy, but it's not airtight. Some breeze gets through, and with a cotton or even light woolen gambeson below that can be soaked, it's not that uncomfortable. It's certainly tiring, though. I don't imagine that many of the Crusaders would have worn full plate, which would indeed have the 'cooking' effect - full plate was really only coming in as the Crusades were coming to an end. In any case, only a few of the people on the Crusades would have actually worn much armour - the nobles and knights. Their men-at-arms, infantrymen, and just plain foot soldiers would have been lucky to have a helm over a padded jack, rather than anything heavier. After that - they'd have fought in cooler weather whenever possible, kept hydrated as much as possible (not that they had the term, but they certainly had the concept), and most importantly, not actually got into that many battles. A successful (that is, surviving) Crusader might have been in only a couple of real battles, and maybe a few scuffles on the side, many without armour."
Did the end of the British Raj in India create an economic loss for Britain?,"To begin, the following passage from Britain, the Commonwealth and the End of Empire by Dr John Darwin discusses the ""staggering blow"" Great Britain felt after granting independence to India. ... Repairing Britain The huge sense of relief at a more or less dignified exit, and much
  platitudinous rhetoric, disguised the fact that the end of the Raj was
  a staggering blow for British world power. Britain had lost the colony
  that had provided much of its military muscle east of Suez, as well as
  paying 'rent' for the 'hire' of much of Britain's own army. The burden
  of the empire defence shifted back to a Britain that was both weaker
  and poorer than it had been before 1939. Britain was overshadowed by two new superpowers, the United States and
  Soviet Union. ... That being said, after reviewing the unemployment rates for Great Britain (The United Kingdom) in the years following the independence of India (beginning in 1947), it does not appear that the rates changed as compared to the early 1940's.

CHART2  pg 458. In fact the unemployment rate dropped from 2.5 (1946) to 2.0 in 1947. INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON OF RATES TABLE 1  pg 456 As noted on page 462 the wartime employment rates neared 100%. Not noted but possibly assumed, post wartime employment rates remain high due to loss of life during wartime as well as job availability in disaster recovery (which certainly was evident in post war Britain after WWII.)  It seems that the public reaction to the Labour Party's direction to providing a welfare state was not met with huge opposition. In fact the voters wanted an end to wartime austerity The Labour Party, after winning the 1945 elections began the process of dismantling the British Empire when it granted independence to India and Pakistan in 1947, followed by Burma (Myanmar) and Ceylon (Sri Lanka) the following year.  These movements along with others parallel the Fabian Movement. The Fabian Society laid many of the foundations of the Labour Party and subsequently affected the policies of states emerging from the decolonisation of the British Empire, especially India.  In conclusion, I would say that as a whole Great Britain did partially suffer in terms of world power, by granting independence to India . However, without the internal stability needed to enforce colonial or Imperial rule over India, (as well as other countries/states) India would not have provided the benefits Great Britain had once received. In regards to the return of British natives from India, I see no evidence to suggest that unemployment rates during this timespan rose. Also, as previously noted the ideas of the Fabian movement, which were pursued by the newly elected Labour party, do not seem to have been met with enough opposition to suggest there was a negative public reaction to the dismantling of the British Empire or those returning from said Empire. NOTE:  I based financial growth or financial diminishment on the unemployment rates throughout the years prior to and after India's independence. The data shows that throughout these years there was no difference in the employment rate. This suggests that the financial burden of the Britons returning home after India's independence did not have a negative impact on Great Britain."
Have fair-skinned peoples ever been the lower/oppressed class?,"The Roman Empire routinely enslaved fair skinned Germans and Celts, and referred to those people derogatively as barbarians. Pretty much all the ancient Mediterranean and Near East empires including Egypt, Mesopotamia, etc. practiced slavery, and like the Romans might also have drawn from more northerly, fairer skinned peoples. However, we should be careful drawing too broad of comparisons.  Slavery worked differently in different cultures.  As bloodthirsty as the Roman Empire was, they actually had certain laws protecting slaves, that simply did not exist for slaves in the United States.  In the Roman Empire, slavery was much more of a class-based institution; anyone could become a slave potentially - your excess children, prisoners of war, and debtors could all be sold into slavery.  So, while the Romans did enslave Germans and Celts, it wasn't race-based / skin-color-based as happened in the Americas; the Romans were pretty much an equal opportunity enslavement empire. Anyway, slavery has been rife throughout history.  It's hard to find any culture that didn't enslave others in some form or other, and that hadn't existed as slaves for someone else.  It's just one of those nasty things humans do to each other until they learn better; there's nothing fundamentally inherent about skin color in any of this.  It's just the random quirks of history and geography why things turned out one way rather than another. As to today's current correlation of skin color and social status, this is most likely an outcome of the several hundred years of European colonialism applied to every corner of the world between 1492 and 1945.  It was pretty intense, and unfortunately left quite an impression, involving not just slavery but also a deliberate attempt to erect a racist social hierarchy based on skin tone.  These days colonialism as a governance principal may largely be gone, but in some sense the global media carries on many of those same biases in mass-marketed entertainment and advertisement."
Has there ever been a battle with only a single survivor?,"The British Army left in Kabul, Afghanistan after the First Anglo-Afghan War, was to leave after an Afghan uprising. The main contingent of some 16,000 troops and associated civilians was attacked throughout their journey to Jalalabad, eventually only a single survivor Assistant Surgeon William Brydon. He was asked upon arrival what happened to the army, to which he answered ""I am the army"".  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1842_retreat_from_Kabul#Retreat_and_massacre"
What is the highest number of brothers who became ruler of the same country?,"Seven brothers Seven of the sons of Ismail Ibn Sharif of the Morocco Alaouite dynasty were monarchs. Ismail ruled from 1672 to 1727 and had 525 sons and 342 daughters according to Wikipedia (or 888 according to the Guiness Book of Records). Control changed hands many times. The ones who became Sultan were: Ahmad ruled 1727–1728, then 1728–1729 Abdul Malek  ruled 1728 Abdallah II  ruled 1729–1734, 1736, 1740–1741, 1741–1742, 1743–1747, 1748–1757.

According to Wikipedia, this was ""variously reckoned as a march, duchy, and independent kingdom"" so this might be a bit suspect (the authority of the Zhou dynasty was 'collapsing' at this time). Anyway, they were the sons of Huan (ruled 685 to 643 ) of the House of Jiang. The sons who became Dukes were: Wukui ruled 642 BC Xiao ruled 642 to 633 BC Zhao ruled 632 to 613 BC Yi ruled 612 to 609 BC Hui ruled 608 - 599 BC"
Did archers synchronize fire? Why?,"There are a number of good accounts of the development of warfare in Europe, but the two key things you need to realise are:
a) ""morale""
b) ""mass"" Much of European warfare has been conditioned by these two abstract concepts.  Broadly, morale is the capacity of a unit to continue to engage in what it is doing despite adverse outcomes and mass is the capacity of a unit to bring effective force to bear at a point. Melee infantry operate by bringing a mass to bear on a point directly, they are only effective as a unit.  To be effective at doing so, the morale of a unit must remain unbroken.  When men are lost one by one it rarely causes the members of a unit to turn and consider if their position is untenable.  When twenty or forty men fall at once it causes people to think. The chief reason that archers fired on command was that this was the way to achieve a military effect, by harming the morale of units of the opposing force.  The individual's personal rate of fire was not a militarily significant feature."
Did Aztecs know how many continents there are on earth?,"I was hoping that someone with better resources on Aztec mythology would speak up, but in absence of that, I'll tell you what I found looking into this online. Chief among it was that I could find nothing whatsoever backing up that interpretation of the five flowers, and lots saying it meant completely different things. Given that, my suspicion is that this is a misinterpretation of the source material on someone's part. If not yours, then the article authors' (or perhaps their source's). Xochipilli is associated with both the Seven-flower (Chicomexōchitl) and Five-flower (Macuilxōchitl). The ""Five"" variant appears to be part of a series (of yes 5) of 5-named deities that are all associated with excess or pleasure. Sort of an Aztec analog to Christian culture's Seven Deadly Sins. The fives are Five-vulture, Five-lizard, Five-rabbit, Five-grass, and Five-flower. Five-flower in particular was associated with gambling and music. The Aztecs did have a belief that there had been 5 Suns (taken literally, or ""worlds"" less literally), but they didn't think all existed simultaneously. Rather that the world had ended 4 times previously, and it was their sacred duty to prevent it happening a 5th time. There is no indication I can find that they believed there were currently other worlds out there. Azetcs were also not a particularly maritime people. In fact their empire had noticeably little coastline, considering where it was, and their capital was about as far inland as you can get in Mesoamerica. Most of the archeologists specializing in their larger Nahua culture will tell you it likely originated in the Southwest American deserts to the north.
 Aztec Empire in 1519 So I'm not finding much support for the idea that they had any concept of whole other continents existing beyond their eastern and/or western sea, and given their cultural roots and outlook, it seems highly unlikely."
How did Nazi Germany produce such an impressive portfolio of officers for WW2?,"To a certain extent there's a wider question to ask - why did German armies fight so well in WW2? I say that because the answers to both questions overlap. The effectiveness of ordinary German soldiers made their generals look good, and good generalship made the soldiers effective. But to restrict this answer specifically to the senior officers I'd say the answer lies in these six points. Points 1, 2, 3, 4 may explain why German military leadership was so ""impressive"", while 5 & 6 may explain why it has long been considered impressive at least in the English speaking world. 1. Effects of WW1 Manpower Losses
Germany suffered terrible losses in WW1 amongst middle ranking officers, which led to rapid promotion through the ranks. This meant that relatively youthful officers got their chance to prove themselves at a young age in the 1914-18 war. By the time WW2 came round these experienced officers were in their prime. Of course Germany was not alone in this regard, though only France suffered comparable losses. But as the WW1 victors, France and Britain were naturally in no hurry to clear out their senior WW1 generals and these were retained into WW2 (Gamelin was 68 in 1939, Weygand 73). 2. Effects of the Versailles Restrictions
The Treaty of Versailles restricted Germany to an army of 100,000 and also imposed limits on certain kinds of weapons. It's possible this led to a culture which valued officers who could offer creative and imaginative solutions to tactical problems.  3. Effects of Defeat in WW1
The German army staff between the wars avoided that classic military error of ""preparing to fight the last war"" whereas French and, to a lesser extent, British planners, fell badly into that trap. Germans were keen to experiment with new technology and this meant the German army was better placed to use planes and tanks in bold, decisive new ways. It's easy to see why senior German officers using such tactics appeared better generals than their opponents. 4. Effects of Prussian/German military tradition
It's widely felt by military historians that the Prussian/German tradition of decentralized command was an important factor in the success of German armies in WW2. The doctrine played an important part in the successful careers of men like Rommel and Guderian. A paper prepared for the USAF in 1994 sums this doctrine up: Army Regulation 487 outlined a number of general principles to be
  followed, but no formulae. For example, the German operational
  doctrine de-centralized the operational leadership, and not only
  allowed, but insisted that junior officers would possess considerable
  initiative in command. http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/doctrine/research/cmc.pdf 5. Need for Quick Victories (and post-war ""spin"")
The nazi state needed quick victories, both because Britain and France were better equipped to fight a long war than Germany was, and because Hitler felt WW1 had proved that a long draining war was dangerous for morale on the home front. This meant that officers who offered bold and daring solutions got Hitler's ear. When daring paid off, in the early part of the war, German officers like Guderian and Rommel were able to claim credit. Disasters, especially those later in the war, could be entirely blamed on Hitler. This was certainly the spin that senior officers put on things after the war, in their memoirs. And this helped to add to their reputations. I don't say this in any way as a Hitler apologist but to offer up the suggestion that having Hitler and his most loyal cronies out of the way, was certainly convenient for wehrmacht memoirists after the war. 6. Convenient for the Allies
Paying tribute to the skill of your opponent is a classic tactic if you need to distract attention from your own shortcomings. It was a technique used by the British in the disastrous run of defeats in France, Norway, Greece, Crete and North Africa.  It was one of the tools in Churchill's kitbag when he was forced to explain before parliament and a domestic audience the lamentable performance of the British army in Africa in 1940-42. He often praised Rommel and hailed him as a ""great general"". The notion of the ""Desert Fox"" was useful to British commanders. While Churchill was privately furious with his own generals, in public it was a sort of an explanation for why the British, superior in men and tanks, were doing so badly against Rommel. As a result, Rommel, and other German generals came out of the war with burnished reputations"
How did the ancient Greeks synchronize time?,"In the particular case of Eratosthenes measuring the radius of the earth, it was done by observing the length of shadows at midday on the summer solstice, in cities that were north-south aligned (to within a few degrees). It was known that the sun was directly overhead on the solstice in the city of Syene in Egypt. But further north in Alexandria on the summer solstice the sun was not directly overhead. So all he needed to do was identify which day the summer solstice fell on, which was a day that people had been able to determine since before recorded history it seems. Likewise recognising midday was no great difficulty. You don't even need to do the measurements at the same time - you can do them on successive years if you want, and get the same result."
Was there a plan to use nuclear weapons for terrain modification in North America?,"It was Project Chariot, in Alaska.  A good book about it is the Firecracker Boys, I recommend you read it if you are interested in the subject.  I think it was cancelled because conservationists and Alaska Natives brought it to the attention of the general public, and it would have been a disaster.  The proponents were perfectly willing to try it (they had their own reasons, related to the ""Atoms for Peace project""/Operation Ploughshare) and did not really care much about the long-term consequences."
Is there a historical explanation as to why the USA people are so litigious compared to the French?,"Very little scholarly work has apparently been done on this, so my answer will closely follow the article ""The Culture of Tort Law in France"" by Jean-Sébastien Borghetti (2012). The question here reflects a strong perception that lawsuits are far less common in France, which is only partly accurate. Tort law does play an important role in France, although somewhat less important than other countries. Both this underlying fact and the exaggerated perception of it can be explained historically. One key point is that other kinds of compensating institutions are strong in France like social security benefits, special state compensation funds (like that for asbestos victims) and private direct insurance. These alternatives are not available as readily in the United States, so victims are forced to turn to lawsuits. Perhaps ironically, reliance on other institutions seems to result from a strongly pro-victim orientation in French tort law. Borghetti suggests that judges are often hesitant to let lawsuits move forward precisely because the system is so slanted in favor of the victim. Regarding the original academic legal philosophy that produces this situation, Borghetti emphasizes its historical development: this orientation is now quite old, and can be traced back at least to
the end of the 19th century when various authors began to contend that
the courts should not stick to liability for fault, as laid down in
the code civil, but should instead create categories of no-fault
liability, even without the legislator’s permission, in order to help
compensate victims of industrial accidents. At that time, the
political convictions of left-wing lawyers appeared to merge with the
Christian concern for the poor and the afflicted. The greater prevalence in France of private insurance specifically also helps to explain the perception that lawsuits are less common. Most lawsuits in France happen ""behind the scenes"", handled by the insurance companies on both sides. Someone who is wronged in France may get paid without ever knowing their insurance company sued or settled. Similarly for the party that caused the harm, they may not know their insurance company paid out to the victim. As a result, media coverage of major lawsuits also tends to be less prominent in France, because while tort law does play an important role in the legal system, it is just not something everyday people have the same awareness about in their own experience. EDIT: Comments by @fredsbend and @JMS both question the relevance of Borghetti's point about social security benefits. I think it is fair to question this point. Here's a key paragraph from the article I tried to summarize here. French social security, first of all, is rightly known for being relatively well-developed. Despite efforts by the Government to curb the steady rise in the system’s budget, the medical branch still offers generous coverage in respect of most health costs that may be incurred by individuals. This is especially true for serious medical treatment which may typically follow an accident. When the patient is prevented from working due to his illness or accident, the social security system will compensate for lost income up to a fixed amount. The result is that most victims of physical injury in France will receive at least partial compensation, through social security, for the financial loss resulting from their injury. As a consequence, compensation through tort law does not usually play the vital role that it does in other legal systems where this type of compensation may be the only means for victims of personal injury, who do not benefit from social security or health care coverage, to fund adequate medical treatment and stay financially afloat. Although Borghetti does not provide much data, I do find these assertions plausible. For example, look at the very different relationship between medical costs and personal bankruptcies in the United States versus France."
What was the purpose of Nazi extermination camps?,"1) It's much easier to hide the killings if they occur at a remote camp rather than executing people on the spot. The latter would probably have meant a much higher chance of rebellion amongst the Jews, Roma and other people who were killed. Most of the people who were deported to the camps did not know they would be killed. 2) The manpower required is much less compared to executing on the spot. For executing you need lots and lots of soldiers. For the gas chambers, you only need one person to flip the switch. 3) Psychologically, it's easier on the people doing the killing. That said, counting the number of Jews killed in extermination camps (see here) compared to the total numer of Jews killed, almost 3 million were not killed in extermination camps but via other means."
When did official documentation stop referring to black people as Negros in the States?,"It seems that the term was used on a number of pieces of legislation as late as the 1970's. In 2016, President Obama signed legislation into law which struck outdated racial terms such as “Oriental” and “Negro” from federal laws. As this article observes: Two sections in the U.S. Code written in the 1970s governing public health and civil rights attempted to define minority groups by using the outdated terms. For those who are interested, the two sections of the U.S. code mentioned above are: and Even more recently, the term ""Negro"" was included in the 2010 U.S census:  However, in 2013 the U.S. Census Bureau announced that the term will not appear in future censuses."
Did all the the -stan sovereign state names appear synchronously?,"The Persian suffix stān is much older than any of the “stans” in modern Central Asia. It goes back to proto-Indo-Iranian as represented by Sanskrit sthāna- “standing place” (already in the Rigveda) and Old Persian stāna- with the same meaning. In early New Persian (texts from the 10th century AD onwards) we have names like Turkistān “land of the Turks”, Čīnistān “China”, Hindūstān “India” and many others. These names are all well known in the Persianate cultures of Central Asia and India, where -stān becomes a productive suffix for forming names of countries, even countries as far distant as Lehistan (the Turkish name for Poland)."
What was wrong with Hitler's left hand?,"Joachim Fest, who wrote a major Hitler biography in German, cites four sources and concludes thus (in footnote 63 on p. 807 of the English paperback edition): Probably the exact nature of Hitler's illness can no longer be determined, since no examination with a specific investigatory aim was ever undertaken. Because of the extremely inadequate documentation, none of the various diagnoses can be persuasiverly supported or rejected; the principal symptom of both Parkinson's disease and the Parkinson syndrome, namely the shaking arm or leg, can also be caused by many other diseases. The shaking of Hitler's left arm and the fact that he tried to hide it is also mentioned on several occasions in this biography."
"Why were the drawings of Colossus burnt after WW2 and why was its very existence ""of course"" kept secret?","To answer why they denied its existence, because the value of British code breaking relied on keeping their ability to break codes secret. (Sorry this is without sources, I'm on a phone on a train.) Part of the wild success of British code breaking during the war was due to the Germans never realizing their communications were compromised. The Germans continued to send vital information using encryption that the British could read and use rapidly. While the Germans often suspected their codes were broken, and made some improvements, they considered the issue from their own relatively unsophisticated code breaking ability. Had they realized the extent of British capabilities, they likely would have beefed up their encryption and transmitted less. GCHQ's leap forward in code breaking ability cannot be overstated. Before WW2, code breaking was considered like solving a crossword puzzle. You got a bunch of very clever people together and they figured it out. GCHQ made breaking codes about mathematics and statistics. They turned it into a massive organization able to quickly and systematically process high volumes of traffic and have it disseminated that same day. Just as great a leap was their use of mechanisation. They built analog and digital computers like the bombes and Colossus of speeds and sizes and quantities unheard of. If the world knew about machines like Colossus they would have beefed up their security. Though burning the plans was probably a bit much. Keeping these capabilities secret would continue to help Britain after the war, snooping on other countries' domestic and military traffic. Secrecy was so ingrained into British code breakers that when the first popular (and extremely flawed) book was published about it, The Ultra Secret in 1974, it was considered a betrayal by some veterans of GCHQ despite the world now being well into the computer age."
What was the pound (unit of weight) initially equal to?,"When in doubt about an English word - check the OED. Here is its etymology and usage history for the first sense of pound: ... This pound consisted originally of 12 ounces, corresponding more or less to that of Troy weight, q.v., which contains 5760 grains = 373.26 grams. This is still used by goldsmiths and jewellers in stating the weight of gold, silver, and precious stones; but as early as the thirteenth or fourteenth century a pound of 16 ounces was in use for more bulky commodities. This was made a standard for general purposes of trade by Edward III, and known as the pound avoir du puis., i. e. of merchandise of weight, now called Avoirdupois, q.v. This pound of 16 ounces, containing 7000 grains = 453.6 grams, has been since 1826 the only legal pound for buying and selling any commodity in Great Britain. In former times the pound varied locally from 12 to 27 ounces, according to commodity, pounds of different weight being often used in the same place for different articles, as bread, butter, cheese, meat, malt, hay, wool, etc. The Scotch pound of 16 unces of Troy or Dutch weight consisted of 7608.9496 grains; the Tron poiund kept at Edinburgh - 9261.67 grains. Pound is also used to translate foreign names of weights, of cognate origin or representative of L. libra. These vary greatly: in Italy between 300 and 750 grams, in Spain and Portugal, the Netherlands, and some German states between 459 and 469 grams. in other German states, Denmark, etc. between 477 and 520.22 grams. But the standard German pfund is now 500 grams, i.e. half a kilogram. Note that the strict etymology for pound is from the Latin pondo meaning  ""by weight"", in the phrase ""libra pondo"" which we translate into modern English as ""pound by weight"". So in a sense the archaic meaning of ""pound"" just means ""by weight""; or perhaps ""the usual weight"". Finally, as some readers seem to have missed the point, carefully note the phrasing ""varied locally ..., according to commodity"" above. This means that each Guild set its own standard for the ""usual weight"" of sales; and that these standards varied regionally even by Guild. That is the key take-away from my previous paragraph's comment about ""pound"" meaning essentially ""the usual weight"" [of this commodity, in this legal jurisdiction]. For those speculating that this simply pushes the question back to the origin of ""ounce"" - prepare for disappointment. The etymology of ounce is directly from the Latin uncia, meaning ""twelfth part"" [of a pound]. (Likewise the English word inch also derives directly from the Latin uncia, in that case signifying the twelfth part of a foot.) While the ounce, Troy and avoirdupois respectively, are further subdivided into 480 grains (20 pennyweight) and 437.5 grains (16 drams), these are simply convenient subdivisions for finer measure.

"Why did the population of Anchorage, Alaska, increase by so much in the 1970s?","There were two major, interrelated events that caused this population boom in the 1970s. The first was the discovery of oil on Alaska's North Slope at Prudhoe Bay and elsewhere in 1968 and 1969. The second was the raising of oil prices by OPEC in 1973 and 1979. Both sets of developments resulted in the rapid growth of oil production in Alaska, and its export through Anchorage. There were two comparable percentage gains in earlier decades, but the 1970s saw the largest growth in absolute numbers."
How did early adopters of the automobile fill up their cars?,"The first cross-country automobile journey was run by Bertha Benz in 1888.: With no fuel tank and only a 4.5-litre supply of petrol in the carburetor, she had to find ligroin, the petroleum solvent needed for the car to run. The solvent was only available at apothecary shops, so she stopped in Wiesloch at the city pharmacy to purchase the fuel. The mentioned Ligroin was a cleanser. Still today some variants of petrol are used to clean things. So I guess it was a similar situation in the US, you had to look for drug stores to get petrol. The ""first gas station"" is mentioned in the German Wikipedia (including a picture of the pharmacy and a plate as first gas station."
What was the internal Soviet reaction to the moon landing?,"TL; DR: Landing on the moon was covered in the Soviet press, and was well known in the Soviet Union. It received much less attention than Soviet space missions, though. Just to add something factual to previous answers. NASA on U.S.S.R. reaction  NASA's Astronautics and Aeronautics, 1969 (15 MB PDF file) contains some useful information on press coverage of moon landing in USSR:  July 16 (p. 225) Worldwide audience focused on Apollo 11 launch: U.S.S.R. radio and TV gave factual accounts on Apollo 11 launch but maintained third day of silence on Luna XV. Major Soviet news program at 8:30 pm Moscow time showed tape of Apollo 11 liftoff taken from live comsat coverage. July 17 (p. 230): Izvestia gave the first U.S.S.R. report of President Nixon's July 17 announcement that medals of two dead Soviet cosmonauts would be placed on moon by Apollo 11 astronauts. Factual account of mission carried no comment (W Post, 7/19/69, A10) July 20-21 (p. 233): Soviet Premier Alexsey Kosygin complimented U.S. on lunar landing and expressed interest in widening U.S.-U.S.S.R. space cooperation during July 21 Moscow discussion with former Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, who was ending Soviet visit. Soviet TV did not carry live coverage of Apollo 11 lunar landing July 20; Tass announcement was read by newscaster and carried in two-paragraph item on Pravda's front page. Evening paper, Izvestiya, accorded story more space and featured photo of astronauts on the moon. On TV, Cosmonaut Konstantin P. Feoktistov described landing as ""major landmark"" and said crew has coped ""brilliantly"" with mission. Georgy Petrov, Director of Soviet Institute for Cosmis Research, called Apollo 11 ""outstanding achievement"" but said more data per ruble could have been gathered by unmanned probes. July 24 (p. 244): ... In U.S.S.R. TV viewers had live coverage for first time during mission at Moscow TV station hooked into Eastern Europe's Intervision network for live transmission of astronauts being deposited on carrier Hornet. Later, station devoted first two-thirds of final newscast to Apollo 11 and announced that Soviet President Nikolay V. Podgorny had sent telegram to President Nixon offering ""our congratulations and best wishes to the space pilots."" Soviet Academy of Sciences president Mstislav V. Keldysh called voyage ""a big contribution to space exploration and further progress of world science."" Cosmonauts send message to Apollo 11 crew: ""We... closely followed your flight.

Excerpts from an article: Первая лунная экспедиция 
  комментирует академик А.П. Виноградов Полет американского космического корабля ""Аполлон-11"", в результате которого два человека - Нейл Армстронг и Эдвин Олдрин впервые ступили на поверхность Луны, мы оцениваем высоко. Серьезную проверку выдержал космический корабль и его многочисленные системы. Нельзя не восхищаться мужеством и выдержкой космонавтов, которые смело встретили неизвестность. Они впервые совершили посадку на поверхность нашего естественного спутника в лунном аппарате. Не менее сложная и новая проблема - подъем кабины с Луны и стыковка с кораблем, остававшимся на орбите.  Пользуясь случаем, хочу поздравить космонавтов с выдающимся успехом и пожелать им благополучного возвращения на Землю. Rough translation: The first lunar expedition
  interview with academician A.P. Vinogradov We highly appreciate the flight of the American spaceship ""Apollo-11"", in which two people - Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin first set foot on the lunar surface. Spaceship and its many systems withstood a serious challenge. One can do nothing but admire the courage and self-possession of cosmonauts, who bravely met the unknown. They first landed on the surface of our natural satellite in the moon unit. New challenges are no less complex - ascent from Moon surface and rendezvous with orbiting spaceship I take this opportunity to congratulate the cosmonauts with outstanding success and wish them a safe return to Earth. Neil Armstrong's visit to USSR in 1970 In May 1970, Armstrong traveled to the Soviet Union. He presented a talk at the 13th annual conference of the International Committee on Space Research. He met Premier Alexei Kosygin and was given a tour of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. Excerpt from Astronautics and Aeronautics, 1970: June 2 (p. 190): Apollo 11 Astrounaut Neil A. Armstrong, on goodwill trip to U.S.S.R., watched TV broadcast of Soyuz IX launch during party in his honor in Moscow and was told by 
  Cosmonaut Georgy Beregovoy that mission was ""especially in honor of your trip here."" Armstrong later presented moon fragment and small Soviet flag carried on Apollo 11 mission to Soviet Premier Aleksey N. Kosygin. Kosygin said he would ""always cherish this gift as a symbol of a great achievement."" He told Armstrong, ""The Soviet peoples are second to none in admiring your courage and knowledge."" Q&A DISCLAIMER: The rest of this answer contains personal opinion and partly based on the experience of communication with the people, who lived in the Soviet Union in the 1960s. What was the internal Soviet response to the news? Soviet officials and media praised astronauts and first moon landing was recognized as an exceptional achievement. At the same time, Moon landing received significantly less attention than Soviet space program achievements (sputnik, first human into space, lunokhod). There was much more information published on Soviet missions, like Luna 15. Did the Soviet citizens know it was happening at the time?  Soviet people were surely informed about it. Newspapers published articles on Moon landing, reports were broadcasted on TV and radio. Neil Armstrong, and Buzz Aldrin were widely known in Soviet Union. Was it spun as a victory for humanity, or a victory for the United States, or a loss for the Soviet Union, or what? As an achievement of the US space program and a victory for humanity. Certainly, it wasn't described as a victory for the United States/loss for the Soviet Union. Soviet publications on space were largely centered around Soviet space program and its achievements. Sputnik, Gagarin's flight, first walk in space, various unmanned probes were largely praised as landmark achievements. In comparison, Moon landing was rarely mentioned and was never presented as a political victory for US. Was the story reported accurately, or were details changed in the retelling? The story was reported accurately. Soviet Union never tried to dispute the veracity of the moon landings. Again, highly-detailed reports on the event probably were never published in USSR."
Are modern Greeks related to the ancient Greeks?,"Until the day comes that we have DNA technology (and theory) advanced to the point where we can look at the genetic lineage of large groups of people, really the best indicator we have for cultural descent is language. Now language isn't perfect in this regard. For instance, there are a lot of people indigenous to the Americas whose language has been lost (or nearly so), and speak English or Spanish instead. There's also the Pygmies, who probably had a very unique language of their own originally, but today speak Niger-Congo derived languages (albeit with some intriguing holdovers). However, this in itself can be viewed as a good indicator of how thouroughly their culture got absorbed into the culture of the new languages. So I think it is quite fair to view anybody speaking a modern language derived from ancient Greek as a cultural descendent of the ancient Greeks. It is also quite fair to view anybody speaking a Romance language as cultural descendants of the Romans. As Samuel Johnston said,  There is no tracing the connection of ancient nations, but by
  language; and therefore I am always sorry when any language is lost,
  because languages are the pedigree of nations So from this standpoint, we would consider the French to be descendants of the Romans (along with Italians of course, and all other Romance speakers), but not the Germans or English."
Did anyone in Europe predict the existence of the Americas?,"As fate would have it, the first known globe of the Earth was created in 1492, the same year as Columbus' voyage. As such, it is also the only known globe to depict the area between Western Europe and East Asia prior to the discovery of the New World. None of the earlier flat maps I could find made any kind of legitimate effort at depicting this area.  The author was working for the King of Portugal at the time. Given this as the state of the art of European cartographical knowledge in 1492, we can see that the intervening ocean was thought to contain numerous small islands. The Azores and Canaries and Cape Verde islands were known and depicted. In the East, Japan (Cipangu), Java and other ""spice"" islands of the SE Asian archipelago are depicted. There are some  interesting ""unknown"" islands. There are several placed up in the arctic circle, perhaps as a nod to Iceland and its legends. There was also one island roughly the size of England smack dab in the middle of the ocean named ""Saint Brandan"". Likely this is a reference to the story of the Irish monk St. Brendon, who was said to have traversed the ocean and found an island paradise. The interesting thing about this is that it appears that this rather tall tale was apparently given much more credence in mainstream European thought than the Icelandic discoveries. Even there though, it was clearly just thought to be a large island, not an entire new continent. So it seems fair to say the folks in the best position to speculate, the Portugese navigational community, didn't think there was anything in the middle but islands."
Who is this young 'Prince'?,"I don't know uniforms well enough to be completely affirmative, but all your clues and the physionomy of the boy remind me of French Imperial Prince Napoleon, son of Napoleon III.  He was born in 1856 and the pictures on his wiki page show a strong ressemblance (in my humble opinion) with the boy on your photo. On this picture, he even wears a similar uniform. On this one, taken a few months before his death, he seems to wear the same decoration as on your photo. If I am correct, your photo would have been taken around 1868-70. He would die in 1879 during the Anglo-Zulu War in South Africa. Confirmation is provided by a comment from @Aaron Brick:

After his father was dethroned in 1870, he relocated with his family to England. On his father's death in January 1873, he was proclaimed Napoleon IV, Emperor of the French by the Bonapartist faction. In England he trained as a soldier. Keen to see action, he successfully put pressure on the British to allow him to participate in the Anglo-Zulu War. In 1879, serving with British forces, he was killed in a skirmish with a group of Zulus. His early death sent shockwaves throughout Europe, as he was the last serious dynastic hope for the restoration of the Bonapartes to the throne of France (from Wikipedia).

Is there any documented criticism of the brutality of the Colosseum from citizens at the time?,"The most notable non-Christian Roman critic of gladiatorial games was likely the Stoic philosopher Seneca. Of course Christians like Tertullian had good reason to speak out against bloody spectacles in general, and some of the conquered peoples living under Rome took less joy in the games than did the Romans. But for the most part, even enlightened Romans whom we might expect to criticize the games kept quiet, including Stoics like Epictetus and the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Tacitus mildly disapproved of the games, writing:  ""There are the peculiar and characteristic vices of this metropolis of
  ours, taken on, it seems to me, almost in the mother's womb--the
  passion for play actors and the mania for gladiatorial shows and
  horse-racing."" But this is a pretty mild condemnation--he doesn't single out gladiatorial fighting as any worse than plays or horse races. I see Seneca's name most often associated with criticisms of gladiatorial fights, but he comes off like a lone voice in the wilderness. He thought the games desensitized viewers, and because of them: Man, an object of reverence in the eyes of men, is now slaughtered for
  jest and sport ... and it is a satisfying spectacle to see a man made
  a corpse. As mentioned, early Christians were obviously critical of entertainments that not only had pagan religious origins but which sometimes featured the grisly deaths of fellow Christians. But interestingly, critics like Tertullian didn't object solely to the human slaughter, but to the spirit of all spectacles. Using some Yoda-esque logic, he writes: There is no public spectacle without violence to the spirit. For where
  there is pleasure, there is eagerness, which gives pleasure its
  flavor. Where there is eagerness, there is rivalry, which gives its
  flavor to eagerness. Yes, and then, where there is rivalry, there also
  are madness, bile, anger, pain, and all the things that follow from
  them and (like them) are incompatible with moral discipline. In other words, gladiatorial fights epitomized what was corrupt about all circuses, games, plays, shows, and so on. Later Christian writers may have exaggerated the extent of anti-Christian brutality, but there is at least one passion text that purports to be an eyewitness account of Christians being exposed to gladiators and wild beasts in the early 200s. Finally, gladiatorial shows were less popular outside of Italy, Roman colonies, and Roman military encampments. In some provinces, there was even overt criticism of the games: When King Herod wished to offer spectacles in an amphitheater he had
  constructed near Jerusalem, ""the Jews found such a cruel pleasure to
  be impious and an abandonment of their ancestral customs."" Source: Sisella Bok on ""The Paradox of Entertainment Violence"""
Why did Poland keep Warsaw as its capital instead of returning it to Krakow in the 20th century?,"You may want to read this answer while listening to a poetic song by Andrzej Sikorowski and Grzegorz Turnau, called ""Nie przenoście nam stolicy do Krakowa"", what means ""Please don't move the capital back to Kraków"", written in the 90's, after the end of communist era in Eastern Europe, when some politics started to express such ideas. Digressions I've decided to cut my answer a lot in comparison with what I've written off-line, in order to provide the most direct answer to the actual question. But for the background, few things need to be clarified, so I'll at least point it in short without providing details. The previous capital before Krakow was Gniezno, the role of which for Polish history is somewhat similar to that of Canterbury for England or Reims for France. Even if Krakow was the center of political power from 11th century, it became the factual capital in 1320, with the coronation of Wladyslaw I the Elbow-high. Also the role of Krakow as the center of political power before 1320 wasn't always clear. This happened because of very complexed internal situation of Poland (which was divided into many smaller parts) between 11th and 14th centuries and because of different role of capital in medieval Poland that we understand it recently. There are also towns Poznan and Plock, which proudly use the title of capital city, because they were also centers of political power in various periods before 1320. Now as for Warsaw becoming the capital. The court of Sigismund III Vasa was moved to Warsaw in 1595 from the highly interesting reason including the results of alchemical experiment, which is unfortunately not a matter of this question. But it was only short, temporal change - the permanent move was made by him in 1609, also from few different reasons. Still, the official capital of Poland was Krakow, what led to several awkward situations and even national scandals. So officially, Warsaw was never described in any documents as a capital until Grodno Sejm in 1793, two years before Poland vanished from the maps of Europe. I will be extremely happy to describe all of that if any adequate questions happen in the future. :)

Page from Liber Chronicum by Hartmann Schedel, 1493, with his illustration of Kraków, Jewish town Kazimierz and royal Wawel Castle  Fall of Krakow in 17th century Speaking of why Krakow didn't become a capitol once again, we have to go back as far as to second part of 17th century. Note that we don't go back to the first part. Because even if the court moved to Warsaw, it didn't stop Krakow from development, thanks to its important role at the trading map of Europe. Unfortunately, bad things started to happen with the enthronement of John II Casimir Vasa in 1648 (in my opinion the worst kings of Poland if not to count Russians which we just don't legitimize because we didn't chose them). It started with a fire at Wawel Castle in 1649, which wasn't anything unusual, but let's count it as a prelude. Soon there came Khmelnytsky Uprising in Ukraine and at the same time Peasant Uprising of 1651 almost at the fields of Krakow. In 1652, nearly 20000 citizens of Krakow agglomeration died in smallpox epidemy, which was quickly followed by one of the biggest floods in town's history. And as if it wouldn't be enough, during the so called Deluge (Swedish invasion) Krakow was sieged, ruined and looted with its surroundings two times in 1655 and 1657. After that decade, Krakow just wasn't the same anymore. Of course it slowly raised, but in overall, demographic and economic development of the town stopped for many years. 
Siege of Krakow according to Samuel Pufendorf, 1695, click here for full resolution Role of Krakow during Partitions of Poland Like I've written previously, in 1795 Poland vanished from map of Europe for 123 years because of so called Partitions. At the beginning, Krakow became a free city on the border of three occupants - Austria, Prussia and Russia. But after unsuccessful Krakow Uprising during Spring of Nations in 1846, it became part of Austria.  And it wasn't even the most important town of its region, as the capital ofKingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria became Lviv. There were both advantages and disadvantages of such situation. On one hand, there was much bigger freedom in Krakow than in Warsaw and other Russian or Prussian towns. Austro-Hungarian Empire just didn't have enough forces to control everything in its borders, especially when they had to deal with many other nations (see map below). This led to development of Krakow once again as the cultural, artistic and historical heart of Polish nation in those difficult times.  On the other hand, Galicia became poor in comparison with other Polish regions, especially Greater Poland. Austrians were spending much more money to satisfy others, e.g. raising from the ground Budapest after Hungarian Revolution of 1848. By that time, Krakow itself was a very small town, surrounded by few other ones (Stradom, Kazimierz, Kleparz) and a new one - Podgorze, founded by Austrians on the other side of Vistula river. Also the town of Krakow was mainly covered by churches and monasteries, from which many weren't even used. It was a difficult task with not always right decisions to reform it into modern, big town. And even if local government was finally successful to realize it, it was still much smaller than other towns. Role of Warsaw during Partitions of Poland In the times of Partitions, Warsaw become capital of two countries. Firstly, capital of Duchy of Warsaw, which existed between 1807 and 1815, until Napoleon's fall. Later, of Congress Poland, the name of which comes from the Congress of Vienna. This way Warsaw was still developing as center of political power, at least at the local level, as it didn't have any own foreign politics and was completely dependent on Russia, with Russian tsar being at the same time king of Poland.  During World War I Warsaw became capital of Regency Kingdom of Poland (founded by Germans and Austrians on the lands of Russian partition) and after the end of it, which meant rise of the Second Polish Republic, Warsaw was also a natural choice for a capital city. Rapid development of the town continued for 20 years between the wars. As far as I hate to admit it, in comparison to Warsaw, Krakow was at that time rather a province. Here are the numbers of citizens in Polish towns in 1939, at the beginning of World War II: Warsaw – 1,289,000
Łódź – 672,000
Lwów – 318,000 (recently in Ukraine)
Poznań – 272,000
Kraków – 259,000
Wilno – 209,000 (recently in Lithuania) 
Greetings from Warsaw, postcard dated before 1939 Krakow and Warsaw during World War II I skip all the history of the war, except for the fact that Warsaw was meant by Germans to be completely demolished and replaced by a new town for German elite with around 100000 citizens. This way during all the war the destroying continued and didn't stop even in 1945. From 1.3 million of citizens, 700 thousands were killed during the war (300 thousands of them being Jews). Here you can see collection of photos showing Warsaw after the war. At the same time Krakow was as a capital of new General Goverment, as Germans treated it as a previously German town. It was also the central place for German garrison in Poland, what made any tries of uprising in Krakow impossible. This way, speaking about buildings, the town survived rather untouched, of course if not to count Jewish district Kazimierz which was destroyed. 
View of Warsaw after World War II After World War II So finally we come to the times after the war.  First of all, were communists thinking about moving the capital from Warsaw? Of course they were. But surprisingly, the rival of Warsaw wasn't Krakow, but city of Lodz. Being the biggest at the time, after the fall of Warsaw, and very close to it, what meant the same, central position in a newly established country, it quickly started to serve as a new cultural center with new universities, theaters, cinemas and artists passing the main Piotrkowska Street. Another reason for which Lodz was taken into account was a large amount of big, empty buildings, perfect for new government offices. During the war Lodz lost around 300000 of Jews (after Warsaw, Lodz had the biggest Jewish population in Poland), 120000 of Poles and 80000 of Germans who left the town together with German army. But before the end of 1945, the population once again raised from 300000 to 500000. This way many official agencies moved to this town quickly after the war. It resulted with Lodz being a center of political power between years 1945 and 1948, when the main offices went back to Warsaw. Other towns on the list were Poznan and of course Krakow. But Krakow wasn't a good option for communists from different reason. Krakow was a town of intelligence, lying in Lesser Poland which was also the most religious region. Even after the war, when intelligence of Poland was crushed, it was still too strong to change it into a communist one and the support for left-winged politics was the lowest in the country.  It was proven in 1946, during the People's Referendum, when the communist party PPR organized huge campaign to vote 3 x yes. Later it took them 12 days to falsify the results in order to prove that the country accepts the new politic order. But in Krakow and other towns of Lesser Poland original results were announced and they were opposite: The official results, published on 12 July 1946, showed that from a population of 13,160,451 eligible voters, 90.1% or 11,857,986 had taken part in the referendum. Of these, 11,530,551 or 97.2% were counted as valid. On the first question, 68% voters chose ""yes"". On the second question, 77.2% voted ""yes"". On the third question, 91.4% voted ""yes"". (...) In Kraków, where the opposition managed to ensure a fair vote, the ""no"" results were: 84%, 59% and 30% for all three questions. In opposite, Lodz was not only biggest and in the center of the country, but also a modern worker's city. What a perfect match for new, communist government. In the end, the vision of creating whole new town suited the needs of communist government the most, as they would be able to build it fully under their control and to unite the country over the rebuild of the capital under the communist flag. Now who made the final decision? Of course Stalin. Son of Edward Osóbka-Morawski, Prime Minister of Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland which ruled Poland after the war, describes it in Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper in the following words (translated by me): Bierut (chairman of State National Council) had an opinion that the state of city's devastation justifies the move of capital and his proposition was Lodz. The Council of Ministers, of which my father was a leader, insisted on rebuilding of Warsaw. Because of lack of agreement the case was decided by Stalin, who gave support to my father. When Bierut came back from Moscow in January of 1945, he told the government that Stalin wants Warsaw to be rebuilt and offers his help. Surprisingly among the people who opted for Warsaw was Marian Spychalski, born in Lodz and the last mayor of Warsaw at the time of war. Finally, Warsaw became a constitutional capital of Poland in 1952, as says the text of Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland: Article 105  Warsaw, a city which embodies the heroic traditions of the
  Polish Nation, shall be the capital of the Republic of Poland."
When and why did garum disappear?,"Short Answer Garum production and consumption declined because increasing instability in the late Western Empire disrupted production and trade (and not just of garum). Further, a key ingredient - salt - became too expensive and pirates undermined the trade routes. Note also that garum was far from the only thing that declined or disappeared along with the empire; so too did many other features of everyday Roman life.  However, it could still be found centuries after the fall of the Western Empire, especially in the Eastern Mediterranean. Details According to the Italian archaeologist Claudio Giardino of the University of Salento (Lecce), ""In the Roman times, salt was a cheap material....When the Roman
Empire collapsed, they put taxes on the salt. And because of these
taxes, it became difficult to produce garum."" Cited in 'Fish Sauce: An Ancient Roman Condiment Rises Again' Also, as the Romans lost control of the Mediterranean, piracy increased: ""The pirates started destroying the cities and the industries nearby
the coast. You could be killed any moment by the pirates, without the
protection of the Romans,"" In order for garum to be produced profitably in large quantities but at prices which most people could afford, ...large fishing fleets were essential and so were beachfront
facilities (especially after regulations were put in place by
Constantine Harmenopoulus that garum works could not be within a
certain distance of a town due to the odors) and safe shipping routes
from areas of production to faraway clients.  Other factors that may
have affected garum pricing and access were the   requirement of a
large workforce, land for facilities, and credit during  a tumultuous
time where shipping routes would not necessarily be secure.  The
Empire’s decline and the contraction of the Empire pulled apart the
trade routes and threads from production to the client. Source: T. Carpenter & G. Stern, 'The Rise, Fall, and Rise Again of Garum'. Paper presented at the Northern Great Plains History Conference, September 2016. The location of garum production sites away from cities may have meant that, in some cases at least, they were less well-protected from raiders than they would have been had they been located inside walled cities. With this ""loss of order"", it was not just garum consumption that declined with the decline of the empire; so too did other industries, as well as other features of Roman life, like the construction of roads and making a daily visit to the public baths or wearing the toga. Source: Carpenter & Stern The spread of the popularity of garum to provinces such as Gaul had occurred with the Romanization of these provinces when Italians settled there: Augustus settled many Italians in  the  provinces in the settlements
of the 20s BC. One mostly overlooked way they Romanized the
provinces, besides recreating grid-pattern Roman cities with baths and
a forum, was to bring their tongues with them, meaning both the
speaking of Latin – on which much has been said and written before –
but also the taste for Roman food.  They imported and eventually
produced their own garum to enjoy the flavors of home far from Italy. As the Romans withdrew, so declined the popularity of garum and the expertise to make it. The fact that it did not immediately disappear is an indication of a degree of Romanization among the indigenous population. Concerning the decline of the trade and consumption of high-priced garum, another factor to consider is the general decline in wealth in mainland Italy especially. The high-priced variety often came from afar as Some distantly-made garum was a status symbol (like Belgian beer or
champagne today). Source: Carpenter & Stern However, it did not completely disappear with the fall of the Western empire in some regions. For example, ...it remained in a few little pockets — like in Southwest Italy,
where they produce colatura di alici, a modern descendant of the
ancient fish sauce. The product was barely known even in Italy just a
few years ago, but it is gradually being rediscovered. Also, manufacture and consumption continued for a while in Tunisia and Gaul (despite the physician Anthimus writing it should be 'banned from every culinary role'), and in the Eastern Mediterranean as late as the 16th century. There is some controversy as whether Asian garum (the production of which "" has been uninterrupted for centuries"") was a 'technology transfer' from the west as the origins of the product in Asia are somewhat obscure. Without lending any support to to the 'West-to-East' theory, Carpenter & Stern note that Roman and Vietnamese fish sauce have a similar ratio of fish to salt ≤
5:1, but the Romans fermented garum for less time before bottling it.
Both Roman and Southeast Asian cuisines use fish sauce in similar
manners, as  both  an ingredient in cooking and as a condiment that
can be diluted with other ingredients like vinegar or sweetener. Fish sauce remains popular in Asia and is now also found in West African cuisine (where I first encountered it)."
To what extent did Native American cultures develop metalworking for tools and weapons?,"I'm afraid I know nothing about which pre-Columbian cultures had any metalworking, but I can answer why metallurgy was, in 1492, very rare in the Americas but widespread in Eurasia. Paraphrasing liberally from Guns, Germs and Steel, which I happen to be reading at the moment, Native American peoples were largely hunter-gatherers. Metalworking, like any specialised trade, is very unlikely for hunter-gatherer cultures, as having the time for individuals to develop craft specialisms requires a food surplus that can usually only be generated from agriculture, plus hunter-gatherer cultures are often nomadic, which rules out heavy metalworking equipment. The reason why Native American peoples were hunter-gatherers is the premise of the bulk of the book. To oversimplify, there were two main factors: Almost all the large mammals died out from the Americas after the last Ice Age, meaning there were no domesticable animals (to pull ploughs and provide transport) until the arrival of horses with the Europeans. At the same time, there were much fewer useful seed-plants (with high protein content, as well as digestible carbohydrates) in the Americas, compared with all the grasses from the Near East.   (As well as a lack of domesticable animals impacting on the productivity of farmland, it is thought that this also led to a greater preponderence of disease in Eurasia (plague, smallpox, measles etc), meaning that we were more likely to have inherent immunity, whereas Eurasian diseases could ― and did ― decimate the aboriginal inhabitants of the Americas.) Eurasia is longer on an east–west axis, whereas the Americas (and sub-Saharan Africa) are longer north–south. The east–west axis means that animals and plants can spread to areas of similar latitude (and, thus, of similar climate). The deserts and rainforests in the Americas, and the narrowness of the isthmus at Panama mean that domestication of plants and animals took an exceptionally long time to travel to other parts of the continent. So, with neither domesticable animals nor usable crops, the hunter-gatherer cultures in the Americas did not have the food surpluses that are a prerequisite for specialised crafts, particularly metallurgy. (Source: All of this is from my memory of the book, rather than looking up references. Errors are almost certainly mine, not those of Jared Diamond. You should, thus, all read the book, because it's very good, as well as probably more accurate than my summary.)"
Why did Bayer lose aspirin and heroin trademarks under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles?,"This is a quite convoluted story. But in short: the common story is a bit too short for correctness. The Versailles Treaty was quite bad on many accounts, but it was not really responsible alone for what happened to aspirin. The classical account is this: In 1915, Aspirin manufactured in tablet form became available without a prescription. As soon as the First World War ended and Germany surrendered, Bayer had to give away its registered trademark of Aspirin. Thus ""Aspirin"" became a generic name in the countries that emerged as winners of the war but remained a registered trademark of Bayer in countries like Germany, Mexico, Canada and over 80 other countries. After the patents ended many pharmaceutical companies in America began the mass production of Aspirin. Their campaigns were destined to be doomed. The First World War had ended but Bayer's war against the world had just begun.
 — G. Tsoucalas, M. Karamanou, G. Androutsos: ""Travelling through Time with Aspirin, a Healing Companion"", European Journal of Inflammation Vol. 9, no. I, 13–16 (2011). This is not entirely false, and neither it is entirely true. It's an oversimplification and ""Versailles"" may be a nice shorthand to mark time, but it has not that much to do with what actually happened in the history of aspirin. We have to observe a few aspects: knowledge to produce it, the corresponding patents, the trademark, and the trade in kind. And in which markets which events occurred.  In Britain the patent for Aspirin was already lost in 1905, as a court ruled that prior art from 1869 made it an invalid claim. But it upheld Bayer's trademark. Generics were thus allowed. In the US both claims were ruled valid. Such trademarks are country specific: In many countries, like Germany itself, the aspirin trademark never went out of Bayer's control.  Thus an all important qualifier: Only in the victorious allied countries/markets did Bayer lose its registered trademarks. In some countries like Britain and the US this situation was used for profit, in revolutionary Russia  the trademark entry was just deleted from its register. As was the frequent practice of the time, the launch of this product was accompa­nied by numerous applications for patent registration for the invention itself, and trademark registration for the name. These applications were made in Germany but also in a range of other countries, includ­ing Great Britain and the United States. In Britain, patent application 27,088 was lodged on 22 December 1898 and grant­ed to a British resident, Henry Edward Newton. In the United States, Patent No. 644,077 – lodged on 1 August 1898 and granted 22 February 1900 – was issued to Felix Hoffman. Despite being essentially the same invention, when Bayer initiated infringement action in courts in Britain and the United States, and the defendants countersued for revocation of the patents, those courts reached different opinions on their validity.
 — Dan Hunter & Claudy Op Den Kamp (Eds): ""A History Of Intellectual Property In 50 Objects"", Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, New York, 2019. (Chapter 25: Aspirin Pill, pp209–215.) And in effect Bayer already had a problem aside from  but related to marketing rights: consumer perception and brand recognition. Aspirin was well underway to become genericised, and the US patent was about to expire in 1917: We see here a more classical move. When the protection via the technological assets is about to expire, companies tend to turn to the market-based assets. While the initial building of the Aspirin brand name had not required heavy communication investments, Bayer was  finally deciding to start investing in the brand. However, at that stage the brand recognition was already largely established and the investments that started in 1914 were essentially needed to reinforce and maintain the brand (and thus reinforce the distribution channels). Adopting a counterfactual perspective, one could imagine that building a brand from scratch at that point would most certainly have cost much more. In any case, the outbreak of WWI did not permit to pursue such investments.
 — Klaus Jennewein, Thomas Durand and Alexander Gerybadze: ""When Brands Complement Patents in Securing the Returns from Technological Innovation: The Case of Bayer Aspirin"", Management international / Gestiòn Internacional / International Management, 14 (3), 2010. pp73–86.  In allied countries the very outbreak of the war made for a veritable ""aspirin-crisis"". Stocks running out, no re-supply on the horizon and a public with more than enough reasons for headaches. This made governments bend the rules. In Britain the trademark for ASPIRIN was just completely suspended to allow competitors to sell their acetylic salicylic acid (ASS/ASA) even under the brand name. In 1915 an Australian parliamentarian came up with the idea that ""trading with the enemy was helping him"" and called specific attention to Aspirin. (Later debate example) In the US, entering the war made seizure of enemy owned assets easy. Bayer tried to hide their's behind shell-companies, but the government saw through the veil and took action against those in 1917. With the Office of Alien Property Custodian. The government arranged for the German assets to be force sold. Sterling Drug bought Aspirin and other Bayer assets in 1918. As the linked article shows, that was not really that much cutting of Bayer from making profits, as they soon entered into a business partnership…  This was all nice and back in the barn before anyone important showed up in Paris: The war ended in November 1918, just a year after the passage of the Trading with the Enemy Act. In that time, the Alien Property Custodian had acquired hundreds of millions of dollars in private property. In a move that was later widely criticized – and that political allies of the Alien Property Custodian likely profited from directly – Palmer announced that all of the seized property would be “Americanized,” or sold to U.S. citizens, partly in the hopes of crippling German industries. (His attitude echoed a wider sentiment that the Central Powers deserved to pay dearly for the vast destruction of the war.) In one high-profile example, the chemical company Bayer was auctioned on the steps of its factory in New York. Bayer lost its U.S. patent for aspirin, one of the most valuable drugs ever produced.
 — Daniel A. Gross: ""The U.S. Confiscated Half a Billion Dollars in Private Property During WWI. America’s home front was the site of interment, deportation, and vast property seizure"", Smithonian, 2014. After Versailles: As part of the reparations not only money and gold were to be supplied by Germany, but also useful things in kind, like coal — or aspirin; but in pill form. The US rights to the trademark was then only lost in 1921. (Bayer Co. v. United Drug Co., 272 F. 505 (S.D.N.Y. 1921)) What about Versailles? The implication was clear. Aspirin was going to be sold with all the hype, fanfare and panache that a hardened patent-remedy professional could bring to bear. Even more boldly, Weiss and his colleagues also decided that there was no reason why their Bayer Aspirin and the other drugs should be marketed only in the United States. As Leverkusen's intellectual property rights were under attack all over the Allied world, why shouldn't Sterling try to challenge them overseas too? It all sounded fine in theory, but there was a problem. When all was said and done, Sterling Products was still just a patent medicine business. Its bosses had no idea how to go about making the sophisticated drugs they now owned and the vast modern Rensselaer plant was completely mystifying to them. The German managers who had once run its production lines had all been sacked, interned or deported, and perhaps understandably hadn't left behind a handy set of instructions showing how everything worked. Nor was there any help from the Bayer patents. Sterling's executives found them as confusing as Mr Justice Joyce had so many years earlier. The documents truly were 'erroneous and misleading … by accident, error or design so framed as to obscure the subject as much as possible'. There was still a large amount of product stockpiled at Rensselaer, but it wouldn't last for ever. Unless Sterling Products found a way to get the plant working, its $5.3 million investment could turn out to be one of the worst bargains in history. There was, of course, one possible solution, but it was not an attractive one. Sterling Products could try to get help from Rensselaer's former owners, Farbenfabriken Bayer. As these were the very people whose interests Sterling was now plotting to undermine, the 'alien' company that the American government had been so keen to get shot of, it didn't look a promising route to follow. There was a strong chance that the Germans wouldn't even talk to them. Fortunately there was one former Bayer executive still with the company, its export manager, Ernst Moller. He had kept his head down during the wartime farragos that had overwhelmed the other senior managers and had somehow clung on to his job. Seeing an opportunity to establish himself in the Sterling hierarchy and pay off a few debts to his old employers in the process, he offered himself as a middleman and pressed Weiss to do the only thing open to him. Go to Germany and cut a deal. Had Carl Duisberg known what they were planning he would probably have enjoyed the delicious irony of Sterling's dilemma, but right then he had other things on his mind. At the end of April 1919, the German government's delegation arrived at Versailles to begin negotiating a peace treaty that would formally end the war. The hopes of the nation had gone with them. Many Germans hoped that the Allies would stick to the principles set out by President Woodrow Wilson in January 1918. His 'Fourteen Points' had covered such matters as the restoration of conquered territory, independence for nations such as Poland and removal of trade barriers, but otherwise seemed to offer a reassuring blueprint for a 'just peace'. In fact it all looked so reasonable that there was even optimism that Germany might get back some of its own lost assets. Among the delegates was a representative of the embryonic IG Farben combine, Carl Bosch of BASF, who hoped to secure the return of thousands of the group's patents, products, factories and trademarks still in Allied hands. Like everyone else with such interests overseas, Duisberg and the management of Farbenfabriken Bayer were on tenterhooks as to what Bosch might achieve. It didn't take long for disillusionment to set in.
 It seemed the German delegation had not been invited to Versailles as equal negotiating partners, but as inferiors who were to be given a set of demands to which they were expected to agree. Shortly after their arrival they were presented with the first draft of the peace treaty – a document that they had had no hand in drawing up. It contained no mention of any of their seized assets or indeed of anything approximating to a 'just peace'. President Wilson, perhaps weakened by the long-term effects of the flu, had clearly lost his battle to persuade the Allies of the importance of allowing the Germans some shreds of dignity. The other victors, particularly the French, seemed more set on making the vanquished pay for their losses and preventing them from ever becoming a threat again. The final document, signed by the demoralized and browbeaten losers on 28 June, was savagely retributive. Germany lost about 13 per cent of its territory, including all its overseas colonies. Its army was reduced to a rump of 100,000 men, and most of its and the navy's weapons were confiscated. The Rhineland was to be occupied and permanently demilitarized and France was given control of the industrially rich Saar region. To cap it all, the financial reparations demanded were almost impossibly high – sums far in excess of Germany's capacity to pay. For Farbenfabriken Bayer and IG Farben the treaty was a disaster. As a grim-faced Carl Bosch explained on his return, one of its most damaging reparations conditions was that Germany had to immediately surrender 50 per cent of its chemical, dyes and pharmaceutical stocks. Even worse, for the next five years the Allies would be able to buy a quarter of any of those products at prices well below market rates. Not one seized trademark or product had been handed back, nor did it look as though they ever would. Short of a miracle, Carl Duisberg would have to accept the unthinkable. In much of the Allied world, Bayer's once jealously guarded aspirin monopoly was gone for good.  — Diarmuid Jeffreys: ""Aspirin. The Remarkable Story of a Wonder Drug"", Bloomsbury: London, 2004. The treaty itself was quite prosaic in cementing just a fait accompli: Nevertheless, all acts done by virtue of the special measures taken during the war under legislative, executive or administrative authority of any Allied or Associated Power in regard to the rights of German nationals in industrial, literary or artistic property shall remain in force and shall continue to maintain their full effect.

It's getting too long to look into the specifics for heroin in this answer. Just note that patent & trademark wise the situation was similar, but the outlook on profitability much reduced as the International Opium Convention was shoehorned into the Versailles treaty.  Previously, Germany, Austria and the Ottoman Empire weren't much in favour of regulating this, but the treaty was quite the opportunity. This increased the political pressure and Bayer 'voluntarily' stopped manufacturing the drug in 1931 after it was already banned in the US in 1924. (Cf Jens Soentgen: ""Heroin.

How did the American Civil War help the U.S economy recover from the Panic of 1857 given that civil wars are extremely destructive?,"tl;dr  Modern industrial warfare pushes the economy to 100% utilization; this cures the effect of an economic downturn (which is effectively suboptimal economic utilization). Wars in general, and the civil war in particular create stimulus spending - governments buy bullets and boots.  Governments drive the economy to 100% utilization.  Unemployment vanishes as young men move from their traditional jobs to new jobs created just for the war.  As @jwenting points out, mortality decreases the size of the labor pool, which affects the economic power of the remaining labor pool. Individuals not normally in the labor pool take up jobs to replace the young men.   Industry is pushed to 100% capacity - industry produces war goods on a priority footing, causing shortages of consumer goods, which drives up prices, drawing even more idle resources (e.g. labor, capital) into production. Between government need for new weapons and technologies, and the retooling of production lines to produce more bullets and less butter, there are opportunities for innovation. Innovation makes more efficient uses of the available resources and deepens the capital pool dramatically.  Furthermore, during wartime, innovation is easier.  In normal conditions there are always opponents to innovation, because innovation is never Pareto Efficient.  War lowers the commitment to Pareto Efficiency and makes innovation easier to implement.  A full explanation of this phenomenon would probably require a small essay. Wars act on financial markets - because wars are intrinsically an existential threat to governments, they borrow money heavily, which further increases the size of the economy and draws financial assets into the markets.  There are additional effects of 100% utilization on capital markets, but I would need a lot more caffeine before I could address that question. The civil war was arguably the first industrial war  - although the war was fought with boots & bullets, the war was won with trains and industrial production. The North ultimately won because it could outproduce the South.   For sources, consult any book on macroeconomics, search on Keynes or Helicopter Ben Bernanke; you can also draw an analogy to quantitative easing. It may also be useful to consult the Parable of the Broken Window; many people believe that the economy grows as the participants replace things that were broken.  This is a fallacy. (I might argue edge cases of the fallacy, because there is some benefit from the increased efficiency of new infrastructure & the cost of brownfield vs greenfield development, but those are edge cases and would require a much longer essay.  (and I'm probably  not competent to write it; I'm only a hobby economist)). A full answer to the question would address the cause of the 1857 panic; unfortunately the 1857 panic was caused by shortfalls in the specie market and it is commonly known that I cannot discuss specie based currency without entering a irrational raging madness that causes me to froth at the mouth like a rabid dog and post page after page of furious invective of the quality usually found on conspiracy web sites.  Today I've chosen to spare us that spectacle.   @jeff asks whether the results would have been different with fiat currency vs commodity (specie) currency.  Not really; the chief difference is that fiat money facilitates a monetary policy, where commodity money restricts the ability of the government to employ a monetary policy. In either case war is an existential threat, (If the government doesn't address the war, the government ceases to exist).  In either case, the government must shift the economy to a wartime footing, and in doing so demand more from the labor and capital markets.   That increase government demand is what recovers the economy from the downturn.  The mechanics are slightly different, but the effect is the same.  Wars may cause famines, and the government may choose to address those famines; if the government does, it will continue to stimulate the economy, but the ability of the government to make such choices are constrained by the deficit spending to fund the war.  But now we're well outside the scope of OP's question."
Why did the Royal Society in 1771 believe that a continent further south than Australia should exist?,"The claim was made by Alexander Dalrymple in his book An Account of the Discoveries Made in The South Pacifick Ocean, Previous to 1764 (An ebook version is available from Google Books). Dalrymple's belief was based primarily on his translations of Spanish documents captured in the Philippines in 1762, in particular, those describing Luis Vaez de Torres' account of a voyage south of New Guinea. He supplemented the information in those translations with records of Dutch explorations.  These described sightings of land which, when plotted on a chart, convinced him that they must be parts of a massive continent in the southern latitudes. Dalrymple initially published his research in two volumes.  The first was primarily his translations of the captured Spanish records (which includes the chart), and the second contained the Dutch voyages.  Copies of these volumes can be viewed and/or downloaded as pdf files from archive.org: EDIT:  27 August 2018 Having read the comments below, I should probably make it clear that Dalrymple's claims were, almost entirely, wrong.  Indeed, even by a charitable interpretation, some were overly optimistic at best!  Nevertheless, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, they were pretty much the best 'evidence' available to the Royal Society at the time.  They also conformed to, and reinforced, a belief in Terra Australis Incognita that dated back to Aristotle. There was a long-standing antipathy between Dalrymple & Cook.  After his first voyage, it was clear that Cook was rather sceptical about the existence of Terra Australis Incognita, and in particular the claims made by Dalrymple.  Nevertheless, he remained open to the possibility that the continent remained to be discovered in Southern Latitudes. In the journal of his first voyage, he wrote: I think it would be a great pity that this thing which at times has been the object of many ages and nations should not now be wholly cleared up, which might very easily be done in one voyage without either much trouble much trouble or danger or fear for it. Captain Cook's journal during his first voyage round the world made in H.M. Bark ""Endeavour"", 1768-71 So even after Cook returned from his first voyage, Dalrymple's claims had not been disproved, and remained a tantalising possibility. Some of the sightings that Dalrymple believed to be part of the great southern continent (and plotted as such on his chart) turned out to just be islands (such as the Island of South Georgia). The South Sandwich Islands were partially explored by Cook during his second voyage. He still thought they could have been 'a point of the continent' and stated: ""That there may be a continent, or large tract of land, near the Pole, I will not deny; on the contrary, I am of the opinion there is; and it is probable that we have seen a part of it."" going on to conclude: ""The greatest part of this Southern Continent (supposing there is one) must lie within the Polar Circle where the sea is so pestered with ice that the land is thereby inaccessible. The risk one runs in exploring a coast in these unknown and icy seas, is so very great, that I can be bold to say that no man will ever venture [by sea] farther than I have done, and that the lands which may lie to the south will never be explored. Thick fogs, snowstorms, intense cold and every other thing that can render navigation dangerous one has to encounter, and these difficulties are greatly heightened by the inexpressibly horrid aspect of the country, a country doomed by nature never once to feel the warmth of the sun's rays, but to lie for ever buried under everlasting snow and ice. The natural harbours which may be on this coast are in a manner wholly filled up with frozen snow of a vast thickness, but if any should so far be open to admit a ship ... she runs the risk of being there for ever"". The three voyages of Captain James Cook round the world, Volume 4 So Dalrymple's claims were finally disproved, and Terra Australis Incognita (what we now know as Antarctica), was shown to be much smaller than most people of the day had believed.   But, of course, that is exactly why Cook's voyages were called 'voyages of exploration'."
Did Stalin believe Israel would go communist?,"It is clear that Stalin supported the creation of Israel. From the Wiki: For Soviet foreign policy decision-makers, pragmatism took precedence over ideology. Without changing its official anti-Zionist stance, from late 1944, until 1948 and even later, Joseph Stalin adopted a pro-Zionist foreign policy, apparently believing that the new country would be socialist and would accelerate the decline of British influence in the Middle East.[cite: Paul Johnson, A History of the Jews (1987) p.527] On May 17, 1948, three days after Israel declared independence, the Soviet Union legally recognized it de jure, becoming the first country to grant de jure recognition to the Jewish state..In addition to the diplomatic support, arms from Czechoslovakia, part of the Soviet bloc, were crucial to Israel in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. It's quite clear that this would NOT have happened had Stalin disagreed. As far as "" what grounds were there for Stalin believing Israel would align itself with the Soviet Union"": as the commenters noted, most of the early Zionists and founders of Israel were politically quite left and socialist-bent. I consider this fact to be too well known and trivial to bother with sites, but if you wish I'll add them. Ex: [1]. Also, at the time, British and the West in general started swinging towards being more pro-Arab due to geopolitical concerns, notably oil (Lawrence of Arabia being a good example; and British resistance to the creation of Israel despite Balfour commitments being another example). As such, Israel would be a natural counterweight for Stalin to extend his influence in Near East, the same way United States was using Israel once the geopolitical alignments reversed themselves in 1970s when Arab states became Soviet clients and Israel American one. "
What was the function of the walls of Jericho?,"The short answer (unfortunately but unsurprisingly) is that we can't be sure. However, the currently most accepted theory would appear to be that the walls were for flood control, but there are other views and there is no clear consensus. The tower, on the other hand, has been associated with the summer solstice, among other things. THE WALLS The most likely explanation would seem to be the walls were to protect the city against floods (for example, Haviland et al, 2007, in Evolution and Prehistory: The Human Challenge), whereas previously it was proposed that they had a defensive purpose (Kenyon, 1957). Steven Mithen, in After the Ice: A Global Human History, 20,000-5000 BC (2006), also lends more credence to the flood theory than the defensive one for the walls.1 This more recent interpretation is also noted by Muth et al in Ancient Fortifications: A Compendium of Theory and Practice (2016) The first known fortifications built around a settlement appear at Jericho during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A, around 8000 B.C.9 The nature of the walls is debated, however,and it has been convincingly argued that they were intended to protect the settlement against seasonal flooding.10 Evidence indicates that the military threshold for a protective wall was not crossed in the 8th millennium.11 The sources given above are: Bar-Yosef, who cites over 30 sources, concludes that Given all the available data, it seems that a plausible alternative interpretation for the Neolithic walls of Jericho is that they were built in stages as a defense system against floods and mudflows. The PPNA inhabitants of Jericho chose to live near a copious spring on a sloping plain which was subject to mudflows and sheetwash. Their response was to build a wall and then, when necessary, dig a ditch. The necessity for better protection on the western side would explain the varying thickness of the wall, which during Stages IV-VI was ca. 3.5 m in the west but remained only 1.4-1.6 m in the north and the south. The varying thickness of the walls could suggest their purpose was anti-flood rather than defensive. Also, during the later PPNB period the wall was not maintained to the same potential defensive effectiveness. Changes in the likelihood of floods seems a reasonable explanation for this. Nonetheless, whether the flash floods would have been severe enough to require such thick walls (as well as ditches to drain away the water) can only be speculated on. There are, though, dissenting views which argue that the wall was to defend against a human threat. Hamblin, while accepting that there was ""a lack of serious and sustained military threat in the early Neolithic"" says: The appearance of such massive fortifications a thousand years before fortification in other regions has led some to question their purpose, claiming the walls were designed to protect the community from flash floods out of the wadis to the west. However, it seems dubious that protection from flash floods would require such a massive four-meter-high wall – indeed the ditch alone should have proved sufficient for flood control. The stronger interpretation is that the wall and tower had a military purpose.... It is likely that the Neolithic fortress of Jericho was built in response to a very specific, local, but ongoing threat. As with the flood theory, there is much speculation here. Hamblin's inclusion of the tower doesn't make much sense given it's positioning in relation to the wall (its defensive use is limited). Others, though, have cast doubt on both the flood and defense theories. Ronen and Adler (2001) have argued that it was a defense against evil spirits (also referenced here), but this doesn't really explain the ditch. Barkai and Liran (2008), while clearly agreeing with Bar-Yosef's critique of the defense theory, do not endorse the flood theory either (though nor do they refute it, their focus being on the tower rather than the wall). Finally (concerning the wall), several sources state the above theories without clearly committing themselves to any one. Both Alan H. Simmons' The Neolithic Revolution in the Near East (2007) and The Archaeology of Syria (Akkermans & Schwartz, 2003) cite weaknesses in the defense theory, but without clearly endorsing the flood theory. THE TOWER On the tower, Bar-Yosef notes that The later history of Near Eastern fortifications seems to rule out its use as part of a fortress. but he comes to no certain conclusion as to it's purpose: The archaeological remains indicate that the tower was a special structure and perhaps held a special place within the settlement. He goes on to say that: The presence of the storage facilities attached to it in its early days may hint that it was publicly owned or at the service of the community. It is quite possible that it was also a place or a center for ritual activities. So, yes, that 'old chestnut' ritual crops up again but, in the absence of any firm evidence, this is hardly surprising. Archaeologists Ran Barkai and Roy Liran, after looking at the surrounding environment and analyzing the architectural design have concluded that the tower is in fact inherently aligned to celestial and geographical elements, and that the ancient Neolithic builders used it as a link between them, their town, and the universe. Archaeologist K. Kris Hirst, citing Barkai and Liran, writes: The stairs at the top of the tower open up facing to the east, and on what would have been midsummer solstice 10,000 years ago, the viewer could watch the sun set above Mt. Quruntul in the Judean mountains. The peak of Mount Quruntul rose 350 m (1150 ft) higher than Jericho, and it is conical in shape. Barkai and Liran (2008) have argued that the conical shape of the tower was built to mimic that of Quruntul. This Jerusalem Post article (2011), citing an interview with Barkai, adds: Barkai said architecture designed to awe and inspire, and without any obviously functional purpose, isn’t unique to the megalithic period. Even today, governments erect monuments like the Arc de Triomphe to influence public opinion and enhance their standing. 1 The page on which Mithen discusses the defensive vs. the flood theory aren't visible on Google books so here it is: Kenyon assumed that these had been constructed to defend the town from attack, a seemingly irresistible conclusion, given Jericho’s biblical associations. It wasn’t until 1986 that Ofer Bar-Yosef asked some obvious questions: who were the enemies of Jericho? Why was the wall not rebuilt after it had become buried by house debris and refuse after no more than two hundred years? Why are there no other fortified sites of the same date in western Asia? Bar-Yosef concluded that the walls had been for defense but not against an invading army – the enemy was flood water and mud-flows.7 Jericho was in perpetual danger as increased rainfall and vegetation clearance destabilized sediments on the Palestinian hills that could then be carried to the edge of the village by the nearby wadis. By the time the village rubbish had buried the walls, the level of human settlement had literally been raised up by the accumulation of collapsed houses and human debris. This had removed the threats of flood water and mud-flow. A wall was simply no longer required. Acknowledgement: Mazura for the lead provided by his comment on Barkai and Liran."
Did the Pope's crossbow and archery bans have any effect?,"Concerning the question -Did any contemporaries actually take note of the ruling? An article cited by the OP brings up a couple of possible groups which may have complied with this, The Holy Roman Empire under Conrad III and the region referred to as Flanders. So we can look at the extent of any ranged weapon bans in those locations. This source, International Encyclopedia of Military History
edited by James C. Bradford, while discussing crossbows, confirms the information that Conrad III, (Holy Roman Emperor from 1138-1152),  condemned their use in his domains. (The same source mentions that the Magna Carta in 1215 banned the use of crossbows specifically.) Conrad III is also mentioned in an article which appeared in The Nation, (in 1961), entitled 'UNILATERAL DISARMAMENT: 1139 A.D. - - by Jack Rothman',  ""So, moved by humane considerations, the Lateran Council, which
  advised the Pope on secular affairs, in 1139 declared the crossbow 'a
  weapon hateful to God.' The ban was observed unilaterally by Conrad
  III of Germany, who forbade its use in his armies for thirteen years,
  meanwhile trying to persuade other powers to do likewise. He failed,
  and by 1152 Conrad's soldiers were again using the crossbow."" So it appears that Conrad made some attempt at abiding by the Popes wishes (at least concerning the use of crossbows),but was only was able to uphold this ban for 13 years, and then resumed the use of crossbows as well. No information here concerning the inclusion or not of long bows in this , and this article,as most that I found, seems to also interpret the papal ruling as mainly directed at crossbows.   Concerning Flanders, which was another area mentioned as banning ranged weapons, this ban is brought up in the book Archery and Crossbow Guilds in Medieval Flanders, 1300-1500 By Laura Crombie.  In this text,it states: In England all men were required, from 1363, to practice archery at
  the local butts each week. In contrast, Flemish towns passed laws
  against anyone using bows or crossbows, and later guns, within their
  walls... It later mentions that shooting outside the city walls was allowed, so it seems this was not a ban on the use of these weapons in war such as canon 29 seems to indicate, but just local ordinances to make it safer in the city limits.  (The presence of archery and crossbow related guilds there would also seem to agree that military use was still allowed). So the above Flanders reference, though it did actually specifically include bows, seems to have little relation to the ban from the Second Council of the Lateran. So some sources indicate that the Holy Roman Empire under Conrad III, (who took power in 1138) did try to follow the ruling (which was in in April 1139), it was for only a limited time at best, while others (apparently everyone else) 'skirted the rules'.  Most information I find seems to be treating this as a crossbow ban, regardless of our interpretation of the actual text of the Canon. (I have seen several sources listing it as slingers and archers). I have not found any mention of an actual ban of the use of bows (beside the later Flemish cities reference).  "
Were well-connected Germans able to park their sons in Norway during WWII?,"The German high command (OKW and OKH) was never of a single mind on anything but, not being privy to the intense pressure applied by Stalin for a second front in France, many high ranking officers believed that the Western Allies would begin the re-conquest of Western Europe by invading Norway and then blocking transport of the Swedish iron ore which were almost as vital to the German war effort as the oil in Ploesti. This importance in the minds of both Hitler and the Wehrmacht can be seen by tracking number of divisions stationed in Norway over the curse of the war: So while Norway eventually ended up being a safe haven for German soldiers, this was far from a foregone conclusion while the war was in progress. With a ballpark figure of 10,000 men per division, 500,000 men would be roughly 50 divisions. That figure is out by a factor of 3 to 5 in regards to infantry and armour forces. Naval and Air forces were of course also stationed in Norway, but those were primarily offensive forces engaged in combat against the Murmansk Convoys and, to a lesser extent, the North-West approaches to the British Isles by merchant marine convoys. (The South-West approaches used so extensively during WW I, passing south of Ireland, were unusable for much of WW II because of the vulnerability to air attack from France by the Luftwaffe.)"
Why weren't pickled fruits and vegetables part of (European) rations during the Age of Sail?,"You do not need know or understand Vitamin C and scurvy to want to bring along fruits or vegetables with you. Why would you want to bring them?  Vegetables were what you ate when you couldn't get meat.  Fruit was a snack.  Neither were part of the ideal diet for a working man, back then.  What people ideally wanted to eat was meat, as much as you could get.  And conveniently, salted meat lasts better than anything else for long voyages at sea.  Flour lasts fairly well, so you had a ship's baker to keep you supplied with bread for filling.  Apples (if you select the right type) also store well, so they were stocked too.  Dried beans would also be a possibility.  You wouldn't have a great deal of variation in diet on long journeys though. You also need to consider the nations involved in long ocean voyages.  The major nations in this were the British, French, Spanish and Portugese.  Whilst all of them knew about how to pickle vegetables, it's probably fair to say that they don't form a major traditional part of the diet of any of the countries.  Pickled vegetables certainly aren't well-loved staples in the way that sauerkraut or kimchi are in their respective countries. Wanting to eat pickled vegetables on a voyage would have been an extreme dietary oddity, which could only be exercised by a captain.  Since most British captains shared the appetites of the day, that meant meat and more meat.  Cook was considered an oddball for his experiment with sauerkraut - and of course a genius afterwards."
Were there occasions when a sovereign country voluntarily joined another country?,"[Re-edited to include various suggestions from comments and other answers] We can divide the answer into two sections, the first of which addresses the general question of voluntary mergers between sovereign countries which create new countries, and the second the more specific question sovereign countries voluntarily becoming subsets (states, provinces, protectorates, etc.) of other countries. There are a number of examples. This Wikipedia page has a decent list of proposed unions (successful and not).  Eliminating the cases of coercion and conquest and also the failed or short-term cases, there are, at a minimum: I'm excluding the various unions of different territories as a result of dynastic marriages that took place prior to the modern era in many parts of the world, on the grounds that it's hard to consider most of those marriages ""voluntary"". One possible case is the personal union of Castile and Aragon via the marriage of Isabella and Ferdinand, since this was a secretly conducted voluntary marriage (they basically eloped!) between heirs who became rulers of their respective kingdoms. There were also various sorts of pre-modern leagues and associations, the most enduring of is probably the Swiss Confederation (which eventually became a recognized country in its own right). It's a bit hard to know how to classify some of these, since the ""sovereignty"" of the various constituents was often ambiguous. (As a relatively recent example, the Swiss canton of Neuchâtel was technically ruled by the King of Prussia up until the 1848 revolutions, and he didn't give up his claims until 1857.) This involves cases where one country decides to joins a second country as one or more states, provinces, protectorates, etc. of the latter. A non-exhaustive list: There are other events which, on the face of it, involved a sovereign state joining another state, but these tend to involve temporary or puppet regimes of one kind or another which make the ""voluntary"" part rather dubious (e.g., the annexation of Hawaii by the US; the annexation of Tannu Tuva by the Soviet Union). (I'm also not counting cases of non-sovereign states where the electorate chose union with another state after being ruled by a third country, without ever first really being at least nominally sovereign, such as Saarland and Hatay.)"
"What is the source of quote attributed to W.E.B. Du Bois: ""When you have mastered numbers...""","Good editor. I wouldn't have thought to challenge that, but its true that numbers weren't exactly Du Bois' thing. Not saying he wasn't good with them, just that isn't what he's famous for, or spent most of his time dealing with. In fact, the actual source of that quote appears to be Harold Geneen, an accountant by training who retired as CEO of ITT. Wikiquote sources this statement from his book Managing, Chapter Nine (The Numbers), p. 151. When you have mastered the numbers, you will in fact no longer be
  reading numbers, any more than you read words when reading a book. You
  will be reading meanings. There are a lot of misattributed quotes floating around. As a protip, in the future when you find a good quote, Wikiquote is a good first place to double-check. I've seen it be wrong too, but the nice thing about it is that wrong things can get fixed there, whereas a lot of places will just leave wrong things up forever. Often it will even go so far as to list misattributed quotes."
What was the point of horse armour?,"I would contend that we tend to overestimate the effectiveness of bows vs armour, and that the armour would likely prevent at least some percentage of the damage to the mount. If we look at the wiki article on Barding we find the following (emphasis mine): During the Late Middle Ages as armour protection for knights became
  more effective, their mounts became targets. This vulnerability was
  exploited by the Scots at the Battle of Bannockburn in the 14th
  century, when horses were killed by the infantry, and for the English
  at the Battle of Crécy in the same century where longbowmen shot
  horses and the then dismounted French knights were killed by heavy
  infantry. Barding developed as a response to such events. So why would you develop and build something, unless it worked? I have watched a video,  ARROWS vs ARMOUR - Medieval Myth Busting
, showing a bit of experimental archaeology which investigates the issue of bows vs armour. Though I would normally cringe to use a YouTube video as a source, I feel this one is extremely well done, has measured the physics involved, goes to lengths to try to simulate period weapons and armours, and Tobias Capwell, curator of Arms and Armour at the Wallace Collection in London is present to oversee the process.  This above-mentioned video, though it is concerning human armour and not horse barding, does use energies and armour thicknesses which fall into the range you mention, so the physics should be similar. The archer is shooting 160lb, 80g arrows, which are developing 123J of energy at 10m, and down to 109J (about 80 ft-lbs) at the testing range of 25m. Similar to the (unsourced) energy from the OP's question.  The armour being shot at, in order to simulate examined museum specimens, varies from 1.5mm to 2.5mm in thickness. Again similar range to the numbers quoted in the question. Information we can draw from the video is that arrows which hit head on may dent, but not penetrate (very reminiscent as to how modern body armor works). Most arrows break, and any that hit slightly obliquely, or in the more curved regions,  ricochet away. This deflection may be of primary importance with a horse, keeping raking shots which might tear at the animals flanks from doing any damage, and deflecting away at least a percentage of the shots finding a target. Note that one of only three complete sets of equestrian armour is found in the same above mentioned Wallace Collection, a beautiful set of German armor, dated to about 1480:  We can draw some information from the Wallace Collection exhibit as well. In looking at the information from the exhibit we find weights listed concerning the armor: 27.161kg (man's armour); 30.07kg (horse's armour); 10.17kg (mail) (About 150lbs) From this we can see that the plate mail barding was expected to be worn in conjunction with chainmail protection as well. The chainmail can deal with slashing damage when engaged close-up. We can also observe the plate portion of the barding was mainly applied in curving sweeps along the breast, the top of the neck, and the upper region of the horses hind quarters. These are exactly the regions you might expect to receive fire from, during either an overhead barrage of arrows, or directly from the front during a charge. One more note concerning the Wallace Collection armour, comes from the description on this page where it defines this armor as  ‘field’ armour (i.e. armour for war) This set of armor was field armour, it was made for war, not for parades or tournaments. So in conclusion, if we can compare the bit of experimental archaeology can be applied to your barding question, it would seem that barding would provide at least some protection from archers. The curved metal surfaces would deflect many indirect strikes, decreasing the amount of damage possibly taken by the horse. The physics tested out in the video indicate the possibility that even direct shots might not have been able to penetrate, further reducing the chance of the horse being brought down. Every arrow deflected or stopped increased your odds off reaching the battle. Statistically it increased the number of knights delivered to the fight.  That was the point of horse armour. Increased survivability."
"What happened in Rome, when the western empire ""fell""?","By 476 the city of Rome had not been the center of the Empire for a long while. Diocletian, picking up the pieces after the crisis of the third century, made a point of snubbing Rome compared to the ""actual"" imperial capitals, which he considered more important. Moreover the sackings Rome experienced in the fifth century certainly depleted its riches and resources. From the Cambridge Ancient History, vol. 14, page 378: Despite considerable imperial and Ostrogothic attempts to
  sustain it, Rome gradually shrank through the fifth and sixth century to a tiny
  proportion of its former size; not only was there no longer the government
  money to sustain it, but it also inevitably lost out from the shrinking overseas
  holdings of its senatorial aristocracy. Doubtless the Roman Senate still sitting in Rome (now no more than an anachronistic relic) was the theater of some speeches, but the historians of the time deemed them of so little consequence that they don't even mention them. But even beyond Rome, in the imperial capital of Ravenna, and all the other lands nominally under the suzerainty of the west Roman empire, the news would have been of little consequence. This passage of the Cambridge Ancient History (vol. 14 page 25) is illuminating: Since the empire’s financial base was simultaneously decreasing, the idea of
  empire quickly became meaningless. The centre no longer controlled anything anyone wanted. In consequence, the late 460s and 470s saw one group
  after another coming to the realization that the western empire was no longer
  a prize worth fighting for. It must have been an extraordinary moment as the
  realization dawned on the leaders of individual interest groups, and upon
  members of local Roman landowning élites, that, after hundreds of years of
  existence, the Roman state in western Europe was now an anachronism. and ibid., page 27 A subordinate commander, Odoacer, organized a putsch, murdered Orestes, and deposed Romulus, derisively titled Augustulus, on or around 4 September 476. He then sent
  an embassy to Constantinople which did no more than state the obvious. There was no longer any need for an emperor in the west. Also, from Christopher Wickam The Inheritance of Rome (a book on Early Medieval Europe that I heartily recommend to those interested in that neglected period) Italy is actually the region of the western empire which lived through least change in the 470s, for Odovacer ruled much as Ricimer had, at the head of a regular army. Italy did not experience an invasion and conquest until 489–93, with the arrival of Theoderic the Amal and his Ostrogoths, and Theoderic (489–526) ruled in as Roman a way as possible, too. In addition to what I wrote, the ""fall of the Western Empire"" is a bit of a misnomer. It was not, at the time, perceived as a change in political order: all the lands formerly in the Roman Empire were still under the nominal authority of the Emperor in Constantinople. The West versus East division was, at least on paper, only an administrative one, and the two Emperors had theoretically been coequal heads of state, with the same authority on every component piece. The situation on the ground was very much different, but Odoacer mantained the polite fiction of being the ""viceroy"" of the Emperor in Italy and even recognized and minted coins in the name of Julius Nepos, the nominal new Western emperor. The loss of authority of the Roman Empire over what were formerly its Western lands was a slow and gradual process, and while 476 is a convenient date (the last year in which a sitting emperor resided in the Italian peninsula), it's quite arbitrary. Other dates that could be reasonably advanced for the loss of imperial control of Italy  are 572, when most of Italy was conquered by the Lombards, a power that did not recognize even the nominal suzerainty of the Emperor, or 751 with the fall of the Exarchate of Ravenna, or even 1130, when the Empire lost its last Italian possessions in Southern Italy[1]. The date of 476 is convenient to write on school exams, but its significance shouldn't be overstated. [1] Personal note: If I were asked to chose one date for the end of the Western Roman Empire, gun to the head, I'd lean towards 751 because the fall of the Exarchate had all kind of consequences (most importantly the Pope deciding to throw his support behind the Frankish Carolingians), while 476 was not even the last time that the whole of Italy was under direct Imperial control (that'd be 572)."
What language(s) were spoken within the Holy Roman Empire?,"The Holy Roman Empire (of the German Nation) was a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, and multi-lingual coalition from its (unofficial) founding by Charlemagne in the 9th century AD. The German Empire would be a better term in fact, as it was founded and typically ruled by Germanic peoples. (Charlemagne himself was a Frank.) As Voltaire once perceptively quipped, the Holy Roman Empire was ""neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire"". (Essai sur l'histoire générale et sur les mœurs et l'esprit des nations, Chapter 70) Given that the boundaries of the empire were constantly changing over its almost thousand-year history (and were rarely if ever officially defined), the cultures and languages subsumed were constantly in flux too. Undoubtedly, German (or the predominant dialect thereof) was the de-facto official language. Latin was also for official matters of state/ceremonies, especially during the Medieval period, given this more modern empire's desire to ape the glory of Ancient Rome, not to mention the ubiquity of the Church in Medieval life. A map of the Holy Roman territories circa 1600 hints well at what languages were commonly spoken by the populace in various regions.  These would have included the following: Standard German and regional West Germanic languages – in modern Germany and adjacent regions Note that ""Lower German"" dialects (e.g. Low Saxon/Low Franconian) were commonly spoken in Northern Germany whereas ""Upper German"" dialects (e.g. Bavarian) were commonly spoken in Southern Germany/Austria/far north of Italy. Dutch / Flemish – in modern Netherlands/Belgium French (and other Gallic languages/Langues d'oil) – in modern France, Belgium, Switzerland, and the oft-disputed regions of Alsace and Lorraine Italian (and its northern regional dialects) (e.g. Venetian, Genoese) – in Italy and elsewhere as a language of culture Czech – in modern day Czech Republic (ancient Bohemia and Moravia) Polish – in modern day Poland and surrounding areas Undoubtedly I have missed out a few, but the above list should cover the predominant languages within the (stable) boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire, noting where appropiate the diversity of dialects of some languages that was extremely prevalent during the medieval and early modern periods of history. Medieval Latin (an evolution of the Classical Latin of Ancient Rome) was indeed the official language of the Holy Roman Empire for most of its history. It was in fact only changed to Standard German during the reign of Joseph II (late 18th century.) What is interesting to note, especially in the High Medieval period where the Holy Roman Empire encompassed much land and many cultures, is that Medieval Latin was the only common language between the educated (especially ecclesiastical) folk in all of its member states. It was perhaps the second great period in which Latin was the ""Lingua Franca"" of its day, supplanted by Standard German (even in regions such as Slavic Bohemia) by the Early Modern period.

At what point was the Byzantine Empire's decline irreversible?,"The Fourth Crusade was the turning point.  The crusade was high-jacked by Venice to take revenge on the Byzantines for past deeds: imprisonments, break of contract, etc... The crusade was aimed to land in Egypt originally, as it was seen as the main threat to taking Jerusalem back.  However, since the crusaders could not pay for the large Venetian fleet, it was arranged that they would do a few missions for Venice first.  Not all crusaders agreed, but the majority saw no choice.  Even the Pope was unhappy with this state of affairs. So, once Venice took control of Constantinople, a series of civil wars and coup happened. This weakened Byzantium to the point where it could not recover.  From there on, it was just a matter of time before another power took control. As a side note, the Byzantine fleet was in great part responsible for the might of the empire.  Once the Empire gave this to Venice to build and use, it was just a matter of time before the fleet degraded beyond the local ability to rebuild it.  An example of why out-sourcing is bad.

Normandy: Why did the landing craft open on the front?,"They still do it that way:  LCU Replacement in Preliminary Design, Anticipating 2022 Fleet Debut If the beaches are heavily defended, the Navy is supposed to bombard them prior to the landing.  Occasionally the military and naval planners have been known to make deadly mistakes. As pointed out in the comments, the debouching troops and equipment hit the beach much more quickly when going out the front.  If there is too much fire from that direction, they may leave the ""door"" shut, and may go over the protected side.  But this slows down the process, and reduces the equipment load. Amphibious warfare provides a list of amphibious operations for modern wars.  My father came ashore this way at Anzio.

"Did a kamikaze ever impact the hull of a ship, as opposed to the deck?","Also, correct me if I'm wrong but the heavy AA guns appear like they can't point down over the deck. They can only point upwards or parallel to the surface, but not down at the surface. This assumption is wrong.  The US Mark 12 5""/38 caliber dual purpose (surface and aircraft) mount was the primary heavy AA armament facing kamikazes.  It was mounted on nearly every US warship.  It had a maximum elevation of 85° and could depress 15°. Even before kamikaze attacks or flying below radar, torpedo bombers had to attack at very low altitude and would often approach even lower to avoid detection only popping up to aim and release their torpedoes.  Torpedo bombers were a huge threat and naval AA defenses were prepared to deal with them. What I want to know is, did any kamikaze ever impact the side or hull of a ship? Yes.  This account of all ships sunk by kamikazes provides several examples. Hovey (minesweeper) on Jan. 7, 1945 - The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships gives the following account: ""At 0450, one plane flying low to the water came in from the starboard quarter passing ahead of Hovey. A few moments later another plane coming from the port beam was put on fire by Chandler. This plane passed very low over Hovey and crashed on the starboard beam. U.S. freighter Augustus Thomas, anchored in San Pedro Bay, Leyte, is attacked by a Japanese plane. The ship's Armed Guard gunfire sets the aircraft ablaze but the kamikaze presses home his attack, a wing striking the stack of the nearby tug Sonoma (ATO-12) before it crashes the freighter's starboard side. I'm sure if you poke around you can find plenty more. There is plenty of footage of kamikaze attacks available to watch.  Many attack from a dive, but many attack level or in a shallow dive.  What I take away from it is the pilots are lucky to hit the ship at all, precision isn't possible for barely trained pilots under intense fire. It seems like that would sink the thing much faster. There's two things to address here.  First, the deck of a ship is far more vulnerable.  Second, and here I'm getting into informed speculation a bit, a diving attack has a much higher chance of reaching the target. Why hit the deck and not the hull?  The major problem is that a kamikaze flies above the water, not under it like a torpedo.  It will hit above the waterline so the hole isn't going to flood.  That said, you could get lucky... USS Wake Island CVE-65
3 April 1945:  At 1744, a Japanese single-engine plane missed the port forward corner of the flight deck, exploding in the water abreast the forecastle.  Thirty seconds later, a second single-engine plane narrowly missed the bridge structure and struck the water about 10 feet from the hull.  This plane exploded after impact, ripping a hole in the ship's side below the waterline, about 45 feet long and about 18 feet from top to bottom and as well as causing many shrapnel holes. Then there's the problem of penetrating the heavy hull armor. On July 26th, 1945 the County class heavy cruiser HMS Sussex was struck by an aircraft. Here's the result.  Source: Australian War Museum Aircraft are designed to be light, it crumpled against the armor. It either lacked a bomb, or was a dud. HMS Sussex's belt armor isn't particularly thick, though it would be thicker than most smaller warships or any merchant ship. Finally, there's the real sailor's fear: fire. Battleship and heavy cruiser hulls were designed to withstand large caliber armor piercing shells usually as large as their own guns.  The USS Iowa had over a foot of armor designed to stop a 16 inch armor piercing shell weighing 2500 lbs moving at 1000 mph.  In contrast, it's deck was ""only"" 7.5"".  This was done to save weight.  The trade off was considered acceptable as long range plunging fire and aircraft bombs had less penetrating power. Most other armored ships followed the same pattern, more armor on the sides, less on the decks.  USS Hornet had 2.5 to 4"" of belt armor, but only 1.5"" protecting her hanger deck. Light cruisers and destroyers were often thinly armored and were vulnerable.  They weren't valuable targets in and of themselves, but they would form the picket line of anti-aircraft defenses up to 80km away from the fleet.  As such, they were a target to roll back a fleet's AA defenses.  As testified by this list of all ships lost by the US Navy and Coast Guard, destroyers got hit hard. A kamikaze will do some damage just from the impact, shrapnel, and spewing aviation gas around, but it's superficial.  A kamikaze normally carried a small 250 or 500kg bomb.  For the bomb to be effective, it has to penetrate the armor and explode inside the ship, else the explosion will reflect off the armor and go (mostly) harmlessly out to sea.  Aircraft are very frail things.  In order to penetrate they need to maximize their speed and minimize their armor.  This means a dive against the thinner deck armor. Once they crash through that deck armor there's nothing to stop that 500kg bomb.  It plunges through unarmored decks and eventually explodes somewhere deep in the bowels of the ship causing damage.  Worse, there are a lot of things on a WWII US Navy ship that burn really well.  Fuel, ammunition, rags, oil, paint, wood, rubber... it's this fire that has the potential to do damage well beyond what a relatively small bomb can do.  A raging fire can put a ship out of action for months.  That's exactly what the Japanese hoped to do, severely damage ships so they would have to be sent back across the Pacific for extensive, lengthy repairs. I consider this section to be speculation based on what I know about WWII anti-aircraft tactics. There's a number of problems with a kamikaze attacking a ship from the side which makes the attack less likely to succeed.  First is speed.  An aircraft in a dive will go much faster than one flying level.  The faster you're going, the harder you are to hit.  It also gives the enemy less time to react and you spend less time under the considerable fire a US fleet could pour out. Next is to consider the enemy's numerous fighter cover.  In air combat, altitude is life.  Altitude can be converted to speed.  Prowling fighters will be patrolling at high altitude waiting to dive and pounce on incoming attackers, gaining speed in the dive.  A low flying kamikaze would be easy prey.  A high flying and diving one means the fighters cannot gain a speed advantage by diving. Then consider what happens when your plane inevitably gets shot up.  If you're flying low, you crash.  If you're flying high in a dive, you continue diving.  If the pilot has any control, they might hit the target.  Even if the pilot dies, the plane may still impact the target.  This was a major problem for AA guns in WWII.  Previously it was sufficient to disable the fragile pilot, engine or controls.  Now even a very heavily damaged aircraft is a danger.  Weight and volume of AA firepower had to increase as well as accuracy. Flying low over the ocean in a WWII fighter while under fire is a surprisingly difficult task, one that many poorly trained kamikaze pilots would not be able to accomplish.  Flying low wouldn't get you under AA, but it might get you under radar or difficult to spot in the haze.  Poorly trained pilots were likely to crash into the ocean, get hit by a wave, or fly too high and be detected. Finally, hitting the side of a ship is surprisingly difficult, especially for a poorly trained pilot under intense fire in a probably damaged aircraft with surface guts of wind blowing them around.  As huge as WWII ships seem, there wasn't much hull sticking above the waterline.  In trying to hit that narrow target you're likely to hit the ocean, fly over the top, or glance off the deck.  In contrast diving on a ship is easier, keep your nose pointed at the target and let gravity do the rest.  This is part of why dive bombing was so effective. That said, most kamikaze pilots were so poorly trained they were only able to conduct a slow, shallow, very vulnerable diving attack."
"Why did only the English adopt, evolve and use the longbow en masse in war?","According to Donald Featherstone's ""The Bowmen of England"" the longbow probably did arrive in England from Wales. It is impossible to trace the actual origin of the longbow, but there is good evidence that it was in use in South Wales during the second half of the twelfth century. Giraldus Cambrensis speaks repeatedly of the men of Gwent and Morganwg as excelling all others in the practice of archery. It goes on... Describing the bows of Gwent, [Geraldus] says:'They are made neither of horn, ash nor yew but of elm; ugly, unfinished looking weapons, but astonishingly stiff, large and strong, and equally capable of use for long or short shooting.'
 These were the bows, in the hands of the South Welsh bowmen, which were used in the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1171. The Normans had learned the power of the Welsh bows and dreaded them; As noted in the question, it was the subsequent English Kings who recognised the power of the longbow; With plans in mind for the Welsh longbow, Edward I confirmed Henry's Assize of Arms[1] by the Statute of Winchester, making practice compulsory on Sundays and Holydays...Other games, such as football, handball and cockfighting were made illegal; direction of labour was introduced so that bowyers and fletchers could be compelled to reside where they were most needed, and there were many acts regulating the price of equipment. [1]King Henry III's Assize of Arms, 1251. It was also Edward's skill as a soldier, with his understanding of the science of war, that allowed him to see how the longbow could be a vital weapon on the battlefield by combining his bowmen with dismounted knights and men-at-arms. ...now [Edward] learned that a cavalry attack could be weakened, almost to annihilation, by volleys of archers.
 Such knowledge, at a time when cavalry held absolute supremacy in war, was a secret of unfathomable value; a secret indeed which laid the foundations of England's very military power. What advantage was there to the longbow? The longbow is about the simplest piece of mechanism imaginable, consisting of only a bowstave and string; it possessed three distinct advantages in that it was cheap to produce, had a fairly extensive range and provided rapidity of discharge. Such an elementary weapon was eminently suitable for use by peasant militia, for it had no complications of mechanism and no professional skill was needed. So it was easy to manufacture and everyone knew how to use it. The difference was that the English recognised its potential and, thanks to repeated practice, could produce archers bending bows of far greater power than their opponents could manage."
Were there any drunk driving laws before the automobile?,"In the UK, the 1872 Licencing Act made it an offence to be: ... drunk while in charge on any highway or other public place of any
  carriage, horse, cattle, or steam engine, or who is drunk when in
  possession of any loaded firearms, ... I understand that parts of that Act remain in force."
Did Heisenberg undermine the German atomic bomb by deliberately hiding his expertise from the Nazis?,"The argument for Heisenberg being intentionally incompetent is that he made two ""incorrect"" choices in which path to follow. He selected heavy water as the reactor moderator, even though it is very unusual and requires a big plant to make it.  He selected plutonium as the fissile material, even though it doesn't occur in nature and have to be created in nuclear piles. The argument is that Heisenberg, being a highly intelligent man, would not have made those mistakes, and that he therefore intentionally made those choices to delay or stop Germany from getting the bomb. However, this ignores that Heisenberg was a scientist, not an industrialist. I think Heisenberg simply chose the options he thought had the greatest chance of succeeding. He didn't think uranium was a good candidate for a chain reaction, and that it would be easier to make a bomb out of plutonium. He also thought it would be easier to create a nuclear pile if it was moderated by heavy water. He was definitely correct about the heavy water. Making a heavy water reactor is easier than a graphite or ordinary water reactor, and in addition, a heavy water reactor can work with non-enriched uranium. This means that although you need facilities to create heavy water, you don't need facilities to enrich the uranium, to some extent compensating for the need of heavy water. And it's hard to claim that he was wrong with regards to plutonium. He rather was ""too correct"". The Manhattan project decided to pursue both plutonium and uranium bombs, and during the development of those bombs they had to come up with a more complex bomb design for the plutonium bomb, because plutonium turned out to be so reactive that it would probably explode to early in the process, making it likely to ""Fizzle"" if it had been used with the original simpler design, while the simple design could be retained for the uranium bomb. So I think he rather chose the options that was the easiest for him. The ""safe bet"", so to speak. He probably either underestimated the time and effort required in creating enough heavy water and then enough plutonium to build a bomb, or he didn't make his choices with regards to the time frame at all, but based them entirely on what he thought would be easiest, as opposed to what would be quickest."
Why did the United Kingdom industrialize first?,"Several historians/economists hold several factors responsible. I know two works that discuss this in great depth:  Personally, I believe the following factors played a crucial role: Wars: Britain's isolation from continental Europe meant that Britain was relatively more peaceful than the rest of the Europe. It was difficult to invade. In the 16th century, England had thwarted a Spanish naval invasion and brought attention to the need to have a strong navy. Later monarchs invested a lot in naval technology and better ships. Not only this navy became a strong deterrent to an invasion, it also went on to protect merchant interests at sea. By the late 18th century, when most European countries were being plundered (the Napoleonic wars), Britain emerged with a naval superiority and a large protected merchant vassal fleet. Markets: British merchants also had a sizeable market (in form of their first colonies). With a small labour supply at home, there was a strong incentive to automate as much manual tasks as possible. This started with textiles but then later moved onto other sectors as well. Legal framework foundation: England's legal system also played a tremendous role here. Various laws that formalised the patent process introduced strong incentives. Religious freedom that followed Elizabeth I's rule also encouraged scientific/engineering revolution. Many modern day laws that protect corporations (such as those on taxation, property, ownership etc.) were passed during the early 18th century in the English parliament. Overall, England (and later Britain) became a good place to do business. For a more detailed account of how British legal system played a part in the industrial revolution please read Julian Hoppit's paper. Scientific Discoveries: This is more of a follow on from the three I mentioned above but with enough wealth in hands and laws to protect intellectual rights, English engineers and scholars went on to create the first machines that revolutionised industry for the first time. The textile mill, steam engine, locomotives, steam ships etc. are all examples of such scientific discoveries. You have to bear in mind that all these factors (and several other small ones) were all needed together. Many European countries had a few of them and they followed the suite when they achieved/got the rest. Also, for many of them a slight difference in factors can be seen (for example, Germany's market was mainly domestic and towards the East --not its colonies).  England had already undergone the first industrial revolution by the time the steam engine was invented. Other European countries were quick to follow."
What led to the first fight in the American Civil War?,"After President Lincoln's election on the 6th of November 1860, the eleven Confederate states did not secede immediately. South Carolina, and then the remaining six states of the lower south (Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas) seceded from the Union between the 20th of November and 1st of February 1861, leaving Arkansas, Tennessee, Virginia and North Carolina still loyal to the Union.  Unionists from those northern slave states made it clear that they would remain loyal so long as the incoming Lincoln administration guaranteed the safety of slavery in states where it already existed, but more ominously employed no 'coercion' against the seceded states. Fort Sumter, a strategically important military installation in Charleston  harbour, became the focal point for that question of 'coercion'.  During his inaugural address Lincoln, cognisant of the fragile loyalty of northern slave states, hoped to place responsibility for the start of hostilities on the newly elected Confederate president Jefferson Davis. He stated that the United States intended to: hold, occupy, and possess the property, and places belonging to the government, and to collect the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion - no using of force against, or among the people anywhere. . . . You can have no conflict, without yourselves being the aggressors. This statement was deliberately vague about what 'occupy and possess' meant, since the Confederate states had long since seized almost all federal buildings in the south.  Lincoln hoped that Unionist sentiment would reassert itself in the south before this question was tested with force. Time ran out in April 1861 as supplies for the federal garrison at Fort Sumter began to dwindle. In March, having been informed by Major Anderson (the fort's commander) that supplies were running low, decided to send an unarmed transport to resupply the fort. Lincoln hoped that if Confederates around Charleston harbour fired on the ship, then the north would appear as the injured party. Jefferson Davis decided to the pre-empt the arrival of the ship and ordered a request for the fort's surrender be sent before it arrived. Anderson refused to capitulate and at 4:30 am on the 12th of April southern guns opened fire. Thirty six hours later, Anderson and his garrison surrendered and the following day Lincoln declared a state of insurrection and called out 75,000 militia from the northern states. This call galvanised sentiment in the south and between the 17th of April and the 20th of May, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina and Tennessee all seceded. The addition of these states provided nearly 40% of the troops to Confederate armies and guaranteed a long and bloody conflict. Quotes and references from: Gary W.

Has there been a naval battle where a boarding attempt backfired?,"The most famous example of this would be Blackbeard's defeat. The Wikipedia article is quite thorough, so I'll focus on the last battle. The local governor organized a pirate hunt to capture or kill Blackbeard after he started pirating again (Blackbeard was pardoned shortly before). Two sloops found Blackbeard's vessel anchored at Ocracoke island. The whole situation was quite fortuitous for the hunters. Blackbeard didn't post a sentry, so didn't notice the enemy until they engaged and more than half his crew was at Bath (a town on the mainland, around 120km from the island). The three vessels engaged in combat next morning. The account of what happened in the naval battle is a bit muddied. A broadside from Blackbeard's vessel heavily damaged and killed nearly 20 men on Maynard's ship and completely disabled its compatriot. Meanwhile Blackbeard ran aground on a sandbank, also taking heavy damage, it's unclear whether damage done by the British sloops caused this. Blackbeard then decided to board Maynard's vessel. Maynard kept most of his men below deck, so Blackbeard was lulled into a false sense of security seeing the many dead on deck and not expecting to see much resistance. After boarding, the pirates were surprised by Maynards men storming from below deck and while the pirates were able to inflict quite a few casualties, they were outnumbered. Eventually Blackbeard was surrounded and cut down after which the remaining pirates surrendered."
How common were marital duels in medieval Europe?,"Not that common. Very curiously, we do not see husband and wife, necessarily, in these pictures. Talhoffer only writes of man (""er"") and woman (""frow""). (More illustrations, with original transcription and with modern German translation.) While it may seem 'obvious' that this would perhaps also apply to 'marital affairs' this is only made somewhat more plausible by the fact the in such a situation any woman could ask some male to stand in for her, usually her husband, as a Champione or Kämpe. Then it was possible for the female to 'just do it' herself, or being forced to do it, as either no-one stepped up, or the husband itself was 'the problem'. This is evidenced in Bavarian law were the Weregild was set to be for a woman assessed as 'half the amount compared to for a man — unless she decided to be brave and a face such duel herself in person, in which case the Wergeld would be of equal amount'. (Cf Meyer1873) In religious views this old Germanic tradition of Trial by Combat was in Christian terms interpreted as God being generally part of the entire process and thus more or less 'ensuring' that the innocent won, the righteous prevailed, the truth-teller survived, and so on. In judicial terms, the general occurrence of such trials was limited to situations over major crimes where no direct evidence was available. Direct evidence was usually required, even if just in the form of two witnesses, to reach a verdict. This brings us back to the probably most commonly thought-of case for the above constellation: if a woman survived a rape, no-one heard her cries for help or saw the act, and later she accused a man of the deed, but instead of confessing he swears to be innocent, then a trial by combat may have been ordered by the judge. Such kinds of trials, by combat, must be older than high medieval times, as they are already mentioned in the Sachsenspiegels recording customary laws and practices, written after 1200. But the oldest concrete example casuistic law of such a conflict as it played out as Talhoffer depicted it between a man and a woman seems to be recorded in Augsburg 1276: 'If a man is accused by a woman that he has raped her, no-one saw or heard the act, and the man swears to innocent, then she was even required to face a fight ""mit ir selbes libe"" (with her own body: no champione allowed)'. Whoever lost this confrontation was then either dead or was then buried alive (Meyer1873). Such practices were going a bit out of fashion for determining the truth in later medieval times, as the modern invention of torture took over for that. And while 'the church' initially had a positive view on these 'judgements by God', but already in 1215 the IV Lateran Council decreed: Canon 18: Clerics may neither pronounce nor execute a sentence of death. Nor may they act as judges in extreme criminal cases, or take part in matters connected with judicial tests and ordeals. This last prohibition, since it removed the one thing that gave the ordeal its value, the ecclesiastical authority, was the beginning of the end of trial by ordeal. In the medieval literature this is all a very complicated back and forth between proponents and opponents of ordeals in general, with for example the Langobard king Liutprand (712–744) already lamenting that such practices are deeply irrational and not very Christian, as did likewise pope Nicolaus I (858–867) — while there were of course equally fervent fans of the practices. (Israel2016) What can be generalized is that this trial by combat swiftly became ever more restricted to major offenses, like murder, betrayal, and rape. It was certainly not a common 'form of divorce'. One such prominent case for a divorce involving an ordeal was that of Theutberga, who was ordered to one such ordeal — non-combat: Kesselfang (~hot water) — but she found a replacement to do it for her. In any case, that very divorce procedure took a while longer than a swift whack on a head… The Talhoffer book is being often regarded as something like 'among last evidence' for an outgoing practice, the last such duel recorded in Brussels in 1511 (according to  — Walther Kabel: ""Zweikämpfe zwischen Mann und Weib"", Bibliothek der Unterhaltung und des Wissens, 1911, Vol 3, p208–210).
And to top it off: this was generally disputed to have ever taken place, at all, by many later historians. But for example from 1288 Bern we know of such an occurrence, not only provisioned for in laws, but reported in the chronicles: Daz ein frowe und ein man sament kampften.
Do man zalt MCCLXXXVIII jar an dem achtenden tag der kindelinen tag, beschach ein kampf an der matten an der stat,
do nu des kilchofs mure stat; und kampften ein frowe und ein
man mit einander, und lag die frowe ob. – G Studer: ""Berner Chronik des Conrad Justinger"", K. -J. Wyss: Bern, 1871. (p29. PDF) ""on a meadow between a wall and the church yard a woman and man have fought on the eighth day after Christmas. the woman won"" This one case is perhaps the very same, and overall relatively rare, occasion that is depicted rather late and equally fanciful in the Spiezer Chronik:  — Bern, Burgerbibliothek / Mss.h.h.I.16 – Diebold Schilling, Spiezer Chronik / p. 112, 1484/85. doi Concluding from analyzing the very oldest surviving medieval fencing manual: Although the literary texts certainly do offer examples of sword and buckler combat as a form of training and/or entertainment, it seems most unlikely that the individuals depicted in MS I.33, particularly Walpurgis [a clearly female swordsmanship apprentice, LLC], would be involved in physical training of this kind for simple amusement, or for show, given the absence of literary depictions of women actively engaged in combat. On this point, I disagree with Forgeng: ‘German evidence makes it clear that women did at times take part in judicial combat, but the apparently ludic context of the present text suggests that for some it could also have been a pastime.’ The near-total lack of any depiction of women taking part in combat in medieval German or French literary texts is, I consider, highly significant. […]  Given that there is evidence that some women also took part in judicial combats, however rarely, it seems plausible that the system depicted in MS I.33 was intended to prepare individuals during their lertag before undergoing a judicial duel. — Rachel E. Kellett: ""Royal Armouries Ms I.33: The Judicial Combat and the Art of Fencing in Thirteenth- and Fourteenth- Century German Literature"", Oxford German Studies: 41. 1, 32–56, April 2012. doi So, how ""common"" was such a marital & judicial duel with weapons? Compared to today's divorce rates, medieval divorce was certainly a much rarer phenomenon over all. 'With weapons' it should be exceedingly rare. 'Divorce by club as common method of divorce' certainly is an exaggeration. But a man — possibly in a pit or otherwise handicapped – fighting a woman, in judicial trial by combat, was definitely a possibility, at least envisioned as 'common enough' to be regulated en detail in laws, but then rare enough so that we only get few real examples to list. To counter the misleading exaggeration on this on 'social' media, one might turn this ideation on its feet with slightly less hyperbole, that all these regulations on ordeals were not intended to correctly perform all these many physical arguments that took place, but ritualize them into slowness to ideally prevent them from happening at all possible stages: The judicial duel thus appears to be a strictly regulated and highly ritualised phenomenon, from the filing of the suit to its end, whose slowness could force those willing to fight to reflect and, ideally, to give in. Those who offered or accepted a duel did not act spontaneously, but had to consider their decision carefully with regard to its possible deterrent consequences for themselves and others, and test its proportionality against the possible alternatives for an amicable settlement of the conflict. The aim of the established rules is, exaggeratedly formulated, not the implementation but the avoidance of the judicial duel. Nevertheless, the demonstration of readiness to fight seems to have been indispensable as proof of the legitimacy of one's own claim or also as evidence of one's own bravery.

How did people put down a drinking horn?,"In short, either when it was empty or it had a stand. Drinking horns were used by many different cultures on different continents (Africa, Asia, the Americas, Europe e.t.c.) and in different time periods up to this day. Often, they were not intended to be put down while liquid remained but this was not always the case. Xenophon, among others, attested to drinking from horns in Thrace and emptying the horn was clearly an expected ritual, be it in the course of a discourse or when drinking to someone's health. The Thracians also engaged in drinking matches. In Roman Artefacts and Society, Ellen Swift says early Roman drinking horns were mostly small and ""drinking from the tip was the norm in the early Roman period"" and some ""have an applied foot that affords standing on a flat surface"". Later examples are larger, mostly drunk from the mouth and seem to be designed to be passed around and not set down until empty.  Roman Glass: Rhyton (drinking horn), 75-125 | Corning Museum of Glass  A late Roman-Republican banquet scene in a fresco from Herculaneum, Italy. 59 x 53 cm. The woman wears a transparent silk gown while the man to the left raises a rhyton drinking vessel. For Vikings and Anglo-Saxons, the horn would be emptied, for example, when it was passed around at feasts, in friendship and in peace: According to a saying of the period: “In war is proved what was
  pledged over ale.” Women also had a clearly defined role in hall
  etiquette. They acted as cupbearers and were referred to by the bards
  as “peace weavers,” in the sense that by passing a drink from warrior
  to warrior, they maintained the friendship between them. The cup, or
  horn, was handed to the drinker in strict order of precedence—first to
  the hall lord, often with the injunction to be joyful at drinking,
  then to the duguo—the elder retainers—next the geoguo—young
  retainers—and finally to guests. When the purpose was friendship, feasting, peace or toasting with alcohol, it seems entirely appropriate not to put down a drinking vessel until it has been drained. In fact, the tradition of emptying the horn continues to this day in, for example, Georgia where the ""the glass (or horn!) has to be drunk ad fundum"". However, horns were not just used for alcohol but also for milk and water and for decorative purposes, drinking or otherwise. It was common (and still is in poor communities) to use every last scrap of an animal (e.g. the Vikings) so it wouldn't make sense not to make use of something that could be fashioned into an impressive-looking drinking vessel. At the same time, it would be wrong to think that all horns had to be emptied: there is plenty of evidence of horn stands. For example, As horn is an organic material and susceptible to decay, metal mounts
  are nearly all that remain from Early Medieval drinking horns. For
  example, we have two 9th century drinking horn fittings found in
  Scotland on display in Creative Spirit; a silver rim mount from
  Burghead, Moray and a tinned copper-alloy terminal mount from
  Pierowall, Westray in Orkney. Both of these mounts are the size which
  would fit locally available cattle breeds. However, metal fittings
  from exceptionally large horns have been found in high status
  Anglo-Saxon burials, including those at Sutton Hoo and Taplow in
  south-east England. Here are two examples of drinking horns with stands. The one on the left is Viking: ""A drinking horn exhibited in the Nordiska Museum in Stockholm, Sweden."" The one on the right ""Medieval period drinking horn, made from ox horn. (Photo: Åge Hojem, NTNU University Museum)""  The one below is in the British Museum and is late medieval (15th century).  Finally, a couple of aurochs drinking horns without a stand (although they may have had), from the Taplow burial (7th century Anglo-Saxon). Ideal for passing around at feasts? "
How were drawbridges and portcullises used tactically?,"Any gate is, by definition, an opening in the stone  curtain wall that is the main defense of the castle. A pulled up wooden drawbridge is much less secure than the stone wall: it's flammable, even if oak; and it's vastly weaker from the standpoint of both material (wood vs rubble/fill-backed stone) and thickness: a few inches vs several feet. Hence even in the presence of a drawbridge, not having a portcullis or equivalent is a gross defensive weakness. It's hard to imagine any designer/constructor getting away with such an egregious oversight. That being said, the practice of pulling up the planks on a permanent bridge was a common defensive maneuver and the work of only an hour or two (even on a lengthy river bridge, never mind a moat bridge of only a dozen or so feet) for a team of properly equipped men. The armies of both Napoleon and Charles both engaged in this repeatedly in the 1809 Bavarian Campaign, most notably at Landshut, Kelheim, and Neustadt (where the planks were hidden in the forest so the local population could not immediately restore them)1. Hence while a drawbridge on a castle gate is optional, the portcullis (or equivalent) never is. Security of the castle requires a substantial fireproof closure on each gate house entrance. The design of actual gate houses, with double or triple portcullis separating multiple foyers topped by murder holes (meurtrières) makes clear that considerable investment was made to make a gatehouse the most, not least, secure point on the castle's exterior.   Harlech Castle Further, the counter-weight, chains, pulleys, ropes, and winch of a drawbridge are expensive both to construct and maintain (viz chains rust, ropes rot, etc.), as well as requiring considerable space within a very specific location: the castle gate house. Whether the cost in capital, expense, and space was worthwhile would depend critically on the specific tactical purpose of the castle when under siege: Allowing quick and furtive entry/exit of a small party, likely under cover of darkness, might better be served by a postern gate (aka sally port). If the castle purpose under siege is primarily to exist, then the existence of an expensive drawbridge to facilitate sudden mass sorties by the garrison would seem unnecessary. Only when the castle purpose was the basing of a substantial force that would sortie while under siege would a drawbridge seem worthwhile. In conclusion, let's study the specific tactical feature of a drawbridge:
facilitating a sudden (drawbridge can be lowered quickly) mass sortie (main gate accommodates much more traffic than a narrow postern gate) to be prepared unseen (portcullis covered by raised drawbridge is hidden) by the besiegers - in a strategic circumstance (a large garrison surplus to the purely defensive needs of the fortress) where such a sortie is wise and a tactical circumstance (the surplus garrison sortieing is small enough to do so across the drawbridge yet large enough to be an effective sortie) where it's practicable. Recall that a castle is secure against starvation, thirst, and time, the most effective weapons of a besieging force, only to the extent that food and water can support the garrison, Thus most castles were designed to hold out with a minimal garrison, often just a few dozen defenders, against a much larger force numbering in hundreds or thousands, for months. Sortieing wasn't part of the defensive plan. Given the above, drawbridges would seem most suitable to circumstances where: The moat/waterway is the main defense rather than any wall; The drawbridge is a routine, minimal, defense (drawn up nightly for example) intended against attack mainly to provide time to lower the inner portcullis. The fortification is the headquarters of the defender's territory, such as a capital city; and/or It's seen as a status symbol:
""Look! a drawbridge! Aren't I just the coolest Baron, with the coolest castle, ever?""
Yes, that's said with tongue firmly in cheek: but don't completely discount the importance of appearing both strong and rich. Only the second of these circumstances comprises a tactical use of drawbridges. As for portcullis, they are always an essential element of defense both tactically and strategically, regardless of a drawbridge being present or not. Notes:"
When and why did the use of the lifespans of royalty to limit clauses in contracts come about?,"This is an attempt to escape the rule against perpetuities. No interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years after some life in being at the creation of the interest. A ninety-nine year lease raises the possibility that the heir in question can not be the ""life in being"" required.  For instance, John Doe takes a lease, and dies immediately.  His son James Doe has a child immediately after the death, and then after twenty-two years, dies.  This grandchild is the heir, but was not a life in being at the time the right (interest) was created, and it's been twenty-two years, and therefore the grandchild can not inherit the right. ""Royal lives clauses"" were created to get around this.  Because royal families are large and wealthy, the likelihood of one of them living to within twenty-one years is large.  Other variations of this clause include ""Kennedy clause"" -- descendants of Joseph Kennedy.  The only rule is that it has to be practical to determine the lives referred to.  It's common to used a deceased monarch because of a greater number of descendants. The use postdates 1682, which was the first formulation of the rule against perpetuities. The rule against perpetuities has been modified in many jurisdictions, and therefore the clause is not so widely used, but it's still used where it applies."
What was the reason for Soviet troops to withdraw from Yugoslavia in World War II?,"Part of the story is probably the Percentages agreement between Churchill and Stalin, from the Moscow Conference in 1944.   According to Wikipedia, Churchill's account of the incident is the following: Churchill suggested that the Soviet Union should have 90 percent influence in Romania and 75 percent in Bulgaria; the United Kingdom should have 90 percent in Greece; in Hungary and Yugoslavia, Churchill suggested that they should have 50 percent each. Churchill wrote it on a piece of paper which he pushed across to Stalin, who ticked it off and passed it back. It was amended later for Hungary. Wikipedia further writes: If this agreement was true, then Stalin did keep to his promise about Greece, but did not keep his promise for Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, which became one-party communist states with no British influence. Yugoslavia remained a non-aligned state in line with the Percentage agreement, though it was a one-party communist state, with very limited British influence. Neither did Churchill keep his promise about Greece, which became a one-party junta with no Soviet influence. Britain supported the Greek government forces in the civil war but the Soviet Union did not assist the communist partisans. As the article also notes, this version has been disputed. But it might be the case that Stalin was wary that he could't take everything and get away with it."
Who believed the earth was flat?,"Indeed, the idea that educated people in the middle ages thought the earth was flat is a myth. It was well known to have been round since well before Christ.  Many early maps represent a round earth with edges covered by a sea. It is quite possible that the earliest of these actually are meant to represent a flat earth, but that's 6th century BC.  Of course, a couple of hundred years later it was well known, at least amongst Greek philosophers, that the earth was round, and Eratosthenes calculated the earths circumference. This didn't stop the use of maps that made the earth look like a disc, though. So called ""T and O maps"" was often drawn as philosophical representations of earth, throughout the middle ages. These may have helped fuel the idea that people in the middle ages thought the earth was flat, but that was not the case. These maps are just representations in principle of the earth, and should not be seen as actual maps. That also means that even the 6th century BC map above may represent a round earth. There was attempts to make real maps fit the T and O perspective, but even so this should not be taken as a belief that the earth was flat.  They can be interpreted as representing a belief that Jerusalem was located at the ""top"" of the earth, and that we all lived on the ""top half"", something that made theological sense.  Now about the question who believed the earth was flat, the answer therefore is ""not many"", but of course they existed. However, the mentioned Lactantius is the one of the few who is explicit, and clearly says that a round earth makes no sense. The other two we know of are Severian of Gabala and Cosmas Indicopleustes. These two both use religious arguments and basically says the earth is flat because it makes theological sense. John Chrysostom and Athanasius of Alexandria both expressed the idea that the earth floats on water, and this is sometimes seen as evidence that they believed in a flat world. However, these quotes are rather arguments for God as a creator, more than arguments for a flat earth, so that interpretation is somewhat more tentative. But although some scholars seem to have argued for a flat earth from a theological standpoint, most christian scholars clearly thought the world was round."
Why did the Soviet Union lift the Berlin Blockade?,"This is a good question. So many encyclopedia entries, passing mentions in books, etc. pass up the issue of ending the blockade, as if the motivation for dropping it was obvious. Daniel Harrington, in a mid-1980s round up and revisit of the arguments over the crisis, gives a typical example of this, ""By mid-March, with the worst of the winter behind him, Stalin realized that whatever leverage the blockade afforded was shrinking rapidly"" [3:110] This is true even in very recent accounts. Ted Hopf's book on the early cold war, writes, ""After the airlift demonstrated its capacity through the winter, Stalin dropped his currency demands..."" [2:141] which were the final obstacle to coming to resolution.  Usually there isn't much attempt to explain why he couldn't continue the blockade another year, two years, etc. The assumption I think many people make, even when works don't really show any evidence that Soviets thought this way, is that the political cost in terms of loss of international reputation was high, and not worth dragging the crisis out. My quick look through the literature didn't say much in detail on this however, but perhaps someone can chime in. Part of the problem, I think, is that the overwhelming predominance of literature on this subject seems to use almost exclusively Western sources (would be great if someone could point out recent work which makes use of Soviet archival sources). I found one important exception to the above in the form of a 1997 article by William Stivers 1 in Diplomatic History which is frequently cited in subsequent works and encyclopedia entries on the subject of the Berlin blockade. I'm frankly surprised to see no integration of its findings into the Wikipedia entry on the blockade. I saw three major takeaways from the Stivers piece that can help us answer your question: The literature fundamentally distorts the facts on the ground during the conflict by portraying (as Allies did at the time) the situation in Berlin as creating a fully isolated city. As Stivers puts it and argues in detail in the article, “the Soviet blockade neither attempted nor achieved the isolation of West Berlin” [1:569]  No effort was made, however – either at the beginning of the blockade or during the course of it – to seal off the Western sectors from either East Berlin or from the surrounding countryside. As a result, a flood of goods – roughly a half a million tons, to take the mean of various estimates – entered the Western sectors from Soviet area sources over the ten-and-a-half-month period of “restrictions.” [1:570] Many works, including the wikipedia entry note that there was food offered from the east but, ""they do so chiefly to emphasize that the great majority of Western sector residents turned it down.” [1:571] Speaking to your suggestion that the Soviets could have just continued indefinitely, Stivers suggests even more strongly: East German and Soviet aims – once asserted with breezy certainty by Western historians – become suddenly elusive. In particular, the fact that the Soviets imposed the blockade, but then let it be undermined in a way that assisted the West to victory, is a contradiction in search of explanation. The Soviets probably could have “won” the conflict at any number of points. Had they imposed an absolute blockade at the very beginning of the crisis (thereby reducing the Allies’ cushion of time), or slogged on with it indefinitely ... they would have strained morale to the limit. [1:595] He answers this puzzle by emphasizing the fact that it was not the isolation of Berlin that they wanted, but the further integration of it into an economy that had great benefit for interaction with it [1:595] While all eyes are on the symbolism of the air-lift for relieving West Berlin, less attention is paid to the powerful impact of the counter-blockade on East Germany: The East German economy suffered grievously from the Allied counterblockade imposed...against Western zone shipments to the East. Trade with Berlin’s Western sector companies helped reduce the damage of shattered interdependencies and avert collapse in certain key sectors. [1:587] In this perspective, Stivers there was both an economic and a political cost - but here the political cost is not just internationally but in terms of its intra-bloc reputation as well: As it was, the blockade was a massive blunder. In German eyes, not only did the Soviet Union appear a most implausible “friend,” but the necessity of seeking security with the West seemed conclusively proved. Economic considerations aside, Soviet supply and trade offers – beginning with the milk offer five days after the blockade began – look like efforts to deescalate the crisis in order to repair political damage. [5:596] Finally, Stivers makes a complex argument, not considered in detail here, that the conclusion of the crisis, which hinged on the Soviet dropping of its demands, especially regarding the currency in West Berlin, came partly as a result of British resistance to certain aspects of American demands, and stalling actions by the British and French up to a point where the demand simply made little sense anymore, thus easing the way for a resolution to the crisis. The period of the blockade brought about changes in the economic environment and decreased the interdependency of the two sides to a point where the restoration of the pre-crisis state was increasingly unlikely. [1:602] In conclusion, Stivers argue, reproduced by others who cite him in later works, is that the blockade came with a cost to the Soviets that was both political and economic in the form of the counter-blockade by the Allies on East Germany, and during its course, helped bring out economic changes in the relationship between East Germany and West Germany that made restoration of the pre-crisis status quo difficult and thus not worth the continuation of the blockade.

What pretext did Hitler use to justify Operation Barbarossa?,"Hitler gave his reasons to the German people via a radio broadcast on the morning of June 22nd, 1941. At 0500 GMT, an hour after the invasion began, the Nazi Minister for
Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, went on national radio to read a
proclamation by Adolf Hitler The proclamation can be seen here in full. Basically, Hitler argued that the Soviets were a threat to Germany and had broken the peace. Thus, Germany was 'forced' into a preemptive strike: ...the invasion was presented as a pre-emptive defensive move that the
Wehrmacht leadership had to undertake in order to avert a Soviet
attack on the Reich... Source: Aristotle A. Kallis, Nazi Propaganda and the Second World War (2005) He also railed against the threat posed by 'Jewish-Anglo-Saxon warmongers'. Below are some excerpts for those who (understandably) don't wish to wade through the entire proclamation: ...Moscow not only broke our treaty of friendship, but betrayed it! I was forced by circumstances to keep silent in the past. Now the
moment has come when further silence would be not only a sin, but a
crime against the German people, against all Europe. Today, about 160 Russian divisions stand at our border. There have
been steady border violations for weeks, and not only on our border,
but in the far north, and also in Rumania. Russian pilots make a habit
of ignoring the border, perhaps to show us that they already feel as
if they are in control. During the night of 17-18 June, Russian patrols again crossed the
German border and could only be repelled after a long battle. Now the hour has come when it is necessary to respond to his plot by
Jewish-Anglo-Saxon warmongers and the Jewish rulers of Moscow’s
Bolshevist headquarters. There was no build-up propaganda prior to the invasion - after all, why give the Soviets any hints? On the contrary, German propaganda focused on attacking Britain. The absence of any reference to Bolshevism, Stalin and his empire,
even for the purpose of negative integration or diversion from the
evident failure of the regime’s anti-British strategy, had been
conspicuous in the output of NS propaganda for a while – and it
remained so until 22 June 1941, that is after the start of the war in
the east....Although the time of the invasion of the
Soviet Union was drawing near, Goebbels continued to deceive not just public
opinion but everyone involved in the dissemination of information. Source: Kallis Attacks on Bolshevism had essentially ended with the 1939 non-aggression pact but were now renewed, bundled together with anti-semitism in a ‘Jewish–Bolshevik–plutocratic’ conspiracy with the added ingredient of Germany protecting Europe's ""civilization and history"". How much of this the public believed or felt justified the invasion is hard to determine. Kallis suggests that the public was wary at first of taking on such a large opponent but, when reports came in of a series swift victories, attitudes changed. The article Attack on Russia cites the recollections of one German girl: Maria Mauth, a 17-year-old German schoolgirl at the time, recalled her
father's reaction: ""I will never forget my father saying: 'Right, now
we have lost the war!' "" But then reports arrived highlighting the
easy successes. ""In the weekly newsreels we would see glorious
pictures of the German Army with all the soldiers singing and waving
and cheering. And that was infectious of course...We simply thought it
would be similar to what it was like in France or in Poland –
everybody was convinced of that... This new optimism of a quick victory didn't last, of course. In a letter to Mussolini, dated June 21 1941 (i.e. before the invasion began), Hitler outlines many of the same reasons, emphasizing his belief that the Soviets had to be dealt with as ...with so gigantic a concentration of forces on both sides—for I also
was compelled to place more and more armored units on the eastern
border, also to call Finland's and Rumania's attention to the
danger—there is the possibility that the shooting will start
spontaneously at any moment. Interestingly, Hitler does not attempt to fool Mussolini with the claim (made in his radio broadcast) that the Soviets had been provocatively attacking German positions along the border. German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop text justifying war against Soviet Union Soviet response: Radio speech by Molotov 22-06-1941 in which he lays the blame specifically on the 'Fascist German rulers' rather than the German people: This war has not been forced on us by the German population, nor by
the German workers, farmers and the intelligentsia, whose suffering we
understand very well but by a clique of blood thirsty, Fascist German
rulers who have suppressed the French, Czechs, Poles, Serbs,
Norwegians, Belgians, Danish, Dutch, Greeks and other peoples."
Did the communication lag become a problem for the ever expanding Roman Empire?,"Throughout history this has proven to be a difficult task for a number of empires, including the Greeks, the Chinese, the Persians, and the Romans. The larger their territory, the more difficult it became to manage and control them. The real shortcoming was in the inability to communicate quickly and effectively.  In some instances, those who needed approval or support were hesitant to act without the proper authority, and the delays in obtaining responses led to their downfall. One of the ways that some tried to handle this was to appoint leaders with the authority to make all decisions throughout different regions of the empire. Ultimately, this tended to lead to power struggles which inevitably brought about the downfall of the empire. To address the question of how the Romans communicated, there were a number of different methods used, depending on what was available or most expedient. In some cases they would use runners, while in other cases they would use a horseman. There were also situations where they would send a military legion to escort an officer or official dignitary who was entrusted to deliver a personal message. I don't recall reading anywhere that they used carrier pigeons."
Why wasn't Monaco unified with France?,"First of all, Monaco was annexed by revolutionary France and was part of it from 1793 to 1814.
Before 1793 and from 1814 to 1860 it was surrounded by lands belonging to the House of Savoy. (So for those specific timeframes, it would be pretty hard for France to annex Monaco without annexing Savoy's lands).  Monaco was surrounded by France from 1860 as a consequence of Treaty of Turin. Two years before, France had agreed to help the Kingdom of Sardinia (ruled by the House of Savoy) fight the Austrian Empire (Second Italian Independence War), and the price for this help was the Duchy of Savoy and the County of Nice.  Monaco was not annexed by Savoys before 1860, because its independence was guaranteed by France (Treaty of Peronne). The later relation between Monaco and France was regulated by a treaty of 1861, when France guaranteed Monaco's sovereignty in exchange for the towns Menton and Roquebrune.
And why did France not try to annex Monaco? Maybe because Monaco is France's client state anyway: France controls its foreign affairs and may interfere with the succession issues, see Monaco Succession Crisis - so why annex it at all? The other reason that comes to mind is that Monaco's existence as an independent state, attracting tourists and rich folks from all over the world, is beneficial to the whole South French Riviera economy, but this is a somewhat controversial statement.  And finally, addressing your question about the nationalism, if we only take a look at the languages: the Monagesque dialect is of Ligurian origin, but the local population through the time felt a rather strong local identity: during the revolution people threatened the Prince with establishing a republic, not joining France or Italy - in other words: it seems that the Monagesque people have never really desired to be a part of either France or Italy."
Was climate a factor in the spread of Islam?,"The question is of course kind of entirely biased, as always when you take a statistical correlation and want to apply a cause on that. However, the question should still be answered. It just means that a definitive answer will not be obtained, only ""elements"". Actually, there are quite a lot of elements to explain this repartition of Islam's expansion. Some are as follows: 1/ First phase: Existing Forces The initial development of Islam was opposed to existing forces: empires, kingdoms that were fought and often beaten by Islamic-Arabic fighters (some would say soldiers, other tribes, so I'll use the generic word ""fighter""). Those wars took time and resources, so an efficient resistance triggered less expansion of Islam than a fierce resistance.
So, in history, how did it take place? 2/ Second phase: Conversion After the military conquest, the converting activities from imams and predictors were the major reason for Islam's expansion. Again, different regions led to different processes: In this phase, note that commercial links usually gave the direction of conversion: that is why Islam mostly expanded on the coasts of the Indian Ocean (Indonesia, East coast of Africa). 3/ Containment Now came the 16th century: by that time, the big push of Europe, especially Portugal, in Asia and Africa push Christianity as a competitor to Islam in conversion. Powered by trade and military victories, Christianity stopped the expansion of Islam at his borders in the Indian Ocean and Africa: In East Asia, China was still a too powerful spiritual power.
In Europe, Christianity was well established and blocked any expansion, except for Timurid and Golden Horde military (but temporary) expansions. Conclusion: Yes, Islam expansion followed a pattern directed by specific causes.
No, this is not directly about climate.
This is more about having established religions and military powerful ""states"", or not yet, at the borders of the initial Islam center.
Finally: Yes, the climate has something to do with the presence, or not, of those established systems:"

"Has there ever been a major migration from the New World to the Old World? If not, why?","As DevSolar mentioned in his comment, this really depends on how you define 'major', but here are several case of migrants moving from the New to the Old World. From the Caribbean to Europe According the (British) National Archives, between 1948 and 1970, nearly half a million people left their homes in the West Indies to
  live in Britain There were also significant migrations to France and the Netherlands. According to Migration from the Colonies to Western Europe since 1800  In 1975, more than 100,000 migrants from the Caribbean were living in
  metropolitan France. Also, around 180,000 Surinamese immigrants arrived in the Netherlands, mostly between 1975 and 1980. From North America to West Africa Another, much smaller but nonetheless historically significant migration from New to Old led to the founding of Liberia. This involved the migration of around 13,000 African Americans during the nineteenth century."
How was the United States able to produce excellent tanks in 1942?,"Good? No. Lots of them? Yes.  The Americans were leaders in mass-producing large durable goods at low cost - cars, especially. This translated to mass-producing medium cruiser tanks (the M4 Sherman) almost as quick as they could roll a Buick off the assembly line. What's more, these were brand new machines, they had not spent months and months slogging through the desert and one pitched battle after the next, and the Americans brought plenty of spare parts for them.  They were designed to be easily repairable and incredibly reliable, and they could move a lot quicker than the German armor. In a stand-up fair fight, the Sherman loses every time. Monty and Patton didn't do stand-up fair fights, they left that to the Russians.  The Americans chose to incrementally improve and upgrade the Sherman, eschewing clean-sheet designs. This meant the Sherman kept getting better and better, while retaining its low cost. At the beginning of the war they were called Ronsons by German tankers - a brand of cigarette lighter who's motto was ""Lights on the first strike"". The design was so extensible that not only were they a credible threat to heavy German tanks by the end of WWII, they were used to good effect against modern Soviet armor in the Six Day War.  It's not how you start, but how you finish."
Why was there a surge in the US incarceration rate during the 1990s?,"According to Trends in U.S. Corrections (pdf), the increase in the prison and jail populations relates primarily to Changes in sentencing law and policy, not changes in crime rates, The main increases have been for drug offenses and violent crimes, the latter constituting the largest group in state prisons. These increases have come about primarily (but not only) because of new policies on drug offences and harsher penalties for violent crimes. Thus, more prisoners are incarcerated for longer periods of time.  Sentencing policies of the War on Drugs era resulted in dramatic
  growth in incarceration for drug offenses. Since its official
  beginning in the 1980s, the number of Americans incarcerated for drug
  offenses has skyrocketed from 40,900 in 1980 to 450,345 in 2016.
  Furthermore, harsh sentencing laws such as mandatory minimums keep
  many people convicted of drug offenses in prison for longer periods of
  time: in 1986, people released after serving time for a federal drug
  offense had spent an average of 22 months in prison. By 2004, people
  convicted on federal drug offenses were expected to serve almost three
  times that length: 62 months in prison. There has also been a nine-fold increase since 1980 in drug offenders in state prisons. At the federal level, two-thirds of all inmates in 1997 were people convicted of drug offences, though this had declined to about a half by 2012. Overall, though, violent offenders make up the largest percentage of inmates. Although the 'three strikes law' (criminal statutes that mandate increased sentences for repeat offenders, usually after three serious crimes) has been commonly cited as a reason for the dramatic increase in the number of people incarcerated, it's either not that simple or only a marginal factor in many states. First, the law did not come into effect until the period 1993-96, more than ten years after the rapid increase in the number of inmates began. Second, almost half of US states do not have this law and, among those that do, only California applies it to a broad range of crimes. Third, many states already had habitual offender statutes before 'three strikes'; it was these statutes that were (and are) being used in many states. It is also noticeable that, between 1977 and 1997, the years when the percentage increase in the rates of incarceration reached double figures were all before 1993 (1980-81, 1981-82 and 1988-89)."
When were 'time zones' (or at least time difference) discovered?,"The concept of longitude was first developed by ancient Greek astronomers. Hipparchus (2nd century BCE) used a coordinate system that assumed a spherical earth, and divided it into 360° as we still do today. His prime meridian passed through Alexandria. He also proposed a method of determining longitude by comparing the local time of a lunar eclipse at two different places, thus demonstrating an understanding of the relationship between longitude and time. — Longitude: History. Eratosthenes in the 3rd century BCE first proposed a system of latitude and longitude for a map of the world. His prime meridian (line of longitude) passed through Alexandria and Rhodes, while his parallels (lines of latitude) were not regularly spaced, but passed through known locations, often at the expense of being straight lines. By the 2nd century BCE Hipparchus was using a systematic coordinate system, based on dividing the circle into 360°, to uniquely specify places on Earth. So longitudes could be expressed as degrees east or west of the primary meridian, as we do today (though the primary meridian is different). He also proposed a method of determining longitude by comparing the local time of a lunar eclipse at two different places, to obtain the difference in longitude between them. This method was not very accurate, given the limitations of the available clocks, and it was seldom done – possibly only once, using the Arbela eclipse of 330 BCE. But the method is sound, and this is the first recognition that longitude can be determined by accurate knowledge of time. — History of longitude: Longitude before the telescope. Eratosthenes created the first global projection of the world, incorporating parallels and meridians based on the available geographic knowledge of his era. — Eratosthenes. His third book of the Geography contained political geography. He cited countries and used parallel lines to divide the map into sections, to give accurate descriptions of the realms. This was a breakthrough and can be considered the beginning of geography. For this, Eratosthenes was named the ""Father of Modern Geography."" — Eratosthenes: Geography. One of the earliest known descriptions of standard time in India appeared in the 4th century CE astronomical treatise Surya Siddhanta. Postulating a spherical earth, the book described the thousands years old customs of the prime meridian, or zero longitude, as passing through Avanti, the ancient name for the historic city of Ujjain, and Rohitaka, the ancient name for Rohtak (28°54′N 76°38′E), a city near the Kurukshetra. The notion of longitude for Greeks was developed by the Greek Eratosthenes (c. 276 BC – c. 195 BC) in Alexandria, and Hipparchus (c. 190 BC – c. 120 BC) in Rhodes, and applied to a large number of cities by the geographer Strabo (64/63 BC – c. 24 AD). But it was Ptolemy (c. AD 90 – c. AD 168) who first used a consistent meridian for a world map in his Geographia. Ptolemy used as his basis the ""Fortunate Isles"", a group of islands in the Atlantic, which are usually associated with the Canary Islands (13° to 18°W), although his maps correspond more closely to the Cape Verde islands (22° to 25° W). The main point is to be comfortably west of the western tip of Africa (17.5° W) as negative numbers were not yet in use. His prime meridian corresponds to 18° 40' west of Winchester (about 20°W) today. At that time the chief method of determining longitude was by using the reported times of lunar eclipses in different countries. — Prime meridian: History."
Has any country ever had 2 former presidents in jail simultaneously?,"Quite a few candidates if: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_heads_of_regimes_who_were_later_imprisoned ...

Argentina has a whopping 8 presidents that sat in jail, including 2 from 2007 onward. Bangladesh had 5 presidents who went to jail, of which two were behind bars in 1975. Bosnia and Herzegovina had 2 presidents sitting in jail from 2006 to 2012. Bulgaria had as many as 3 former prime ministers behind bars at the same time in 1944. Comoros has 3 presidents and prime ministers behind bars at the time of writing this. Costa Rica had 2 presidents behind bars from 2004 to 2012.

Guatemala 3 early in 2018 Hungary 4 in 1945 Iraq 4 in 2004 Japan 5 in 1945 Libya 4 in 2011 Pakistan 4 + 2 arrest warrants as I write this The point is Brazil is not an exception. One caveat: read the list with a fistful of salt, because it lists former French President Sarkozy as sitting behind bars since 2018, whereas he was only put in police custody for a day that year as he was charged with bribery and illegal campaign contributions. (He might sit in jail some day in the future, but the point here is that you may want to double check the data.) Also, Gaston Flosse of French Polynesia is listed twice."

Was slavery really on the way out in the antebellum USA?,"No, slavery was not on its way out. Historians like Dunning and Phillip are writing half a century before the cliometric revolution in economic history, which has completely changed how we view this question. Fogel and Engerman's 1974 ""Time on the Cross"" was quite influential in showing how profitable slavery was for those who practiced it. In particular, plantations were more efficient economic institutions than smaller farms. Many more cliometric studies have been done since Fogel and Engerman. They may vary in details, but most economic historians agree that slavery was not on its way out, at least not in any timely manner. Remember, there was still a domestic slave trade, and so we know exactly how much the market valued the South's slave stock as commodities. Based on those prices, we get estimates such as these: Enslaved people were the capital: four million people worth at least $3 billion in 1860, which was more than all the capital invested in railroads and factories in the United States combined. Seen in this light, the conventional distinction between slavery and capitalism fades into meaninglessness. This graph from Ransom and Sutch indicates that the market value of America's slaves was growing at an ever increasing clip. This makes clear why the Southern elite was willing to expend so much blood and treasure to defend their peculiar institution: the market considered their stock of human property to be as valuable as ever.  One argument that slavery would have died eventually is that the slave system wanted, even needed, to expand, and we know that the American Southwest was not suited to cotton agriculture. But we can't conclude that this would have led to slavery's demise either. There were strong expansionist factions in the prewar Democratic Party that wanted to conquer the rich, tropical lands of Cuba and Mexico and make them the new cradle of American slave culture. A good source for these expansionists is Yonatan Eyal's ""The Young America Movement and the Transformation of the Democratic Party, 1828-1861."""
Why did the Soviet Union out-pace the US during the space-race?,"It did so, but only initially. Over the long term, it fell behind in most areas, and once the USA was first on the Moon the space race was over with the USA the victor. Rewind back to the beginning of the 1950s. The Cold War had just started, both the USA and USSR had lots of nukes, but the USA had a massive advantage because its bases in Europe allowed its bombers to deliver those nukes directly to the USSR. In contrast, the USSR could not hit the USA in any way shape or form - so if nuclear war came, the USA would be completely safe. This gross imbalance in the power dynamic spurred the USSR to order their scientists to focus on technologies to project power, which led to the successful deployment of the R-7 ICBM by 1957. That same year, Sputnik was launched into space on an R-7; the first human spaceflight took place via a Vostok rocket which was a derivative of R-7; and indeed today's Soyuz launch vehicle is itself a heavily modified derivative of the R-7. The Soviets benefited from the advantages of a command economy, as well as a completely centralized and controlled program: there was only one rocket project, and all focus was placed on making it into something highly capable, which translated into both military and civilian use. The USA, being on the ""good"" end of the power projection imbalance, had little or no incentive to invest in rocket technology; they instead poured R&D into their Air Force's traditional fighters and bombers. This changed once the USSR demonstrated their own hydrogen bomb, but the USA was behind the USSR, and their first operational ICBM was only available in 1959. This was primarily due to infighting, poor allocation of resources, and duplication of work within the highly fragmented and territorial branches of the US armed forces; there was no unified goal of a single capable rocket, just various very experimental programs, most of which were inherently unsuitable for human spaceflight. Essentially, by 1957 the USSR had a functioning, powerful human-capable launch vehicle and a single unified vision of what to do with it and how it could be used, while the USA was still trying to figure out who should be responsible for rockets and what capabilities they should have. This culminated with the USSR's successful, and unexpected (by the West) launch of Sputnik in 1957, while the USA's first attempt to launch a satellite that same year (the Vanguard program) exploded on liftoff. But in 1958, two important things changed for the USA: This singular focus on human spaceflight, combined with a powerful, reliable, and extensible human-capable rocket, now laid the groundwork for the USA to surpass the USSR. Mercury brought both nations to rough parity in terms of human spaceflight, its successor Gemini pushed the USA slightly ahead while pioneering technologies that would be required by the program to put humans on the moon, and finally that program - Apollo - succeeded in its goal. It was now the Soviets' turn to fall behind. The R-7 was capable of putting humans in Earth orbit, but lacked the payload capability for a moon landing. A new rocket was required, the infamous N1, which had an incredibly lengthy and troubled development that included personality clashes between the top rocket scientists in the USSR, as well as the death of the man primarily responsible for its development. By the time the USA succeeded in putting humans on the moon in 1969, the N1 had not had a successful launch after 2 attempts, and was ultimately cancelled in 1974."
Was the Wehrmacht a mechanized army?,"You are correct. Parts of the Wehrmacht were mechanized, but the vast majority was foot infantry with horse drawn logistics. Most soldiers walked towards Moscow, and back."
How is serfdom related to slavery?,"It seems like you are trying to treat ""slavery"" and ""serfdom"" as trans-historical categories, and that is where the confusion lies. To make meaningful definitions and comparisons, we have to be more specific. There are many different forms of so-called ""unfree labor"" and each must be understood in its own context. Unfree Labor is the title of a classic book by Peter Kolchin. It draws comparisons between slavery in the US South and serfdom in Russia during the late-sixteenth through mid-nineteenth centuries. The independence and resident mentality of American slaveholders facilitated the emergence of a vigorous crusade to defend slavery from outside attack, whereas an absentee orientation and dependence on the central government rendered serfholders unable successfully to defend serfdom. Russian serfs, who generally lived on larger holdings than American slaves and faced less immediate interference in their everyday lives, found it easier to assert their communal autonomy but showed relatively little solidarity with peasants outside their own villages; American slaves, by contrast, were both more individualistic and more able to identify with all other blacks, both slave and free. Ancient slavery is something closer to early modern serfdom than early modern slavery in many respects. But it's a more difficult comparison to make because the ancient world was very different in all sorts of ways. This blog makes the attempt. In the Roman Empire, slaves could obtain freedom much more quickly than slaves during 1600s-1800s in North America. Also, in the Roman Empire, slaves were at times educated, held status within their households and were valued by their owners. That is not to say that all slaves within the Roman Empire had access to these aspects, but they were present and common practice within Roman society. In comparison, slaves in North America were not afforded these features, they were a source of labor and, eventually in the Southern Colonies, they became essential for the economy. Furthermore, slaves during the Roman Empire were typically ‘white’ and viewed as a person/human being. While in the North American Colonies, slaves were typically black or Indian, no white person was enslaved, and slaves were typically not viewed as having the same rights as free individuals, nor were they believed to be fully human. To conclude, I wouldn't make too much of the terms ""slavery"" and ""serfdom"" when divorced from their specific historical context."
"When Israel won the Six Day War, did they consider expelling all Arabs from the annexed territories?","There is no evidence they seriously considered expelling all Palestinians. The impracticality, illegality and negative publicity was self-evident, even if fringe elements entertained the fantasy. However, there's evidence that smaller scale displacements were carried out. It resulted in the 1967 exodus. During the brief war of 1967, 350,000 Palestinians were displaced, representing one-quarter of the population of the two sectors. Israel denied causing this exodus, but according to a U.S. State Department account, Israeli aircraft ""hit many civilian targets on the West Bank where there are absolutely no military emplacements,"" causing thousands to flee. Kattan, Victor, ed. The Palestine question in international law. British Institute of International and Comparative Law, 2008. Israel denies this, obviously. However, post-war surveys of Palestinian refugees in Jordan revealed that a majority reported air strikes as the reason they fled. [I]n survey, 57% of West Bank Arabs who took refuge in Jordan during 1967 war cited aerial bombardment as reason for departing. Quigley, John. ""Displaced Palestinians and a Right of Return."" Harvard International Law Journal 39(1), 1998. This is also corroborated in contemporary reports from Western journalists during the war. There seems to be little doubt that the 60,000 inhabitants of the three big U.N. camps around Jericho were attacked by planes on the second day of the fighting. They are now the biggest single group among the refugees who have arrived. D. A. Schmidt, ""100,000 in Jordan Said to Have Fled Across River,"" New York Times, June 12, 1967. Furthermore, while Israel accuses them of antisemitism, the 1971 report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of Occupied Territories states that: On the basis of the testimony placed before it or obtained by it in the course of its investigations, the Special Committee had been led to conclude that the Government of Israel is deliberately carrying out policies aimed at . . . forcing those who are in their homes in the occupied territories to leave, either by direct means such as deportation or indirectly by attempts at undermining their morale or through the offer of special inducements, all with the ultimate object of annexing and settling the occupied territories. The Special Committee considers the acts of the Government of Israel in furtherance of these policies to be the most serious violation of human rights that has come to its attention. The evidence shows that this situation has deteriorated since the last mission of the Special Committee in 1970. However, again, they did not consider expelling all of the Palestinians. For one thing, unlike 1948, there was no huge reserve of Jewish immigrants to settle all this land. For another, Israel believed that maintaining an Arabic population in the West Bank would form a ""human bridge"" to the other Arab nations. One was the hope that the Arabs of the occupied West Bank, in particular, might provide a human bridge over which Israel could ""normalise"" relations with other Arab countries . . . The second reason why Israel did not expel Arabs form the territories occupied in 1967 was that, unlike 1948, there were no waves of Jewish immigrants waiting to take the Arabs' place. Shazly, Saad. The Arab Military Option. American Mideast Research, 1986. Moreover, it would be impossible to hide the scale of such an expulsion, and that would have destroyed Israeli reputation worldwide. As has been pointed out, expelling civilian populations from occupied regions is an egregious, black-and-white violation of international law, including treaties Israel is party to. Specifically, the Fourth Geneva Convention Article 49: Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive."
Did Native Americans ever fight the indigenous people living in Mexico before Europeans arrived?,"On the topic of the Aztecs, an intriguing book on this subject is Aztec Warfare: Imperial Expansion and Political Control, by Ross Hassig. The Aztecs were an extremely war-like civilization, that were constantly attacking and subjugating their neighbors.  Interestingly, though, their style of warfare was quite different from what we are familiar with from western european history. For the Aztecs it was all about taking prisoners.  The more prisoners you could bring home to sacrifice to the gods, the higher your standing.  Thus, weaponry, tactics, and military strategy were all geared around maximizing capture of the enemy rather than defeating them in detail.  They didn't really care about securing administrative control over their conquests quite the way the Europeans did, and often allowed the conquered to continue under their existing leadership, so long as they continued to send tribute. Typically the Aztec army would set forth from the capital at the start of the war season and go from one town to the next.  They might start with towns that were lax in their tribute or that had refused to give it.  When they appeared at a town, those people had the choice of surrendering or going to war; the Aztecs would be particularly harsh to those that resisted to dissuade others from doing the same. Flower War was another interesting warfare technique rather unique from European war; the nobility would leave their regular troops and engage in non-lethal battle with nobility of neighboring empires.  These did not result in capitulation of their enemy, but were done for practice, honor, and to ""test"" the strength of the opponents.  I suppose there is some analogy to the jousting tournaments of the European middle ages. Thus the Aztec empire was always a bit amorphous, with cities and towns shifting in allegiance depending on the strength of the king, the proximity of the army, and heaviness of tribute demands.  The empire was maintained not by territorial control via castles and forts, but rather indirectly via political influence, propaganda, and fear.  It also meant that the maximum effective range of the Aztec empire was limited to how far the army could march in one war season. Thus, while the Aztecs probably would have no qualms about conquering, say, Texas, the structure of their civilization would just not support such a long range expedition. Also, the central Mexico basin was a very agriculturally rich area and supported very large populations.  Outside this area populations were more scarce.  So I think the Aztecs would not be as interested in areas far from them where captives would be harder to obtain and more time consuming to bring back for sacrifice. While the Aztecs were distinctive compared with Europe, they didn't live in a cultural vacuum.  Neighboring empires followed similar style warfare, prisoner capture, flower war, and so on.  Religious practices, agricultural technology, war strategy, and more would drift northward, influencing the practices of other Native American tribes.  The Flower Wars remind me much of the ""counting coup"" of the plains indians for instance. For contrast, I'd suggest reading Empire of the Inca by Burr Cartwright Brundage. The Incas engaged in war for keeps.  They didn't take captives for sacrifice, they wanted territory.  When they took a new region, they'd transfer some loyal families from Cuzco to serve as the conquered region's ruling class.  Dissidents would be rounded up and relocated elsewhere in the empire.  The Incas would terrorize the newly acquired until they accepted the Emperor's law without question. They also practiced warfare in a much different fashion.  War was not to win social standing but to take territory, so their armies were organized much more differently; as they often faced enemies fortified in cliff-high strongholds they developed ""tortoise"" shield-rush tactics that would have impressed the Romans. Logistics were the Inca's particular talent.  While marching within the borders of their empire, they would enlist the commoners of the province as porters to carry goods from one end of the province to the next, whereapon they'd hand off to people of the next province.  The people would open up their granaries to supply the marching army; foraging and looting were strictly forbidden. The Incas also had a unique ability to ""snowball"" as they took new lands.  Upon taking a new province they immediately enlisted the military man power of that province into their army, to be used as the cannon fodder for their next campaign.  This both strengthened their army and depleted the resistance power of the new province. [Update]
A third book I've been reading lately is 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus, by Charles Mann.  This goes into much more detail into both the Aztec and Incan empires - from how they arose to how they fell - as well as surveying other Indian civilizations throughout North and South America. In school learning about the Native Americans, I was given the impression of the Americas as being populated by two civilizations (the Aztecs and Incas) and everywhere else was just nomadic people.  This book really drives home the point that this was far from true:  There are traces of complex farming civilizations dotting all over North and South America, that apparently died out of disease or other causes well before being encountered by Spanish or other explorers, for which little is known.  As well, going back through time there was a rich history of other geographically extensive civilizations prior to the Aztecs and Incas - the Mayans and Olmecs are perhaps the best known of these but there were many, many more."
Why does the King of Spain still claim defunct titles like the King of Hungary?,"They're maintained as a matter of tradition, which is not unusual in monarchies. It's used both for prestige and as a relic of an era when European diplomacy revolved around territorial claims of the monarchs. That said, most titles do have clear geographical or dynastic sources. If you do find one that seems strange, leave a comment and I'll see if I can supply an explanation. The title for Corsica was part of the Crown of Aragon, which formed a dynastic union with the Crown of Castile that later became Spain. In 1297 the Pope created a purely titular Regnum Sardiniae et Corsicae for James II of Aragon, even though neither controlled either Sardinia or Corsica. Nonetheless, the ""kingdom"" was inherited by the heirs and descendants of Isabela I and Ferdinand II, along with all the other titles the couple possessed. With a little digging, it becomes apparent that the user Zeubea inserted the ""the King of Hungary, Dalmatia, Croatia"" etc titles into the Crown of Spain article.  Since he didn't provide a source, all we have to go by is his other edits. Apparently, he believes Charles V obtained the Hungarian title somehow and passed it to his Spanish heirs. He added the claims to the Charles V article, stating at first that the titles were: just nominally held by his son Philip II of Spain, honoring Castile and Aragon efforts against Otoman empire in Eastern Europe.  Awful English aside, logically, this doesn't really make any sense. It is well established that it was Charles V's brother, Ferdinand I, who was elected King of Hungary. Ferdinand's son Maximilian became King of Hungary after him. Why would it go to Philip II, his nephew? A mere hour later Zeubea changed his story, claiming instead that: Philip II of Spain held the King of Hungary, of Bohemia, and of Croatia title just nominally, inherited from his aunt Mary of Hungary [[Mary_of_Hungary_(governor_of_the_Netherlands)|Mary of Hungary]], sister of Charles V and widow of [[Louis_II_of_Hungary]], who inherited the title by testament of Charles V.  Broken syntax aside, once again this makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Mary of Hungary was Queen Consort of Hungary by virtue of her marriage to Louis II. How can Philip II inherit the title from someone who doesn't hold it in her own right? How can Philip II inherit a title that's based on being married to the king? Was Philip II the wife of duly crowned, legal Hungarian King, his uncle Ferdinand I?  How does Mary ""inherit"" the title by ""testament"" of Charles V anyway, when she was Queen of Hungary long before Charles V died (in the same year as her)? Zeubea did not cite any references in his article edits, but he leave an entry on the talk page asserting that: Because of testament of Charles V, like a deference to his widow sister Mary of Hungary, he let her to use this title on life. Then, because of her marriage with Louis II of Hungary without (legal) descendents, these titles laid nominaly on Philip II of Spain, and, from him, Spanish Crown holds the King of Hungary, of Bohemia, and of Croatia nominal titles. More terrible English aside, once again this makes no sense whatsoever. Louis II did die without issue, but how could Philip II inherit his title? The Hungarian crown was elective and the magnates of Hungary elected Ferdinand I. Even if the Crown of St Stephen was inheritable, it would've gone to Louis II's heir, not his wife's heir. This time however, Zeubea did list a couple of links to ostensibly support his claims. Let's look at the first one. Hungary only seem to appear twice: Doña María de Hungría, Gobernadora de los Países Bajos (1531 - 1555), no tenía sucesión. Which just says Mary of Hungary had no issue. Okay. María (1505), Reina de Hungría desde 1522, Gobernadora de los Países Bajos (1531 - 1555). Which just says Mary was Queen of Hungary after 1522. Which makes sense since she married Louis of Hungary in 1522. Doesn't help either. So Zeubea's first link actually proved himself wrong:  Mary was Queen of Hungary by marriage, not from ""the testament of Charles V"". Maybe the second link would be more helpful. Once again Hungary only seem to appear twice: Es verdad que si pudiese acabar con la reina viuda de Hungría, mi hermana, que continuase en el dicho cargo, que ha tanto tiempo tenido, sería lo que más convernía, porque ella lo ha hecho muy bien en paz y en guerra. Mas está puesta en descargarse de él; en fin, se determinará todo con vuestra venida, placiendo a Dios. Which basically says that his sister Mary is the Queen Dowager of Hungary, and how she has been doing so well in her position that he doesn't want to let her stop. This was written in 1548. By then, Mary had been Governor of the Netherlands since 1531, a position she is known to resent and yet Charles V is known to have thought she handled well. Considering Mary hadn't been in Hungary for decades by that point, clearly this is saying that Mary should continue being Governor of the Netherlands - not about being ""king of Hungary"". Well there's only one mention of Hungary left so this must be it! Lo mismo siempre he hallado en la reina viuda de Francia y en la reina viuda de Hungría, mis hermanas, y tengo por cierto que entrambas y cada una continuará esta voluntad con vos, y ansí recíprocamente debéis corresponder, y tenedlas siempre por buenas tías, y favorecedlas siempre en todo lo que pudiéredes, y os ruego, y os lo encomiendo. But... this is just talking about his sisters, the Queen Dowager of Hungary again (and the Queen Dowager of France, so Eleanor). Well that's a bust. The only reasonable explanation is that Zeubea was wrong, as his own sources proved. It seems he might have confused Charles V's comments on Mary's performance in the job of governing the Netherlands, for her honorific title as a former queen consort of Hungary. But either way he said nothing about giving Mary's position to Philip II. To be fair, Charles V may have claimed the throne of Hungary upon his election as Holy Roman Emperor. The website @MAGolding used is the only source that confirms this, but Charles could well have inherited the claim from Maximilian I, his grandfather. Maximilian's father, Charles's great grandfather Frederick III, was heir to Ladislaus the Posthumous, the last of the Albertine Habsburgs and a King of Hungary. He was a ward of Frederick during his youth, and his mother Queen Elizabeth had also entrusted the Emperor with the Holy Crown of Hungary. After Ladislaus died, Frederick had himself crowned King of Hungary in 1459 and invaded Hungary, then under the control of Matthias Hunyadi. They made peace in 1463, with Frederick returning the Crown and recognising Matthias, but retaining his title and the promise that he would succeed Matthias to Hungary if he failed to produce a male heir. The Hungarians ended up setting the treaty aside and electing Vladius of Poland when Mathias died in 1490 without male issue, but the two sides subsequently signed another treaty stipulating pretty much the same terms, but with Maximilian succeeding Vladislaus if the latter produced no heir. So it's quite plausible for Charles V, heir of Maximilian, to maintain his grandfather's claims on Hungary when he became emperor. But be that as it may, it's a moot point as far as the Crown of Spain is concerned. Again, it's clear that nothing in Charles V's testament left this particular title to his Spanish heir, Philip II. Moreover, the same website which confirmed Charles V was titular king of Hungary, also explicitly omitted the Hungarian title from the Spanish monarchs. In any case, Ferdinand I finally achieved the family dream when he was elected king in 1526. Actually, yes, but it is as tenuous as tenuous can be. In 1385, Charles III, King of Naples seized power in Hungary from Mary, and had himself elected King. He was promptly killed a couple of months later, but his son King Ladislaus of Naples took up this claim and made several attempts to become King of Hungary himself. He had basically zero success, but it started a tradition for his heirs. Ladislaus died without issue in 1414. His sister Joanna succeeded him, and maintained the same titular claims to Hungary. She adopted Alfonso the Magnanimous in 1421, but repudiated it soon afterwards when they had a falling out, so that Renee was named the next king when she died in 1435, also without issue. Alfonso was King of Aragon, but Naples didn't say with the Crown of Aragon because he died, also without legitimate issue, in 1458. The Crown of Aragon passed to his brother John the Great, but Alfonso's bastard son succeeded to the Kingdom of Naples as Ferdinand I. The titular claim to Hungary stayed with Naples, maintained by Ferdinand I. Shortly after he died in 1494 the French invaded and deposed his son, though. King John, and his son Ferdinand II (the same one who married Isabel of Castile), didn't claim Hungary. But after the Neapolitan branch of the family was ousted, Ferdinand II conquered it back from the French in 1504. By then Aragon had been united with Castile. Naples thus passed into the United Spanish crown, through Joanna the Mad to Emperor Charles V in 1516, little more than a decade later. Note that, even though they were united under one ruler (or ruling couple), this ""Spain"" was still a disparate collection of very independent polities, each with their own traditions, laws, and customs. Hence, documents issued by the Kingdom of Naples may use their (by then) traditional styles, which included Hungary. Equally, it makes sense for the Spanish Crown, having been united without Naples in 1474, to not mention Hungary, as @MAGolding apparently finds in his answer."
Why were Albanians the only nation in the Balkans who converted to Islam during the Ottoman occupation?,"Based on what I've found, I would say that it was a combination of factors that all amplified each other.  The conquest of Albania was particularly brutal compared to the rest of the region, and was furthermore contested through the revolt of Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu, which lasted from 1443 through 1468. Even by that time, the region of Krujë had developed into one of the more important subaşilik (an Ottoman gubernatorial region) centers in the Balkans. This basically devestated the area, and led to the emigration of thousands of Albanians to the north (there seems to have been a very large émigré population in Naples because of this)1. Over the next couple of centuries, the remaining Albanian population was further diluted through the immigration of Muslims from elsewhere in the Ottoman empire. This trend of population movement is noted in many of the contemporary writings and also in traditional accounts of the expansion of Islam into the Balkan regions2.   These demographic trends would have amplified each other as areas with large Muslim populations tended to both serve as magnets for further Muslim resettlement and accelerated the pace at which the rest of the population converted to Islam.  This makes quite a bit of sense if you compare it to large regional ethnic concentrations in the United States for example, and I would imagine that similar social dynamics would have been at play. This is actually evident in the tax records for the region, in particular records related to the cizye, or tax on non-believers (thank you Ottomans for keeping good tax records). Population studies based on these records seem to confirm these types of concentrations3. In addition, this link gives a pretty good summary of the literature and is worth a read. 1 Jelavich, Barbara, History of the Balkans: Eighteen and Nineteenth Centuries, p 34-5

What is the difference between the Ancient Greek religion and the Ancient Roman religion?,"The biggest difference that I'm aware of is that the Classical Greek religion was much more the religion of myths that we all know, while the Classical Roman religion had fewer personifications and its gods were much more like numinous forces than like people. The Greek religion that we know was encapsulated by Homer who served in some respects like an Old Testament to their classical religion. The Greek gods seem to have alwayds been personified -- they were basically powerful -- sometimes very powerful -- people. The Greek religion was by-and-large not about morality (how could any of the Olympians claim superiority there?) but about propitiation of potentially dangerous powers and making deals with potentially friendly ones who might thereafter act as your supporter or your city's patron. During the course of classical antiquity many philosophers examined Greek religion and often found it wanting. By the height of Greek culture, the religion still existed, but the various philosophical schools -- the Cynics, the Sophists, the Pythagoreans, the Stoics, the Epicureans -- provided a guide to living which the Greek religion lacked.  But the Olympians were deeply embedded in Greek culture, and you could certainly get in trouble by being too overt in your questioning of them -- just ask Socrates. But they appear to have been more a matter of social solidarity than what we'd understand as a religion. The Romans were broadly similar, but the earliest things we know of the Roman gods show them as faceless, unembodied personifications of places and forces: Luck, War, the Sky, Fertility, Crossroads, Family, etc., etc. As the Romans became more aware of Greek culture they came to see their gods as having Greek equivalents and their view of the gods tended towards the Greek model, but never completely. The Roman gods were always numinous forces as much as they were people with great powers. The Roman religion has been characterizes as being ""organized superstition"" and some Roman rituals were meaningless to the participants and done only because they'd always been done that way and it might be bad luck to stop. Roman religious rituals also had the feature that they had to be done perfectly with any slightest error requiring the officiant to start from the beginning. The Roman religion was intimately tied to the Republic, with the officials of the Republic conducting many rituals. There were priests, but they were almost invariably powerful officials who were elected or appointed to the post and who used their religious position to further their political one.  (Famously, Julius Caesar's political career was saved when he manged to get elected Pontifex Maximus.) As the Republic turned into the Empire, the Roman religion was even more co-opted for political ends, and the worship of deified emperors and of Rome itself became an increasing focus, not because people believed that Augustus now sat on Mt Olympus or wherever, but because it provided a unifying force in a giant organization that badly needed them. (This was a large part of why Christians were persecuted: they didn't participate in civic rituals that the State considered important, but (because they were new and didn't have a long history) lacked the Get Out of Sacrifice Free card that the Romans (usually) gave the Jews.) With the Roman religion providing as little spiritual guidance or solace as the Greek, the Greek philosophical schools were also heavily adopted by the Romans. Bottom line: The Greeks tended towards greater personification of their gods; the Romans tended towards their religion being a series of quid pro quo transactions with faceless forces. But they had much in common and more as time went on and the cultures merged. Edit:

How kind were the Muslim occupations of North Africa?,"The history is a bit sketchy about this period. The most well-known early source, Ibn Abd al-Hakam Conquest of Egypt and North Africa and Spain, was written in 870. Being written about two centuries after the conquest, he had to rely a lot on oral traditions. In addition, many early sources focused on highlighting the Muslim victories and had little information on the conquered population and how they were treated.  That said, the Quran does prohibit forced conversions (Quran 2:256 explicitly says ""There shall be no compulsion in religion""), and we do know that during the early Caliphates this prohibition was generally observed. That doesn't mean that the caliphates were fully tolerant by modern standard. Non-Muslim subjects were required to pay jizya, a special tax which also exempted them from military service. While jizya seems like a form of discrimination today, this served as an incentive for the rulers to keep the religious minorities thriving and not forcibly converted. This relative tolerance allowed indigenous non-Muslim minorities to exist today even in areas under millennia of Muslim rule, e.g. Egyptian Copts or Syriac Orthodox Church. While Christians remained in a significant number in Egypt, in the Maghreb (Western North Africa) the number is much smaller, and even that might have been partially introduced by colonial powers. C. J. Speel's 1960 paper The Disappearance of Christianity from North Africa in the Wake of the Rise of Islam, argued that this was due to the fact that the Maghrebi Christians were Arians. They didn't believe that Jesus was God and thus were theologically closer to Islam than the mainstream Christianity of the Byzantine Empire. Sources/further reading:"
How were medieval castles built in swamps or marshes without draining them?,"As noted, this type of castle was extremely common. Harburg (Horeburg/near Hamburg), the first castle at Danzig are perhaps the most famous of these. They were most often built along the Northern European plains on the South shore of the North sea and the Baltic Sea. But that is only indicating that a lot of wetlands can be found in those regions. They were popular everywhere where there was enough water influencing the surrounding terrain to form a natural obstacle for approaching enemies. A clear cut definition and distinction between swamp castle and water castle seems difficult. Today, many of these were either transformed into more comfy residences in later years and thus lost their military character (quite late construction date exception of Bourtange in Groningen), had their marshlands drained, or they did succumb – not in the least through military actions – or in their construction itself, due to the permanent water stress upon the construction. Then of course, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh springs from a family that had its seat at Glücksburg Castle. Castle Vischering might look most like what we expect for a medieval castle:  But to get even more to the point of Monty Python: they did not have that much money for extensive props. So they just used an existing castle: For comparison, picture from question:  And the original: Bodiam Castle:  and as pictured in the movie  Bodiam Castle was used in Monty Python and the Holy Grail in an establishing shot identifying it as ""Swamp Castle"" in the ""Tale of Sir Lancelot"" sequence The difficulty in differentiating these types of castles may be illustrated in this watercolour picture by Wilfrid Ball in ""Sussex Painted"" (1906):  
–– Matthew Balent: ""The compendium of Weapons, Armour & Castles"", Palladium Books: Taylor, 1991. The often found subsequent difficulties with water damaging the construction lead to some inventions: The motte proper was a conical mound which might vary considerably in size (between 6 and 15 m). The motte could be completely man-made—an important or even enormous undertaking—but if there was a suitable hill in the area it would be adapted by scarping, that is, cutting vertically down the sides and digging away the lower slopes. In certain cases, to avoid the shifting of materials and to provide greater stability to the motte, alternating layers of stone, peat, clay, chalk, rubble, gravel, brushwood or sand were inserted between rammed or beaten down layers of earth. Finally the whole mound was revetted with a thick coat of clay to keep out water. With this technique the builders could create a dry place in a possible swampy area, or keep the castle out of reach of the river in low lands. The base of the motte was surrounded by a ditch, which may have been filled with water. Some of the material for the motte was derived from the ditch, but in some cases additional materials were required to bring the mound up to any appreciable height. A great majority of medieval moats were dry, but de­ pending on the natural situation, some were filled with water. A wet moat, called a douve or wet ditch, formed a very efficient obstacle against the assaulting party. However, wet moats could be something of a mixed blessing; they were inconvenient in peacetime, which meant that unofficial bridges were often erected—with subsequent argument and indecision about the right moment to chop them down in an emergency. Besides, water might dangerously erode the base of the wall, and stagnant water might be a year 'round health hazard for the inhabitants of the castle. The water for a douve could simply be collected from rain, but because this source was unreliable, the wet ditch was very often supplied with fast-flowing water coming from a river or sea by means of dikes, sluices, watergates and derivation canals. In certain cases, wet ditches took on the proportions of a lake, a marsh or even an intentional flood. The architect and the lord or trustee would decide together the best place to build the castle. Their choice was influenced by various strategic, technical and financial considerations, and nearly always involved a site favoring defense such as a high ground, a spur, a hill, an island or a marsh. When a portion of ditch was dug, masons built strong wall foundations (remember that castles were vertical buildings demanding stability). In good ground conditions large flat stones were tilted inwards to take the thrust of the wall above. When the ground was less stable, masons start with a framed-up timber raft; on marshy ground they had to install timber piles driven deep. Constantly, the master-builder had to supervise all of the construction, control alignments, check material qual­ity and so on. To all these tasks were added the construction of echauguettes, gatehouse, houses, chapel, lord's residence, dungeon, and more. And the conception and construction of the castle were even more compli­cated in mountainous sites where transport was difficult and weather unpredictable. Spectacular difficulties were met in wet or marshy sites. Certain cities owed their growth to the installation of a royal, imperial, princely or episcopal court and became national, regional or provincial capitals. Many others were rebuilt or created because of a favorable geographical situation (for example, a passage in a marsh or between mountains, a ford on a river, a junction of important cross­ roads, or a protected anchorage) because accessibility favored the installation of trading-places and markets. 
Cross-section, Tour de Constance in Aigues-Mortes (France). The huge Constance tower, completed in 1248, was a 32 m high cylinder, 22 m in diameter with walls 6 m thick. Built in a swampy site, the tower rests on solid foundations composed of pillars. The tower includes two vast vaulted chambers and a crenellated top platform with a watch-tower used as a lighthouse.
–– Jean-Denis G G Lepage: ""Castles and Fortified Cities of Medieval Europe. An Illustrated History"", McFarland: Jefferson,  London, 2002. That means for construction that builders tried to take advantage of natural conditions: drier, raised land, like in Glücksburg, where the construction rests on a natural granite base. Simultaneously or alternatively, they used compressed earth and mixed material they tried to seal from the wetness primarily with clays and rested the foundations  on wooden beams, like on a grand scale found in Venice. In both examples, the permanent difficulties stemming from the wetness and continuing to this day illustrate how difficult to maintain these constructions were and are. The case of Danzig/Malbork castle illustrates another aspect. We can only analyse a fairly short time period in which the castle existed in the 'desired' form. The necessities for upgrades over time were already quite pronounced. The present day appearance is much more solid than the first iterations: The Knights quickly overran the lower reaches of the River Vistula, building their first castles during the 1230s, of timber and earth banks. In a land of rivers, swamp and forest, a scanty supply of good building stone meant it was used only for foundations.
–– Dan Snow: ""Battle Castles"", Haperpress: London, 2012. A problem from the conditions for answering this question is the assumed absence of ""terraforming"". Building the castle itself is a part of terraforming. In the middle of a swamp no big building can be erected  without manipulating the ground for it to be able to hold the weight of the structures above it. Further it was always desirable to ensure the surroundings keep their deterrence and obstacle properties. That means castle owners would have always liked to have some more control over the water level. To prevent the swamp or marshland to become too dry, or even increase its effectiveness by initiating a flooding. As the fate of most of these constructions who were not real water castles on a river island or a proper lake shows, these castles in swamps or marshes were most often only a temporary phenomenon. Not only for health and safety of the occupants or the buildings themselves. Ironically such castles became often small population centres. And ordinary people often had less interest in this inconvenience of wetlands next to their housings, but generally preferred usable land close to home, so that eventually most swamps and marshes were drained, or even dried up naturally. Further examples to investigate – not for their present but for their initial appearance would be:
Wyher near Ettiswil, Gifhorn castle, the oldest still existing Burg Oebisfelde, Lembeck, Hülshoff, Dunguaire Castle, Mespelbrunn or the sometimes suspected oldest stone castle of which no traces remain from the series of Loire castles Doué la Fontaine, Château de Sully-sur-Loire. The Teutonic Knights had come from the Holy Land to Prussia well experienced in the building of castles, but in the savage lands of the north the environment and conditions for construction were very different. Their Prussian territories were almost literally carved out of the dark forests and swamps with their meandering rivers, and the pioneer knights were handicapped by a shortage of labour, no local building skills and few deposits of workable stone. The technology of building in brick existed and had been demonstrated effectively in Denmark, but the settled conditions and reserves of manpower simply did not exist on the Prussian frontier.
The result was that the first Prussian castles resembled those of the natives that were destroyed by the Order's army. They were often hastily built from timber, usually oak, because the stone laboriously gathered from fields was only sufficient for foundations. The forts were thus rough-hewn wooden blockhouses, sometimes built upon a crude and simple stone base of undressed boulders, encircled by wooden palisades and with the lay of the land determining the contour of the walls. With so many rivers and swamps around, water defences played an important part in a castle's layout. Rivers provided a barrier in summer and roads during the winter, so the castles were often located on a promontory where two rivers met.
Wooden castles were of course vulnerable to attack by fire, so during the 13th century an attempt was made to bring masons in from Germany to build stone castles. However, as noted above, stone was scarce, and in Prussia no more than five castles were converted from wood to stone by 1250, so timber kept the knightly communities alive until brick succeeded stone as a cheaper and more readily available material. The average garrison of a wooden castle would be about a dozen knights, together with 100 or more soldiers, mercenaries, native militia and servants.
In time, all the permanent castles of Prussia were converted from wood to brick, but it is also important to note that wooden castles continued to be built even when brick castles were well established, but these were constructed as temporary fortresses during expeditions into enemy territory. If such a foray was likely to take some time, then it was sensible to build a temporary base rather than rely on a succession of flimsy encampments.

What exactly is the US national anthem?,"There is no ""exactly"". First, one minor clarification: the bill itself actually passed Congress in 1930 (April 21st), but wasn't signed into law until March 1st of 1931. What you linked there was just a restatement of that law verbatim in the US legal code. The original text is of course the same. One thing you have to realize is that back then it was considered an old drinking song, and nothing about it was under copyright. That means there was no such thing as a single definitive version, like one might imagine a modern song release should have. Anyone could modify, add, or omit verses (or notes), and if other singers liked it enough, that became part of some renditions of the song. The tune was (mostly) authored by an Englishman in 1773, and was probably never covered under any kind of copyright law in the USA. The lyrics were written as a poem in 1814, and by 1929 long out of any copyright they ever may have had. US Copyright was very much looser at the time, lasting only 28 years, and even then only if the author explicitly registered it and extended it. So at the time, this was just a patriotic song that was being sung in saloons, at ballgames, and at other appropriate times, and it would have been sung with whatever lyrics, verses, and arrangement the singer(s) felt like singing. The phrase ""the words and music known as"" is in fact as specific as it was possible to refer to it. All this being said, there was an attempt a making ""standard version"" in the 1910's. By the early 20th century, there were various versions of the song in
popular use. Seeking a singular, standard version, President Woodrow
Wilson tasked the U.S. Bureau of Education with providing that
official version. In response, the Bureau enlisted the help of five
musicians to agree upon an arrangement. Those musicians were Walter
Damrosch, Will Earhart, Arnold J. Gantvoort, Oscar Sonneck and John
Philip Sousa. The standardized version that was voted upon by these
five musicians premiered at Carnegie Hall on December 5, 1917, in a
program that included Edward Elgar's Carillon and Gabriel Pierné's The
Children's Crusade. The concert was put on by the Oratorio Society of
New York and conducted by Walter Damrosch. An official handwritten
version of the final votes of these five men has been found and shows
all five men's votes tallied, measure by measure. Of course nobody really had the authority to enforce this, so performers would stick to it only as much as they preferred it to other versions. As the old joke goes, the best thing about standards is there are so many to choose from."
Why could China keep most of the lands it conquered after 17th century but European powers could not?,"The Chinese situation was fundamentally different from the Western European colonial empires. In fact it's rather more like Russia, who also managed to keep her Eurasian empire, or the United States, who acquire vast territories West of the Mississippi. In the case of China, those lands you refer to are mostly Sinkiang and Tibet. Most notably there is the inherent advantages of a land link. It was (and is) considerably easier for a Chinese regime to dispatch an army to Sinkiang to suppress a revolt, than it is to ship a similarly sized force across the Atlantic Ocean. Moreover, overseas territories tends to become distinct from the motherland by virtue of a giant ocean in between the two, allowing a people to develop distinct national identities. Secondly, Chinese power is simply overwhelming relative to either Tibet or Sinkiang. That China itself was no match for the Europeans is irrelevant. After World War Two, the European overseas colonies successfully fought off the Great Powers; for instance the French by Vietnam. In contrast, once the ruling Chinese regime turned its attention towards it, Tibet was helpless to prevent a military takeover,  Part of this is because despite their geographic size, the native population was very small. With Tibet, the population is a mere three million even today. Sinkiang is a lot more populous currently, but not so for most of history. A paper[1] by Qi Qing-shun of the Xinjiang Social Studies Institute notes that region's population had hovered around one million for most of the time since the Han dynasty. Moreover, Sinkiang's demographics was devastated by its forcible incorporation into China. The province was created out of the Dzungar Khanate's lands, after it fell to the Manchurian Empire. In addition to just the conquest, the Manchus enacted a brutal extermination campaign that effectively erased the Dzungar people from the their former homeland. Most survivors either fled into Russia, or were enslaved within China proper. These conditions enable China to establish effective control via internal colonisation. Ethnic Han Chinese settlers now constitute roughly half the whole population in both. Coupled with a strong emphasis on national unity and general nationalism, China virtually ensured it will be able to maintain its rule over both regions. [1]: Qi, Qing-Shun.

Why didn't Moldova unite with Romania?,There is a long documentation of the process on Wikipedia which doesn't really answer your question however.

Why didn't Japanese infantrymen and samurai use shields?,"First off, before reading mine, his ( non native Japanese but fluent ) --English ( British ) -- explanation is available at Youtube.  The blog is obviously written by him. 
For those who are interested in the quick answer, kindly take a look at his video. The left thing I have to do is....checking the original content and I present my counter argument. I think this is a good question. The reason is because it is even agonizing many Japanese today. In the last post, I made an answer from the perspective of the amount of the production of iron ( ores ) and the then prevalent method to produce steel, Tatara, but I discarded my previous answer since I was not able to respond to my own question ""Then why didn't Japanese Samurais use wooden shields like Scots did?"" in the battle fields. I googled in my country's site as ""shield, Bushi ( samurais )"" and interestingly, I came up with an explanation by a non native Japanese but who are so fluent and have enough knowledge and insight into Japanese history ( even he has his own armor lol ).

The question was 「Why didn't Japanese use shields in their battlefield?」 My most appropriate reply to it is  「As a matter of fact, they used it.」 今回のビデオでは日本で使われてきた３つのタイプの盾について語ります。ですがその事について語る前に、""日本人は戦場で盾を使わなかった""という一般的によく言われる考えの問題点について触れておきたいと思います。それは古代日本について語る時、多くの人々がサムライの歴史が全てであるかのように認識している点です。  サムライの時代は日本の歴史の、日本の戦争の歴史の一部分に過ぎず実際には、少し乱暴ですが１０世紀から１７世紀の間の出来事です。日本の歴史はそこだけではありません、サムライの台頭以前にも多くの出来事があるのですが残念ながらほとんどの人はそれを考慮せず、またその事について語ろうとしません。 I would like to show you 3 types of shields used in Japanese in my video ( *where is the video, is later. ) Now, before talking about them, I would like to refer to the common assertion ""Japanese did not use shields at all"". It is only applicable to ancient Japan, where considering unfortunately many less Japanese knowledge(ful) people associate Samurais as if they were the soldiers covering entire and whole Japanese history.  The age of Samurai ( or Bushi ( I Kentaro Tomono would like to use this word )) is, in a very rough and coarse way, is just from 10th to 17th century. Japanese history can not be described only by such a short period of time. There are many who don't mention before the appearance of Samurais aka Bushis even though chronically speaking there are many to tell before them, only few refer to them.  もちろんサムライは日本の戦争の歴史において非常に大きな役割を果たしていましたがそれより前に２つ、縄文時代(12000BC-300BC)と弥生時代(300BC-AD300)というとても重要な時代があります。この2つの時代では「手持ちの盾」はとても一般的であり、その時代の日本の歩兵はそれを使っていました。 右上の写真が今話しているものです。 It goes without saying that Samurai's role was very important in Japanese history, however, there are also important eras too, Jomon period ( 12,000BC-300BC ), Yayoi period ( 300BC - AD300 ), respectively. In these 2 eras, hand-held shields played a great important role. You can see the pictures of those shield upper-right corner of the picture above.  またこちらは侍より前の時代の扮装をしている様子です。  このように現代でもイベントで人々が当時の衣装を纏った姿を見ることができますが、当然そこまで人気があるわけではありません。どうしてもサムライという日本を象徴する戦士に人々の関心は集まり、日本の時代衣装を楽しもうと、それを着て人々を楽しませようと思う人の多くがサムライを選びます。もちろん私を含めてです。 というわけで正しい質問は「なぜ日本人は戦場で盾を使わなかったのか？」ではなく
  「なぜ日本人は手で持つ盾を使わななくなったのか？」とすべきでしょう。  The above picture is the ritual ceremonial illustrating these ages. These ceremonial events garner people to watch, but they not so popular compared with the counterparts of Samurais'. Samurais who are popular to native Japanese too, make their today's ritual events more entertaining than those of formers',  collect more people to watch, including me. Now, ""correct"" question is not ""Why didn't Samurai use shields at battlefields"" but rather be ""Why did the hand-held shields drop off the favor by Japanese?"" Why did the hand-held shields drop off the favor by Japanese?  5世紀と15世紀には日本の氏族間の戦争を劇的に変える出来事が起こりました。15世紀に起きた事は有名ですね、種子島鉄砲あるいはマッチロック式銃と呼ばれるものの伝来です。ポルトガル人によってもたらされたこの特殊な、特別な武器は日本でコピーされ大量生産されます。一時期は日本だけでヨーロッパ全体よりも多くのマッチロック式銃が生産されました。忘れないでください、これは足軽だけでなくサムライも使用していたという事を。  では5世紀に起きた出来事とは何か？ それは馬の伝来です。これは状況を一変させました。以下を考慮してみてください。  In 5th century and 15th century, there occurred dramatic events respectively, which altered the Japanese battles between their clans ( I prefer to use ""families"" ).What happened in 15th century is quite commonly known. The imports of Tanegashima rifles or Matchlock rifles.. The unique and special weapon brought by Portuguees was copied in Japan and became produced in mass. The numbers of these rifles produced only in Japan surpassed the total aggregate of that of the entire Europe. Please do not forget, not only Ashigaru ( foot soldiers ) used the weapon, but also Samurai ( lords ) did too. What happened in 5th century? It is an import of horses. This even changed entire Japan completely. Kindly consider the followings. 平和な時代が一時期ありましたが基本的に古代日本では常に戦争が起き、日本人同士で争っていました。その理由はとても単純で日本には資源が、農地として使える土地が、そして生産資源が限られていたからです。一部の歴史家は日本では土地の20%しか資源を生産する事に適していないと指摘しています。それはつまり古代日本の戦争というものは主権や支配権の問題だけでなく生存競争だったわけです。  In ancient ( I think he is referring to Jomon era and Yayoi era he mentioned above ) age, there were peaceful periods, of course, but the normality is continuous battles between Japanese. The reason is simple. Japan, lacking the important resources for life, including ( arable ) lands. According to a Japanese historian, at that time, only 20% of Japanese entire land was cultivable. That means the battles in ancient ages in Japan meant not only for domination of areas, reigning areas but for survival itself. さて、その様に常に戦争をしている国に馬が、つまり騎兵が伝来したわけですが騎兵は歩兵に対し絶対的な優位を保持していました。ここで日本には２つの選択肢がありました。1つは歩兵と盾を持った歩兵を騎兵に対抗できるまで強化し進化させるか、それとも騎兵を軍隊に導入するかです。日本は後者を選びました。手持ちの盾を捨て騎兵を受け入れ、それを発展させたのがサムライになっていくわけです。もっとも侍の歴史の最後の方では騎兵よりも歩兵よりの性格になっていくのですが。ちなみにイギリスの騎兵などは片手剣を使用していましたが日本の騎兵が盾を使わなかった理由については後述します。  Now, into such a country where battles are daily normality was imported, Horse.
   And accordingly, horse riding soldiers were born. Horse riding soldiers are having the perfect dominance against foot soldiers, but Japanese had 2 choices. Either upgrade foot soldiers equipped with shields to match up with horse riding soldiers, or just select horse riding soldiers as military men. Japan selected the latter. Abandoning shields, accepting the horses they ride, and its final development was the Samurai. ( Here is important ( in my opinion ) ) Although, foot-soldiers became more important than horse riding Samurais in the later stage of battle in Japanese history. The U.K soldiers back then, ( when? ) used one handed sword, the reason why Japanese Samurais ( Bushis ) did not use shields will be described later on. Shields Samurais continued to keep using.    この出来事により日本人は手で持つ盾を捨てたわけですがそれは盾自体を捨てた事を意味するわけではありません。侍全盛の時代においても盾は使われていました、ですがそれは地上に置いて用いる大型の「置盾」、中世イタリアのジェノヴァのクロスボウ使いが使用していた体全体を防護する大きくて重い長方形の盾であるPavise Shieldに近いものです。それは弓対策に、後に鉄砲対策に使われていました。所謂""持盾""ではありませんが盾なのは間違いありませんね。これが2つ目の盾です。  The incident which I described above ( import of horse ) only meant Japanese abandoned hand-held shields. But that does not mean they completely ""dumped"" shields. In the eras dominated by Samurais, ""shields"" were used but they were called 「Okitate」( such as this ( by Kentaro Tomono ) which is large and set at the ground, similar to the heavy, rectangular shaped shields ""Pavise Shield"" used in Italy at middle age by crossbow men to protect their body wholly. Though technically speaking they are not ""hand-held"" shields, they are ""shields"", am I wrong here? And this the second ""shield"" I mentioned.  そして3つ目の盾が、少し奇妙に思えるかもしれませんがこの「袖」です、肩甲の事ですね。これは私が所有する16世紀の日本の当世具足甲冑の袖です。前の時代のものよりも小さいですがこの様に肩に装着します。その目的は主に弓を防ぐ事にありますが鉄砲にもある程度は対応しています。 And the ""3rd"" shield, is 「Sode」or 「Katayoroi」（　Acutally, both means the shoulder plate which is used in ancient time. He might have probably meant to be 
  like this one. by Kentaro Tomono ) This (? ( probably below )) is the 「Sode」of the 16th century's Toseigusoku ( only in German available ) which I possess personally. Though, they are smaller than those of the previous age, you attach it at your shoulder. The main purpose of it is to defend from the attack by bows but can protect from bullets to some degree.  なぜ日本の侍は盾を両肩に装着するようになったのか？ ではなぜ片手に盾を持ちもう片方にメインの武器を持つというスタイルではなく、盾を両肩に装着するようになったのでしょうか？ 掲示板などでよく盾の大きさや重さのため扱いが難しい事が原因ではないかと語られていますがそれは間違いです。また盾というものは包括的用語であることを忘れてはなりません。  Why did samurais attach shoulder plates on both sides? I would like to inquire into why Samurais attach shoulder plates rather than holding a sword with one hand and hold his shield with another hand? Widespread on the internet is shields are too heavy, too big to handle, so that they abandoned. That is wrong. And please be reminded ""shields"" mean so broadly.  古代ローマ人のスクトゥム Old roman Scutum  カイトシールド Kite Shield  Buckler ( left ) and Pavisive Shiled ( mentioned above ). 例えば体全体を覆う古代ローマのスクトゥムも盾ですし小さなバックラーも、ノルマン人が使った中型のカイトシールドも、先ほど言及した置盾も盾です。スクトゥムは非常に効果的だったとはいえ扱いにくいものでしたが（実際にはそこまで扱いにくいとは思いませんが）バイキングが使った円形の盾やバックラーのような盾は機敏な動きが可能であり、また防御だけでなく攻撃にも使えました。その様な小型・中型の盾ならば、あるいはサムライ以前の盾ならば扱いにくいということはなかったでしょう。 For example, the Old Roman Empire's Scutum which covers the defender's body wholly is one of the shields buclers and the medium sized Kite Shields which Normans used and Okitate which I mentioned before were all shields. The Scutum was very effective but hard to handle with ( although in my opinion the Scutum is not so hard to handle with )　Shields such as the rounded one Vikings used and small bucklers enables the handler for more agile movement and can be used not only for the protection but also for the attack. If Samurai had such a small, medium sized shields. then they would have no problem to equip with at all. また別のよくある意見としては日本人が「両手持ち」の武器を好んだからというものがあります。実際日本人は槍や薙刀、刀、太刀、さらには弓を多用しました。武器が関係したのは間違いないでしょう、ですが単に好みの問題ということではありません。 Other things I hear a lot is Japanese preferred two-handed weapons. In reality too actually, Japanese used a lot such as spears, Naginatas, , swords, broad swords, and bows in the course of history. These weapons had definite influence on why Japanese did not use shields ( small or medium or whatever. ) 
  But the problem ( why the shield fell out of favor of Japanese samurai ) is not
  because of their preference at all. 我々は侍と聞くと刀を想像しますが実際には彼らの主要武器は弓でした、日本の侍はヨーロッパの騎士と違い弓も扱う射手でもあったのです。剣や槍と違って弓は盾を持ちながら使用することはできません、そしてそれこそが侍が持盾を使用しなかった理由だったのだと私は考えています。 When we hear the word ""Samurai"", we imagine a soldier with a sword, but their main weapon was bow. Japanese samurais were bowmen different from European Knights.Bows can not be handled with shield, different from swords and spears. 
  And I think that is the main reason why Japanese did not have the hand-held shield.   刀は片手で扱う事も一応できましたしその様に使われたこともありました。(実際には刀は戦場において主要な武器ではなく2次的、3次的な武器でした。) また古代ギリシャのファランクスが槍と盾を併用していたように槍を片手で扱う戦法も歴史上存在しました。ですが弓と手に持つタイプの盾の併用は困難です。剣と盾を持って戦うか、それとも弓を使うことを重視し持盾を捨てるか、日本人は後者を選択したわけです。先ほどの鎧を見ても構造的に弓が扱いやすいものになっていると理解できるでしょう。  Swords were/can be used singly handedly ( In the ""real"" battle field, swords were secondary or third option weapon. )  As is in a case in ancient Greece, Phalanx used spears with one hand and shield with another hand. Though, the combination of bow and shield was quite challenging. Either you pick a sword with one hand and shield with another hand or using bow only, Japanese chose latter. You can deduct from the look of the armor I previously showed that the armor itself fits with bow attack. 弓を使うことを選択した結果として盾を身に着けるようになり、盾を持つ必要がなくなったので両手武器を使うようになった、というのが私の考えです。 My opinion is, as a result for Japanese samurais to have selected bows as their main weapon, they ""attached"" ""their shield"" ""on them"", which led them to think it unnecessary to hold a hand-held shield and used both hands' weapons. 日本の甲冑とその役割 The roles and the usages of Japanese armors  最後に日本の鎧についても語っておきましょう。古代ローマ人が盾を主要な防具としロリカ(板金鎧)を2次的な防具としていたのと違い、日本の侍にとっては鎧が主要な防具でした。 Lastly, let me talk about Japanese armors. While Old Romans used shield as their main defense tool and their armors, Lorica as their secondary defense tool, to Japanese armors were the main defense tool.    詳しく説明する前に日本人が使用していた鎧がどんなものか、実際に私が所有している当世具足をお見せしましょう。この鎧は槍や刀のような両手武器だけでなく弓を扱う事も想定してデザインされています。見ての通り腕の可動域はかなり広く、この様に弓を構えるふりをしても全く妨げになりません。  Before entering into further discussion, I would like to show you how Japanese armors were, using the ToseiGusoku ( the armors around late 16th ( Kentaro Tomono )) I have as an illustration. These armors are designed to not only use the both hands' weapons such as spears and swords, but as well as bows. As you can see my picture above, I can so broadly move my arms, even allowing me to perform like a bowman.  足軽や侍が槍を持ち突撃しようとするとそれに対し敵兵は矢を放とうとしてくるのですが、日本の和弓は例えばイギリスのロングボウなどと比べてドローウェイト(弦を掛ける際にかかる重さ)が小さいので鎧を貫通する事が難しく、よって鎧のつなぎ目に当たる事を期待して矢を放ちます。可動性を優先した日本の鎧には鉄板によって保護されていない隙間がありますから。 When Ashigarus or Samurais try to penetrate into with their spears, the opponent counter attacks with bows. Now Japanese bows have lighter draw weight ( weight at bow's length ( Kentaro Tomono ), thus their aim is expected to penetrate into unhinged parts of Samurais' armors because otherwise they can not go into. There are unprotected spots due to the mobility-first structures of Japanese armors.   なので槍を持って攻める側は少し前傾姿勢になり半身になって突撃します。こうする事で隙間を隠し袖や兜を前面に出し矢から身を守りつつ攻撃しました。 Thus, those who try to penetrate with spears incline their body and head forward a little bit and turn their body ( probably to right if the soldier is right handed ( Kentaro Tomono ) half with their shoulder plates front ward. By doing this, putting their helmet and shoulder plates forward protects themselves from bow attacks.  また敵が眼前に迫った時、攻撃する瞬間には少し奇妙に思われるかもしれませんが放たれる矢や迫り来る槍の切っ先から身を守るために防具の中で最も強固な部分、つまり兜をさらに前面に出すため下を向きながら攻撃しました。 When opponents come so close to you, it might sound strange though, Ashigarus or Samurais moved up their helmet further frontward, because the helmet is the most secure, thus enabling them to defend against the spear points and arrows as is illustrated above.   このような戦法は珍しい事ではなく、中世ヨーロッパのジョスト(騎士の一騎討ち)でも似たようなことが行われていました。 These kinds of tactics are nor rare, same kinds can be observed for medieval jousting by the knights in Europe then.  ジョストのために作られたこのような兜は前面が一枚板の金属でできておりそこが最も防御力があると考えられていました。 The front part of the helmets for jousting comprises of only 1 plate and it was considered that part should be protected first.  なので騎士達は防御力を最大化するためにぶつかる直前に仰け反るような体勢をとっていたといいます。そうする事で無防備な覗き穴を保護したのです、仮に槍の穂先の破片が飛んできたとしてもそれを防ぐ事ができました。日本の侍や足軽が衝突の瞬間に下を向いたのもこれと同じ様な戦術と言えるでしょう、こちらは上を向いていましたが。 Therefore, European knights ""opened"" their body upwards right before they come across each other like above so that protection can be at the highest and to protect the peeping hole which is not protected. Even if the tip of the spearhead flies into their body, they could duck the attack. Japanese Samurai's downward bending style is similar to this method, I think. Nagae yari (long shafted spear) 16.4 to 19.7 ft (5.0 to 6.0 m) long, a type of pike used by ashigaru.13 It was especially used by Oda clan ashigaru since the reign of Oda Nobunaga; samurai tradition of the time held that the soldiers of the rural province of Owari were among the weakest in Japan. Indeed, Kantō was a chaotic place; Kansai was home to the Shogunate, and the Uesugi, Takeda, Imagawa, and Hojo clans, as well as pirate raiders from Shikoku. Additionally, Kyushu was home of one of the most warmongering clans in Japan, the Shimazu clan. Because of this, Nobunaga armed his underperforming Ashigaru soldiers extra-long pikes in order for them to be more effective against armoured opponents and cavalry, and fighting in groups and formations. His spear seems to be that of ancient ages. Zohyo Monogatari （ In Japanese ( Story by Ashigaru ( foot-soldiers )), tells the same thing.  Quote ①槍は突くものとだけと思うな ②皆で気持ちを一つにして槍の穂先を揃え､拍子を合わせて敵の 　槍を上から叩く ③その時は突こうと思ってはならない。ただし1人2人の敵の 　場合はその限りでは無い。 ④叩く時は敵の背中に差した旗を叩き落とすつもりで振り下ろす ⑤馬に乗った敵はまず先に馬の胴腹を突き､馬が撥ねるので敵が 　馬から落ちたところを突き殺す ① Do not think spears are the weapons to push ( thrust / shove ) the enemy. ② Integrate all the spearmen's mind and arrange your spearheads in one line and 
     hit the enemies' spears from above in one action. ③ For ②, do not consider to push/thrust then. However, when the enemies is only one or two person(s), it would be O.K. ④ When you try to hit the enemies from above, try to do so as if trying to hit
     the flags they have behind them. ⑤　When you attack enemies riding horse, first, hit the body of the horse and at the instance when the horse jumps up, and consequently after the enemies fall off the horse, attack the enemy. So there were even 15-20 feet spears back then whereas the height of Japanese was in average around 5.2 or 5.3. But there were short spears too. They were used for narrow range battles, their length were about 6 feet. And there were the ""middle"" size spears, their size were around 10 feet to 12. But regardless of the size, spears were bothhanded weapons, which unabled Samurais or Ashigarus to hold hand held shields. Upgraded later on."
Did people use to marry much younger during the last millennium?,"Not really. Generally speaking, most European women since married in their early to mid twenties, to men in their mid to late twenties. The age gap for the commoners, i.e. the vast majority of the population, were typically not large. Unfortunately the question declined to define how much younger is ""much younger"" supposed to mean, but most Europeans married well after the onset of puberty.  Overall, there does seem to be an upward trend in marriage ages. However, we have little statistical evidence prior to the 17th century. The paucity of records makes claims of trends over the whole millennium rather hazardous.   Both spouses married late in Europe during the Early Middle Ages. Citing Carolingian survey data, the late David Herlihy argues[1] that prior to 1000 or so, barbarian marriage customs - marrying in late twenties to similarly aged spouse - predominated in Western Europe. From about A.D. 1,000, however, the value of women appears to have declined. Rather than receiving a bridal price from the husband, families now paid dowries to unload daughters much earlier. The age of first marriage for women thus plummeted to their late teens, but largely left that of men unaffected.  For reasons that remain unclear, the situation began to be reversed at some point during the High and Late Middle Ages. This gave rise to the curious nuptial phenomenon known as the northwestern European pattern, which has dominated Western Civilisation to this date. Proposed in his highly influential 1965 work[2] by John Hajnal, this paints a picture where both spouses married late and established their own households, independent of their parents. Another feature is that significant proportions of both men and women abstained from marriage completely. Under Hajnal's classification, this system prevailed west of an imaginary line running from Trieste to St Petersburg.  Hajnal's pattern is sometimes thought to originate from the value of retaining a daughter's labour on Late Medieval farms of Western Europe. Later on, the habit of young women and men to work in other households also delayed marriages. This contrasts with the Mediterranean situation, where domestic servants were more likely to be married and widowed. Other arguments propose that the need for financial security (due to the habit of relocating away from home upon marriage) forced delays. Data from the Middle Ages are scarce, the earliest statistical records from the Late Medieval and Early Modern periods demonstrates a relatively high, and increasing, age at first marriage. By the Late Middle Ages Dijonese women were known[3] to marry at 20. This rose to 21 during the 16th century, and everywhere in France the mean age of first marriage seemed to have climbed to about 25 by the 18th.  Similarly, in most German regions, women married in their twenties - averaging between 22.7 to 28.5 in one study[4]. Demographic data from the late 17th century[5] reveal that commoner women from Giessen and Heuchelheim on average first married when just over 24, although Mainz's average was much lower at 21.3. Likewise, Medieval English couples are thought to have married during their their early to mid twenties[6]. By the Early Modern period, the average 17th century English women were marrying when 25.6-26.2 to men 28.1 years of age, although it declined slightly subsequently.  In the Netherlands, by the middle of the period, the mean ages at first marriages for women were estimated to be about 20-21 at mid 16th century Leiden, and 23.5-25 at late 16th century Amsterdam. Both groups married husbands who were on average 1-2 years older. These numbers further increased after the 17th century. Overall, the evidence is that European marriage patterns resembles that of the 20th century. Not all of Europe followed the same pattern. Southern Europeans women were more likely to marry young to older men, although ages were generally still around 20. A landmark study[7] of 1427 Tuscany reveal the mean age of first marriage there to be 19 for women, but 28 for men. Subsequent studies[8] on 15th and 16th century Florence confirms that all women married when 18 to 19, to men between 27.7 and 31.2. However, men with higher socioeconomic status tended to marry older, a trend not reflected in women's marriage patterns. While the Florentine situation is often regarded as unusual, it is not unique. Another study[9] of 15th century Ragusa showed that women were on average betrothed at 18, but gave birth to their first child when 22. From this the authors surmised that Ragusan couples consummated their marriages when the women were 21 and men 36. In this case, local cultural norms seemed to be the main culprit. Nuptial patterns in colonial North America were also different from the colonists' Western European motherland. A lack of eligible women relative to available bachelors resulted in fierce competition for potential brides[10]. This led to a reduction of women's age at first marriage in the 17th century, though it gradually caught up to European norms as the colonies grew over the following centuries. However, few colonial couples marry as young as earlier writers had once assumed [11]. In early English colonies, the average age at first marriage for women were late teens to very early twenties[12], roughly five years lower than that of England. In Massachusetts[13], women married around 19 to 20 in the early 17h century. Maryland women married even younger at 17 to 18, while for Virginians it was closer to 21[14]. The difference during the early colonial period is much smaller for men, who married mid to late twenties in the colonies. This was only a couple of years lower than that of English men. Mirroring developments in England, the gap in ages between spouse closed overtime. Women's age at first marriage climbed back up to almost 24 by the 19th century, while men's dropped slightly to around 25-26. In both cases, the mean age of different colonies evened out over time. Many cultures elsewhere in the world did have lower marriage ages than contemporary Europeans. For instance, Song China at the start of this period had legal minimum ages of marriage set at 16 for men and 14 for women. A survey[15]. of tomb inscriptions found on average, women married when slightly over 18 to men slightly over 23. Similarly, in Japan during the early modern period, women were found[4] to have married around 16.7 to 22.7. By the late 18th and 19th centuries, especially in areas of high commercial development, women's mean age of marriage had rose to around 22-25[16]. References: [1] Herlihy, David.

Did Vladimir Lenin have a cat?,"It appears that Lenin did indeed own several cats over the years. According to Louis Fischer's The Life of Lenin (the source cited by the Wikipedia article): He had had a brown cat in Geneva.  During her visit to Lenin at Gorky shortly following the August 30, 1918, attempt on his life, Angelica Balabanoff saw two cats in the household. Lincoln Eyre, an American journalist who went to Lenin's Kremlin apartment, noted that the dictator was ""fond"" of his several cats. One reasonably well-known image that you may have seen is this one:  (click to enlarge) According to this article in the Guardian newspaper, the photograph was taken in 1922 by Lenin's sister ""at his residence in the village of Gorki"", and so could very well show one of the two cats seen by Angelica Balabanoff in 1918."
"What is this symbol in a financial record from Wisconsin, USA, in 1860?","That looks like the archaic form of the letter ""s"". Shown here in the word ""Congress"" from the original US Bill of Rights:  The Latin name for that long-s glyph is ""solidus"", which also happens to be the word from which we got the word ""shilling"". Of course this was not a coincidence. This glyph looks a bit like a slash '/', but is different (note that in the ledger it dips below the line, and curls outward a bit at the tips). Solidus was (and in some places still is) used as a currency separator, particularly between shillings and pence. So looks very much like that indicates the units on the entry are in shillings. Of course the USA had been on the Dollar standard for quite a while by then, but it does appear that people in the USA were in fact still also occasionally using shillings as a unit into the 1860s, valued at 24 US cents each1. Supposedly, in old-fashioned £sd Accounting, a notation of ""X/Y"" meant ""X shillings, Y pence"". A dash in the pence slot (""X/-"") meant 0 pence. So those columns would be ""12 shillings, 0 pence"" and ""10 shillings, 0 pence"" respectively. According to our Wikipedia reference ,that would be about $2.88 and $2.40 respectively. However, it was pointed out in comments that the 24 figure isn't very well documented1, and the more typical factor in standard £sd accounting is 12. That would cut those figures in half, to $1.44 and $1.20 respectively, which is a figure more in line with what Semaphore reports as the average for those two columns in that state ($1.73 and $1.30). 1 - I tried to find a better reference for this, but it quickly looked to be an effort worthy of its own question.

How were horses disembarked from sail ships?,"Basically three options: The easiest and most preferable way. Might require specialised or retrofitted ships:

(The Puerto Rican Paso Fino ) If waters/shore and ship railing are all low enough then of course just a little jump suffices. 'Lifting' already is quite difficult and carries great risk of broken bones. This 'jumping' is dashing and even more prone to animal injury. A jump, or 'drop' was not really uncommon, but may require the horse to swim the last bit, meaning a fully armed and armored rider is unlikely to take the leap as well: 
(Anne Arundels' Horse: Transporting Horses) Note that horses can swim, but certainly not that good if outfitted for attack as a war horse, or even in armour. Swimming is one of the most aerobic activities that animals can do. A 10-minute swim is equivalent to a several-mile canter, so don't overdo it.(src) The problem of shallow waters and horses on a big ship with nowhere to dock is illustrated here: A Byzantine navy would do it like this: In the non-tidal waters of the Mediterranean war galleys, like the dromons and the khelandia, would have been suitable for any sort of landing on a hostile beach, unlike the heavy and round-hulled pamphylos, which required a dock. The horse-transport units of the Byzantine fleet had been equipped with a climax since at least the early tenth century, which was a ramp used for the loading and unloading of the horses from the ship’s gunwales, either from the stern or usually from the bow. This term is mentioned in the De Ceremoniis for the Cretan expeditions of 911, 949 and 960/126 and reveals the necessary modifications to the ships when they had to carry horses, such as hatches not just to the sides but also on the decks, leading down into the holds, while further modifications would have been engineered in the hulls of the ships concerning the stabling of the horses. According to Pryor, the khelandia were indeed specialised horse transports, able to carry between twelve and twenty horses. But these must have been built differently from dromons when it comes to the dimensions of the ship’s beam, which would have been much wider to accommodate both the lower bank oarsmen and the horses. A significant structural difference between the tenth-century Byzantine transport ships and their Italian counterparts in the twelfth century was that the latter placed both banks of oarsmen on the upper deck, thus making more room for the horses in the ship’s hull.

The back-breaking task of handling cargo is most easily accomplished by mooring the ship at a wharf, setting a gangway from dock to ship, or, for heavier loads, utilizing a harbour crane or pulleys rigged from the ship’s mast and spars. Not all harbours were deep enough for large ships to reach dock, nor did all inhabited coastal regions have specially built wharves or jetties; these became more common from the beginning of the 12th century. A range of loading practices are alluded to in one scene of the 11th-century northern European Bayeux Tapestry: ‘one boat being beached, another coming to anchor in the shallows, and others fastened to a mooring post’. It should be remembered that at least two transport ship types existed: large, sailed nave roundship transports and oared transports. It seems reasonable to conclude that the horses could disembark, armed and mounted from some transport ships but not all, and that some horse ports were positioned lower in the hull. Large nave with horse ports were nailed shut, sealed, and caulked. It may be hard to believe that the ports were actually below the waterline, as is explicitly stated by Joinville, Bonolis, and Jal, but surely, the ports were caulked for good reason. However, caulking may not have been necessary on oared transports designed with the horse port well above the waterline, discharging from a weather deck. Robert of Clari testifies that saddled, armed horses embarked and landed through horse ports, and Count Charles’ description, too, makes it clear that on his ships, the horse port swung open at the stern and was large enough for both horse and rider, mounted and fully armed, to disembark. Count Charles recognized that such a large opening created a structural weakness that needed to be fortified by larger deck beams and the addition of strong timbers.

From another thread:   With big ships transporting lots of horses and no port or docking in sight, and beaching the vessel not an option, there is basically just one option for quick readiness and in full bridle, unload the horses from a big ship onto a boat with shallow draught, then proceed to landing ground with the horses on those:

How did gold come to symbolize lower ranks than silver in the United States Air Force?,"It's historical, dating from before the two colours represented different ranks instead of different branches of the army, as a cost-saving measure (essentially). From Wikipedia: The Army origin explains why the color silver outranks gold in Air
  Force officer insignia. In the early 19th century, Army infantry
  colonels wore gold eagles, while all other Army colonels wore silver
  eagles. When the Army later decided to adopt a single color of eagles
  for all colonels, that single color was silver, apparently because
  more silver eagles than gold eagles were already in use. Lieutenant
  colonels received silver oak leaves next, to match the silver eagles
  of full colonels. Majors were then given gold oak leaves to
  distinguish them from lieutenant colonels. Once the precedent of
  silver outranking gold was set, it was followed when gold bars were
  later created for second lieutenants, who had no grade-specific
  insignia until the early 20th century. Update: I found this complete History of U.S. Army Grade Insignia  through 1866. I note that the early adoption of silver jewelry resulted in a high contrast when worn over gold epaulettes. Also, as late as 1866 Second Lieutenants wore no insignia jewel while First Lieutenants and Captains wore a silver jewel with high contrast against the gold braid. This is completely consistent with the note in Wikipedia that I quoted above."
Why did the Republic of China retract its simplified Chinese characters?,"Victor Henry Mair is an American Sinologist and professor of Chinese at the University of Pennsylvania, and this is what he wrote (emphasis mine): An English language report in The Quarterly Bulletin of Chinese Bibliography states that, on October 4, 1935, the government “authorized” the use of simplified characters in official and private documents.  In other words, the government granted permission for the use of simplified characters, but did not insist that they be used. This passive attitude toward script reform was not sufficiently powerful to undermine the edifice of well-established tradition it faced. Thus in January of 1936 the simplified character scheme was withdrawn before it could be truly applied. This withdrawal is typically attributed to the intervention of Dai Jitao, an influential conservative in the government who used his connections in the Ministry of Education to have the scheme rescinded.  Whether or not the withdrawal can be traced back to a specific individual, conservative opposition was certainly the major factor in its failure. Source: Victor H.

Where did the “vikings wear helmets with horn” stereotype come from and why?,"It started with the vikings themselves... Helmets with horns? Depictions of an Iron Age date exist featuring people with horned helmets/heads, such as upon the Golden Horns. Similar images are also known from the Viking period itself. In the Oseberg burial from Norway, which dates to the early Viking period, a tapestry was found on which horned helmets are also depicted. Does this prove that all Vikings wore the famous helmets with horns? The answer is probably not. However, there is some evidence to suggest that certain warriors wore such headgear. The horned figures on the Golden Horns are berserkers. These were wild warriors, who threw themselves into battle in a trance-like fury. We are also familiar with them from the Icelandic sagas, in which they are amongst the most feared of all Vikings. It is also possible that such headgear was worn for display or for cultic purposes. In a battle situation, horns on a helmet would get in the way. Such helmets would also have caused problems on board the warships, where space was already at a premium. In addition, none of the contemporary sources mention Vikings wearing horned headgear. Viking helmets The idea that all vikings wore these horned helmets is a more recent invention... The popular image of the strapping Viking in a horned helmet dates back to the 1800s, when Scandinavian artists like Sweden’s Gustav Malmström included the headgear in their portrayals of the raiders. When Wagner staged his “Der Ring des Nibelungen” opera cycle in the 1870s, costume designer Carl Emil Doepler created horned helmets for the Viking characters, and an enduring stereotype was born. Did Vikings really wear horned helmets?"
How do I find the sources which determined the year of the fall of Babylon?,"One way to go about this type of research is to simply dig deeper, one step at the time: review the bibliography of the articles you've run into, and read the citations of potential interest. Rinse and repeat until you finally locate one or more articles that argue about the precise date - historians aren't the type of scholars who take ancient texts at face value, so you'll necessarily run into such articles if you dig deep enough. A shortcut for the above is to head to Google scholar directly, enter something like ""Fall of Babylon date"", and hit Search. Doing so will reveal a heap of articles that argue about the date and how it was arrived at (i.e. considerations such as astronomy, other events that were occurring at the same time documented in this or that source, and so forth). The shortcut method might require a bit of digging deeper too, but it'll often be faster. This article from the first page of the above-mentioned Google Scholar results, for instance, includes a tasty looking citation in footnote 7. The book is out of print but you can download it from U Chicago: R. A. Parker and W. H. Dubberstein, Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.-A.D. 75 (Providence: Brown U, 1956), 29."
Did the United States have a third atomic bomb to drop on Japan?,"Ray Monk in Inside the Center: The Life of J. Robert Oppenheimer tells the story  thus: Truman returned to Washington from Potsdam on the evening of 7 August
  and was immediately caught up in a whirlwind of activity generated by
  Groves, who was determined to proceed as quickly as possible with a
  second bombing of Japan. He and Admiral William Purnell, Groves writes
  in his autobiography, 'had often discussed the importance of having
  the second bomb follow the first one quickly', so that the Japanese
  would not have time to recover their balance'. This second bomb would
  have to be of the Fat Man type, there being no chance of assembling
  another uranium bomb at this stage (in fact, the Little Boy remained
  one of its kind; the Fat Man design, despite its complicated assembly,
  being easier to manufacture, safer to transport and more powerful).
  After the success of the Trinity test, the only thing standing in the
  way of using a Fat Man bomb in Japan was the availability of
  plutonium. Groves had originally been advised that a plutonium bomb
  could be ready to use on August 20. At the end of July, this was
  revised to 11 August. Groves, however, was too impatient to wait that
  long and, somewhat against the advice he was given by the scientists,
  saw to it that the bomb was assembled, loaded and ready to use by the
  evening of 8 August [...] Immediately after the Nagasaki bombing the Allies did not possess any
  more atomic bombs. It is true, as Groves puts it, 'our entire
  organization both at Los Alamos and at Tinian was maintained in a
  state of complete readiness to prepare additional bombs', but, as he
  himself reported to General Marshall, the earliest data at which the
  next bomb could be assembled for use was 17 August, and almost
  everybody expected the war to be over by then. BTW, there are also interesting original documents available from the Truman Library. And if you want my personal opinion: two such bombs were more than enough."
Did Henry VIII have his bedroom bricked up every night?,"I can't find any academic source to support the story. Given the logistics involved, I reckon the amateur historians have it right.

To quote Greg Jenner (Chief History ""Nerd"" on BBC's Horrible Histories) on Twitter  Haha thanks, it's one of those half dubious stories which circulate and we thought it would be fun to run with it He also made the observation: Feel free to ask around, we are well aware many facts are possibly
  myths but until they are disproved they remain usable on a comedy show On balance, it's a fun story, but probably one to be taken with a large pinch of sodium chloride."
When was Silver ever more valuable than Gold?,"From ""The origin of metallic currency and weight standards""  By Sir William Ridgeway (Google books); University Press, 1892 ... We saw that the Arabs of the Soudan down to the present day prefer silver to gold whilst in the earlier part of the present century when Japan was opened to European commerce the Japanese eagerly exchanged gold for silver at the rate of one to three and even less as they possessed no native silver and were charmed with the beauty of the little known metal. . ... It is almost certain that in all countries at one stage silver must have been of higher value than gold. Afterwards as its production became greater it became equal in value and finally little by little much less valuable until at last the relation between the metals is 1/22. All this on pages 145/146; the earlier pages give some historical document references for these."
"Why did modern ""Romania"" remain the most ""Roman"" part of the Balkans?","I would say this had a lot to do with the Eastern Roman Empire's influence. You probably know, before the fifth century fall of Rome, the empire was divided east and west with two separate emperors. The west was overrun by Germanic tribes such as the Vandals, Goths, etc. The east hung on for many centuries more, until the Muslims conquered the area around the late sixteenth century, I believe. We now often refer to this eastern empire as the Byzantine empire, though this is mostly a historical term. Throughout the middle ages they continued to call themselves Roman and adhered to that old culture and identity. The Byzantines encompassed a good sized piece of south eastern Europe, including modern Romania's general area and I'm pretty sure at least some of Greece for a time. You can find a lot of very interesting information about Scandinavian (Vikings) floating down the rivers of eastern Europe to trade with these people and even to become the famed and feared warriors of the Varangian Guard, the personal elite soldiers of the 'Emperors'. Harald Hadrada was one such warrior before dying at Stamford Bridge.
Most relevant to your question about Romania specifically, is that in the early 1200s, Constantinople was captured by crusaders, who formed it into a state called the ""Romanian Empire"" or the ""Latin Empire of Constantinople"". So that's probably the most explicit reason for Romania in particular to take on that identity seriously, while Bulgaria and other neighbours didn't get a lot of attention as they did.

Is there a historical precedent to the vaccine scare?,"Actually, the exact same thing happened in Brazil, but with a real uprising: Vaccine Revolt (Wikipedia).

Has women's suffrage ever decided an election?,"You're not the first person to ask this question.

In this most recent midterm they estimated/predicted that an all male electorate would have elected a majority Republican House of Representatives.

Which battle was the most lopsided result in terms of casualties?,"It's actually quite difficult to point to a specific answer because, as your Boudica example shows, in many cases casualty estimates are not very reliable. The 80,000 figure given for Boudica's forces is considered to be a rhetorical device and not an actual factual number - a problem that plagues many pre-modern accounts. Another difficulty is measuring what counts for casualty. Historically, a great part of war losses comes from disease and illness, rather than direct combat. Moreover, there is no unified standard for counting what passes for ""wounded"" in historical records. Nonetheless, here are some contenders: Operation Desert Storm Among larger set piece battles, this is probably the clear winner. Coalition forces suffered about 1,155 casualties (379 deaths and 776 wounded). Iraqi casualties are less clear, but early claims of 100,000 fatalities are wildly implausible. A more reasonable estimate would be 26,000 killed or wounded with about 83,000 captured. Even with this conservative estimate, the ratio remains an astonishing 1:94. If prisoners are excluded, this ratio falls to a still high 1:22.5. Desert Storm also contained a number of heavily lopsided engagements, most notably the Highway of Death during which Coalition forces suffered no casualties, giving an effectively infinite ratio. Battle of Omdurman The Anglo-Egyptian-Sudanese force took about 430 casualties (48 dead and 382 wounded). The army of Abdullah al-Taashi lost around 30,000, including 12,000 dead, 13,000 wounded and 5,000 captured. This gives a ratio of 1:69, or 1:250 if we only count fatalities. Battle of Majuba Hill Probably the most lopsided result in a relatively evenly matched engagement. The Boers lost only 1 dead and 5 wounded, but managed to inflict 92 fatalities, 134 wounded and 59 captured on British forces. This is a ratio of 1:47.5, or 1:92 if we only count fatalities. It is very rare for pre-industrial battles to achieve ratios like Desert Storm or colonial skirmishes at any scale, although some total disintegrations of the defeated side did occur. In such cases casualties are not necessarily combat deaths or injuries or captured, but often also from exposure during a long rout or simply desertion. Some contenders are: Battle of Tumu A 230,000 or 500,000 (estimated actual size vs paper strength) strong Chinese army led by the Ming Emperor was destroyed by a Oirat cavalry force of around 20,000. Precise casualties are not known, but Chinese records indicate that the expedition was entirely annihilated. Even assuming they costed the Oirats extremely dearly, the ratio couldn't have been any lower than 1:23 or so, and might be (but probably isn't) as high as 1:166 going by Wikipedia figures. Battle of Fei River A Jin force about 80,000 was able to crush an 870,000 invading Qin force through inducing a panicked rout. Again detailed casualty numbers are unavailable, however the Qin Emperor was recorded to have returned with only 20-30% of his original force. Traditional sources indicate minimal Jin casualties, though some online sources claim 5,000 with no clear evidence. Conservatively estimating a Qin 600,000 casualty, most of which incurred during the rout, and assuming a more reasonable 10,000 lost for the Jin, that still gives a ratio of 1:60. Mongol Invasions I feel this deserve to be mentioned. During the Mongol Empire's expansion into Europe and elsewhere, they fought several militarily wildly successful battles that annihilated entire armies. For example, the Battle of the kalka River, or the Siege of Bagdad, and the Battle of Liegnitz. The ratios are particularly lopsided because the Mongolians could chase down routed enemies with great lethality. However, there are usually no reliable estimates for Mongolian casualties, so no real ratio can be calculated. Other honourable mentions: Battle of Kircholm One of the most successful heavy cavalry charges of all time. The Polish-Lithuanians are said to have suffered about 300 casualties (100 dead and 200 wounded); the Swedish army however lost between 7,600 to 8,900 men, most killed or executed as they were routed. That's a ratio of 1:25-30. Battle of Rorke's Drift Example of lopsided victories for a heavily outnumbered force. About 150 British and colonial soldiers held off a 3,500 strong Zulu force, inflicting 351 confirmed kills for 17 fatalities in the process. Including 15 British and an estimated 500 Zulu wounded, the ratio is 1:26.6."
"Why, in old movies and TV series, do they always use such extremely exaggerated wheel turns when driving a car?","In old cars you had to turn the wheel a lot further, because there was no power steering. For a feel of that, push a car when the engine is dead and try to steer it without engine assistance (it's hard!). Also the actors would have to act driving with no idea what the screen behind them was doing, and often still do."
How were Martello towers supposed to work?,"That was the whole idea behind it. Not every bit of coastline is liable to invasion. Only on certain beaches troops could be landed. Steep cliffs and dangerous shallows didn't need protection. Place a very strong defense tower with a gun crew, and that single gun crew could keep a possible invasion force at bay. Don't forget that coastal defense has the advantage of stability - the earth (hopefully) doesn't move as much as the waves do. They had a much better chance of hitting their target than any naval vessel. Not to mention they had all the time in the world to pre-plan possible targets.  One Martello tower with a crew of, say, 20 could (at least in theory) keep several heavily armed warships with many hundreds of crew away. "
Are there any accounts written by torturers on their actions?,"Takashi Nagase wrote a book about his experiences during and after the Second World War entitled Crosses and Tigers, and financed a Buddhist temple on the Thai-Burma railway to atone for his actions during the war.  This included his time as a Kempeitai (military secret police) interpreter and torturer in a prison camp on the railway.  He later befriended Eric Lomax, one of his former victims. The story is told in The Railway Man, Lomax's autobiography and the subsequent film."
How did Moscow become the capital/most important city in Russia?,"Yes. Originally, Moscow became a center of power as a defensive measure against Mongols, since it was seen as a ""remote, forested location"" for the descendants of Kievan Rus. One Wikipedia article says that ""a number of rivers provided access to the Baltic and Black Seas and to the Caucasus region"", but it seems to me it is in the Volga basin, so the best access would be to the Caspian Sea. Anyway, it does seem like a somewhat random place, with the location presently known as Nizhny Novgorod being a more obvious alternative at the time. In the modern time, the immediate reason to move the capital to Moscow was an anticipated loss of Petrograd to the German offensive. In February 1918, Lenin's military situation was desperate and he was in fact lucky to achieve a peace at a cost of ""only"" Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Belarus and Ukraine. Moving the capital of the Soviet Russia to Kiev was out of the question, because it was a Ukrainian city. Despite strong russification (especially in the 19th century), it remained Ukrainian. Even after establishment of the USSR, Russia remained a dominant republic, having more people and industry than Ukraine, so there was no reason to move the center of political power to a not-so-sure location."
Why does Latin America have a higher number of surviving Native Americans than North America?,"I think you are missing the true pattern of that map. Note that it shows a higher percentage of natives in Canada than it does in the US, and shows the same lower percentage of natives in the USA as in a geographically contiguous area of South America (1% or less). If anything, the real pattern there is that areas in the subtropics (but not subartic) have almost no natives left, whereas areas outside that zone tend to have more. For comparison, here's a map of the subtropical climate zones.  The correspondence between these areas and the ""fertile crescent"" is no coincidence. That's where almost all European crops were domesticated, and thus where they grow best. Other areas may be useful to rule, but to come settle and live, a European society needs a place its crops can grow. (Note the yellow bands in South Africa and Australia and New Zeeland. Its no coincidence those are the only areas of significant European habitation in Africa and SE Asia/Oceana respectively. To take a more detailed look, below is a worldwide climate zone map. The European crop package can grow well anywhere you see tan (semi-arid), green (temperate), yellow (Mediterranean), or the lighter of the more greeny blues (warmer Continental). Those areas match up almost perfectly with your map above of where native populations were completely eclipsed. Which Europeans ended up colonizing an area doesn't seem to have had an appreciable affect.  So the answer here is that natives were pushed(wiped?) out nearly everywhere their land was useful for European agriculture."
Why did the USA invade Okinawa instead of one of the many other islands in southern Japan,"The Allies weren't taking Okinawa for B-29 runways. They had those already in the Mariana Islands. A B-29 airfield was built on Okinawa, but the first attack from it against Japan happened on the last night of the war. The primary reason for taking Okinawa was as a base for the invasion of Japan, both for ships and shorter-ranged aircraft. Okinawa has harbours, and Kadena Air Base had already been built by the Japanese. This required taking all of the Ryukyu Islands, and that's what was done. The Battle of Okinawa is the famous part of this campaign, because the Japanese concentrated their resistance there, knowing that while they held the main island, the other islands would be of limited use. You can't set up mobile fleet bases while the enemy are still within artillery or small-boat attack range. The other islands in the group were taken comparatively easily, so the combats are not famous. Sources: Okinawa, 1945: Final Assault on the Empire, Simon Foster, 1996 and  Okinawa: The Last Battle, the relevant volume of the US official history, available here. Addendum: Of course, once you have a base, other uses for it emerge. In July 1945, Halsey's Third Fleet attacked the Tokyo area, and then, as best the Japanese could tell from radio intercepts and direction-finding, moved south. This was confirmed when carrier aircraft attacked Kyushu, the southernmost main island of Japan, and Japanese aircraft were moved south for a counter-strike on the Third Fleet. But it wasn't there. The radio intercepts had been staged from the USS Tucson, which had separated from the fleet, carrying radio operators from Halsey's staff and sailed south, imitating Third Fleet's traffic. The carrier aircraft had flown from Okinawa. Third Fleet was located again when it attacked steel plants and rail ferries in Hokkaido and northern Honshu, and the Japanese were unable to retaliate effectively. This raid sank eight and damaged four of the twelve rail ferries that carried coal from Hokkaido to Honshu, cutting the amount of coal that could be transported from the mines in Hokkaido to industry in Honshu by 80%, and crippling Japanese war production.

WW2: Did US marines and soldiers really go into action with unbuckled helmet chin straps?,"Yes, they did. Not all, but a very many, especially the more veteran soldiers. I don't have time to get sources together, but will when I do. Reasons were varied. Some believed that being close to over-pressure events (artillery, etc) could cause a head injury with the large helmet being force up and the tough leather strap breaking the neck. This was supported by more than one army regiment actually giving written orders to their men to not buckle up. 
From usmilitariaforum.com 
From usmilitariaforum.com Others believed that an enemy soldier could sneak up behind, in hand-to-hand combat, and use the leverage of the helmets front lip with the strap and break the neck using the back edge. Having worn a 'steel pot' in my earliest army time, I will say the number one thing about it, by far is it is heavier than any other hat I ever wore on my head. When running, whether or not the chin strap was properly fastened, that pot would rock forward and back and side to side, taking my head with it, such that I was forced to use a hand to keep it in place regardless of the strap! Now, considering that the original strap was just a strip of some material that was itchy and scratchy, I can easily understand why soldiers wouldn't want it done up. Even the later straps, like I used, made of nylon and cotton webbing, would be quite the sweat magnet and end up very rough. Finally, one of the biggest reasons, directly related to the weight (did I say it is VERY heavy?) was that a soldier would want to remove it whenever and wherever possible, as soon as possible. Figuring that soldiers, even those in the front lines, spend most of their time not actually fighting, but standing, sitting, waiting, marching, being trucked here and there, would tire of constantly doing and undoing the pain in the ass d-ring connections.

What were the main causes of successful take over of India by Britain?,"There are a good number of reasons why the British were able to do so, and in fact rule over India effectively for over a century. The British agreed to maintain a permanent and fixed subsidiary force within the territory of their ally. In return, they didn't take money but took over a part of the territory of the ally. A British officer called ""resident"" was placed at the court of the ruler.{he could interfere in the internal matters of the kingdom} The ally could not maintain any relation with any other ruler without the approval of the British.{so,when the rulers wanted to revolt against the British they are alone.} The Indian rulers felt a false sense of security but in reality they were losing their independence. On the other hand the Britishers maintained large forces at the expenses of the Indian rulers and also increase their area of influence. Some states brought under control through this policy are Hyderabad, Tanjore, Awadh, etc. At the end of it all, the British had the advantage of better manpower, were militarily more powerful and stronger, and add to it they had some very canny strategists too. And the disunity among Indian princely states, their constant warring with each other, just added to the advantage."
What do the modern Japanese people think about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki?,"The effects of Hiroshima and Nagasaki run quite deeply.  One of the most profound effects is that Japan is very pacifistic and one of the few (if not the only country) that has outlawed war.  Article 9 of the Japanese constitution prohibits the Japanese government from declaring war, although permits Japan to maintain a self-defense force.  Since the end of WWII Japan's conditions of surrender and reliance on American markets has forced it to maintain US military bases which are widely disliked, especially in Okinawa where there have been numerous demonstrations against the American presence there (Blowback by Chalmers Johnson  provides a very detailed analysis of Japanese concerns with US military presence). Being the only country that had been the target of nuclear weapons, Japan also is very much against the development of nuclear weapons.  One of the conditions of American forces being deployed in Japan is that nuclear weapons not be deployed on Japanese soil, and Japan has been stridently against weaponizing their nuclear program.  Unfortunately, the American military establishment routinely mocks this requirement by having nuclear weapons deployed on naval craft stationed ""in transit"" in Japanese waters.  In essence, the relationship between Japan and America in the last 60 years has been complex.  Japan's quick growth has been heavily reliant on preferential access to American markets and technology (to an extent where the US has been willing to harm its own balance of trade and allow Japanese firms to co-opt American companies trade secrets).  In return the Japanese political establishment has allowed American forces to be stationed in Okinawa indefinitely.  While this benefits most of Japan, Okinawa has had to surrender the best 20% of its land and has received the least of the benefits of Japan's growth.  The Okinawans have thus been the most vocal opponents of the American military presence.   TO SUM: The benefits of America bending over backwards to provide favorable trading terms for Japan, and the ability of the Japanese to exploit this, has lead to a more prosperous Japan.  These developments have generally overshadowed not only the past animosity over the war and nuclear bombings, but much of the tensions that arise between American militarism and Japanese pacifism as well. (The exception being in Okinawa of course).    "
Why did Italy abandon its alliance with Germany in WW1 and join the Allied side?,"Italy's main issue was its enmity with Austria-Hungary, Germany's main ally. That made Italy the ""odd man out"" in the so-called Triple Alliance with the other two. Italy had joined (reluctantly) with Germany out of a fear of France. This occurred when France and Britain concluded an alliance that made Britain responsible for the mutual defense of the English Channel, and freed the French fleet to concentrate in the Mediterranean, possibly against Italy. When World War I broke out, Italy found that it had nothing to fear from France (or Britain, or Russia for that matter). On the other hand, it would have a lot to fear from a victorious Austria Hungary, from which she had taken Lombardy and Venice in the 19th century (the former when allied with France). So when Britain and France offered Italy Tyrol and Trieste from Austria, Italy jumped at the bait and switched sides.   "
Why were British ships not of the same quality as French and Spanish ships until the latter part of the 18th century?,"I think that N.A.M Rodger covers this quite well in chapter 27 of his book ""The Command of the Ocean"". It was for long an article of faith among naval historians that eighteenth century British warships were inferior to their French and Spanish opponents, because British shipwrights remained wedded to craft traditions while their continental rivals were men of education who applied mathematics and science to the solution of their problems. This judgement flattered, and sometimes still flatters, a range of agreeable prejudices. It fitted the eighteenth-century upper classes' admiration for France as the home of social glamour and prestige. It expressed British sea officers' conviction that as men of honour they were both morally and practically superior to civilian technicians; it magnified their courage and judgement when they won, and excused their failures when they lost. That is the British of the time had good reason to be overly critical of their own vessels and the British have always seen glory in being the successful underdog. However, a key consideration is the purpose to which the ships were put: Moreover the comparision between 'good' French and 'bad' British design rests on the naive assumption that the two were directly comparable, that British and French designers were building the same size and types of ship, to fulfil the same functions - in other words that the strategic situations of the two countries was the same. and Rodger adds, The proper question to ask of all ship designs is not how well they compared to one another, but how well they corresponded to each country's strategic priorities, and how wisely those priorities had been chosen.   That can be seen in how the British deployed their ships compared to the French and Spanish. As the century passed, the British aimed for what Mahan called ""Sea Power"", ensuring that their merchant fleet was protected and that their enemies' fleets were not free to move on the oceans. This required vessels that were able to stay at sea for long periods in all weathers. By comparison, the French and Spanish deployed their ships for specific missions, keeping them sheltered in port when not otherwise required. So their vessels didn't require the endurance of the British ships. The strategic priorities would determine the number of ships needed and their roles. The British approach needed lots of ships so even if the rivals had the same levels of naval expenditure, the British would have to spend less per ship (in both construction and maintenance) than the French and Spanish.  The fighting ability of a sailing warship is not simply a function of the vessel itself. The quality of the officers and crew were just as important (and were possibly more important) in determining how each individual vessel performed. In fact, the same ship with a different crew might handle very differently.  Another factor in how an ship handled is how the ship was loaded and trimmed. A ship just out of port on a long mission with a full load of stores and provisions with a fresh crew would be a different proposition to the same vessel on the return being lightly loaded with an experienced crew.   I think some care needs to be taken when talking about the idea ""that British ships were sometimes built...following the plans of the beautiful and fast sailing French or Spanish ships"". When foreign warships were captured, they were handed over to naval architects who made detailed plans of the vessels (Many surviving plans of French and Spanish vessels only exist because of this practice). If the warship was seen as worthy then the British often made a copy based ""on the lines"" of the foreign ship. This means that they copied the hull form (shape) rather than it being an exact copy in all details. The British still used their own construction methods to build the ship and they followed their own standards for fitting out the vessel. Given the primitive state of scientific understanding of what made a good ship, this approach makes sense. Copying a good working design was cheaper and less risky than developing a new one from scratch.  In addition, mention of the 'Forty Thieves' in this context is misleading since these vessels were built and put into service in the early nineteenth century. The issues with these ships had more to with the particular circumstances of their procurement than with general standards of ship design and building of their time.  "
"Has there been any ""invasive plants warfare"" in the past?","Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven
is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat,
and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then
appeared the tares also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst
not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto
him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also
the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I
will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind
them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. Matthew 13:24-30, King James Bible Obviously this is just a biblical parable, not history, and whatever plant is meant under tares, it was probably native in Iudea, not ""invasive"". Also it is not speaking about warfare between states, but enmity between individual households. Nevertheless, this shows that the idea of ruining the enemies crops using plants as biological weapons existed in the ancient world."
How did cities operate in medieval times?,"Life in medieval times was in the way you are asking not much different than it is now. You may want to read The Canterbury Tales by Chaucer. In many of the stories he paints a picture of day to day life in Medieval England and you will see it was not too much different than things are now. To answer some of your specific points: The middle class: there most certainly was a middle class. In England the middle class included two main types of people: villeins and yeoman. A villein was a tenant farmer who was bound to the land, a serf. A yeoman owned his own land. Most tradespeople, crafters, and technicians were yeomen. Homes: people did own homes, but they were more simple and smaller than those today. A very common design was a round house with a single room and a thatched roof. The floor was dirt, but was covered with soft rushes, called ""thresh"". You would sleep on a mattress of straw, or a bed if you were well off. A young person, or a poorer person would just sleep on woven straw mats. Children: very young children had no clothes, but a blanket, but when they got to be 3 or 4 they might get a tunic, unless their parents were really poor. There was no school so children just ran around and did what they wanted unless they had chores to do or work given by their parents. Once a child was about 6-8 they could work doing sewing and other simple chores, feeding hogs or whatever. Poor families sometimes put their children to work against their will to help earn money to eat. This would result in runaways. Wives: Some women would be married and do whatever was necessary around the home. Making cloth and clothing consumed a lot of time which kept women busy. Many women would be unattached, being spinsters, free spirits, or widows. Such women would work for a living being, well, spinsters (you guessed it) or knitters. There were usually certain professions set aside for single women, such as ale making. Many women were doctors/herbalists and harlotry was common. Men: Men did all the sort of work you might expect. ""Official"" or state-sponsored jobs were somewhat more scarce than they are now, so men often had more off-hand jobs being handymen or what were called ""hands"", doing menial labor. There were a lot of bums, beggars, and bag ladies, and there was no incarceration of crazy people the way it is now, so anyone with a mental disability just wandered around. They were called ""fools"". Eating: It was a little bit harder to get food than it is now, but in the towns there was usually a dole of some kind. Also, you could often find work for food digging ditches or cutting wood. Desperate people could eat worms, nettles, seeds and other such wild food. Churches gave out food, just like they do now. Regular food in England was barley or rye bread. Even a menial laborer could make enough to pay for bread and some extra. Most people had at least a wooden bowl and spoon. A really poor person would eat with their hands. A yeoman would usually have fork, knife and spoon with pottery plates and cups. The table for most people was like what a park bench and table would be today. Chairs would be only for the upper middle class and above. Most people could afford fish or meat at least once a week and fats and suet were traded around to make soups, which most people had every day. A common dish was gruel, which was oats or barley mixed with milk, what we would call ""cereal"" today."
"When did the hypocrisy to call a dictatorship ""free, democratic, republic etc."" start?","It started at least with the rule of Gaius Octavius, a.k.a. Augustus. He was a dictator (Imperator) but Rome was continued to be called republic, consuls and Senate continued to be ""elected"". But the supreme power became lifetime, and the
Imperator appointed a heir, usually a real or adopted son. Since then, this is a custom in some dictatorships. The term ""People's democracy"" was invented by Stalin (Soviet dictator, who claimed that he rules a democratic, constitutional state). The first ""People's Democracies"" were Eastern European states, PRC and North Korea. Then some countries in Africa and Asia followed the example. Usually such countries have all attributes of democracy: a constitution and parliaments, even an ""elected president"". But really this is a rule of one person, who is secretly elected by a small band, called Politburo of the Communist party, usually for life time, unless the same Politburo stages a coup.
The only difference is that in some of these countries this power is hereditary and in others it is not. Correction. As Bartek Chom noticed correctly in his comment to another answer, the term was not invented by Stalin, but it was also used by the short lived Ukrainian and Belorussian People's republics. However these states were not communist dictatorships. "
Why is the island of Java so populated?,"One important factor is soil fertility: Java’s soils are very fertile because of periodic enrichment by volcanic ash. In contrast, with the two nearby large Indonesian islands of Borneo (shared with Brunei and Malaysia) and Sumatra: Borneo, the world’s third largest island, has exemplary rainforest soils: shallow and nutrient poor. The abundance of rain in these ancient ecosystems has leached the soil for millions of years. In contrast to overpopulated Java the neighbouring island of Sumatra still provides huge unused land reserves. However, by far not all of these reserves can be regarded as real agricultural potentials, e.g. for resettlement projects. Especially the poor soils often prove an agricultural handicap. Besides soil fertility the existing vegetation has to be considered. Thus, for example, the so called ""alang alang grass savannas"" in general show better potentialities than forest areas, while most of the swamps prove rather unsuitable for agricultural development. (I don't think it makes sense to compare Java with islands like Honshu or Madagascar that are in other countries with entirely different histories.)"
Why is it that the maiden name is traditionally dropped when a woman is getting married?,"Is this something that predates back many civilizations ago? Or is this a relatively newfound trend? In general, it is a relatively new trend of the last few centuries, and many old cultures have/had no such concept or tradition. Keep in mind that surnames in many cultures are a relatively new trend. There was no name to drop upon marriage if you didn't have a surname. The Nordic cultures, for instance, historically used patronymic ""surnames"". These generally would not change. Emma Jonsdóttir does not cease to be Emma, Daughter of Jon upon marrying Erik Eriksson. Similar practices existed among other peoples such as the Welsh, for example, well into the Early Modern Era. On the other hand, some cultures like Greek would have referred to the married woman as ""wife of Erik"". In cultures with longer histories of using surnames, many did not historically expect women drop their surnames at all. In the far east, examples include the Koreans, Japanese or Vietnamese. While some Chinese women added their husbands' surname on top of their own, it is a social use and not a surname change. Most women in recorded Chinese history are in fact identified by their birth surnames only (i.e. my honourable mother <Maiden Surname> from Kiangnan). The same is also true in the Near East, among Iranians and Arabs. Even in Western Europe, up until the the Early Modern Era, Scottish women of the lowlands did not customarily drop their maiden names. There are also the well known examples of Romance cultures such as the Spanish. Further back, Ancient Roman women did not change their nomen upon marriage, either. In the English speaking world, dropping the maiden name became standard after surnames became common among the English people; sometime in the 13th and 14th centuries. So no, it did not predate civilisation. In fact, this whole practice is not nearly as common or ""traditional"" as it might seem. The main cultures to have such a tradition seem to be Anglophone, (Germanic) Western Europe and Slavic ones. Why is it that the maiden name is traditionally dropped when a woman is getting married? This is a lot more murky. In the English tradition, it is often said to be rooted in women being quasi-properties of their husbands without a separate legal existence; and that therefore they take their husbands name to mark themselves as extensions of the man of the family. It is difficult to determine the veracity of this claim. Generally speaking, however, I'm more inclined to argue that the practice of dropping maiden names occur in two situations:"
What would have been the typical drinks for a US farmer in the late 18th/early 19th century?,"The time period of interest is entirely prior to the rise of the railways, and even to the construction of such infrastructure as the Erie Canal (completed 1825). Thus anything regarded as a typical or common drink would have been strictly what could be produced with local produce. Consumption of wines, beers, ciders, whisk[e]ys and other liquors and liqueurs  from further than a few dozen miles would have been restricted to special occasions and wealthier individuals. The main classes of alcoholic beverages that might have been available in the U.S. at this time are the following: (Grape) Wine: Made from fermented grapes.
The well known varieties of Europe's vitis vinifera grapes do not put up well with North America's cold winters and hot summers, and the native North American grapes (bar hybridization) make an inferior wine. True wine aficionados will pursue making wine from any grape available, but the common palate is often unsatisfied with the result. The popularity of ciders in early North America is likely the result of the unpopularity of local wines. Ciders: non-grape wines Essentially the wine made from any fruit other than grape, such as apple, peach or pear; the former being the most prevalent. Their popularity in Revolutionary America is likely due to the non availability of quality wines at a low cost, providing inexpensive access to a low alcohol content beverage other than beers and ales. With both the falling transportation cost of European wines and the development of hybrid vinifera-labrusca grape varieties that both made a quality wine and could survive North American conditions, the popularity of ciders declines. The absence of truly satisfactory grapes for wine-making leads to a consequent absence of brandies (distilled/concentrated wines) except for the case of ciders. Apple-jack, traditionally made by jacking - allowing cider to freeze and discarding the ice to concentrate the alcohol - becomes a very popular drink in colonial America right through the 18th Century. It decreases in popularity through our period in step with the rise of American Whiskey. Other brandies are for the most part imported, and uncommon or rare until later in the 19th Century.  Beers (Lagers and Ales): made from fermented grain, most notably barley
Barley is a hardy grain, able to flourish in virtually any temperate climate, making it's fermented beverage a world-wide favourite. The ""beers"" made from grains such as rye and corn are also the base from which all whisk[e]ys are made by distillation and ageing. The ease and low cost of manufacturing it and the wide variety of climates in which the constituent grains can be grown mean that beer is always a popular drink. The distinction between ales and lagers is the temperature of fermentation, ales being warm-fermented and lagers cold-fermented. The different yeast varieties for these two fermentations usually result in ales also being top-fermented and lagers bottom-fermented, though this is not a strict distinction. The flavour distinctions between these two types of beers, and even their multitudinous varieties, would have been more typical of today's craft beers than of the mass-produced ""fructose-beers"" so popular across much of America post-prohibition. Extremely strong pride in local varieties should be expected, reminiscent of that displayed in the 1487 Leeuwarden beer riots. Whisk[e]y: Made by distilling and ageing a ""beer""
The distinction between whisky (Scotch and Canadian) and whiskey (Irish and American) is irrelevant to this question. They are all made by distilling a ""beer"" (the result of fermenting a grain mash) and then ageing the same in oak barrels. Corn whiskey or Bourbon in particular has long been a staple drink in the U.S., particularly in the Appalachian regions of the South East, as the corn used for its mash as well as the oak needed for its barrels is widely and inexpensively available. Gin, like whisk[e]y a liquor made by distilling a fermented grain mash, is predominantly flavoured by the addition of botanicals, particularly the juniper berry to yield its characteristic taste, instead of through oak aging. Prior to the development of modern distillation methods a few decades after our period it retained a distinctive malty character. This traditional style of gin is today branded as jenever. As with the whisk[e]ys there are many distinct varieties, but as the distinctions are more elaborate in origin than the originating grain I will not list them here. The strong juniper flavour typical of gins was found particularly effective in masking the bitter taste of quinine, leading to the popularity of gin and tonic in tropical climates susceptible to malaria and amongst those who had spent considerable time there. It would also have likely been popular in the New York City area due to its Dutch heritage, but less so elsewhere. Vodka: Originally, like the whisk[e]s and gins, made exclusively from grain mashes, by our time period vodka is also being made from starchy root vegetables such as potatoes and even carrots. They are distinguished by: The result of this is to give a very clean alcoholic taste amended only by the carefully selected post-distillation additives, that requires no (and receives no benefit from) ageing of any sort. It's origins are in Eastern Europe - specifically Poland and Western Russia - and is only just spreading from those regions into Scandinavia during our period. It was likely very uncommon in North America until the mass migrations from Eastern Europe at the end of the 19th century.  Rum: made by fermenting and distilling sugarcane molasses Originally a West Indian beverage, rum is already New England's most popular liquor when our time period begins, though it is a lighter product than typical in the West Indies - almost like a whiskey. During our time period rum declines in popularity as sugar from the West Indies increases in cost following the Revolution, and the development of American Whiskey varieties expands. One might even venture that American Whiskey is developed as an emulation of the light New England Rums. but distilled from grain mashes instead of molasses. Liqueurs: Highly sweetened distilled liquors of all sorts These are the co-base of most mixed drinks and cocktails, softening and hiding the alcoholic flavour of the combining liquor.  A development of the Medieval European monasteries, these were likely uncommon throughout the U.S. until canal and then rail transport became commonplace. Cocktails, mixed drinks usually made by combining a liquor with a liqueur or a sweet non-alcoholic beverage, are first attested in North America towards the end of this period. Our time period completely precedes the development of commercial non-alcoholic carbonated beverages by some decades, so the sweet co-bases would have commonly been fruit juices, or liqueur on a special occasion. However these really are saloon drinks, not beverages commonly consumed in the home or on the farm. Returning to the question at hand, the most common and popular beverages were those that were inexpensive locally - which prior to the canals and railways was those that could be made locally from local produce: Ciders; beers and ales; corn whiskeys (Bourbon); and blended whiskeys. All of these could be made by many farmers themselves, from their own produce. As the vast majority of Americans were rural inhabitants until the end of the 19th century, these inexpensive local beverages predominated. The easiest of these beverages to prepare at a lower alcoholic content, suitable for consumption by children and servants would have been small beers and small ciders at an alcohol content ranging between 0.5% and 3%, and unfermented ciders and fruit juices. Note that it is quite possible to brew beer until the yeast dies of alcohol poisoning at 12-14% (depending on yeast variety) - as strong as any wine. In strength one would broadly distinguish between the small beers (up to about 3% ABV), table beers (roughly 3% to 7% or so ABV) and strong beers (above 7% or so ABV) with local regulations possibly providing legal definitions of the ranges. Those seeking a stronger drink than strong beer or strong cider would have most commonly selected a New England Rum at the beginning of the time period, gradually shifting to an American Whiskey by the end. Both of the latter would have been much less expensive, throughout the time period, than anything imported from Europe, and offering a progressively wider variety of taste profiles as the period wears on. "
What were the reasons for making Prohibition a constitutional amendment?,"As other answers have mentioned, there were state and local laws that prohibited alcohol before the Constitutional amendment.  And there is the obvious fact that a Constitutional amendment is a more permanent measure than a normal law, which would require a more complex measure to overturn.  (There may be a parallel to the moves in recent years to enshrine gay marriage bans in state Constitutions; in most cases there were already laws in place, but a Constitutional amendment was thought of a something that might be ""more permanent"" and wouldn't be overturned easily if a different party came into power.) However, the question is a bit more complicated, because one might argue that -- at the time -- a ""normal federal law"" couldn't be used.  Or, if it were used, it could not achieve the sweeping goals of the temperance movement in truly prohibiting alcohol.  Furthermore, a law prohibiting alcohol at that time might have been successfully challenged and overturned by the Supreme Court.  That's the short explanation.  To understand the situation in detail, we have to consider the history of Constitutional law in the United States. The Constitution contains a set of enumerated powers for the federal government.  Originally, Congress had no power to pass laws that could not derive directly from one of these powers; any other government powers were granted to the states (as reinforced by the Tenth Amendment).  However, the exact limitations on these powers were disputed almost immediately as new legal situations arose.  The 19th century saw a number of these enumerated powers become slightly expanded or curtailed in various Supreme Court cases. Nevertheless, the presumption in the early 20th century was that Congress could not create laws which went beyond those original enumerated powers.  The Supreme Court frequently struck down federal laws that could not be related back to the Constitution (perhaps most famously in the string of court decisions that repeatedly invalidated much of Franklin Roosevelt's ""New Deal"" in the early to mid 1930s on the grounds that the federal government did not have those powers).  While the Supreme Court jurisprudence of this era tended to focus on economic freedom issues (the so-called Lochner era), any legislation that took power away from states or individuals could be suspect if it was not in the enumerated powers. The regulation of ""interstate commerce"" is contained in the enumerated powers, but it was still largely interpreted as an interstate issue, i.e., the federal government could legally become involved mostly when merchandise or businesses went across state lines.  Thus, early attempts at drug restriction by the federal government tended to focus on taxes for items going across state lines, rather than outright bans or detailed regulation.   An interesting case study here is the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act, which was passed in 1914 to regulate opiates and cocaine.  The act did not make such drugs illegal, but merely required special registrations and taxes on those who manufactured or distributed them.  The tax on physicians and medical use was low, but for non-medical use, the tax was so exorbitant as to effectively prohibit distribution or sale of the drugs.  This second tax was challenged in court, where it was claimed that the act was not a tax -- which would be a Constitutionally enumerated power -- but rather a federal infringement of the police power of the states, which of course was its intent if not its literal mechanism.  Nevertheless the Supreme Court upheld the act in United States v. Doremus (1919) while reaffirming that the federal government could not usurp the police power of the states.  But the Supreme Court did later object to use of the act to arrest doctors who chose to prescribe these drugs without sufficient medical justification, e.g., just to drug addicts.  As Justice McReynolds wrote in Linder v. United States (1925), ""Obviously direct control of medical practice in the states is beyond the power of the federal government.""  This shows the kind of complex debates about precisely how far federal power could go, which a Constitutional amendment would avoid at this time. Another option was for the federal government to pass uniform acts, such as the Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act of 1934.  A ""uniform act"" is a collaborative measure intended to be adopted by individual states to ensure a uniform process governing a particular issue.  However, states cannot be forced to adopt such regulations; initially only 9 states adopted this early narcotics act, and a public relations campaign was launched by FDR and others to convince the public of ""reefer madness"" and thus adopt narcotics legislation. Since alcohol regulation is not specified in the Constitution, Congress had no explicit power to regulate it.  And, as affirmed for example by the Supreme Court in the Matter of Heff (1905): In the United States, there is a dual system of government, national
  and state, each of which is supreme within its own domain, and it is
  one of the chief functions of this Court to preserve the balance
  between them. The general police power is reserved to the states subject to the
  limitation that it may not trespass on the rights and powers vested in
  the national government. The regulation of the sale of intoxicating liquors is within the power
  of the state, and the license exacted by the national government is
  solely for revenue, and is not an attempted exercise of the police
  power. Nonetheless, Congress was making progress using its enumerated powers leading up to full Prohibition.  In the Wilson Act (1890), through its power to regulate the postal system, Congress affirmed states' ability to regulate mailed liquor once it entered a state.  Regulation of the postal system and interstate commerce led to further restrictions on imported liquor in ""dry"" states or communities, including the C.O.D. Act (1909), the Webb-Kenyon Act (1913), and ultimately the Reed Amendment (1917).  Many such laws faced challenges in the Supreme Court and were only upheld when justified in a particular enumerated power. Given that much alcohol was locally brewed or distilled in the early 1900s, regulation of ""interstate commerce"" would not have been sufficient to prohibit alcohol completely, and a ""uniform act"" was essentially a state-by-state approach which was already underway. Thus, a Constitutional amendment was (at that time) the only way to create a nationwide law actually banning alcohol sale and distribution in general. The Lochner era came to an end with the so-called ""Switch in Time that Saved Nine,"" when Justice Owen Roberts started voting to uphold sweeping federal powers in 1937, thereby creating a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court that was reluctant to declare legislation unconstitutional on the basis of the enumerated powers.  (Whether Roberts's decision had anything to do with FDR's threat to enlarge the Supreme Court and appoint enough new justices to override his opponents is something that historians have long debated.  Roberts himself declared that his decision to ""switch sides"" had nothing to do with FDR's plan.) In any case, laws regulating controlled substances rapidly followed the 1937 shift, such as the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and various new laws regulating marijuana, etc.  By the early 1940s, there were effectively few restrictions left that constrained the ""interstate commerce"" clause, which was now interpreted to be able to regulate any economic activity, from commerce only within states to personal goods consumed on one's own property. Thus, Congress prior to 1937 had only limited powers to regulate manufacture, sale, and transportation of most substances (alcohol included), and mostly resorted to taxation as a remedy.  After about 1942 Congress has had basically unlimited power to pass such regulations as long as they do not interfere with specific individual rights.  Thus, a sweeping prohibition of alcohol from the 1910s-1930s required a Constitutional amendment, but subsequent prohibition and regulation of various other drugs has been achieved through ""normal federal laws."""
How were the cities of Milan and Bruges spared by the Black Death?,"I found this op-ed by John Mulhall*, a member of the Max Planck-Harvard Research Center for the Archaeoscience of the Ancient Mediterranean, who attributed Milan's relatively good performance largely to leadership. The key to its success lay in the decisive executive action of Milan’s
ruling dukes. Skilled physicians were essential, but what separated
Milan from other states was a government that put the physicians’
talents to best use. Mostly they did a lot of what we today would call quarantine, contact tracing, and data collection. The early symptoms of Plague are very distinctive, so trained doctors could diagnose it quite quickly. Of course contact tracing and data collection are eminently scalable problems, requiring no special knowledge or equipment. You only need the manpower to throw at the problem, and leadership willing to order it done. Also, it wasn't a port city, so they were able to reduce outside reintroductions by simply shutting all the gates and routing all travelers around, or into special camps outside the walls. These are pretty much all the stuff Taiwan for did for Covid-19, but without benefit of electronics. As mentioned elsewhere, all these measures just halved Milan's death toll compared to everyone else, down to about 15% of the city, rather than everyone else's 30%. Of course by the time the next plague rolled around 300 years later, that generation of dukes were not only long dead, but that system of government was too. In the 1350's Milan was ruled by a family of energetic and highly competent local Dukes who were in fact in the process of expanding their domains in the area. This was a period of Milanese expansion, which within the century would end up encompassing most of northern Italy, and no small amount of Switzerland. So it was quite fair to say the Visconti of the day knew what they were about. By 1630 Milan was smack in the middle of a 150 year period of being a Hapsburg possession. The rulers were not local, were not even Italian, did not owe their positions to any actual managerial competence, and had little need to concern themselves overmuch with what was happening with the populace in the hinterlands of northeast Italy. Sucks to be the locals in that situation, but it is what it is. In the case of Bruges, it looks like the latest research is that it probably was not spared at all. The previous conception of a ‘light touch’ of plague in the Low
Countries was created by the overprivileging of particular urban
sources, and a failure to account for the rapid replenishment of
cities via inward migration, which obscured demographic decimation. From Joris Roosen of Utrecht University: There is still a persistent notion that the Low Countries only
experienced a 'light touch' of the first wave of the plague (between
1349 and 1351), and that this enabled them to recover quickly and
fully. But the numbers tell a different story, at least for modern-day
Belgium and parts of the Netherlands. The plague caused an enormous
death rate in this region, which persisted in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries and reached cities as well as rural regions. * - Website behind a soft paywall"
Why was the Treaty of Versailles so harsh?,"I think you're asking two questions: why were such harsh conditions imposed, and why did Germany accept. As for why they were imposed: ""Some also argue that the treaty was meant to permanently render Germany useless as a military might […]"" — Perhaps not totally, but I think this is the answer. It's what the French wanted, and their security concerns won out over Wilson's ideals in the negotiations. The Maginot Line stands testament to France's fear of another German invasion, and I don't think revenge—or the political necessity of satisfying a public thirst for revenge—can be discounted either. As for why Germany accepted, this diary entry by Albrecht von Thaer on October 1, 1918 recounts Ludendorff's own assessment of Germany's position at the time.  He said approximately the following: it is his duty to tell us that our military situation is terribly serious. Every day it is possible that there might be a breakthrough on the western front. He has had to report this in the last few days to His Majesty. For the first time, the O.H.L. [Oberste Heeresleitung or Supreme Army Command] was asked by His Majesty, as well as the Chancellor, what the O.H.L and the army is still capable of accomplishing. In agreement with the Field Marshall, he responded: the O.H.L. and the German army are at an end; the war can no longer be won; indeed, a total defeat can probably no longer be averted. Bulgaria has fallen. Austria and Turkey, at the end of their strength, will probably soon fall as well. Our own army is unfortunately already badly infected with the poison of Spartacist-socialist ideas. One can no longer rely on the troops. By 1918, both sides were developing strategies and tactics which had failed so far to, but held the promise of, breaking the stalemate (co-ordinated tank and infantry attacks, stormtrooper units). The Spring Offensive was Germany's last chance to put these in effect with anything close to the logistical support and number of crack troops they required—in the event, it wasn't enough—and its failure meant that the best Germany had to look forward to was defeat by attrition accelerated by the arrival of the US. Furthermore, the Treaty wasn't signed until June 28, 1919, about seven and a half months after the ceasefire. During this time the Allies maintained their blockade of Germany, many starved (a source in that article suggests 100,000 civilians, though the Allies made attempts to allow food into Germany), others succumbed to the global influenza pandemic (which, all told, killed more people than the war killed combatants), and the country descended into paramilitary street fighting and revolution. So Germany never was in a particularly good bargaining position (all they could offer was to abbreviate everyone's suffering), and was by 1919 utterly at the Allies' mercy. I don't know enough to form an opinion on this, but here is Sally Marks on the historiography of the aftermath of WWI: (superscripts omitted) For nearly forty years, historians of twentieth-century diplomacy have argued that the Versailles treaty was more reasonable than its reputation suggests and that it did not of itself cause the Depression, the rise of Hitler, or World War II. Their efforts have had little effect, despite Margaret MacMillan’s best-selling Paris 1919. The distorted view of The Economic Consequences of the Peace and J. M. Keynes’s other works still dominates both the Anglo-American historical profession and the English-speaking educated public, though Zara Steiner pointed out in The Lights That Failed that the Versailles treaty was the mildest of the 1919–20 settlements. […] After a long, bitter great war, losers are rarely treated as victors. Germany’s military collapse has been downplayed. Last battles count most, and Berlin sought an armistice in hope of regrouping to fight again only when its army neared disintegration. The Armistice of November 1918 was in fact a surrender, but the Allies, without thinking, retained the German term implying only a cease fire. That was the first Allied mistake. The text required a rapid military withdrawal that only the German army could accomplish, which gave it great influence in the nascent German republic. Franco-Belgian yearning for liberation rendered that requirement hard to avoid. […] While the Four imposed losses and constraints upon Germany, many of them temporary, they allowed it to remain Europe’s greatest state politically, economically, and potentially militarily, for they never really faced jointly the extent of German power and the possibility of its hostile use. They can be faulted for the ostensible and psychological as well as the real burdens they imposed on Weimar’s democrats; the insufficiency of enforcement clauses; ignoring the risks of imposing a victor’s peace without a united will to enforce it; the treaty’s numerous pinpricks but relative moderation on many key points; their necessary haste and unnecessary disorganization; and leaving Germany dominant on the continent—indeed, when the bonds of Versailles dissolved, more dominant than it had been before. Above all, by the crucial combination of their failure to ensure that Germans understood their military defeat, their consistent avoidance of the big questions, and their neglect of aspects of German power, the victors inadvertently provided the preconditions for what one Weimar official termed “the continuation of war by other means.” Marks, Sally.

"Did this ""sledge rigged like a sloop"" vehicle ever exist, or was it an invention of Jules Verne?","Yes, and this wikipedia article and this other one describe it.  The first article talks about ice boats in America (invented in Poughkeepsie, etc), but the second makes it clear that the Dutch had this technology down cold a very long time ago.  Verne, one suspects, read 19th century equivalents of Wikipedia for plot elements; maybe he read an equivalent of the first article I cite and was hooked by the American connection, and so put it in his novel.  Added: Of course, Verne's version travelled over land, and real ice-boats over frozen water.  As Pieter Geerkens remarks, ice boats are very rapid, as (I suppose) the drag on the runners on ice is far less than the drag on the hull in the water. "
"Who, if anyone, was the first astronaut to return to earth in a different vessel?","The first people who landed in a different vessel than they took off in were Aleksei Yeliseyev and Yevgeny Khrunov. In January 1969, they took off in Soyuz-4 and returned in Soyuz-5. Crew exchange between directly docked spacecraft was the primary purpose of the Soyuz-4/Soyuz-5 mission. Mission details: The First Crew Exchange in Space The first spacecraft switch using an orbital station took place much later, only in January 1978. Then the crew of the Soyuz-27 spacecraft (Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Oleg Makarov) returned in Soyuz-26 after spending five days on the Salyut-6 station. Speaking of orbital stations, it's interesting to mention that Skylab (launched in May 1973) also had two docking modules (as the Salyut-6 had), so a similar ""station-based crew exchange"" could potentially happen earlier. However, there were only three non-overlapping expeditions to this station, with all the crews returning to Earth with their initial vessels. The Skylab Rescue mission was on standby from August 1973 to February 1974 in case of emergency."
Why didn't Hannibal attack Rome after the Battle of Cannae?,"Short Answer: The traditional analysis is that Hannibal probably could not have taken Rome, and perhaps more importantly, knew that he couldn't, despite his brilliant victories in the field. A complementary analysis is that in recognition of this, his preferred strategy is to disrupt Rome's alliances. Cities typically fall in one of three ways: being starved into submission, being taken by force, or outright surrendering. Rome was adamantly against peace, as evidenced by their rejection of Hannibal's terms (and probably, due to knowing their own strength). A successful siege was similarly unlikely; despite her devastating defeats, Rome remained very populous with plenty of manpower. While Roman allies in Italy remained loyal, Hannibal's army was too isolated and small to take on Rome on its own. The prolific Punic Wars writer, Professor John Francis Lazenby from the Newcastle University, offers some convincing arguments about the difficulties Hannibal would have faced at Rome: Lazeby advances several reasons why Hannibal did not march on Rome: Rome was 400 kilometres away, and there were two legions in the city to defend it, as well as the male members of the population; Rome still had troops and could raise others; whether Hannibal could take Rome quickly was uncertain and a siege could drag on; also Hannibal's aims were to detach the Latin and Italian allies from Rome. Hannibal did not want a war to the death with Rome; the war was about dignitas and imperium, and he proposed peace, though his ambassador to Rome, Carthalo, was turned back by the orders of Marcus Junius Pera, dictator for 216.  - Dillon, Matthew, and Lynda Garland. Ancient Rome: A Sourcebook. Routledge, 2013.   This is AFAIK the predominant view. There are other viewpoints on why Hannibal couldn't take Rome, but I doubt many think that Hannibal had a moment of insanity and chose not to march on Rome for no good reason. For example, Professor John F. Shean argued that Hannibal was limited by logistics. In any case it is unlikely that Hannibal could have realistically considered marching on Rome from Cannae. Shean convincingly argues that Hannibal's campaigns were largely dictated by his logistical situation, and that after Cannae his army scarcely had supplies for a few days, let alone a three-week march. If he had made it to Rome the subsequent siege could have lasted for months, if not years, posing a logistical nightmare since his army's opportunities for foraging would have been limited by being permanently stationed at one point. Even if Hannibal had wanted to follow up his victory at Cannae by marching on Rome, it is incredibly unlikely that he would have been able to do so.  - Daly, Gregory.

What concessions did Hitler demand from the Poles before 1939?,"As of 24 October 1938 the demands were annexation of Free City of Danzig by Germany and extraterritorial roadway+railway from East Prussia to mainland Germany through the Polish Corridor (so a ""corridor across a corridor"")  [Eagle Unbowed p. 42].  Danzig was a strategic port, well connected to Poland's industrialized regions (central and western Poland). In 1920s most Polish export/import passed through Danzig; inland trade was scarce. The gist of the issue was less on being somehow connected or unconnected, and more about the total throughput and its scalability and its security. The country's economy could be simply strangled by abruptly stopping foreign trade or it could stagnate when the transport couldn't grow too fast. All Danzig, Gdynia, Klaipeda (Lithuania), Riga (Latvia) put together were already insufficient at the time, the business could have more investments and did seek best return on investments in all these routes. Gdynia and associated coal trunk railway, the new independent all-Polish export/import route built at a huge cost, in 1938 slightly overtook Danzig in terms of tonnage transferred. But its railway was a weak spot, strategically, and also already a bottleneck (rough terrain between Kościerzyna and Gdynia enforced sharp turns and high slopes). For Lithuania or Latvia the routes were poor and connected to the similarly poorly industrialized eastern Poland. Their existing ports had entirely insufficient throughput. For example Latvian ports would need to grow at least fivefold, while the train route there would need to be basically re-done. Entire Latvian network used the wider Russian gauge and train conversion was done in Dyneburg. Politically, it would require a long process to prepare such international investment and associated guarantees. Militarily, the Latvia-Lithuania option was worse than Gdynia: not only under German but also under Soviet threat. The Lithuania diplomatic standing was fragile: the Polish-Lithuanian relations were terrible over earlier Polish annexation of Vilnius, and also the  German-Lithuanian and Soviet-Lithuanian relations were quite strained. In fact, not using the main Lithuanian port of Klaipeda turned out to be an excellent decision. It got ""danziged"" by Germany as soon as March 1939, when Germany occupied Klaipeda and promised Lithuania it could continue to use it only as a Free Port.  Now to the main point, the German propostion. It was shameless even for Hitler's standards:  we'll annex some land, so we could control and tax a large part of your foreign trade, and then you can go and maybe conquer by yourself some Soviet land over there. Germany and Soviet Union had no common border at the time. Obviously letting German land forces enter Poland and ""help"" was out of question, for it would instantly turn Poland into a satellite state. (My own speculation, only partially supported by Lyons pp. 56-57 and Leslie, p. 205). In these times letting foreign forces in was only appropriate for very very close allies, such as UK and France. Otherwise it was a huge diplomatic no-no. Further considering scenario of a Soviet-Polish war, Poland had no illusions whether Germans could or would stop themselves before ""securing the rights of German minority in the failing Polish state much troubled by the current war"" as was customary at the time. Even if Poland entered that scenario as an independent state, the predicted outcome would be it would end as either German or Soviet satellite. Additional fact was that the Hitler's proposition was soon mirrored. Stalin proposed to send troops to ""help"" against Germany. This was similarly rejected, as it would lead to Poland becoming a Soviet satellite state (again Lyons)."
Why did life expectancy decline sharply in 16th century England?,"This was primarily due to the 1557 influenza pandemic, which returned in 1558 and perhaps lingered for another year or two. This was a global pandemic and other areas of Europe were also severely hit. Making things even worse was that the influenza was preceded by plague, typhus, measles (hat tip: Rusl) and famine in some regions of Europe. Influenza significantly contributed to England's unusually high death
rates for 1557–58: Data compiled on over 100 parishes in
England found that the mortality rates increased by up to 60% in some
areas during the flu epidemic... As a result, the population of England fell by an estimated 2% between 1557 and 1559 and deaths for the year 1558 were 80% above normal. This pandemic was a global one and was highly fatal, with deaths recorded as being due to pleurisy and
fatal peripneumony. It first infested Asia, then Constantinople, and
having spread all over Europe, afterwards attacked America. Before
autumn 1557, it simultaneously hit all parts of Spain so quickly that:
«the greater part of the population in that Kingdom were seized with
it almost on the same day» Thomas Short described the epidemic based on contemporary reports, the
disease: «came from the land Melite in Africa, into Sicily; so into
Spain, and Italy […]. It attacked at once, and raged all over Europe,
not missing a family and scarce a person. Source: Rosamaria Alibrandi, 'When early modern Europe caught the flu. A scientific account of pandemic influenza in sixteenth century Sicily'. In Medicina Historica 2018; Vol. 2, N. 1: 19-26. A Note on Life Expectancy Note that the life expectancy figures quickly rose again, and that the source of the data in the question states that: Shown is period life expectancy at birth, the average number of years
a newborn would live if the pattern of mortality in the given year
were to stay the same throughout its life. or, to put it in a slightly different way, The statistic “Life expectancy at birth” actually refers to the
average number of years a newborn is expected to live if mortality
patterns at the time of its birth remain constant in the future. In
other words, it’s looking at the number of people of different ages
dying that year, and provides a snapshot of these overall “mortality
characteristics” that year for the population. (My emphasis) Some Historical Context Also worth noting is that the 1557 pandemic was not the first, but it is better documented than the ones that came before it: ...although influenza has been known in Europe since the middle of the
13th century and there are some records documenting six visitations in
the 14th century, and four in the 15th, it only began to be studied by
the profession from the start of the following century. Only then
records of erupted epidemics appeared, together with the circumstances
which attended their outbreak and progression, and their
characteristic symptoms. Source: Alibrandi"
How long was a sea journey from England to East Africa 1868-1877?,"We can find record of Thomas Wakefield's 1870 trip in the 1904 publication Thomas Wakefield : missionary and geographical pioneer in East Equatorial Africa at archive.org. The ships and trips start is begun on pg 98 Passages were taken for the little company in the brig ‘ Emily ’ (268
tons register), bound for Zanzibar. In his diary of the voyage, Mr.
Wakefield says : ‘For her size the arrangements for accommodation on
board the “ Emily ’’ appear to be very good, but of course she lacks
the conveniences of cabin and deck of a respectable passenger ship. dating the trip, also pg 98: On February 24, 1870, Mr. Wakefield writes: ‘We begin to move to-day,
following our ship to Gravesend. Myself and wife, accompanied by her
brother, the Rev. R. Brewin, left Woolwich Station at 9.40 this
morning, and arrived at Gravesend at 10.40. A little while after-
wards the following friends from London came to spend with us our last
hours in England, and to speak words of comfort, and to say a kindly
farewell on pg 100, arrival at Zanzibar (emphasis mine). On Thursday, June 2, after being ninety-seven days at sea, the south
end of Zanzibar Island was sighted early in the morning, and the
anchor cast about 1.30, before the powder magazine. After discharging
her dangerous cargo the ^ Emily ’ moved into the harbour, and our
weary travellers went ashore. So this particular journey took 97 days, and since the arrival at Zanzibar specified the South edge of the island, we can safely assume the southern route around the Cape. Concerning the aspect of the question about the Suez canal, @Stuart F in comments provides an excellent source , the NY Times article Passage East, which discusses the difficulties for a sailing ship such as the Emily traversing such a narrow region as the canal and indeed the entire Red Sea Region: The Red Sea is narrow, with treacherous shoals along its eastern
shore, and prevailing winds blow in opposite directions in the
northern half and in the south. It was not practical to operate from
end-to-end on a regular basis under sail."
Why would graphite have been confused with lead?,"Theses minerals were confused because they are quite similar in appearance, attributes and possible usage. Graphite was previously called plumbago meaning the mineral Galena also called lead glance, which is a lead containing ore, not pure lead (plumbum). The density of pure lead glance (PbS) is only 7.60 g/cm3. They both look really similar and were indeed used for similar applications, for example namely in cosmetics. Kohl and mascara are charcoal – or mainly carbon – and just this galena respectively. Graphite was previously also quite often confused with molybdenite, (density: 10.28 g/cm3) a substance also capable of marking smooth surfaces. Going by density alone is not very useful when classifying minerals, since densities vary, despite containing the most wanted metal. The numbers cited by you and me are for the pure compounds, usually not found as such in nature.  Galenit is also quite soft, clocking just 2-3 on the  Mohs-scale, compared to 1–2 for graphite. Galena: 
  and graphite: 
  molybdenite:  All of these materials can be used as a solid lubricant as well. Making them of strategic importance for military purposes. England banned the export of pencils to Napoleonic France, since the containing graphite is ideal as a lining for casting cannonballs. (Source: Scientific American: Carbon Wonderland (2088)) Like galena graphite was also used to glaze or line pottery vessels, making them more fire proof. The three minerals historically named galena, molybdena and plumbago have several common features — they are all soft, dark materials with a metallic lustre. Before the advent of modern chemical methods, these three substances were often mistaken for one another. Because galena (lead(ii) sulfide) was known to be a useful lead ore, it was commonly believed that molybdena and plumbago also contained lead. However, molybdena (which we call molybdenite today) was actually molybdenum(iv) sulfide, and plumbago was what we now call graphite.
  (Anders Lennartson: ""Made by molybdenum"", Nature Chemistry, Vol 6, August 2014, p746.) Most important is of course the actual application as a writing or drawing tool. Everyone now knows how graphite in pencils works, but a similar effect is achieved in using a stilus plumbeum. These drawing tools are said to originate in ancient Egypt and are allegdly also described by Pliny. This variation of metal point is today most often called a silver point, despite lead being the main component in most cases. This then closes the circle since modern pencils, containing graphite, are in English often called lead pencil and in German always called Bleistift. Young students often wise crack about licking the tip of a pencil, being unsure whether ""it is or is not dangerous"" because ""lead is toxic"", ""actually it is not lead and does not contain any lead, so it's safe"". At least modern German word usage (and Danish, Dutch, possibly more) and many citizens still confuse the minerals."
How did people travel to remote islands like Easter Island?,"As to how they made it safely, don't be fooled by the fact that they only had 'canoes';  double-hulled ships are far more seaworthy than single hulls of a similar size. That's not to say it wasn't risky or difficult, but modern people have successfully followed the paths of early Polynesian migrations using traditionally designed boats and (more impressively, imho) traditional navigation techniques.  Ben Finney wrote a book about his experiences in Hokule'a, a double-hulled canoe which later (in 1999) made the voyage to Easter Island. How they decided to make that first trip, without knowing for sure that an island was there, is a more interesting question.  Rapa Nui (Easter Island) tradition says that a king dreamt of the island's existence and ordered an expedition to find it.  You don't have to be woo to believe that something like that might have actually happened - after centuries of sailing eastward and settling new islands, the idea of trying it again wouldn't have seemed all that outrageous.  Anything from overpopulation to a ruler showing off for a girl could have led to such an order being given. Obviously no one knows for sure what happened, but I found an article in which Finney explains the difficulties the first expedition would have faced, not least of which is the primarily easterly winds in that part of the Pacific.  A sailing vessel can actually sail against the wind by zigzagging, but it's difficult and greatly increases the distance of the journey. Therefore, Finney says:  The key to reaching Rapa Nui would be to get enough days of favorable westerly winds ... to come close enough to the island to see it, or detect it indirectly by telltale cloud formations, by the appearance of terns or other 'land finding' birds, or by other signs by which island navigators use to recognize when land is near. He speculates that perhaps some especially adventurous voyagers [went] down to around 35° South to try to run before westerlies there, and that after a week or two the cold wind and rough seas forced them to angle north to seek the warmth of the tropics. If so, they might have stumbled across Rapa Nui in their flight from the cold. Another possibility is that  Marquesans sailing to the Tuamotus could have been driven far to the east by sudden westerly gales, and then have elected to keep heading in that direction in hope of finding land sooner than it would take them to work their way back to the west. Similarly, people making a crossing from Mangareva to Pitcairn, or between islands in the Austral group might have been driven far past their target by strong westerlies and then opted to keep pressing eastward. The article goes into a lot more detail, and also has links to diaries of the Hokule'a expedition to Easter Island."
What was the first solar eclipse that was demonstrably predicted in advance?,"(This is an incomplete answer since I don't know which eclipse specifically was predicted, nor how it compares to the rest of the world. But it is too long for a comment.) Because of their cultural association of governmental legitimacy with astronomical/geophysical omens, ancient China was rather obsessed with predicting eclipses. Attempts to do so seemed to have begun in the Warring States era, but naturally were not very successful. Some breakthroughs were achieved in the Eastern Han when it was realised that the moon's motion is inconsistent. By 20 B.C. the Chinese knew how eclipses were caused ... By 8 B.C. the Chinese could predict eclipses by using the 135 month period; and by A.D. 206 they could predict eclipses by analyzing the motion of the moon. By A.D. 390 they could predict how much of the moon would be in shadow.  - Thurston, Hugh, Early Astronomy, Springer, New York, 1994  These are referring to solar eclipses, as was made clear by the rest of the paragraph discussing ancient disputes over how the moon could block the sun's light. See also: Astronomers were attached to the royal household as second tier functionaries ... One of the most important events to predict were eclipses. In the first century B.C. (the Han dynasty), an eclipse period of 135 months was recognized during which 23 eclipses were known. By the third century A.D., the astronomer Yang Wei was able to specify times of first contact for a solar eclipse.  Case Western Reserve University: Journey Through the Galaxy-  By about 20 BC, surviving documents show that Chinese astrologers understood what caused eclipses, and by 8 BC some predictions of total solar eclipse were made using the 135-month recurrence period. By AD 206 Chinese astrologers could predict solar eclipses by analyzing the Moon's motion.  - National Aeronautics and Space Administration: Eclipse Through Traditions and Cultures  It would therefore appear that, that by about the early third century, at least some eclipses were predicted. Of course, these predictions were not very good, especially since the sun's movement had not been understood. That happened much later in the Tang Dynasty. The monk Yi Xing was able to produce better eclipse predictions based on his research. Another notable advancement in Chinese astronomy was achieved in the Yuan Dynasty, by the astronomers Wang Xun and Guo Shoujin. This actual movement of the sun was fully understood by the famous astronomer Yi Xing (一行, 683-727 A.D), and he used the theory in his computations, for example the calculations for the time fo eclipses, in his Da Yan calendar (大衍歷, 729 A.D), getting accurate results in the process. (...) Guo and his co-workers were able to make more accurate astronomical calculations, which helped them to make better astronomical predictions, especially in the case of eclipses.  - Tiong, Ngsay, and and Helmer Aslaksen. ""Calendars, Interpolation, Gnomons and Armillary Spheres in the Work of Guo Shoujin (1231–1314).""  Again, the eclipse predictions were still not perfect, especially over the course of centuries. However, a failed prediction was cause for commissioning a new calendar. Conversely, this meant that at least some of the predictions even in this early period were accurate, by chance or otherwise. One major piece of evidence proposed by Xu in favour of the adoption of Western methods concerned eclipse predictions ... [E]clipse prediction was the touchstone. In 1610, when it was first proposed to employ Jesuits for astronomical reform, the miscalculation of a solar eclipse was used to make the case for the necessity of this reform.  - Jami, Catherine, et al, eds. Statecraft and Intellectual Renewal in Late Ming China: the Cross-Cultural Synthesis of Xu Guangqi (1562-1633). Vol. 50. Brill, 2001. At this juncture the then-extant Chinese calendars were failing in their predicative powers. The Court held a competition (to predict an eclipse) between the Chinese court astronomers and the Westerners, which resulted in a resounding victory for European astronomy."
What disruptions were brought about by Islam that the Arabians saw so many victories?,"The critical factor all these answers leave out: The Black Death. The Plague of Justinian swept through the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires a few generations before Islam. On the Byzantine side, the reduction in manpower available for warfare was near 90%. The damage to the economies of both empires made it unlikely they'd rebuild the population losses quickly enough, and, as @user64617 pointed out, the two were frequently at war with each other anyway. As to where I get the ""90% reduction"" figure: Before the Plague, Justinian had sent Belisarius to conquer Italy. Belisarius frequently requested more troops, as cities came over to the Empire's side and he needed to garrison them. He'd request 10,000 -- and get 1,000. After the Plague, Belisarius was again sent to Italy, to fix some problems other generals had created and, if possible, continue the conquest. Again, he'd request 10,000 additional troops -- but this time, all he'd get would be 100. The political events between the two phases did not involve Justinian -- he was sick with the plague -- and his personal attitude towards Belisarius, and his intent to rebuild the Empire, had not changed. (This doesn't mean 90% of the population died; it means enough people died that 90% of those who would have been available for the armies instead were needed for farming, shipping, trades, etc.) Sources: Belisarius, the Last Roman General by Ian Hughes; Justinian's Flea by William Rosen."
How much would 300 pounds (money value) weigh in Medieval England?,"In that era, 300 pounds weighed 300 pounds, but it's a different pound. Your example of Robin Hood fixes the time period during the reign of King Richard about 1175, though we must remember this is a legend. This is just after the chaotic reign of King Stephen when the centralized minting of coins broke down. His successor, King Henry II, reintroduced the royal mint system. Rather than pure silver he began striking coins from 92.5% silver, sterling silver which is harder than pure silver, thus pound sterling. In that era, 300 pounds weighed 300 pounds. No matter the coinage, it's 300 pounds of silver; 240 silver pence weighed and was a pound. This makes checking the value of a bag of coins very easy regardless of whether they're shaved or not, it was weighed. However, their pound was not our pound. In King Richard's time, a pound of money would be based on the Tower, Saxon, or moneyers' pound of 12 Tower ounces. This was roughly 350 grams or roughly 75% the weight of a modern pound. The modern 16 oz pound is the London pound. So Robin Hood's 300 12 oz pounds of coins would weigh roughly 225 modern 16 oz pounds (around 100 kg). many medieval pictures of people riding depict horses which seem very small to me Careful, medieval art was not concerned with accuracy. They would regularly depict any scale or perspective that fit whatever they were trying to say with the art. As for carrying it on a medieval horse, this is dead weight hanging down with a low center of gravity, not live weight sitting high above the horse. 20% of the horse's weight is a modern humane consideration for a modern light riding horse. A medieval horse would be less differentiated and expected to carry loads as well as a rider, or the rider could walk along side while the horse carried their load. Where there were any gold coins minted in England during the middle ages? Yes, but gold was worth roughly 20 times more than silver. If you made a gold penny the same value as a silver penny it would be tiny and slip through gaps in your bags. To keep gold pennies a reasonable size they were worth 20 silver pennies."
Why was no Nobel Prize for Literature awarded in 1935?,"At the time, Henry Suzzallo's National Encyclopedia claimed that: The Swedish Academy decided not to award the Nobel Prize in Literature this year, declaring that no single person in the field of literature merited the award in 1935. Whether this was accurate, it would not have been terribly unusual. The Peace Prize was likewise not awarded in 1935; it was retroactively given to German dissident Carl von Ossietzky in 1936.  In fact the Nobel Foundation's statutes provide for a prize to be ""reserved"" for a year if no suitable candidate was available for that year's award. If no one deserving could be found even after a year, the prize money is returned to the Foundation's funds. § 5.
  A work may not be awarded a prize, unless it by experience or expert scrutiny has been found to be of such outstanding importance as is manifestly intended by the will. If none of the works under consideration is found to be of the importance indicated in the first paragraph, the prize money shall be reserved until the following year. If, even then, the prize cannot be awarded, the amount shall be added to the Foundation's restricted funds. Statutes of the Nobel Foundation The Guardian article cited in the OP actually lists seven years where a retroactive award happened for the Literature Prize: 1915, 1919, 1925, 1926, 1927, 1936 and 1949. For instance, William Faulkner was awarded his 1949 Nobel in 1950. One possible reason for 1935's omission may be that the Nobel Committee had been considering Roger Martin du Gard, for his novel sequence Les Thibaults. However, he was writing a seventh volume at the time, and perhaps this caused the Committee to delay a decision. As it happens, l'Été 1914 was published in November 1936 - too late to be considered that year. Du Gard went on to receive his Nobel in 1937."
Until when was Marseille Greek-speaking?,"There is evidence that Greek continued to be used in Massalia (Roman name: Massilia) even during the late empire and the spread of Christianity. To cite one academic source, ...the city preserved its Greek language until the 5th c. A.D., and
remained an active cultural and commercial center. Source: Richard Stillwell (auth.), William L. MacDonald and Marian
Holland McAllister (eds.), 'The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites' (1976) The same assertion is made in this 1981 doctoral thesis. It is worth emphasizing at this point that, even from very early times, Massalia was a multilingual city with (probably) most inhabitants conversant in more than one language. Initially, this meant Greek and Gaulish as Greek colonists married local women. Later, Latin was added to the mix. Circumstances brought three languages into use at Massalia, the Greek,
the Latin, and the Gallic (Isid. xv., on the authority of Varro). The
studies of the youth at Massalia in the Roman period were both Greek
and Latin. Roman culture and language did replace Greek in some respects but mostly it existed alongside it. This should not come as surprise given that for elite Romans, Greek was a language most of them studied and acquired, along with Greek thought. Greek had held an important place in Roman society and culture since
the late Republican period, and educated Romans were expected to be
bilingual and well versed in both Greek and Latin literature. Source: Alison John, 'Learning Greek in Late Antique Gaul' Further, Romanization and Hellenization are not distinct phenomena: being Roman
involved, to a certain extent, being Greek (§1.2). In many parts of
the Western Empire, we are in fact often faced with a ‘cultural
triangulation’, a series of negotiations of identities which involved
Roman, Greek and local. Source: Alex Mullen, Chap. 9 in 'Southern Gaul and the Mediterranean' (2013) Our evidence for the continued importance of Greek during the period of the Roman empire comes from both authors and inscriptions. Strabo (d. circa AD 24) , who wrote his Geographica during the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius, observed that in Massalia ...all the men of culture turn to the art of speaking and the study of
philosophy; so that the city, although a short time ago it was given
over as merely a training-school for the barbarians and was schooling
the Galatae to be fond enough of the Greeks to write even their
contracts in Greek, at the present time has attracted also the most
notable of the Romans, if eager for knowledge, to go to school there
instead of making their foreign sojourn at Athens. Strabo may have overstated the importance of Massalia as a centre for education as we have few surviving texts from Massaliote writers, but it was nonetheless of at least minor importance, and definitely Greek in outlook.  Tacitus (d. AD 120), who had family roots in Massalia and probably spoke Greek (he served in Greek-speaking Asia), wrote about Agricola's education in the city. We also have inscriptions in Greek dating to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd centuries AD though, because relatively little excavation work has been done, the sample is small. One example is: The domain of education is represented by a white marble dedication
from Marseille dating to the end of the first or beginning of the
second century AD and dedicated to a .... ‘teacher’... Source: Mullen, Chap. 9 Another example is a little later: Again from Marseille, and dated to the end of the second, or beginning
of the third century AD, a marble plaque refers to what appears to be
a bilingual grammaticus.... The name and inscription are Greek... Source: Mullen, Chap. 9 Interestingly, inscriptions (and, to a lesser extent, Roman authors) point to the use of Greek in several regions of Transalpine Gaul during the imperial period. Thus, we should not be surprised that Hellenism was not a dying remnant of a culture which was disappearing
in favour of Romanization but a conscious choice on the part of the
community and its elite, and its cultural traditions were a dynamic
and evolving response to the changing context of the Roman empire. Source: K. Lomas, 'Hellenism, Romanization and cultural identity in Massalia'. In Lomas (ed.), 'Greek Identity in the Western Mediterranean' (2004) Overall, the epigraphic evidence is patchy and a little confusing with both Latin and Greek names and writing in evidence, but with the former seemingly more prominent. This might indicate more Latin than Greek speakers, but we have to consider survivorship bias and we cannot assume that the proportion of inscriptions for each language closely correlates with population. Greek gods, cults and festivals were still in evidence in 3rd century AD; it seems reasonable to presume that ceremonies were conducted in Greek. In the 4th century AD, the spread of Christianity helped to maintain the use of Greek. Communities had sprung up in Massalia by the early 4th century and Christianity was...a context in which Marseille's enduring Greek
cultural and intellectual tradition (still acknowledged in many ways
under the Empire) could be revived, its links with the interior
fostered, and its special relationship with the East reinvigorated. A footnote to the above adds: The city's Greek heritage is reflected under the Empire in the names
of its buildings, officials and individuals.... Greek was still used in
the early third century to record the career of a high-ranking
imperial functionary from Marseille... Source: S. T. Loseby, 'Marseille: A Late Antique Success Story?'. In The Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 82 (1992). However, by the 5th century AD Greek was in decline among Gallo Romans though we cannot assume that it disappeared entirely. One of the last prominent Greek-speakers of the city that we know of was Gennadius of Massilia, a priest and scholar of the late 5th century. By the mid to late 6th century, the Greek historian poet Agathias (d. after 580 AD) wrote that Massalia, although once a Greek city, it has now become barbarian in character having
abandoned its ancestral constitution and embraced the ways of its
conquerors. Translation cited in Dallas DeForest, 'Agathias on Italy, Italians and the Gothic War'. In Estudios Bizantinos 8 (2020)"
"When the Portuguese began the exploration of the West African Coast, did they believe the Indian Ocean was an enclosed sea?","What a wonderful question! Dom Henrique is one of the chief characters of this story, and that means we need to explore him more than the general Portuguese knowledge. These explorations as a whole were a manifestation of the soul of this great man who was well beyond his contemporaries in what he wanted and expected from his sailors. I'm basing this answer on Bradford's 'A Wind from the North'. In short, the answer is that when Dom Henrique started with the voyages of exploration, he was unsure about what would be found, but by the end of his life he was sure there was a way around Africa, as evidenced on the map of Fra Maura. However, for the average sailor the religious connotations of sailing towards 'the end of the world' and their possible demise there were far more important than what else was there. It doesn't look as Ptolemy's map was in common circulation though his other works were; Dom Henrique's resolve may also have been strengthened by hearing about the Phoenician circumnavigation of Africa. Yet, the overarching purpose of these missions was to learn more and to discover—often in these cases the final goal may come unexpectedly. Firstly, far more important than a map of the world was the understanding that the sailors of the time had. For them, Cape Not was the beginning of the end of the world: Quern passar o Cabo de Nam, ou tornara ou nam.
He who would pass Cape Not, either will return or not. Only a touch further south lay Cape Bojador which was the limit of the 'known' world, and the two things beyond it were ""the boiling sea and the Ocean of Darkness"": At that point it seemed as if the waters ran downward in a curve, so that, it was said, no ship could ever sail back. The winds drew always from astern, so that even if the curved ocean was a myth, the fact remained that a square-sailed vessel had little chance of beating her way north again. Bradford speculates that the tale of the Phoenician circumnavigation of Africa was known to Dom Henrique—from the scholars who ended up gathering at Sagres—which would possibly be a better medication than any map. What makes a survival of the Ptolemaic map in Portugal or for the Portuguese suspect is that Azurara, the chronicler of Dom Henrique's life, writes: ""he desired to know what lands there were beyond the Canary Isles and a cape called Bojador. For at that time there was no knowledge, either in writing or in the memory of any man, of what might lie beyond this cape."" Yet, Ptolemy is mentioned in specific terms, however (all emphasis and addition original; ""he"" refers to Dom Henrique): We know, in fact, that he suspected there were further islands or land masses in the Atlantic from the chronicle of Diogo Gomes, a ship's captain who spent many of his years in Prince Henry's service, and who was with him when he died. ""The Prince wished to know,"" he wrote, ""about the western ocean, and whether there were islands or continents beyond those that Ptolemy described. [The Alexandrian astronomer's Guide to Geography was a standard reference book of the period.] So he sent caravels to search for lands."" The main problem, however, was not whether a way was shown on a map. Dom Henrique's sense of the unknown prompted him to send the ships out; he was expecting to find new things and was willing to wait out until he got results. What was more difficult was finding good captains and brave sailors to sail that way. At least before the discovery of Maderia, no riches or wealth was expected from the south given it was the traditional Christian 'end of the world'. Indeed, many sailors (perhaps more superstitious than the captains or Dom Henrique and also likely to profit less than the leaders of the expeditions) were very reluctant to proceed to the south: The Sea of Obscurity, or the Ocean of Darkness, it was called. There dwelt monsters, and the sun stood so high overhead that the water boiled. The men who lived on the outermost edge of the African shore were known to be burned black by the sun, so how could man go farther without being roasted alive? ... ""To sail south,"" murmured the sailors. ""What is the point of that? How can we possibly pass beyond the bounds that are established? What profit can the Prince gain from the loss of a few poor sailors?..."" Bradford notes the dialogue is not made up, but he doesn't specify a source. Azurara is brought out as one example, but Bradford has used other chroniclers as well. The desolate nature of the desert next to the Atlantic in that part of the North African landmass would not have incentivized the Portuguese any more, at least not until they got past those to the rich delta of the Senegal. Cabo Branco was only reached in 1441, and it's near there that some trade was conducted with local tribesmen, but that was a good two decades into the exploration progress. Lastly, the specific virtue of the Prince as the overseer of these voyages is brought out with respect to these world-views: ""The Prince always welcomed the captains of his ships with great patience, never disclosing any resentment, listening graciously to the stories of their adventures, and rewarding them as men who were serving him well. But immediately he sent them back again to repeat the voyage — either them or others of his household — impressing upon them, more and more strongly, the mission he required them to accomplish ..."" Towards the end of his life, the Prince was quite certain that Africa could be rounded. The map by Fra Maura incorporated knowledge that the Prince's voyages had uncovered, and that shows the Cape of Good Hope (described below):  Bradford describes the making of this map: The map was finished in the spring of 1459, and it is evidence of the information that Henry had collected from all over Africa that the Cape of Good Hope, called the ""Cavo di Diab,"" is shown on this world map. Forty years before Vasco da Gama rounded the cape, either the Prince or his cartographers had heard of an Indian sailing vessel that in 1420 had rounded the cape from the east after a voyage of 2,000 miles."
Why did Meiji government consider switching from Japanese to English?,"(A little background for others reading this post) In 1868 Emperor Meiji re-established imperial rule. To move Japan into the modern era, he encouraged his people to explore and learn from the more technologically advanced cultures of the world.   Even in the late 1800s, English was the language of international commerce. Emperor Meiji's push to learn English was an attempt to jump onto the world stage with both feet. The effort failed for many of the same reasons that the metric system failed in the US. People are creatures of habit - they only change when they want to change or environment forces them to change. A decree has no force without the will of the people. Language is also a source of national identity. It is easy to adopt someone else's architecture and technology, but language is personal.  By contrast, during this same period the government ordered commoners to adopt a surname. Imagine living in a caste system in which only the high-class had last names, and you are told to be more like a high-class person. In spite of the large scale and significance of this change, it is hard to imagine an effort like this failing.  The only way English would have succeeded as a national language in Japan is if it were somehow necessary."
Why isn't Somaliland recognized as a separate country?,"This isn't really so much about any US allies not wanting it to happen as much as it is about the African Union not wanting it to happen. In January of 2008, the US State Department issued this statement:  ""While the United States does not recognize Somaliland as an independent state, and we continue to believe that the question of Somaliland's independence should be resolved by the African Union, we continue regularly to engage with Somaliland as a regional administration.""  This essentially states that the US is willing to concede the recognition of African countries to the African Union and is therefore following their lead. The primary reason that the African Union has given for not recognizing them is that they viewed Somalilands's claim as just another enclave seeking separation, and apparently this violates the principles of the African Union. The African Union itself does not favour rearranging the borders of African countries, especially where there is no agreement. It feels that, rightly or wrongly, the colonial borders were fixed and that changing them would open up too much uncertainty.  The fact that Somalia refuses to recognize the existence of Somaliland is a significant factor in this. The matter is further complicated by the fact that there is another separationist movement in a tract of land called Puntland  which joins these two regions. As long as this instability exists, it is unlikely that the African Union will recognize any country other than Somalia, so Somaliland and Puntland are both left out in the cold. Until the African Union decides to recognize these regions as separate countries, it is unlikely that any other major country will do so. Somaliland's 'path to recognition' BTW - The week of independence that you mentioned occured back in 1960. Since Somaliland has essentially been a part of Somalia for over fifty years, it is easier to understand why the African Union sees them as just another separationist movement. "
Was slavery in the United States legally limited to blacks?,"Mostly, but not entirely. Several states including Virginia explicitly recognized slaves that were purely descended from Indians. It is important to realize that the law often had no bearing on whether a person could be enslaved and there was a huge mismatch between the laws and actual practice. For example, most southern states had laws very early making it illegal to import slaves of any kind and ruling that any slave imported into their state became instantly free. Virginia passed their law of this type in 1792. Nevertheless, this law was never obeyed. Hundreds of thousands of slaves were imported and exported from Virginia after 1792 and none of them that I know of were freed under this law. Another such law, more restrictive, was the Act of 1819 in Virginia, which has the following language: No persons shall henceforth be slaves within this commonwealth, except
  such were so on the seventeenth day of October, in the year one
  thousand seven hundred and eighty-five, and the descendants of the
  females of them and such persons and their descendants, being slaves,
  as since have been, or hereafter may be brought into this state, or
  held there in pursuant to law. Where it was only legal to bring in slaves from other states and the District of Columbia. Thus, for example, it would be illegal to bring an actual African as a slave into Virginia after this law was passed. As a general rule, after the War of the Revolution the courts only recognized ""negroes,"" meaning Africans, as inherently slaves. Indians could only be slaves if they were the children of slaves and already owned. You could not newly enslave an Indian. If a person imported and enslaved a  non-African, that would be illegal, because they were out of limits. The specific language is as follows for Virginia: Notice that there is an exemption for a person ""passing through"". So, for example, if a foreign diplomat had, say, a Burmese slave and was just traveling through the state, then that would be allowed. Note that the same laws forbade free negroes or mulattoes from settling in Virginia, as defined by being of one-fourth blood of a negro. Such people could be arrested at will and expelled from the state."
CIA mole in Indira Gandhi's Cabinet,"The averted 1971 confrontation between India and Pakistan was a cold war near miss.  Like the Cuban missile crisis.  India was backed by the USSR, Pakistan was backed by China.  India was preparing to invade Pakistan with Soviet backing, and the US was afraid China would get involved to support their ally Pakistan.  The entire mess was occurring months ahead of Nixon's trip to China, which would cement the opening of China and become a cornerstone of US foreign policy for the next five decades.   In truth it was Nixon's signature foreign policy move. In 1983, Seymour Hersh (Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who broke the My Lai Massacre in Vietnam, and Abu Grab abuses in Iraq war) alleged in his book, ""Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House,"" that Former PM Morarji Desai was the “most important” informer of the CIA, who was paid $20,000 annually by the agency to pass on information during the Indo-Pak war of 1971.   --- 1989 Desai filed a case in a US court to dispute this.  Former Sec State Kissinger testified in Court that Morarji Desai was not a U.S. Source.   That suit was dismissed on legal technicalities in 1989. In 2005, with documents relating to these issues in front of the CIA, the State Department confirmed the existence of a highly placed CIA mole operating out of the Indira Gandhi's cabinet.  These records are enough proof to reveal the extent of the damage that was caused to India's national interests by the CIA mole.  From ""3 D Deceit, Duplicity & Dissimulation of U.S. Foreign Policy Towards India"" (Dec 25, 2011)
The latest on this case came from declassified MEA Files.  The Indian establishment had prior information that US journalist Seymour Hersh, contacted some Indian officials before making such serious charges in his book.  Contrary to their claim at the time."
Why did people have so many children in Victorian times?,"There is a name in the medical community for those who rely on withdrawal as a contraception method - such people are referred to as ""parents"". Your average high school health textbook will give you the success rate for various types of pre-modern contraception.  (Remember that artificial contraception was illegal in some countries).  Childhood mortality rate could run over 50% and the only way of ensuring a safe and healthy retirement was to have lots of children. There was no welfare state to offer you a pension. If you wanted to eat after you were too old to work, the only option was to have enough children to make it likely that one of them would survive and be wealthy enough to support you.  If your family is very poor, then the marginal cost of raising a child is small; it doesn't take that much more money to support a family of 14 than a family of 12 - and few people could save any money, so 2 children didn't create more wealth than 12.  Just less love. There are also strong psychological reasons - Cursory research on modern single motherhood in poverty suggests that the love of a child is one of the few things that is assured in a world where little can be controlled.  Two additional points based on comments - I don't have research to back this up. "
How to rebut Holocaust denial argument?,"What are you trying to rebut, that the plaque changed, or that the number of deaths is uncertain? Maybe the plaque originally stated the estimated number killed total, but now it just refers to the number killed at Auschwitz. Without knowing the exact text of the plaque, it is hard to say. The death of 1.1 million is the current total accepted by the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. Rebuttal: just because there is uncertainty in the total number of deaths, does not mean there is uncertainty that there were death camps or that millions were executed in those camps."
Did pirates really drink a lot of rum?,"Rum was easily obtained in the sugarcane rich Caribbean and olden day South Seas Pirates, who would drink anything they could get their hands on if it had a kick, were associated with the drinking of rum. So, while they would drink other forms of liquor if they could obtain it, the average Pirate crew member drank what he could afford, and that's what made rum the drink of choice. In 1740 the addition of citrus to watered down rum, better known as Grog, proved to be helpful in warding off scurvy. I've also read that casked water took on a dreadful flavor after being stored for extended periods of time so adding water and citrus to rum (grog) eased the consumption of the tainted water.   It is because of the reasons listed above that Rum swilling Pirates became a timeworn stereotype.  "
"If the Ch’in dynasty was so short-lived, why was China named for it?","The original question is a bit vague as to who exactly is calling China, well, ""China."" This also means that it's a bit tricky to pin down what exactly the word ""China"" refers to (e.g. is it the same word as ""Cathay,"" ""Sina,"" etc.? Is it even referring to a nation?), especially because it's not at all a certainty that ""China"" is derived from ""Ch'in/Qin"" (I'll refer to it by its Pinyin romanization ""Qin"" for the rest of this answer). It's also not exactly clear what ""Qin"" refers to as there are many political entities in China's history that shared that name. The first dynasty to unify China? The state that preceded the dynasty? One of quite a few states in later periods of disunity? So let's address each part of that. Here's some more details on each one in turn. But first caveats galore. Nailing down exactly what a ""nation"" (and hence what actually corresponds to the notion of ""China"") is gets pretty difficult as you go back in time: Modern nation-states have a tendency to tie together a piece of land, a government institution, and a cultural heritage in a single package. These things historically have often not been packaged together in many societies and ""China"" is no exception. A single government might control many different lands and many different peoples, a single land might be controlled by many different governments and many different people, or a single people might be subjects of many different governments and live in many different lands. I'm going to be moving loosely between words that apply to land that is a sizable subset of modern-day China and people whose culture most Chinese people would probably agree is part of their cultural heritage. With those in mind, let's dive in! The Chinese people have called their nation and themselves many names through time, many of which come from dynastic names. Qin does not figure among them however (except during times and places of rule by the Qin). The first dynasty of China had a rather bad rap among later generations, mainly due to massacring scholars who didn't follow the Legalist school of thought. As the early 20th century Sinologist Berthold Laufer put it: [The] Chinese people never called themselves after the Ts'in for whom their scholars professed a thorough contempt... (The Name China. Berthold Laufer. T'oung Pao, Second Series, Vol. 13, No. 5 (1912). pg. 723) Here's a list of alternatives. Early 20th century Sinologists such as Paul Pelliot and Berthold Laufer expounded at length about the likelihood that the Indo-European cognates of ""China"" all come from Qin (Laufer in particular changes his opinion later in life from initially opposing the idea to coming around to it). This is far from unanimous though. Endymion Wilkinson instead seems to attribute the origin to ""silk"":  ""Seres"" (the silk people) may have been intended by some Roman writers to refer ot the Chinese. ""Silk"" possibly came from Latin sericus, itself in turn derived by way of Greek and Roman from the Old Chinese pronunciation sie for si (Chinese History: A Manual. Wilkinson. Pg. 752) This mainly matches with the timelines established for most of the Indo-European cognates claimed to have descended from Qin. In particular, Laufer and Pelliot both mention a 300 B.C. dating of the Sanskrit word Cina given by Hermann Jacobi, which Laufer initially takes as evidence against the Qin origin and which Pelliot seems to hand-wave away as a potential hedge that perhaps ""China"" comes from the pre-unification Qin state, but still believes L'opinion traditionnelle, qui invoque le souvenir de Ts'in Che-houang-ti, me paraît encore, sinon certaine, du moins le plus probable. (L'Origine du nom de ""Chine"". Paul Pelliot. T'oung Pao, Second Series, Vol. 13, No. 5 (1912). Pg. 740.)  The traditional opinion [that ""Chine"" comes from Qin], which invokes the memory of Qin Shi Huangdi, still appears to me, if not certain, at least the most probable. At the end of the day it seems like all the academic sources just settle on Occam's Razor. Like I said, hard to answer well or rigorously."
Were the living standards in Medieval Europe a lot worse than in the Muslim world?,"This may be off topic as Wikipedia has a pretty complete article on the Islamic Golden Age.  The short answer is yes, while European nobles were sitting on wooden/stone chairs in cold stone buildings, the Arab nobles were laying on comfortable carpets, living a pretty good life quite similar to the old Roman nobles, enjoying many exotic goods and luxuries. 
There are records of visiting Europeans being quite impressed by the lavish living conditions of the Arab upper-classes. Of course, the masses of the people usually didn't have it so good and being part of the lower-classes during that time, whether in Europe or in the Muslim world, probably wouldn't have been as enjoyable.  There were however various public services in the Muslim world, like 24/7 hospitals that at some points were forbidden from turning away patients who could not afford to pay for healthcare. Education was also highly valued and public schools were available, as well as public libraries (the two would have often been combined). Sewers and clean water systems were functioning pretty good, and Muslims washed regularly (something that got adopted only later in Europe) which provided better overall hygiene. Freedom of expression was also relatively higher (although not in the modern Western sens), and interestingly, many things said and written by Muslims during that era would seem unimaginable and heretic to some Muslims today. During this period the Arabs made considerable advances in science, education, medicine, philosophy etc, basing themselves on the great works of antiquity. In the mean time European scholars were stuck with a very inflexible Catholic church. Italian merchants eventually brought these advances and ""resurrected"" ancient texts back to Europe which triggered the Renaissance, which also coincides with the end of the Islamic Golden Age. Sources: Wikipedia Metaexistence Islamic History Online EDIT What I mean by: while European nobles were sitting on wooden/stone chairs in cold
  stone buildings is that there was a severe drop in the standard of living of European nobles following the fall of the Western Roman Empire. They lost access to many of the luxuries goods from the East and much of the engineering, architectural, philosophical and medical knowledge known to the Romans.  Overall, life would have been more enjoyable in the Muslim world during the European Middle Ages. Assuming of course that you were lucky enough to be born a free man, which applies throughout History."
Did people in China resort to cannibalism during the reign of Mao?,"Yes we have at least one account of cannibalism.

"Why did Roosevelt and Churchill use voice-based telecommunication, instead of simpler text-based options which were easier to encrypt?","During that period, both Churchill and Roosevelt were old men more used to hand written letters than ""high technology"" teletype writers.

Were there any travel restrictions during the Black Death pandemic?,"SHORT ANSWER Yes, there were some restrictions on movement during the period 1347 - 51 but mostly (with a few exceptions such as some city states and Poland) they were haphazard and depended on local or personal initiatives and / or religion rather than national governments.  Invariably, the measures that were taken were too little, too late. Further, although it was widely recognized that people got sick after being in contact with the sick, travel and gatherings in the form of pilgrimages and processions were actually sometimes encouraged. DETAILS Europe Parts of Italy were ahead of most other regions in Europe in imposing restrictions on movement. An early example from 1347 was that many Italian ports began to turn away ships, fearful that they carried the deadly
  disease. By March 1348, these protective measures were formalised and
  Venice became the first city to close its ports to incoming vessels.
  Those they did admit were subjected to 30 days of isolation, later
  raised to 40, which eventually lead to the birth of the term
  ‘quarantine’, for ships were forced to wait in the middle of the
  Venetian lagoon before they were permitted to disembark. Other ports, though, were less cautious: In the western Mediterranean, tales were told of Plague ships from
  Messina being kept from Genoa by wary authorities, but at least one
  found port in Marseille, France, in January 1348. Source: Jospeh P.Byrne, 'The Black Death' (2004) In Europe, Italian cities led the way in implementing travel restrictions: Travel bans to or from plague-stricken areas developed early and in
  Italy among the northern city-states. In January 1348, Lucca banned
  entry to anyone from Catalonia, Genoa, or the Romagna; in Visconti
  territories, Milan, Parma, and Padua denied access to any foreigners;
  and Venice restricted access to ambassadors. Source: Joseph P. Byrne, 'Encyclopedia of the Black Death'(2012) In the case of Milan, in spring 1348, the duke and his councilors decided on two courses of
  action. First, deny entrance to the city to anyone from any place
  suspected of plague; and, should plague appear in the city,
  immediately isolate cases in their own homes. It worked. According to
  Agnolo di Tura, only three families suffered, and Milan avoided the
  fate of most urban areas. Source: Byrne, 'Encyclopedia' Also in Italy, in May 1348 the northern city of Pistoia introduced
  wide-ranging laws affecting many aspects of daily life. Restrictions
  on imports and exports, travel, market trading and funerals were all
  brought in, but again to no effect. At least 70% of the population
  died. In Florence, and doubtless elsewhere, groups of people isolated themselves, refusing to admit outsiders to their place of isolation. The writer Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-75) wrote that: Some people were of the opinion that a sober and abstemious mode of
  living considerably reduced the risk of infection. They therefore
  formed themselves into groups and lived in isolation from everyone
  else. Having withdrawn to a comfortable abode where there were no sick
  persons, they locked themselves in and settled down to a peaceable
  existence... Source: John Aberth, 'The Black Death: The Great Mortality of 1348-1350' Often in Europe, though, people waited with dread before fleeing when the plague struck their locality. People coming from infected communities were, unsurprisingly, mostly unwelcome. For example, the chronicler Geoffrey the Baker wrote that the plague ravaged Devon and Somerset up to Bristol. As a result, the people of
  Gloucester denied admission to people from Bristol, believing that the
  breath of those who had lived among the dying would be infectious. Source: Rosemary Horrox, 'The Black Death' (Manchester Medieval Sources series, 1994) Despite Gloucester's precautions, the plague spread to there too. It was only when the shortage of labour in England began to affect landlords that laws were passed in 1349 and 1351 which, in addition to attempting to control wage demands, restricted the mobility of peasants. These laws, though, were for economic reasons rather than to prevent the spread of the plague (and they were widely flouted). Perceived economic necessity was also behind a law in Cahors (France) aimed at preventing people from fleeing the town. The lack of citizens due to fleeing contributed to local financial resources drying up in many areas, hence the advice of the king's advisor: In August 1348, he told the consuls of Cahors that to raise money for
  repairing the town fortifications they should levy stiff fines on
  those citizens who had fled the plague and refused to return to the
  city. Source: John B. Henneman, Jr., 'The Black Death and Royal Taxation in France, 1347-1351'. In 'Speculum,' Vol. 43, No. 3 (Jul., 1968), pp. 405-428. Although it was widely noticed that those who came into contact with sick also got sick (and there are examples of places where people were confined to their homes if they were sick) , the church unsurprisingly focused on prayer, fasting and virtuous living, as did King Edward III in England. Also, far from encouraging people not to travel, the papacy declared 1350 a Jubilee Year, in which a pilgrimage to the churches of
  Rome would earn pilgrims a plenary indulgence – the full remission of
  the penance due for their sins. Source: Horrox The Muslim World In the Muslim world, adherents in Cairo were told not to enter a plague-afflicted area, and nor were they to leave it. Many held to the belief that the Plague was entirely the will of Allah: it is a mercy to the
  faithful victims, since they will go immediately to Paradise, and
  punishment for the infidels. Source: Byrne, 'The Black Death' Thus, Muslims were to neither flee nor enter a place where the Plague raged After 1351 The plague recurred many times over the following centuries and, while it often went unchecked, precautions were taken in some places: A document from 1377 states that before entering the city-state of
  Ragusa (modern Dubrovnik in Croatia), newcomers had to spend 30 days
  (a trentine) in a restricted place (originally nearby islands) waiting
  to see whether the symptoms of Black Death would develop.[13] In 1448
  the Venetian Senate prolonged the waiting period to 40 days, thus
  giving birth to the term ""quarantine"". By the 15th century at least, some authorities were becoming more organized. In parts of Italy, Bills of Health (certifying that the bearer was healthy) for travellers were common: In 1494 the Florentine government reconstituted the health board with
  which they had experimented in 1348. Five men with six-month terms
  kept watch on where the Plague was being reported, provided clean
  bills of health for Florentine travelers, and condemned violators of
  sanitation laws. As Luca Landucci pointed out in his diary..., during
  the epidemic of the late 1490s they also expelled poor victims of
  disease from the city, an action taken by many cities in Europe. Source: Byrne, 'The Black Death' However, it took longer for the idea of Bills of Health to take hold in England: The earliest known English example is York, which required
  certification from people arriving from plague-stricken Maldon in
  1536; York was a century ahead of most of England. Source: Byrne, 'Encyclopedia'"
Where does the name 'D-Day' come from?,"D-Day and H-Hour are generic terms for the beginning of an operation when one does not yet know the date and time of the operation. Thereafter planners refer to the days following the start of the operation as D+1, D+2, D+3. For example, Operation Overlord was tentatively planned for June 5th, but weather delayed its start to June 6th. Because the plans referred to ""D-Day"" and ""D+1"", the plans need no adjustment. The D and H don't mean anything, they're just a bit of jargon to clearly and succinctly indicate the start of the operation. ""On the day we will"" or ""at the start of the operation we will..."" vs ""On D-Day we will..."". It's like in math, ""you have X apples and I have X+1 apples"", except it's ""you have A apples, and I have A+1 apples"" to avoid ambiguity about what X+1 means. At the time, Operation Overlord was just another operation (a big one) which would be talked about in terms of D-Day and H-Hour. It's only the fame of the operation where the term ""D-Day"" became popular with laymen and attached to that particular operation. The earliest recorded practice is from WW1 in ""Combat Orders"" from the The General Service Schools at Fort Leavenworth, Kanas 1922-1923 Section IV.25. ""D DAY"" AND ""H HOUR.""—a. General—(1) When orders or plans are prepared for an operation that is to take place on a date, and at an hour, as yet undetermined, or, concerning which, secrecy is essential, the expressions ""D Day"" and ""H Hour"" are used to indicate that the date and hour of the operation are to be announced in subsequent orders. For example, field orders No. 7 state ""* * the division attacks on D day at H hour * * *."" Subsequent orders state ""* * * * reference FO No 7, D day is January 15; H hour is 5:30 AM * * *."" It is then understood that the operation ordered by field orders No 7 is to take place at 5:30 AM, January 14. (2) D Day and H Hour are fixed, the same for all elements of the command. When the operations of any element of the command are to commence at some time prior or subsequent to D Day or H Hour, the time is indicated as ""D-Day (or H Hour) plus (or minus) so many days (hours or minutes)."" This is explained in detail in sub-paragraphs b and c following. b. D Day. (1) There is but one ""D Day"" for all units participating in a given operation. Thus it is erroneous to announce that D Day, for example, is January 15 for some elements of a command, and is January 16 for other elements. (2) The first, second, third, etc., days, following D Day, are referred to as ""D plus 1 day,"" ""D plus 2 days,"" ""D plus 3 days,"" etc. (3) The first, second, third, etc., days, preceding D Day, are referred to as ""D minus 1 day,"" ""D minus 2 days,"" ""D minus 3 days,"" etc. (4) (a) Nights are referred to thus: (b) For example, assuming D day to be January 14, then the nights referred to, in the above illustration, are: c. H Hour (1) There is but one ""H Hour"" for all units participating in a particular operation. Thus it is erroneous to announce that H Hour, for example, is 10:00 AM for some elements of the command and is 2:00 PM for other elements. (2) H Hour is some specified hour on D Day; i.e., it is included within the twenty-four hours (midnight to midnight) comprising the calendar date of D Day. To state, in an order, that ""H Hour is on D Day"" is redundant, hence unnecessary.
thus: (3) Specified times, following H Hour, are indicated (4) Specified times, preceding H Hour, are indicated
thus: (5) Although a combination of hours and minutes is usual, in designating specified times preceding or following H Hour, it is sometimes preferable, in concentration and barrage tables, for example, to use minutes only. In such instances, for example, the time is written ""H plus 75 minutes"" instead of ""H plus 1 hour and 15 minutes."" (6) When indicating an hour that is referred to H Hour as a basis, the time indicated may not be included in D Day. Thus, assuming H Hour to be 12:00 noon, then ""H plus 13 hours"" is 1:00 AM the following day, and ""H minus 13 hours"" is 11:00 PM the preceding day. When unnecessary to refer to H hour as a basis, these times are referred to, respectively, as ""1:00 AM, D plus 1 day"" and ""11:00 PM, D minus 1 day."""
Why were nomadic tribes (like the Mongols) from the Eurasian steppes a much reduced threat from the 15th century onwards?,"My source for this answer is mostly Devereaux's discussion of ""the Fremen Mirage"" and other writing on his site about steppe nomads, which goes in-depth into what made the Mongols so powerful for their time - and why that time came to an end. The answer has remarkably little to do with weaponry. The steppe nomad composite bow is an incredibly powerful weapon that strikes at long range, especially combined with Mongol skirmish doctrine that could break up formations. There's a reason that the major firearm users of this time period were Western European, rather than the people fighting the steppe nomads, and it's not because Western Europeans were smarter. Gun-wielding armies had the same big weakness as bow-wielding armies: logistics. Mongol armies could move many times faster than military formations organized by agrarian states - up to 60 miles per day compared to 10 miles for infantry armies. This is not only explained by their horses but also by their source of subsistence - soldiers could drink mare's milk from their mount, and when moving together with their herds, slaughter sheep to stay on the move for months. Meanwhile, an agrarian army can only carry about 10-20 days worth of rations for soldiers and animals. The steppe pony can survive on just grass; the larger European horse (to give one example) must be stall-fed. If you want to use firearms, you have to bring wagons of gunpowder and spare parts (it's much harder to fix a damaged musket than an axe in the field) further reducing your range. So a Mongol army seemed like it could appear anywhere, while to attack the Mongols (either to chase their armies or to strike their civilian population and resource base) required taking an army into a steppe that could not sustain it for more than a handful of days. Mongols could therefore engage in battle pretty much on their own terms, and if they ever lost they could retreat, come back and try again with most of their strength intact (battles were won or lost based on morale and cohesion, rather than killing everyone, and wars were won through sieges and holding ground). The agrarians' slow-moving armies could not follow the Mongols into the steppe, and could not pull the same trick off with their own assets (farms and towns) for obvious reasons. The Mongols were defeated when that logistical advantage was overcome. Partly this was due to the development of an Early Modern centralized state that could organize supply dumps, long-distance transportation, and more effective mobilization & training of its soldiers rather than relying on vassals to ride out with whoever they happened to have on hand. The firearm becomes useful only in this context - in the hands of a state able to organize manufacture, issue, doctrine development, training, and logistical support. But such a state does not need guns in order to win battles because its troops are already much higher quality. Its superior organization also means that it can hold ground in the steppe, and eventually settle it, to deny the Mongols pasture land in the long term and therefore win strategic victories that can meaningfully add up over time, which is how Muscovy was able to turn the stalemate at Ugra into eventual domination of former Mongol lands. Meanwhile the Mongol pastoral way of life was about as optimized as it could be for their circumstances. Their bottleneck was not logistics or equipment, but population: every adult male is already a soldier, and already using the best weapon available. Even if they could increase their population, you can only graze so many horses (and sheep) on one plot of grassland before they eat all the grass (consider that every mounted rider needs several horses). The Mongols could not innovate their system to overcome the loss of their logistical advantage."
What is the oldest European royal house?,"In terms of continuously dateable genealogy, it is probably the Bagratids of Georgia, the current head of which is disputed between three branches. 
The Georgian branch was founded by Adarnase in the late 700s as branch of the Armenian Bagratuni dynasty, though descendants then fabricated an origin story claiming descent from the biblical David, which is obviously fanciful fiction. The Bragatids may have had recorded ancestors as far back as classical antiquity, but the intervening genealogy is basically non-existent. Another candidate is the House of France, founded in 987 by Hugh Capet. It current survives in the legitimate male line through a cadet branch, headed  by Jean d'Orléans. Hugh Capet was himself a male line descendant of the Robertians, and thus the Capetians can trace their descent at least as far back as Robert the Strong, and probably to Robert II of Worms, before 800. The earliest ancestors of the Robertian lineage can be pushed as far back as Charibert of Hesbaye in the 500s, but very little is known about him and the intervening genealogy is not definitive. Realistically, there's probably any number of ancient dynasties that survive to this day, but without genealogical records to identify their descendants. This is particularly true because the question did not specify legitimate issue - unfaithful princes are legion in history, and with enough bastards you can win the probability game. For the most part however, bastards and non-inheriting sons (who do not otherwise distinguish themselves), as well as dispossessed houses in general, rapidly fade out of history. The House of Plantagenet, for instance, is usually held to be extinct in the legitimate male line with the execution of Edward in 1499. However, it actually survives in the male line through Henry Somerset, whose direct male line ancestor John Beaufort was a legitimised bastard of John of Gaunt. Note that the first Plantagenet, Geoffrey V of Anjou inherited his title cognatically, but was an agnatic descendant of the less known Geoffrey I of Châteaudun. This Geoffrey in turn seems to have been a direct agnatic descendant Rorgon I of Maine. This would mean that the Rorgonid dynasty, established before 819, survives today through Henry Somerset. These examples illustrate a second problem, which is that the earliest genealogy of older dynasties are actually very unclear. It is thus very difficult to date the age of a dynasty accurately. Although there are conventional founding dates, the founders were themselves members of powerful established dynasties, so it is essentially a judgement call to determine where a dynasty begins. While outside Europe, an honourable mention goes to the House of Confucius. His 79th generation descendant in the direct agnatic line, Kung Tsui-chang, still holds title as the hereditary Sacrificial Official in Taiwan. This is a ministerial level post created as a Republican continuation of the Holy Dukes of Yen, after the Chinese Revolution abolished every other title of nobility. Confucius was himself a 16th generation descendant in the male line of Di Yi, who was the penultimate king of Shang China. That royal dynasty was founded by Chen Tang when he was said to have overthrown the previous (but legendary) Xia dynasty circa 1675 BC. Thus, although his line hasn't been sovereign for some 3000 years, Kung Tsui-chang is an agnatic descendant of the oldest archaeologically-confirmed ruling house of China. Note on the terminology: This question seems to have attracted some confusion over what ""dynasty"" means. While dynasty is not generally a strictly well defined term, genealogical descent is. A lineage that is traced exclusively through male offsprings is patrilineal, or agnatic. Those that goes through any combination of male or female links is called cognatic. A dynasty can thus be simultaneously extinct in the agnatic line while persevering in the cognatic line. For example, while Queen Elizabeth is technically the last agnatic member of the British Saxe-Coburg and Gotha line to reign, the Windsor dynasty continues cognatically though her children, e.g. Prince Charles. Likewise, the House of Austria was technically extinct with the death of Maria Theresa in 1780, but survives cognatically through her children as the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. An even earlier example is the House of Welf, which became extinct in the male line with the death of Welf III in 1055, but survives in the cognatic line through his sister to this very day. Since the question specifies patrilineal descent, cognatic survivals are excluded."
When did Britain learn about the American Declaration of Independence?,"The news reached London on the 10th of August. It was, of course, known by British officials in the colonies much earlier, but It is astonishing how casually the Declaration was first reported to
  official London. On July 8 ex-Governor Tryon in New York wrote to
  Lord George Germain, the colonial secretary, and Admiral Shuldham
  wrote to the Admiralty Office, but neither of them made any reference
  to the momentous document. On the same day General Howe also wrote to
  Lord Germain, and buried in his letter is the brief sentence: 'I am
  informed that the Continental Congress have declared the United
  Colonies Free and Independent States.' That was all, as if he were
  reporting that Congress had recessed or had issued some new currency.
  These three letters reached London on August 10, making very good time
  crossing the Atlantic. Source: H. Peckham, Independence: The View from Britain (Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society, October 1975, Volume 85, Part 2) As called2voyage and T.E.D. have pointed out in their comments, Mr. Peckham should not be astonished by this, and the author himself notes that At least two pamphlets had appeared earlier in the summer predicting
  that the colonies were going to separate themselves from the crown. Granted, the pamphlets were not quite the same thing but then the two sides were already at war (see also T.E.D.'s answer). On the declaration itself: ...by the middle of August a copy of the Declaration did reach London
  by some other means, as it was completely printed in The London
  Chronicle under date of August 16, although that issue of the paper
  appeared on the 17th or 18th. The British ministers and King George
  now all had a chance to read the forthright statement and react to it. Source: H. Peckham Also, The St. James's Chronicle (London) for August 15-17 printed the
  Declaration in full, but with some curious editing to protect the
  king's name. In the second paragraph, where it reads 'The History
  of the present King of Great-Britain,' the wording has been changed to
  read: 'The present History of Great-Britain.' This omission of the king
  then makes it possible to change all the charges leveled against him
  from 'he' to 'it,' referring to Great Britain rather than the monarch. On the reaction of the monarch and the government, Official reaction did not yet manifest itself. Parliament was in its
  long summer recess, and most of His Majesty's ministers were out of
  London at their country residences. They did not feel compelled to
  issue statements, and as a matter of fact they looked upon the
  Declaration as a kind of dying gasp from a revolutionary force that
  was expiring. The military situation made them optimistic.... The rebellion couldn't
  last. Source: H. Peckham The British government reacted by hiring John Lind, an English politician and pamphleteer,
  to write a rebuttal to the declaration. He wrote Answer to the
  Declaration of the American Congress, a reply that tried to pick apart
  the Declaration of Independence. Lind focused on the issue of slavery,
  saying that the colonists were actually angry that King George III had
  offered freedom to the slaves.... Following this, King George III officially declared the colonies to be
  in a state of rebellion. By August of 1776, the King ordered troops to
  the colonies. Not until October 31st did the king speak before parliament: In his address, the king spoke about the signing of the U.S.
  Declaration of Independence and the revolutionary leaders who signed
  it, saying, “for daring and desperate is the spirit of those leaders,
  whose object has always been dominion and power, that they have now
  openly renounced all allegiance to the crown, and all political
  connection with this country.” The king went on to inform Parliament
  of the successful British victory over General George Washington and
  the Continental Army at the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776,
  but warned them that, “notwithstanding the fair prospect, it was
  necessary to prepare for another campaign.”"

When did Canada become truly independent?,"There have been several stages in the history of Canadian independence. Canada became a self-governing dominion within the British empire on 1 July 1867 when the British North America Act was passed by the UK Parliament. The Statute of Westminster, passed by the UK Parliament in 1931, acknowledged Canada as co-equal with the United Kingdom within the British Commonwealth. Canada obtained full autonomy when the UK Parliament passed the Canada Act 1982 in 1982. This granted full sovereignty to Canada, and so marks the date at which Canada became truly independent. As a side note, and as noted in the comments below, the Queen's role as monarch of Canada is entirely separate from her role as the British monarch. She is Queen of the United Kingdom, and also, Queen of Canada by an act of the Canadian Parliament (The Royal Style and Titles Act). The fact that the Queen is head of state of both the UK and Canada (and also in 15 other Commonwealth nations) does not affect Canada's sovereignty as an independent country at all."
Was Alexander the Great Greek or Macedonian?,"Prior to Phillip's time, the ancient Greek world was fragmented in (often warring) city states and kingdoms, and citizenship was considered far more important than nationality or ancestry. Pericles' reforms (451 BC) exemplify the distinction: From that point on Athenian citizens would lose their citizenship if they married non Athenians, regardless of their Hellenic ancestry. Similar laws, more or less, existed in Sparta, Athen's cultural and political counterweight, and all around the Ancient Greek world. In a comparably similar manner, both Philip and Alexander favoured the citizens and soldiers of Macedon over the rest of the Greeks. The first time the Greeks became a single political entity, with the notable exception of Sparta, was the League of Corinth (337 BC). Thus the concept of Greek nationality was just one year old when Philip was assassinated and the 20 year old Alexander assumed power. However his ancestry had been considered Hellenic since the times of Hesiod and Homer and his dynasty had been recognized as ethnically Greek since at least the Graeco-Persian wars.  Simply put, ancient Macedonians were one of the many Hellenic tribes. What bonded them with the other Hellenic tribes - the Minoans, Achaeans, Ionians, Mycenaeans, Dorians, and Epirots to name a few - was a cultural and historical bond, not a national or ethnic one. The Macedonias spoke in a Greek dialect, worshipped the gods of Olympus and followed all major traditions of their fellow Hellenes. If we approach the question strictly from a cultural perspective, the answer is obvious: ancient Macedonians were decisively Greek.  There's an abudance of archaeological evidence for the above in Dion, the Macedonian sacred city. Dion was build in the feet of mount Olympus and early in the 5th century it became the cultural and religious centre of the kingdom of Macedon. Archelaus I of Macedon created a sanctuary in honour of Zeus and re-organized and brought to prominence a nine days festival (the Olympia) in honour of Zeus and the Muses. Every major city state of the era build their own sanctuaries in Dion - some still visible - and participated in the festivities.  The Greeks weren't particularly xenophobic, but they never participated in barbarians' religious festivities or allowed barbarians to participate in their own. It only takes a short walk through the ruins of Dion to quickly realize the Macedonians were widely accepted as Greeks by the other Hellenic tribes. Hesiod (750 - 650 BC) gives us a beautiful story of the origins of Macedonians, in Catalogue of Women. According to his mythology, Macedon was Hellen's nephew. Hellen was the mythological progenitor of the Hellenes and where the words Hellas and Hellene come from. This mythological relationship binds Macedonians with the other major tribes of the era: The Hesiodic mythology is our basis for which tribes of the era can be considered Hellenic. If we doubt the Macedonians' belief that they were Hellen's descendants, I don't see why we don't doubt the similar beliefs of the rest of the Hellenic tribes. The royal house of Macedon claimed an Argive1 descent, tracing their origin to the legendary Hercules2. Herodotus presents the claim in his Histories, by describing an event that took place prior to the naval battle of Salamis (492 BC). Alexander I of Macedon, while visiting the Greek camp as an envoy for the Persian general Mardonius2, proclaims his Greek ancestry: [Hdt. 9.45.1] Hearing that, the generals straightway went with the men to the outposts. When they had come, Alexander said to them: “Men of Athens, I give you this message in trust as a secret which you must reveal to no one but Pausanias, or else you will be responsible for my undoing. In truth I would not tell it to you if I did not care so much for all Hellas;
[Hdt. 9.45.2] I myself am by ancient descent a Greek, and I would not willingly see Hellas change her freedom for slavery. I tell you, then, that Mardonius and his army cannot get omens to his liking from the sacrifices. Otherwise you would have fought long before this. Now, however, it is his purpose to pay no heed to the sacrifices, and to attack at the first glimmer of dawn, for he fears, as I surmise, that your numbers will become still greater. Therefore, I urge you to prepare, and if (as may be) Mardonius should delay and not attack, wait patiently where you are; for he has but a few days' provisions left.
  [Hdt. 9.45.3] If, however, this war ends as you wish, then must you take thought how to save me too from slavery, who have done so desperate a deed as this for the sake of Hellas in my desire to declare to you Mardonius' intent so that the barbarians may not attack you suddenly before you yet expect them. I who speak am Alexander the Macedonian.” With that he rode away back to the camp and his own station there. The Greco-Persian Wars and Herodotus' account are significant because this is the first time in Greek history the Greeks united, even if only to face a common enemy. The Argeads claim of Greek ancestry was successfully put to the test 20 years after the battle of Salamis, when Alexander attempted to participate in the Olympic Games (500 or 504 BC): [Hdt. 5.22.1] Now that these descendants of Perdiccas are Greeks, as they themselves say, I myself chance to know and will prove it in the later part of my history. Furthermore, the Hellenodicae who manage the contest at Olympia determined that it is so,
  [Hdt. 5.22.2] for when Alexander chose to contend and entered the lists for that purpose, the Greeks who were to run against him wanted to bar him from the race, saying that the contest should be for Greeks and not for foreigners. Alexander, however, proving himself to be an Argive, was judged to be a Greek. He accordingly competed in the furlong race and tied step for first place. This, then, is approximately what happened. The Greeks contesting Alexander's ancestry was most probably politically motivated. Macedonia was a Persian puppet state during the Graeco-Persian wars, and it's not unreasonable that the Greek world was uncomfortable with a Macedonian competing in the Games. Still, the Hellenodicae ruled in favour of Alexander and it should be noted that Archelaus I had also competed in the Games prior to the Persian invasion. In recent years, starting from the late 19th century and onwards, there have been various efforts to question Alexander's ancestry and essentially rewrite history. Most of these efforts are related to the often bitter Macedonia naming dispute. This complicated political issue has produced tons of documentation, from both sides, and the politically charged rhetoric is where the historically false dichotomy of Greek or Macedonian comes from.

Did the Romans have winter uniforms?,"They were not supermen by any means :)
But yes, temperatures were higher, by more than 1 degree (Kent and Wales were famous for their wines, right now it's far too cold there for that for example).
And don't forget that in the Roman era, wars were fought in summer almost exclusively, later expanding into spring and autumn as the conscript army was replaced by a professional one. The reasons for this are in large part practical. I have seen pictures of Roman troops along Hadrian's wall (where there were permanently manned bases) wearing wool and fur cloaks, trousers, and boots similar to what the locals would wear. The Romans were pragmatists if anything, and were never afraid to adopt local customs if they made sense to them (similarly, Romans were quick to welcome foreign gods into their religion, as long as those gods were not those of monotheistic religions like Judaism and Christianity which claimed all other gods to be false and were thus a threat to the Roman state which relied like so many on the divinity of their rulers (especially during the imperial era, during the republic they afaik were merely endorsed by the temples rather than claiming to be divine themselves))."
Why did the grip-centered viking shield fall out of use relative to the kite shields?,"It's important to note that concrete information on how shields were used is scant, so a large part of any discussion on this subject is speculation and logic.  That said, kite shields had an obvious advantage in extending protection to the lower half of the body. This was especially relevant to the cavalry, and particularly so in a period when leg armour was not common, since the height of their legs make them natural targets for an enemy. Of course, the downsides of kite shields are equally obvious: they were heavy and awkward to maneuver. That is, the benefits were less meaningful, and yet the drawbacks more serious, for leg infantry. Round shields did not actually ""fall out of use"" until the Renaissance, and they also continued to be held in a central grip. It was the weight of kite shields which necessitated strapping them to the users, rather than inherent potential tactical advantages per se. Later manuals indicate that the smaller, and lighter round bucklers were extended in a fist far out from the body, so as to be ready to block any incoming blows with little movement. Strapping them to the forearm would've considerably limited this. See this depiction from the late 13th century Boulogne-sur-Mer BM MS.131:  Anyway, returning to kite shields. It's probably a safe bet that it was not a coincidence that kite shields became common around the time cavalry began to dominate in Medieval Europe, and declined once leg armour became widespread. The heater shield that largely replaced them are noticeably shorter. In other words, once the benefits for leg protection diminished, kite shields were replaced by lighter and more maneuverable, shorter shields. Note that round shields remained in use throughout the same period. For illustration, consider the knights with kite shields from the Bayeux Tapestry:  Compare and contrast with these from the Rochester Bestiary, circa mid-thirteenth century:  In the latter, we can see the legs were protected by chausses. This is conspicuously absent from most of the armoured figures depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry, most of whom only wore knee-length hauberks."
"When did Germans begin to call themselves ""Deutsche""?","There is a text written by Luther called ""an den christlichen Adel deutscher Nation"" (exact spelling!). So the word ""deutsch"" is very old. However, even from the 1848 revolution on (short-living foundation of a German Democracy that was supposed to overcome the small monarchies (""Kleinstaaten"")) or from 1871 on (Foundation of the 2nd Reich), Germans didn't consider themselves as Germans at once.  Yes, it was the same German Empire, with the ""Kaiser der Deutschen"" from 1871 on, but people still identified themselves strongly with their Land and their respective King (Württemberg, Sachsen, Bayern, Hessen ...) or City (Hamburg, Bremen, Lübeck) that constituted the federally organized Reich. One interesting source is the author Karl May: In his adventure stories, he gave Germans mostly positive roles, but among them, all German heros were Saxonian (as the author himself). Maybe it is similar for Americans form the US: Being American but being Texan (etc.) as well. So there was a slow transition that was not equally fast. This transition came to an end in the years around 1933. I once read that from that time on German mountaineers wrote ""deutsch"" as their nationality in the summit logs much more often. Previously, they preferred ""bayrisch"" or ""sächsisch"" etc. This is an interesting source because summit logs are for the voluntary mountaineering community only, so it is not influenced by the authorities claiming their citizens."

Italicized words are in Hebrew. In medieval art, past and especially biblical scenes are often re-contextualised. They are telling the stories in completely anachronistic ways, updating the content of pictures to contemporary fashion, people and surroundings. So that even illiterate people would recognise what's going on. This was done extensively in pauper bibles. That means a 13th century bible illustration is a source for both: imaginations of the artist about what is told in the story, and what 13th century people actually looked like. The Maciejowski Bible is an important source of information on clothing and weapons from the 13th century. (src) This folio's description: Old Testament Miniatures with Latin, Persian, and Judeo-Persian inscriptions
  France, Paris, 1240s The Crusader Bible, also known as the Morgan Picture Bible, the Maciejowski Bible, and the Shah ‘Abbas Bible, is not only one of the greatest medieval manuscripts in the Morgan, it also ranks as one of the incomparable achievements of French Gothic illumination. The miniatures represent one of the greatest visualizations of Old Testament events ever made. Some of the stories and their heroes are well known, but there are also accounts of less familiar Israelites who fought for the Promised Land—tales that resonate to this day. There are incredibly violent battle scenes in which the implements of war are so accurately depicted they could be replicated. And there are scenes of everyday life, love, hate, and envy, as well as adultery, rape, and murder—all set in thirteenth-century France. The book of Joshua is one of the history books in the bible. As such it claims to tell an actual historic event. At least Jews and Christians are told and have to believe that this was a true event. But numerous reasons do not allow it to be grouped into the category of reliable historical source. The Book of Joshua holds little historical value. The archaeological evidence shows that Jericho and Ai were not occupied in the Near Eastern Late Bronze Age. The story of the conquest most likely represents the nationalist propaganda of the 8th century BCE kings of Judah and their claims to the territory of the Kingdom of Israel; incorporated into an early form of Joshua written late in the reign of king Josiah (reigned 640–609 BCE). The book was probably revised and completed after the fall of Jerusalem to the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE, and possibly after the return from the Babylonian exile in 538 BCE. Re-framing the picture into its medieval time, the kings hanging are wearing typical garments and crowns. That part of the illustration can be seen as 'authentic'. But that any king would be hanged in that era is already not that likely. That this would be done with five of them in one go even more so. And certainly they would bot be hanged with their fine clothes and battle helmet crowns still on. These things are just added in to explain their role/status/function. Note that the Amorite's crowns signify them being nominally higher status than Joshua with his simple skullcap helmet. The scene depicted is  (Joshua 10.5, YLT) And five kings of the Amorite (the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon) are gathered together, and go up, they and all their camps, and encamp against Gibeon, and fight against it. 22 And Joshua saith, 'Open ye the mouth of the cave, and bring out unto me these five kings from the cave;'
  23 and they do so, and bring out unto him these five kings from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.
  24 And it cometh to pass, when they bring out these kings unto Joshua, that Joshua calleth unto every man of Israel, and saith unto the captains of the men of war, who have gone with him, 'Draw near, set your feet on the necks of these kings;' and they draw near, and set their feet on their necks.
  25 And Joshua saith unto them, 'Fear not, nor be affrighted; be strong and courageous; for thus doth Jehovah do to all your enemies with whom ye are fighting;'
  26 and Joshua smiteth them afterwards, and putteth them to death, and hangeth them on five trees; and they are hanging on the trees till the evening.
  27 And it cometh to pass, at the time of the going in of the sun, Joshua hath commanded, and they take them down from off the trees, and cast them unto the cave where they had been hid, and put great stones on the mouth of the cave till this very day.

Is there any evidence that Cleopatra and Caesarion considered fleeing to India to escape the Romans?,"The source for Sanjeev Sanyal's account is most likely Plutarch. In his Life of Anthony, Plutarch wrote: Caesarion, who was said to be Cleopatra's son by Julius Caesar, was
  sent by his mother, with much treasure, into India, by way of
  Ethiopia. There Rhodon, another tutor like Theodorus, persuaded him to
  go back, on the ground that Caesar invited him to take the kingdom. Our sources are somewhat unclear but, putting together what evidence has survived, Michael Gray-Fow's 2014 article What to do with Caesarion in the Classical Society journal Greece & Rome, says that Cleopatra, when deciding in 30 BC where to flee, … opted for India and organized a fleet on the Red Sea, but it was
  destroyed by the Nabateans because their king Malchus (Maliku II)
  wanted to demonstrate his value to Octavian…
  As
  Octavian approached Alexandria, Cleopatra decided that Caesarion’s only salvation lay in getting as
  far away from Octavian as possible. For him alone she resurrected the
  idea of flight to India. Gray-Fow continues: Caesarion was sent off up the Nile with his tutor, Rhodon…Octavian
  entered Alexandria on 1 August 30 BC. Just over a week later,
  probably believing that Caesarion was safely on his way to India and
  that Octavian might be more lenient towards him if she were dead,
  Cleopatra also committed suicide. It is doubtful whether Caesarion ever reached Myos Hormos or Berenice [Red Sea ports].
  He certainly got no further if he did. Exactly what happened is
  unclear, perhaps deliberately so. Both Dio and Suetonius agree that
  Caesarion was overtaken in his flight, though Dio alone implies that
  he was murdered at that point. Plutarch and Suetonius both claim that
  Caesarion was brought back to Alexandria and killed there. Gray-Fow cites numerous sources. Among the primary ones are Plutarch (c. AD 46 – AD 120), Livy (64 or 59 BC – AD 12 or 17), Cassius Dio (c. AD 155 – c. AD 235) and Suetonius (c. AD 69 – AD 122)."
How did people deal with ice on the roads during the horse-and-buggy era?,"Snow removal takes a lot of effort. It was easier to switch out wheeled carriages for sleighs. Sleighs work better with more snow, so that according to this article: in the 18th and 19th centuries, ""snow was never a threat"" to road
  travel, ""but rather it was an asset."" The more densely packed snow became, the better. Some municipalities even had special ""snow rollers"" to compress the snow:  Some inventors did try out horse-drawn plows, but these were intended for pedestrian alleys, not thoroughfares. In the U.S., these were most popular in the ""snow belt,"" with Milwaukee being the first major city to use one in 1862. However, horse-drawn snowplows are not able to handle blizzards, as the Blizzard of 1888 (which dropped 50 inches of snow on the East Coast) made clear: The plow-pulling horses, like everyone else, had no choice but to stay
  inside and wait for the snow to melt. Cities in the region learned a
  valuable lesson about preparation, and the following year many
  implemented measures like hiring more plows and giving them assigned
  routes, and sending the plows out to start clearing the roads in the
  early stages of the storm. It was the introduction of automobiles that required cities to take snow removal seriously: As automobiles replaced horses and carriages on the roads of the U.S.,
  the snow problem got flipped on its head. It wouldn't be enough to
  clear the alleys and pack down the snow on the main roads anymore.
  Cars required dry, safe streets. Motorized salt spreaders were
  introduced, but they often didn't do enough, and urban sprawl meant
  most cities were just too big for horse-drawn plows to clean all the
  streets. In the early 1920s, Norwegian brothers Hans and Even
  Overaasen and New Yorker Carl Frink independently came up with designs
  for car-mounted snow plows. These were, apparenty the perfect solution
  to the modern snow problem, and the company Frink started is still
  producing plows today."
"Did Shackleton's crew all ""miss out"" on WW1?","Following the link from Steve Bird, one finds the biographies of 28 expedition members. In Timothy McCarthy's biography: On returning to England after the expedition, McCarthy joined the Royal Navy Reserve as a Leading Seaman as his service in the First World War. On Friday 16th March 1917, only three weeks after returning from South Georgia, and at the age of 28, he was killed in action at his gun post on board the S.S. Narragansett, on his first day under enemy fire. The ship had been torpedoed between the South West of Ireland and the Scilly Isles. He went down with his ship along with all other 45 hands, he was the first of the Endurance expedition members to die. In Alfred Cheetham's biography: On return from the Antarctic he enlisted in the Mercantile Marine and while serving as second Officer on the S.S. Prunelle  on Thursday 22nd August 1918, at the age of 51, his ship was torpedoed in the North Sea by a German U-Boat. Alf went down with the ship, he was the second of the men of the Endurance  to be killed in the Great War. That page currently lists biographies for 28 of the crew (including Shackleton). Now, going to The History of Parliament one finds Of the 53 surviving members of the expedition, three were killed in the war and another five were wounded. An issue here is that Wikipedia and other sites from Google list 28 total crew (including Shackleton), matching the number of biographies given on the CoolAntarctica site. This brings The History of Parliament site into question. The only two listed as killed in World War 1 are those listed above. Huberht Hudson (per the bio, Huberht is an older spelling of Hubert but is what Hudson used), the navigator, was killed in action in World War 2 which may have led to the incorrect listing of 3 killed in action. That still does not explain the 53 crew members vs 28 listed elsewhere. Going through all the biographies on Cool Antarctica, one finds that of the 28 there is no record of World War 1 service for only 5 of them. The majority saw service in the Navy or the Merchant Marine. Of possible interest: Frank Worsley (Captain of Endurance) commanded Q ships, sinking 3 U-boats and receiving the DSO. Dr. James McIlroy, surgeon, badly wounded at Ypres. James Wordie, scientist, badly wounded at Armentieres. Charles Green, cook, wounded on HMS Wakeful. Walter How, able seaman, blinded in one eye by German mine while serving on a Merchant Navy vessel. John Vincent, able seaman, survived being torpedoed. William Bakewell, able seaman, an American who served in the British Merchant Navy and survived two sinkings. So, based on my review, only two of the crew of the Endurance died in World War One, and one in World War Two."
Were Russians in the cold war era USA discriminated against for their ethnicity?,"Because of emigration restrictions from the Soviet Union imposed from at least the 1920's on, there were very few ethnic Russians of recent arrival in the U.S., and the Western world in general, during the 1950's. Those ethnic Russians (and Ukrainians) had mostly arrived during the late 19th, or very early 20th, century. By the 1950's ethnic Slavs were generally third or even fourth generation, fluent in English, and respected members of the community. Other than attending a church with slightly different ritual and architecture, they were virtually indistinguishable from other third and fourth generation immigrants of the same era from other parts of Europe: Italy, Greece, Poland and Germany. I have no doubts that, especially during the 1950's, there was counter intelligence being run in those communities by the FBI and others. There may have been some discrimination against these ethnic groups in certain sensitive government posts - but on the other hand there was also some favourable hiring for the language and cultural knowledge. I suspect a net wash. As for treatment by the general population - eyes were so focused on the Civil Rights movement that I doubt many even knew who their Russian neighbours and colleagues were.  This Wikipedia page lists several Russian-American writers of note, including Ayn Rand and Isaac Asimov. This page lists numerous additional notable Russian-Americans, both alphabetically and by selected occupation. The noted physicist Richard Feynman was subject to quota in his university application, but that was due to his Jewish heritage and not his Russian ancestry. I believe this to be typical of the time. Hollywood's persistent habit of renaming non-WASP actors and actresses  during this time would hide the Eastern European heritage of many famous performers - but I believe this was to sidestep the endemic antisemitism of the age, and not an anti-Slav or anti-Russian sentiment either by the producers or the general  public. The major Hollywood moguls were almost all Jewish, and very self-conscious about that fact."
"In the Medieval period, how long would an average swordsmith need to forge an average sword?","Wikipedia's page on Japanese swordsmithing provides some information on the time frames involved in the manufacture of good quality blades: The forging of a Japanese blade typically took many days or weeks, and was considered a sacred art, traditionally accompanied by a large panoply of Shinto religious rituals. As with many complex endeavors, rather than a single craftsman, several artists were involved. There was a smith to forge the rough shape, often a second smith (apprentice) to fold the metal, a specialist polisher, and even a specialist for the edge itself. Often, there were sheath, hilt, and tsuba specialists as well. The page also contends that the production of steel from iron would take four or five workers at least a week. It also goes on to mention that, depending on the quality of the sword, the polisher might take weeks to get things done just right: When the rough blade is completed, the swordsmith turns the blade over to a polisher called a togishi, whose job it is to refine the shape of a blade and improve its aesthetic value. The entire process takes considerable time, in some cases easily up to several weeks. Early polishers used three types of stone, whereas a modern polisher generally uses seven. The modern high level of polish was not normally done before around 1600, since greater emphasis was placed on function over form. Assuming that the steel is already available, I think that it might be safe to extrapolate that a cheap but functional Japanese sword could have been made in a few days, a good sword in a couple of weeks or more, and a great sword in a month or more."
How beneficial were war bonds to the US during WWII,"The sale of war bonds ""sterilized"" the otherwise humongous U.S. debt. That is, while debt was historically large (by any standards except today's), we ""owed it to ourselves"" and not to foreigners. Which is to say that the money was available to be ""recycled"" into the U.S. economy after the war. But the main benefit was AFTER the war. The country saved something like 25% of its GDP annually during almost four years of war. When it ended, the average American family had almost one year's wages in savings, most of it in war bonds. That financed the greatest peacetime economic boom in American history, and allowed for returning soldiers to be employed in civilian pursuits, at higher productivity rates than they enjoyed before the war."
Did ancient Romans anticipate the fall of Rome?,"The literary evidence for Romans anticipating the fall of Rome would seem to be very limited and, at most, indirect. There are, though, references to potential future threats to the empire, but also - among Christian writers - the belief that Rome's future was in God's hands. The contemporary accounts we have tended to focus on the past and / or the times in which the writer lived. This meant not infrequent references to 'better times' in the past and the reasons why Rome had declined up to the time they were writing their accounts. This recognition of decline, though, did not necessarily mean they felt it was inevitable that it would continue. Writers were aware, after all, that Rome had faced many challenges before and survived. Not all writers acknowledged that there had been a decline, though, while others observed a decline in some respects but not in others. Jill Harries, in Sidonius Apollinaris and the Fall of Rome, A.D. 407–485, writes that: It is a truth almost universally acknowledged that the Roman Empire in
the West collapsed without a sound in the fifth century, but that
nobody understood that the catastrophe had occurred before Byzantine
chroniclers woke up belatedly to the fact in the sixth century. The aforementioned Sidonius Apollinaris (died 489 AD) was a poet, diplomat and bishop who, despite being, a witness to the death-struggle of Roman Gaul Source: Neil McLynn in a review of J. Harries, 'Sidonius Apollinaris and the Fall of Rome, A.D. 407–485', Journal of Roman Studies was, according to Harries, nonetheless clinging to the artificially inflated expectations of the Theodosian age Cited by McLynn One writer who perhaps alludes to troubled times ahead for the empire is Ammianus Marcellinus (died 391 AD or later), a soldier and historian who wrote about the period 353 to 378 AD. On the one hand, he asserts that: Those who are unacquainted with ancient records say that the state was
never before overspread by such a dark cloud of misfortune, but they
are deceived by the horror of the recent ills which have overwhelmed
them. For if they study earlier times or those which have recently
passed, these will show that such dire disturbances have often
happened. On the other hand, with reference to 'barbarian' incursions in earlier times (160s AD), an element of pessimism creeps in: after calamitous losses the state was presently restored to its former
condition, because the temperance of old times was not yet infected by
the effeminacy of a more licentious mode of life, and did not crave
extravagant feasts or shameful gains... Although it is debatable as to how much one can read into this, G. Sabbah in Chapter Two: Ammianus Marcellinus of Greek and Roman Historiography in Late Antiquity (G. Marasco, ed) writes: Ammianus’ work is a world that embraces his personal life as well as
the history and spirit of his times. Painted in black and white in
order to contrast good and evil, justice and violence, this world is
dominated by long-recognized obsessions: the anguish of the present
and anxiety about the future, the haunting omnipresence of death and
the passion for justice. Ammianus' reference in the first citation of Rome overcoming reverses in the past is echoed by the 5th century AD poet Rutilius Claudius Namatianus. For example, Rutilius writes: Amidst failure it is thy way to hope for prosperity.... after many
disasters, though defeated, thou didst put Pyrrhus to flight; Hannibal
himself was the mourner of his own successes....Spread forth the laws
that are to last throughout the ages of Rome...The span which doth
remain is subject to no bounds, so long as earth shall stand firm and
heaven uphold the stars! Recordings of Roman disasters by 4th and 5th century writers such as the anonymous author of Epitome de Caesaribus (previously attributed to Aurelius Victor) and Zosimus in Historia Nova seem to be expressed with feelings of despair, yet are followed by passages which relate that, within a few years, almost all was well again. An example of this can be found in sections on the Battle of Mursa Major in 351 AD when  Constantius II defeated the usurper Magnentius, but with enormous casualities on both sides. Zosimus writes: Constantius, considering that as this was a civil war victory itself
would be scarcely an advantage to him, now the Romans being so much
weakened, as to be totally unable to resist the barbarians who
attacked them on every side while the Epitome de Caesaribus relates: In this battle, hardly anywhere was Roman might more fully consumed
and the fortune of the whole empire dashed. Yet the latter source soon after says ""the frontier of Roman property was restored"" while Zosimus, on the Battle of Argentoratum in 357 AD writes that engaging with the enemy gained such a victory as exceeds all
description. It is said that sixty thousand men were killed on the
spot, besides as many more that were driven into the river and
drowned. In a word, if this victory be compared to that of Alexander
over Darius, it will be found in no respects inferior to it. Even the poet Paulinus of Pella (died 461 or later), after the loss of his property in Gaul to duplictous Visigoths and Romans, retained an optimistic outlook in his Eucharisticus. True, he had wanted to leave Gaul for Greece, but this was due to his personal situation and he makes no comment on the future of Rome. Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus, writing in the late 4th or early 5th century AD, very clearly recognizes a decline in the Roman military in De re militari but his work is a plea for reform, not an acceptance that the empire's decline is irreversible. Christian writers, unsurprisingly, look at Rome from a divine perspective and do not necessarily perceive a decline. Rufinus (344/345 to 411), for example, Carefully selected and framed his topics to demonstrate his belief
that history provides evidence of the working of God in time, and that
history has a progressive, if fitful, movement toward the fulfillment
of a divine plan. Source: David Rohrbacher, 'The Historians of Late Antiquity' Sozomen (died about 450 AD) adopts a similar interpretation to Rufinus, that imperial stability depends solely upon the emperor’s continuing
devotion to God. Source: Rohrbacher As Mark Olsen comments below, proper ""devotion to the gods meant stability""; religio, ""the traditional honours paid to the gods by the state"", earned the favour of the gods and thus prosperity. For the sake of the well-being of the state, it was expected of individuals and most especially of the emperor. Orosius (died after 418 AD) saw Rome as ""divinely inspired"" and wrote that I discovered that past times were not only equally as grave as those
of today, but that they were even more terrible in accordance with how
much more distant they were from the assistance of the true religion. Cited in: Rohrbacher Far from anticipating the fall of Rome, Orosius and Olympiodorus, different in so many ways, both envisioned a
more peaceful future with Gothic forces allied with yet subservient to
Roman power. Source: Rohrbacher In earlier times, some emperors were concerned about the fortunes of the empire under their successors (for example, Marcus Aurelius on his successor Commodus), but this did not lead them to anticipate the fall of the empire. Nor did Tacitus (died about 120 AD), although he did forsee Germany as the source of the greatest future hazards. and was generally critical of the principate, observing that They said that the world had been well-nigh overturned, even when the
principate was the prize of honest men Also, he considered the principate a dangerous enticement to immorality and
vice. Although Tacitus is sharply critical of the emperors’ excesses and fearful for the
future of Imperial Rome, while also filled with a longing for its past
glories. Annals III.55 and his comments on Nerva and Trajan show that he remained hopeful for human nature if it was given the right chances. Going back even further, Polybius (died about 125 BC) made some general statements to the effect that all nations decay (see here and here), but this was - of course - long before the empire even came into existence. Potentially one reason for a lack of literary accounts on fears for future is that the vast majority of the people who were affected by ""the collapse of the economy"" never recorded their thoughts, while ""the decline of the population"" would not necessarily have been seen as a bad thing by the inhabitants of a very overcrowded and polluted Rome with its frequent outbreaks of plague and streets so congested that daytime traffic was banned until the 4th century AD."
"Who, if any, in JFK's inner circle argued against the plans for the Bay of Pigs invasion?","Apparently, Arthur Schlesinger wrote a memo against the ""upcoming"" Bay of Pigs idea. But he didn't push it very hard."
"Who was the last leader of a country to call himself a dictator, or the last regime that called itself a dictatorship?","Perhaps that my own country (Portugal) is the answer. In 1926 we had a military revolution and in 1928 one the leaders of that revolution, general Óscar Carmona, was elected president of Portugal. The period from 1928 until 1933 was called by the political leadership of the country as Ditadura Nacional (which means “National Dictatorship”). It turns out that, unlike some of the other leaders of the 1926 revolution, general Carmona never intended to reinstate Democracy in Portugal. Having said this, I am not aware of any occasion in which general Carmona described himself as “Dictator”. In 1933, a new constitution was approved and the Portuguese regime became the “Estado Novo” (meaning “New State”)."
"Were slings used for throwing hand grenades? If not, why?","@KorvinStarmast has the correct answer for hand grenades. But we did use slings to lob grenades. Just think bigger.  A trebuchet is basically a big staff sling used to throw a projectile. That big beam is a lever serving the same role as the staff (or your arm). The large size and time period makes it practical for explosive devices during a time when cannon were prohibitively expensive or non-existent. The larger ammunition size allows for more safety measures. The longer flight time allows for a longer, safer timed fuse. The higher impact velocity allows for a safer impact fuse. Since it's a siege weapon, accuracy isn't all that important. A trebuchet can sling solid shot (ie. rocks), incendiary devices, explosives, or a pimped ride. A ""grenade"" is an explosive or incendiary device which is thrown by mechanical action, not gunpowder. Early grenades were ceramic pots filled with Greek fire, burning tar, or other sticky, incendiary material. It could be lit or fused with a lit rag. When thrown at the enemy the pot would shatter spilling the sticky, burning (or lit by the rag) contents all over the poor sod it was heaved at. A molotov cocktail is the modern day equivalent. Romans used onagers, small trebuchet powered by twisted rope, to hurl incendiary devices.  Later would come the fused explosive, the classic bomb with a burning fuse from cartoons. I don't have a medieval example, but I came across some curious WWI mechanical bomb throwing devices! In their desperation for trench artillery WWI troops tried out some curious trench catapults. The best is the West Spring Gun, a sort of spring powered hybrid ballista/trebuchet.  Source: Australian War Memorial ...a multi-springed (24) bomb-thrower of erratic tendencies which first saw service in 1915. The weapon, which was based on a Roman stone-throwing engine, was silent and relatively accurate up to a range of about 240 yards. It was much mistrusted by its operators as it was not unknown for mis-directed bombs to rebound from the thrower's own trench parapet. Source: Imperial War Museum I think the reports of mis-directed and rebounding bombs sums up the problem with slinging grenades. And this was with a large, firmly planted device and a (hopefully) trained crew. If that was unreliable, imagine the soldier next to you trying it with a hand held sling. Such trench catapults threw hand grenades, such as the No 15 ball grenade, or the No 21 R. For the catapults they'd use a longer nine second fuse.  When grenades weren't available, troops got creative and bodged together some umm... front line expedient explosive devices to sling at the enemy. I give you the ""jam tin grenade""!  How'd you like to be the one that has to light and lob that?"
"Was England considered a ""colony"" of France?","I'm going to say that England should not be considered as having been a colony of France.  From the wiki page for colony a colony is a territory under the immediate political control of a state, distinct from the home territory of the sovereign When William took power he did so on behalf of himself and not on behalf of France, and he ruled as King of England. So while England had a sovereign who happened to be a foreigner, the English were not governed by a foreign state (i.e France). "
Was World War I a war of liberals against authoritarians?,"Seeing WWI as an ideological battle between liberal democracies and authoritarian regimes requires hindsight and taking the Western perspective and adjusting your lenses for what was considered ""liberal democracy"" at the time. While certainly empires fell and new republics rose, other empires gained, and people continued to be oppressed. When you start to look at WWI in the moment and in detail it's less clear. When you look at WWI from the perspective of the world outside the victorious Allies and remove the ""liberal for the time"" distortion things start to get a lot less rosy. The primary drive for WWI was the rise of a unified Germany in 1871 overnight destabilizing the balance of power Europe. Previously the UK, France, and Russia were centers of economic and military power with fractured central Europe and stagnant Austria-Hungary acting as a buffer zone. Now Germany is a new center of power right in the middle. Born in the defeat of France, and later getting into a naval arms race with Britain, Germany scares the pants off both France and Britain. They held it together for 40 years: emperor to emperor; monarch to monarch... and France. The monarchies of Britain, Germany, Russia, and Austria-Hungary all had a vested interest in keeping the status quo to remain in power. France had a vested interest in countering its mortal enemy: Germany. Eventually it fell apart as Germany got too ambitious. France and Russia allied against Germany. That opportunistic alliance between liberal France and autocratic Russia against autocratic Germany further complicates the narrative. Even as WWI is breaking out we see frantic shuttle diplomacy happening right up to the last moment to prevent a general European war. None of the powers are saber rattling for general war, it's all about a power grab in Serbia. Even Germany, who was goading Austria-Hungary, hoped for a quick victory against Serbia before Russia could mobilize. Russia is the most obvious thorn in this idea. Autocratic Imperial Russia in WWI are fighting on the side of... democracy? No, Imperial Russia joined WWI in a spat with Austria-Hungary over who gets to protect dominate the Slavs. These were two autocrats going to war over who gets control. It's only after the war went horrendously badly for Russia (plus many contributing factors) that allowed a Communist revolt to take hold. Then the resulting Soviet regime is democratic in name only, it's more autocracy. And then there's Imperial Japan, at the time just getting started on a decades long brutal occupation of Korea. They joined the war on the Allied side in a deal with the UK to protect against German Pacific raiders. Japan used this as an opportunity to grab German Pacific territories including the German occupied port of Tsingtao in China which they kept. Then they turned against China with a series of unequal treaties designed to give Japan more control. The Third French Republic is liberal democracy... for men. The UK, a constitutional monarchy, had representation for about half the men. And in the democratic US only men could vote, and in practice often only white men. And, oh yes, their many, many, many colonies and occupied territories. Racism appears again in the preferential treatment of mostly-white colonies. Canada and Australia, for example, had a modicum of home rule. Others like India, Indochina, and the Philippines don't get democracy until after another world war and many revolts. For them the US, UK, and France are the autocrats. Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points for the peace following WWI made some very enlightened promises regarding the handling of occupied territories. Some were kept. Most were not. But the ideas had power. After the Central Powers surrender and the war proper is over, multiple nationalist uprisings spring up in former imperial territories. Anatolia (ie. Turkey), the Middle East, Russia, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Europe all expect their autonomy. While one can view the Allies support of Central European and Baltic nationalism as a blow for freedom and democracy and self-rule... when you start to look at the Allied attitude towards other regions it looks more like a cynical buffer zone against Germany and the Soviets. East Germany, western Russia, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire were largely carved up. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Hungary got their independence more or less by treaty and a bit of fighting. Self-rule, yes, but also convenient checks on German expansion. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia emerged from the chaos of German-occupied Baltic area following the collapse of both Imperial Russia and Imperial Germany. A three way brawl developed, generally, between nationalists, Soviets, and local Germans. The Allies and Whites generally threw in with the nationalists. Again, supporting self-rule, but they also act as a bulwark against Communism which scared the crap out of the Allies. Once we look beyond keeping Germany in check, things become less rosy for the liberal democracies. In Russia we see a confused Allied intervention into the Russian civil war generally on the part of the autocratic Whites, though really against the Soviets who scare the crap out of them. We also see victorious ally autocratic Imperial Japan attempt to establish a Siberian buffer state, not very democratic. This is all in contrast to point VI. VI. The evacuation of all Russian territory and such a settlement of all questions affecting Russia as will secure the best and freest cooperation of the other nations of the world in obtaining for her an unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent determination of her own political development and national policy and assure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free nations under institutions of her own choosing; and, more than a welcome, assistance also of every kind that she may need and may herself desire. The treatment accorded Russia by her sister nations in the months to come will be the acid test of their good will, of their comprehension of her needs as distinguished from their own interests, and of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy. Looking south at the Ottoman Empire, we see the Allies making promises of independence after the war if the locals would please fight the Ottomans. Meanwhile the Allies are making secret treaties to carve up the territory for themselves. The war in Europe is over, but Allied armies continue to gobble up Ottoman territory. Russia, Britain, France, Greece, and Italy are all tripping over each other in the mad scramble to lay claim to pieces of Anatolia and the Middle East for themselves. This mostly went according to plan, the Middle East was carved up into regions for the benefit of the Allies; not very democratic. As for the Turks, point XII promised... XII. The Turkish portion of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development, and the Dardanelles should be permanently opened as a free passage to the ships and commerce of all nations under international guarantees.  Instead there was a plan to carve up Anatolia with ""zones of influence"" and outright annexations leaving about a third of the territory for the Turks. The Turks strenuously objected to this plan that nobody consulted them about and won their independence by fighting the Allies who wanted to carve them up. Finally, some colonies took point V to heart. V. A free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable government whose title is to be determined. Most famously Hi Chi Minh arrived at the Versailles Peace Conference asking for independence from France for Vietnam. He was ignored and two generations of the Indochinese would suffer for it."
Is it true that there are more slaves in the world now than ever at one point in history?,Let's start with some basic facts.
Were there any high-ranking female soldiers during the Middle ages?,"She wasn't technically knighted insofar as I'm aware of, but Joan of Arc springs to mind. She played a decisive role in ending the Hundred Years' War. Cursory googling yields a few more female warriors here, but only Joan of Arc is from the European middle ages, and this Quora question on the same topic with a few more examples. One of the Quora answers incidentally references the Order of the Hatchet as female knights: The city of Tortosa, in northeastern Spain, was held by Islamic Moors until the Second Crusade. In 1148, Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona led his forces to wrest control of the city. The crusading armies then moved on to attack other places. This left the city open to counter-attack in 1149. Moorish armies found the city well-defended, though, for the ladies of the town donned men's clothing and fought with whatever weapon was closest to hand, including hatchets. Berenguer was so impressed with the spirited defense that he created the Order of the Hatchet and bestowed it upon the women soldiers."
"Why do revolutions ""eat their own?"" What is the sociological dynamic here?","As Lenin famously said, the key question of any revolution is the question of Power. Translating it into the vernacular for the benefit of the unindoctrinated: a revolution is done for the sole purpose of gaining power. All talk about giving land to peasants or factories to workers is just that - talk, the people who are actually leading the revolution have no intention of implementing anything that might conceivably detract from their power. They also assume that their differences are tactical and will wither away when they gain power, thus they ""expect"" (sincerely or not) the unity created by the common struggle against the Ancien Régime to persist into the post-revolutionary period. Thus, once a revolution succeeds, the new centers of power start to fight each other until a certain stability emerges: coalitions form and fall apart as their members pursue their own goals. A classic example would be the Russian revolution, where the clear leader, Lenin, became increasingly incapacitated by health in early 1920-ies, which resulted in a coalition of Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Stalin contesting the power against Trotsky, the immensely popular heir apparent. When they kicked him, Stalin united with Buharin to get rid of Zinoviev & Kamenev, and then purged Buharin to emerge the only leader. The contest was, of course, played in the appropriate ideological terms (like ""left opposition"", ""right opposition"" &c), but the essence remained the same - who will wield the power. The only historical ""exception"" to this pattern is the American revolution, where the founding fathers recognized their differences (and thus expected a power struggle post-victory) and wanted to create the least powerful central government that would still be capable of holding the Nation together.  The largely non-violent collapse of communism in the late 1980-ies is ""out of scope"" as it was not led by ""professional revolutionaries"" who could engage in ""post-victory squabbles"". The side that wins the post-revolutionary power struggle is the clique with the most tactical skill, not the ""moderates"" or ""extremists"". Stalin was more moderate than Trotsky but less so than Buharin. So, in the mad world of Bolshevism, he could be labeled a ""centrist"". Jacobins ruled for a mere year and were wiped out. I am not sure Rohm could be construed as a ""moderate"" (to put it mildly)."
How prevalent were recreational drugs in the ancient world?,"Drugs are certainly not a new phenomenon. Two well-known examples are opiates and cannabis. A great deal has been written about the use of hashish by medieval Nizari Ismailis (which gave us the word ""assassin"", derived from the Arabic ""Hashshashin""). When I was studying the archaeology of Cyprus at Birkbeck in the late 1990s I wrote a paper on opiate use in the ancient Eastern Mediterranean. I've summarised many of the salient points from that paper (with a few updated links) below: Opiates were certainly very prevalent in the Eastern Mediterranean in antiquity. The earliest written source that I know of is Hesiod's Theogony, where Prometheus is supposed to have tried to use poppy juice to drug Zeus at the city of Mekonê (""poppy town"") near Corinth. The earliest use of opiates that I'm aware of in Europe dates to the Bronze Age. On Crete, excavations of what appear to be ""shrines"" dating to the Minoan Post-Palace period (1,400 - 1,100BCE) have discovered figurines that Professor Spyridon Marinatos described as the ""Poppy Goddess"". A careful examination of the poppies confirms that they were the shape and colour of the opium poppy [S. Marinatos, 'The Minoan goddesses of Gazi', Journal of Archaeology (Greece) 1937, Vol. I, pp. 278-291]. The British Museum holds a number of small Cypriot base-ring jugs which have been dated to the Bronze Age and which are shaped like inverted poppy seed pods. This type of jug has been found in excavations across the Eastern Mediterranean. An archaeologist named Robert Merrillees suggested that the shape of the jug might have been a form of advertisement for its contents, and that the drug might have been exported across the region from Cyprus. Residue analyses carried out on one of the jars in the British Museum collection did, in fact, detect traces of opiates which appeared to confirm Merrillees' theory.  However, subsequent analyses from other jugs excavated in the region failed to detect any evidence of opiates, and it has been suggested that the confirmed case was a result of the re-use of the jar. One note of caution though. Even if the use of opiates was fairly widespread in the Eastern Mediterranean in the Bronze age (and the evidence is inconclusive), we cannot be certain to what extent they were taken recreationally. The use of opiates for pain relief is fairly well known, but I also remember that my tutor (who was a big fan of the Minoan culture on Crete) was keen to point out that opiates can also be used as as an anti-diarrhoeal drug, and that (at that time) only one of the Cypriot poppy jugs had been found on Crete. (She also pointed out that the Minoan sites on Crete and Santorini appear to have had toilets connected to sewers with running water to dispose of the waste, and invited us to draw our own conclusions). However, if the drug was widely available, then it is hard to believe that it wouldn't have been taken recreationally. EDIT: While doing a little further research on the subject, I just found this paper from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime which covers the use of poppies and opiates in the ancient Eastern Mediterranean. Hope this is useful. The final part of your question, asked whether any ancient kingdoms (not including the Chinese opium wars) had problems with the citizens abusing drugs? In the Islamic world, alcohol was (and is) prohibited under Sharia law.  This is often interpreted as prohibiting all intoxicants (not only alcohol). Despite that, the practice of hashish smoking seems to have continued throughout the history of Islam (against varying degrees of resistance at different times and in different places). Apart from the prohibition under Islamic Sharia law, I'm not aware of any legal prohibitions against recreational drug use in the ancient or medieval periods in Europe or the eastern Mediterranean.  This suggests that, if there was a problem with recreational drug use at these periods, it wasn't considered to be serious enough to require legislation. Hopefully others can add answers which cover other recreational drugs in other geographic regions in the ancient and medieval world."
