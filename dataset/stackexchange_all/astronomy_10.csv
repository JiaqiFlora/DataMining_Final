How much gold is there in our sun?,"The mass of the sun is 1.989 × 1030 kg. Abundance in the Sun of the elements gives a percentage 1 × 10-7 % for gold *, so that leaves you with a mass of 1.989 × 1021 kg of gold. HowStuffWorks states that there is 1.26 × 1021 kg water on Earth, of which 98% is in the oceans, i.e. 1.235 × 1021 kg. This would mean the XKCD statement is true: there is 1.6 times as much gold in the sun as there is water in the oceans. * They cite WolframAlpha as their source. Executing SolarAbundance ""Gold"" there confirms this (mass) percentage."
How loud would the Sun be?,"The Sun is immensely loud. The surface generates thousands to tens of thousands of watts of sound power for every square meter. That's something like 10x to 100x the power flux through the speakers at a rock concert, or out the front of a police siren. Except the ""speaker surface"" in this case is the entire surface of the Sun, some 10,000 times larger than the surface area of Earth. Despite what ""user10094"" said, we do in fact know what the Sun ""sounds"" like -- instruments like SDO's HMI or SOHO's MDI or the ground-based GONG observatory measure the Doppler shift everywhere on the visible surface of the Sun, and we can actually see sound waves (well, infrasound waves) resonating in the Sun as a whole! Pretty cool, eh? Since the Sun is large, the sound waves resonate at very deep frequencies -- typical resonant modes have 5 minute periods, and there are about a million of them going all at once. The resonant modes in the Sun are excited by something. That something is the tremendous broadband rushing of convective turbulence. Heat gets brought to the surface of the Sun by convection -- hot material rises through the outer layers, reaches the surface, cools off (by radiating sunlight), and sinks. The ""typical"" convection cell is about the size of Texas, and is called a ""granule"" because they look like little grains when viewed through a telescope. Each one (the size of Texas, remember) rises, disperses its light, and sinks in five minutes. That produces a heck of a racket. There are something like 10 million of those all over the surface of the Sun at any one time. Most of that sound energy just gets reflected right back down into the Sun, but some of it gets out into the solar chromosphere and corona. No one can be sure, yet, just how much of that sound energy gets out, but it's most likely between about 30 and about 300 watts per square meter of surface, on average. The uncertainty comes because the surface dynamics of the Sun are tricky. In the deep interior, we can pretend the solar magnetic field doesn't affect the physics much and use hydrodynamics, and in the exterior (corona) we can pretend the gas itself doesn't affect the physics much. At the boundary layers above the visible surface, neither approximation applies and the physics gets too tricky to be tractable (yet). In terms of dBA, if all that leaked sound could somehow propagate to Earth, well let's see... Sunlight at Earth is attenuated about 10,000 times by distance (i.e. it's 10,000 times brighter at the surface of the Sun), so if 200 W/m2 of sound at the Sun could somehow propagate out to Earth it would yield a sound intensity of about 20 mW/m2. 0dB is about 1pW/m2 , so that's about 100dB. At Earth, some 150,000,000 kilometers from the sound source. Good thing sound doesn't travel through space, eh? The good folks at the SOHO/MDI project created some sound files of resonant solar oscillations by speeding up the data from their instrument by 43,000 times. You can hear those here, at the Solar Center website. Someone else did the same thing with the SDO/HMI instrument, and superposed the sounds on first-light videos from SDO. Both of those sounds, which sound sort of like rubber bands twanging, are heavily filtered from the data -- a particular resonant spatial mode (shape of a resonant sound) is being extracted from the data, and so you hear mainly that particular resonant mode. The actual unfiltered sound is far more cacophonous, and to the ear would sound less like a resonant sound and more like noise."
"How can there be 1,000 stellar ancestors before our Sun?","The Sun is actually a THIRD generation star. What I mean by this is that there are chemical elements in the Sun that were made inside another star, but that star itself can only have made those elements because it had material in it that must also have been made inside previous, second generation stars. Eventually we get back to the first generation stars, born out of primordial gas from the big bang that contained almost no heavy elements (those beyond helium) at all. That is quite a mouthful, so let me explain using an example - barium. There is barium in the Sun. We can tell that by looking at the spectrum and seeing absorption lines due to barium. But barium cannot be made in the Sun. The barium is made via the s-process, which involves the slow capture of neutrons onto the nuclei of iron-peak elements. This happens during the asymptotic red giant branch phase of stellar evolution, and the Sun has 6 billion years or so before it gets to that point. [NB: not even half the abundance of chemical elements beyond iron are produced by supernovae explosions$^1$.] So, before the Sun, there must have existed a star - probably an intermediate mass star - which evolved to become a giant, made barium in its interior, then lost its envelope through a massive wind into the interstellar medium, and that material was incorporated into the protosun. Such stars (between, say, 2 and 10 solar masses) would have much shorter lifetimes than the Sun$^2$, so plenty of time for them to live and die before the Sun was born. But wait a minute! That previous star must have already had iron-peak elements in its interior to act as a ""seed"" for the s-process production of barium. These were not and could not be made inside that star. They must have been made in a previous star, probably a massive star, that burned through all the nuclear fusion stages before exploding as a supernova, casting heavy elements, including iron-peak elements, into the interstellar medium. This previous star could also have had its own (metal-rich) ancestors, but ultimately as we go back in time we reach a point where the previous star was a first generation star, made from primordial H/He gas, with almost no heavy elements. These first generation (a.k.a. population III stars, just to be confusing) were probably very massive and short lived - a few million years. They would be born when the universe was a few hundred million years old and we can see no examples of them in our Galaxy today. To try and define more precisely what I mean by ""generation"". So that is why I claim the Sun can be classed as a ""third generation star"" - it contains atoms/nuclei that must have been inside at least two previous stars. But you should not take this too literally. There are grains of material trapped inside meteorites that consist of solids that were already present in the pre-solar material. These are important because these grains were thought to have formed in individual stellar events and their isotopic compositions can be studied. These tell us that the Sun formed from material that has been inside many different stars of different types. Stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis calculations tell us the same story. For example, whilst most of our oxygen was made in massive stars that underwent a core collapse supernova, such events do not produce that much carbon. The C/O ratio tells us that most of our carbon comes via the winds from intermediate mass AGB stars. Heavy elements like uranium may be dominantly produced in neutron star collisions, but others like barium and strontium are not. The details of how many ancestors have contributed to the Sun has no simple answer. Much of the solar hydrogen and helium could be pristine; some will have been through more than one star. Heavier elements (bar some lithium) will have been through at least one star. The fact that we have s-process elements like Ba, Sr, La and Ce, which are formed by neutron capture onto iron-peak elements, tells us those have been through at least two stars.  However, these are vast underestimates. Mixing in the interstellar medium is reasonably effective. The material spewed out from supernovae and stellar winds 5-12 billion years ago has had plenty of time to mix throughout the Galaxy before the Sun's birth. Turbulence and shear instabilities, driven by the winds and supernovae from massive stars, should distribute material on galactic-length scales in a billion years or less (Roy & Kunth 1995; de Avillez & Mac Low 2003), though local inhomogeneities associated with nearby recent events can persist over $10^{8}$ years. If this is the case, then the Sun is the product of the $\sim$ billion stars that died before it was born. The reason you are confused with your lifetime argument is that you have ignored the possibility of the Sun being made from stars that lived at the same time in different parts of the Galaxy. The material that they ejected near the end of their lives has just been thoroughly mixed up. $^1$ The rest are produced by the s-process in intermediate mass AGB stars; through nova events on white dwarfs; or perhaps, in the case of the heavier elements, through the collision of neutron stars (see this Physics SE question). $^2$ A rough expression for the lifetime of a star is $10 (M/M_{\odot})^{-5/2}$ billion years."
Why is the discovery of merging neutron stars important?,"Reasons why this is important: It is the first simultaneous detection of a gravitational wave and electromagnetic signal, and the strongest GW signal yet in terms of signal to noise (Abbott et al. 2017a). It spectacularly corroborates the reality of the GW detection technology and analysis. The progenitor has been unambiguously located in a (relatively) nearby galaxy (Soares-Santos et al. 2017), allowing a host of other telescopes to obtain detailed measurements. It shows that GWs travel at the speed of light, a further verification of Einstein's General Relativity (Abbott et al. 2017b). It shows that most of the very heavy elements such as gold, platinum, osmium etc. are plausibly produced by merging neutron stars and constrains the rate of such mergers in the local universe (e.g. Chornock et al. 2017; Tanvir et al. 2017). It shows that short gamma ray bursts — some of the most energetic explosions in the universe — can be caused by neutron star mergers (e.g. Savchenko et al. 2017; Goldstein et al. 2017). It is the closest detected short gamma ray burst (with a known distance). That the progenitor has also been characterised allows a closer investigation of the interesting physics underlying the ejection and jet mechanisms thought to be responsible for the gamma rays and later X-ray and radio emission (e.g. Margutti et al. 2017; Alexander et al. 2017). It provides observational constraints on how matter behaves at extremely high densities, testing our understanding of fundamental physics to its limits — for example, the details of the gravitational wave signal moments before merger are diagnostic of the interior conditions of neutron stars at densities of $\sim 10^{18}$ kg/m$^3$ (Hinderer et al. 2010; Postnikov et al. 2010). It provides an independent way of measuring the expansion of the universe. Merging binary gravitational wave sources are known as ""standard sirens"", because the distance to the GW source pops straight out of the analysis and can be compared with the redshift of the identified host galaxy (Abbott et al. 2017c). The result agrees with measurements made using the cosmic microwave background and the distance-redshift relation calibrated by other means, verifying our estimation of distances, at least in the local universe. Finally, this event will turn out to be important because it was lucky; in the sense that the source was detected well-inside the sensitivity horizon of LIGO (Abbott et al. 2017a). The detection itself, was not unexpected given the rates predicted based on studying the neutron star binary systems in our own Galaxy (e.g. Kim et al. 2015), but the fact that it was so close —
 within the closest 5% of the sensitive survey volume where it could have been detected — is fortunate. In the end, if someone thinks none of the above is interesting or important, then nothing I can write will convince them otherwise. The vast majority of people I speak to are curious and fascinated to find out about our cosmic origins and how the universe works."
Does the Sun rotate?,"Yes. It does not rotate uniformly though, different portions have a different angular velocity (as a body made of plasma, it can get away with this). Measuring this in theory is pretty easy, we just need to track the motion of the sunspots. This isn't as simple as calculating the changes in relative positions of the sunspots, though, as the Earth is rotating and revolving, which makes the calculations harder. This measurement can be done using the celestial sphere (the field of stars that we see) as a ""fixed"" reference point and seeing how the Earth and the sunspots move relative to that. Almost everything in the universe rotates/revolves, at least a little bit, because angular momentum is hard to get rid of. It can be transferred from body to body, but for a body to end up with zero angular momentum, it needs to meet another body with the exact same angular momentum and collide with it in a particular way. Given that this is pretty rare, all celestial bodies rotate. In addition to that, a non rotating body that is revolving will eventually start spinning due to tidal forces."
Why don't astronomers use meters to measure astronomical distances?,"In addition to the answer provided by @HDE226868, there are historical reasons. Before the advent of using radar ranging to find distances in the solar system, we had to use other clever methods for finding the distance from the Earth to the sun; for example, measuring the transit of Venus across the surface of the sun. These methods are not as super accurate as what is available today, so it makes sense to specify distances, that are all based on measuring parallaxes, in terms of the uncertain, but fixed, Earth-Sun distance. That way, if future measurements change the conversion value from AU to meters, you don't have to change as many papers and textbooks. Not to mention that such calibration uncertainties introduce correlated errors into an analysis that aren't defeatable using large sample sizes. I can't speak authoritatively on the actual history, but solar system measurements were all initially done in terms of the Earth/sun distance. For example, a little geometry shows that it's pretty straightforward to back out the size of Venus's and Mercury's orbit in AU from their maximum solar elongation. I don't know how they worked out the orbital radii of Mars, etc, but they were almost certainly done in AU long before the AU was known, and all of that before the MKS system existed, let alone became standardized.  For stars, the base of what is known as the ""cosmological distance ladder"" (that is ""all distance measures"" in astronomy) rests on measuring the parallax angle:
$$\tan \pi_{\mathrm{angle}} = \frac{1 AU}{D}.$$
To measure $D$ in 'parsecs' is to setup the equation so that the angle being measured in arcseconds fits the small angle approximation. That is:
$$\frac{D}{1\, \mathrm{parsec}} = \frac{\frac{\pi}{180\times60\times60}}{\tan\left(\pi_{\mathrm{angle}} \frac{\pi\, \mathrm{radians}}{180\times60\times60 \, \mathrm{arcsec}}\right)}.$$
In other words, $1\operatorname{parsec} = \frac{180\times 3600}{\pi} \operatorname{AU}$. Astronomers also have a marked preference for the close cousin of mks/SI units, known as cgs. As far as I can tell, this is due to the influence of spectroscopists who liked the ""Gaussian units"" part of it for electromagnetism because it set Coulomb's constant to 1, simplifying calculations."
Could the dinosaurs have seen the asteroid that killed them?,"The answer is yes; for a few nights prior to the impact (assuming they had eyes with a similar sensitivity to our own and could look up!). It could be a bit longer than this if the body was larger than 10 km (it goes up roughly in proportion to the impactor's radius) and could be much longer if the object was a cometary body or had a very high albedo. Details: Impacting solar system objects would have relative closing speeds from around 11 to 72 km/s. We could take the optimal case that the asteroid approaches whilst fully lit by the Sun (which probably precludes the minimum and maximum speed in the range quoted above) and then scale from another similar body - say the asteroid Vesta. This has a diameter of around $a=520$ km, gets as close as $d=1.14$ au from the Earth and has a maximum brightness of about $m=5.2$ apparent magnitude (and is hence just visible to the naked eye) and an observed flux $f = f_0 10^{-0.4m}$, where $f_0$ is a zeropoint for the magnitude scale. Thus the flux $f_n$ received by a near-Earth asteroid of diameter $a_n$, at a distance $d_n$ from Earth (in au) and with the same reflectivity would be
$$ f_n = f\left(\frac{a_n}{a}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1+d}{1+d_n}\right)^2
\left(\frac{d}{d_n}\right)^2\ .$$
This equation assumes the asteroids are illuminated by the Sun at a distance $(1+d)$ au and then viewed at a distance $d$ au from Earth. The magnitude of the dinosaur killer would then be
$$m_n = m -2.5\log (f/f_n)$$ To be an at all conspicuous naked eye object, $f_n \geq f$ and the dinosaur-killer becomes a naked-eye object at a distance given by
$$ d_n^2(1+d_n)^2 \leq 0.0022 \left(\frac{a_n}{10{\rm km}}\right)^2\ .$$ The only non-imaginary (i.e. square root of a positive number) solution for $a_n \sim 10$ km is $ d_n \leq 0.047 (a_n/10 {\rm km})$ au or $ \leq 7$ million ($a_n/10 {\rm km})$ km. Moving at say 30 km/s, then it gets closer by 2.6 million km per day, thus hitting the Earth about 3 days after becoming a naked eye object. Obviously this would be longer for a slower approach speed or for a larger or more reflective asteroid. But shorter for a smaller, faster asteroid or if the asteroid approached from a direction not fully illuminated by the Sun or had a smaller albedo than Vesta. An interesting trade-off to think about is if what is determined by measurement is the kinetic energy of the impactor. This would be proportional to the product of its mass and the square of its speed. The mass will be proportional to $a^3$. Thus if we fix the kinetic energy and allow the radius to be bigger, then it becomes visible from further away (roughly proportional to $a$) and will also be moving slower. i.e. A more massive, but slower impactor will likely be visible for a longer period of time and vice-versa. Another possibility is that the object is of a cometary origin with an icy composition. If that were so then it could be much brighter as a result of sublimation, outgassing and having a bright cometary nucleus and tail. The answer would still be yes, but the visibility period could be weeks (comets are rather unpredictably bright). It thus seems to me that there is a plausible range of parameters and trajectories where a dinosaur-killing asteroid could be observed and then observed to grow brighter over a few nights, but probably not much longer than that unless it was a comet. Another possibility is of course that the impactor approaches from the sunward side of the Earth. In which case, it would be nearer the Sun, but only partially illuminated as seen from Earth. More importantly, it is likely to be in the daytime sky and would thus remain unobserved until it was, at most, hours away from impact. "
Is the Moon only 60x60 pixels?,"Yes and no. Yes, it's true that the apparent size of the Moon is 30 arcmin. It's true that the visual acuity of most people is 1 arcmin. So it's true that if you take the angular size of the smallest detail you can see on the Moon, and you put a bunch of those lined up straight in a row, you could span a Moon diameter with only a few dozen of them. In that sense, you are correct. However, when you try to reproduce the situation on a computer screen, the comparison breaks down. First off, the eye doesn't see in ""pixels"". Like most optical systems, there's a point-spread function, that takes very tiny details and smears them up to a larger spot. The resolution of the eye is not the pixel size, but the size of the bell curve coming out of the point-spread function, and that has soft edges and is round, and it's everywhere and it's not fixed.  You assimilate the size of that larger spot with the size of a pixel on a digital screen, in your comparison. But that's not the same. The pixel grid in those thumbnails is fixed, so whatever falls between pixels is lost forever. Aliasing intervenes and creates artifacts that are not there in the original image. The dynamic range of the monitor is not the same like the dynamic range of the eye (the eye is much better). Color and brightness levels on the monitor are discrete, whereas the eye sees them as a continuum. Finally, the visual center in your brain is like a powerful computer that applies intelligent correction algorithms to the live image. The list goes on and on. The bottom line is - all these effects combine and allow you to perceive a live image that is slightly more rich than those dead, frozen thumbnails that you posted. Not a whole lot better, but a little bit better. It's not like the eye can ""work around"" limitations, but it's more like you lose too much when you shrink a large image into a tiny fixed pixel grid on a computer screen. It's very hard to reproduce reality on a computer screen. A much better way would be to take a 2000px by 2000px image of the Moon, put it on a big super HD monitor, and move it back to the point where the apparent size of that image is 30 arcmin. I know that doesn't sound satisfactory in the context of your original query, but it's a much better simulation. Similar problems appear whenever you try to map the resolution of any continuous optical system (like a telescope) to a fixed digital grid (like a camera). Let's say you're using a sensor with a pixel size of 4 microns. Let's say your telescope has a linear resolution in prime focus equal to 4 microns. You might be tempted to say - great, the sensor matches the telescope, right? Well, not really. When that happens, you actually lose a bit of resolution. The image is good, but it's a little bit softer than it really should. See below an image of the Moon I took a while ago, with a system having exactly the parameters indicated above. You can tell it's a bit soft, it's not really down to the pixel. Turbulence also plays a role, but part of the problem is that linear resolution is equal to pixel size. Click the image below and open in new tab; if your browser shrinks it again to fit the window, left-click the big image to expand to full size - you must do this to see the full resolution image and notice the effects I'm talking about. The fuzziness is not visible on this small version here:  One way around that phenomenon, as an example, is to blow up the image in the telescope with a barlow until the linear resolution in prime focus is much greater than the camera pixel size, maybe 4x bigger. You do all your processing, and then you shrink it back, if you like, and you'll get a sharper image. Combine it with stacking multiple frames, and the overall quality can get pretty close to 100% the theoretical performance of the telescope. TLDR: Continuous optical systems, and discrete grids of pixels, are very different things and cannot be easily compared."

Can gravitational waves pass through a black hole?,"No, gravitational waves cannot pass through a black hole. A gravitational wave follows a path through spacetime called a null geodesic. This is the same path that would be followed by a light ray travelling in the same direction, and gravitational waves are affected by black holes in the same way that light rays are. So for example gravitational waves can be refracted by gravitational lenses just as light waves are. And just like light waves, if a gravitational wave crosses the event horizon surrounding a black hole it is then doomed to travel inwards to the singularity and can never escape. There is one caveat to this. When we talk about a gravitational wave we generally mean a ripple in spacetime that is relatively small. Specifically it is small enough that the energy of the gravitational wave does not significantly affect the spacetime curvature. So when we calculate the trajectory of a gravitational wave near a black hole we take the black hole geometry as fixed, i.e. unaffected by the wave, and we compute the trajectory of the wave in this fixed background. This is exactly the same approach as we use for calculating the trajectories of light rays. Since light rays carry energy and momentum then, at least in principle, they have their own gravitational fields. But for both the light rays and gravitational waves likely to exist in the universe the energy carried is too small to make a significant contribution to the spacetime curvature. When you say in your question: I would presume that something interesting happens because of the way spacetime works near black holes I would guess you are thinking that the gravitational wave could change the geometry near a black hole, but as described above typical gravitational waves don't have enough energy to do this. It would be reasonable to ask what happens if we give the wave enough energy, but the answer turns out to be that it no longer behaves like a simple wave. Gravitational waves exist in a regime called linearised gravity where they obey a wave equation that is basically similar to the wave equation light obeys. If we increase the energy so much that gravity becomes non-linear (as if the case for black holes) then the oscillations in the spacetime curvature no longer obey a wave equation and need to be described by the full Einstein equations. For example it has been suggested, but not proven, that really high energy gravitational (or light) waves could interact with each other to form a bound state called a geon. I confess that I'm unsure how much work has been done studying oscillations in this regime."
Why is only one side of the Moon visible from Earth?,"The reason for this is what we call tidal locking: Tidal locking (or captured rotation) occurs when the gravitational
gradient makes one side of an astronomical body always face another,
an effect known as synchronous rotation. For example, the same side of
the Earth's Moon always faces the Earth. A tidally locked body takes
just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve
around its partner. This causes one hemisphere constantly to face the
partner body. Usually, at any given time only the satellite is tidally
locked around the larger body, but if the difference in mass between
the two bodies and their physical separation is small, each may be
tidally locked to the other, as is the case between Pluto and Charon.
This effect is employed to stabilize some artificial satellites.               Fig. 1: Tidal locking results in the Moon rotating about its axis in about the same time it takes to orbit the Earth. (Source: Wikipedia) Fig. 1, cont.: Except for libration effects, this results in the Moon keeping the same face turned towards the Earth, as seen in the figure
on the left. (The Moon is shown in polar view, and is not drawn to
scale.) If the Moon were not spinning at all, it would alternately
show its near and far sides to the Earth while moving around our
planet in orbit, as shown in the figure on the right.                                                    Fig. 2: Lunar librations in latitude and longitude over a period of one month (Source: Wikipedia) Libration is manifested as a slow rocking back and forth of the Moon
as viewed from Earth, permitting an observer to see slightly different
halves of the surface at different times. There are three types of lunar libration: Libration in longitude results from the eccentricity
of the Moon's orbit around Earth; the Moon's rotation sometimes leads
and sometimes lags its orbital position. Libration in latitude results
from a slight inclination between the Moon's axis of rotation and the
normal to the plane of its orbit around Earth. Its origin is analogous
to how the seasons arise from Earth's revolution about the Sun. Diurnal libration is a small daily oscillation due to the Earth's
rotation, which carries an observer first to one side and then to the
other side of the straight line joining Earth's and the Moon's
centers, allowing the observer to look first around one side of the
Moon and then around the other—because the observer is on the surface
of the Earth, not at its center. All quotes and images from Wikipedia on Tidal locking and Wikipedia on Libration."
Why not take a picture of a closer black hole?,"I was surprised too when I first heard they were trying to image M87's black hole. The short answer is because it's really, really big. It is 1500 times bigger (diameter) than our Sagittarius A*, and 2100 times farther away. This makes its apparent size about 70% of that of Sgr A*, which they are also attempting to image. A cursory search of wikipedia's List of Largest black holes shows that there's no other black holes with a combination of size and closeness greater than these two.  A couple of other candidates are not too far off. Andromeda's black hole is 50x the size of ours, and at 100x the distance, it would appear half the size of Sgr A*. The Sombrero galaxy is 380 times farther way than Sgr A*, and has a black hole estimated to be 1 billion solar masses, which is 232 times Sr A*, resulting in an angular diameter about 60% of Sgr A*. There appear to be many other considerations to which black holes were chosen, as explained in this similar question. At a guess these would include how obscured each black hole is with foreground dust/stars etc, how active (and therefore bright) the nuclei are, and their inclination w.r.t earth affecting which observatories could observe them at which times. Edit: I've found another plausible candidate. NGC_1600 is 200 M light years away with a central black hole estimated to be 17 billion solar masses heavy. This would put it at about 40% the apparent diameter of Sgr A*.  
Comparison of the apparent size of the largest nearby black holes And of course obligatory XKCD to remind us how small these objects really appear."
Is it dark inside the Sun?,"No, it's not. The radiation field in the interior of the Sun is very close to a blackbody spectrum. If you look in any particular direction the brightness (power per unit area) you see is $\sigma T^4$, where $\sigma$ is Stefan's constant. Even at any particular wavelength it is always the case that a blackbody of higher temperature is brighter than a blackbody at lower temperature. Given that the interior temperature might be $10^7\ \mathrm K$, then the surface brightness is $5.7 \times 10^{20}\ \mathrm{W/m^2}$, compared with the $1400\ \mathrm{W/m^2}$ you would get by looking directly at the Sun (please don't do this). Note that most of this power comes out at X-ray wavelengths, but because of the properties of a blackbody, the brightness at visible wavelengths will still be plenty brighter than that of the solar photosphere (see below). A possible source of confusion is this term ""opacity"". When things are in thermal equilibrium, which the interior of the Sun is, then they emit the same amount of radiation as they absorb. So high opacity also means high emissivity. Details for interest: The opacity, $\kappa$ in the solar interior ranges from 1 cm$^2$ g at the centre to about $10^5$ cm$^2$ g just below the photosphere. To estimate the mean free path of photons we need to multiply this by the density $\rho$ and take the reciprocal:
$$ \bar{l} = \frac{1}{\kappa \rho}\ .$$
The density varies from 160 g/cm$^3$ at the centre to about 0.001 g/cm$^3$ just below the photosphere. Thus the mean free path is about  6 micrometres at the center and is actually quite similar just below the photosphere (it peaks at around 2 mm about three quarters of the way out towards the surface). Thus your ""view"" of the stellar interior is of a foggy sphere with radius of no more than a few times $\bar{l}$. The fog however is tremendously bright - as outlined above. The brightness at particular wavelengths is proportional to the Planck function
$$B_\lambda = \frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^5} \left(\frac{1}{\exp(hc/\lambda k_B T) -1}\right).$$ Thus at $\lambda=500$ nm (visible light), the ratio of brightness for blackbodies at $10^7$ K (solar interior) to 6000 K (solar photosphere) is $4.2\times 10^{4}$. i.e. Even just considered at visible wavelengths, the interior of the Sun is about 40,000 times brighter than the photosphere."
Does the Milky Way move through space?,"Does the Milky Way move through space? Yes it does.  I'm very fascinated with space, although I don't have a degree or any formal education, I'm still very in love with everything about it and want to learn constantly.  Good man Mike.  One thing I ask myself is if our galaxy moves through space? It does. When we look at the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation we see a ""dipole anisotropy"" due to the motion of the Earth relative to it:  Image courtesy of William H. Kinney's Cosmology, inflation, and the physics of nothing See Wikipedia for more: ""From the CMB data it is seen that the Local Group (the galaxy group that includes the Milky Way galaxy) appears to be moving at 627±22 km/s relative to the reference frame of the CMB (also called the CMB rest frame, or the frame of reference in which there is no motion through the CMB) in the direction of galactic longitude l = 276°±3°, b = 30°±3°.[82][83] This motion results in an anisotropy of the data (CMB appearing slightly warmer in the direction of movement than in the opposite direction).[84]"" 627 km/s is quite fast. See this article, which says it's 1.3 million miles an hour. The speed of light is just under 300,000 km/s or 670 million miles per hour, so the Milky Way is moving through the Universe at circa 0.2% of the speed of light. Also see the CMBR physics answer by ghoppe which talks about the CMBR reference frame, which is in effect the reference frame of the universe.    Or does it stay in a single location? If it does move, what causes it to move? I'm afraid I don't know why it's moving. Perhaps it's because the Universe is full of things moving in fairly random directions. Like a gas.   Hopefully the question makes sense, if not I can elaborate. It certainly makes sense to me!  Edit 13/09/2017 : as Dave points out in the comments, there are other motions, including the motion of the solar system around the galaxy, which is circa 514,000 mph. (See the Wikipedia Galactic Year article). And the motion of galaxies isn't neat and tidy either. "
If a massive object like Jupiter flew past the Earth how close would it need to come to pull people off of the surface?,"TL:DR Jupiter isn't dense enough for its gravity gradient over Earth's radius to produce a 1g tidal acceleration, even right at Jupiter's surface. thanks to PeterCordes Jupiter's gravity will pull on the Earth itself, as well as everything on it.  It's not like a vacuum cleaner that selectively lifts small and light objects, the gravitational force will scale with the mass of each object; if the Earth is a zillion times more massive than we are, then Jupiter's gravitational force will also be about a zillion times larger. What that means is that Earth will accelerate towards Jupiter, and we will accelerate along with it, and so we won't ""feel the tug"" anywhere near as strongly as one might suspect. Instead, let's think about the size of the Earth, and the fact that people on the near side will be closer to Jupiter than the center of mass of the Earth, and people on the far side will be farther away. Since people nearer to Jupiter will feel a slightly stronger acceleration than the center of mass of the Earth, they will feel a quite gentle tug. We'll calculate that in a minute.  But believe it or not, people on the far side of the Earth, feeling less of a tug than the Earth's center of mass, will believe they are being pulled in the opposite direction! They won't really be pulled away from Jupiter, but they will not accelerate towards Jupiter as fast as the Earth, and so it will feel like they are being repelled. This kind of force is called a tidal force and this is the picture that's often used with the concept:  Source Replace ""Satellite"" with ""Jupiter"" The acceleration we feel due to gravity is expressed as $$a_G = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$ where $G$ is the gravitational constant and equal to about $6.674 \times 10^{-11}$ m^3/kg s^2 and M is each mass that's pulling on you. If you put in 6378137 meters and the mass of the Earth ($5.972 \times 10^{+24}$ kg) you get the familiar 9.8 m/s^2. If Jupiter were 114,000,000 meters or 114,000 kilometers away, the Earth would accelerate at 1 g towards it, but people on the close and far side would accelerate very differently. On the close side, being 6,378 kilometers closer, would feel an acceleration 1.2 m/s^2 greater, so they would feel that they weighed 12% less. And people on the far side would also feel about the same amount lighter because they felt less acceleration than the Earth. If Jupiter were so close that it were practically touching the Earth, it still wouldn't pull is off of Earth, assuming that Earth remained intact. But that wouldn't last very long!!! Earth would be accelerating towards Jupiter at about 20.9 m/s^2, and people on the near side would feel acceleration of 24.8 towards Jupiter, but relative to Earth that's only 3.9 m/s^2, so not enough to overcome Earth's gravity of -9.8 m/s^2. On the far side of Earth it's similar; the acceleration towards Jupiter would be 17.8 m/s^2 but minus Earth's acceleration of - 20.9 it's -3.0 m/s^2 away, but that's also not enough to overcome the attraction to Earth of in this case +9.8 m/s^2. When Earth touches Jupiter, we will feel about 40% lighter on the near side and 31% lighter on the far side of Earth, but we would not leave the surface. However, in just minutes we'd be pulled so deep into Jupiter that we would be crushed by Jupiter's internal atmospheric pressure. It would certainly be fun, but it wouldn't last long!"
Why is there a zig-zag in elemental abundances?,"Nuclei are more stable if they have an even number of protons Z, and are also more stable if they have an even number of neutrons N. This is because the particles form pairs. (Almost all nuclei with both N and Z odd are unstable with respect to beta decay.) If a nucleus is going to have significant cosmic abundance, it must be either absolutely stable or at least have an extremely long half-life. This is more likely to happen when Z is even (and also when N is even). Stability also effects probabilities of different types of decay. E.g., if a nucleus can undergo both beta+ and beta- decay, then it is usually more likely to do the decay that results in the more stable daughter."
If two black hole event horizons overlap (touch) can they ever separate again?,"You have already got some good answers, but I'll just try to provide one more intuitive solution on why the event horizons will never separate again if overlapping each other:
First, imagine a speck of dust that comes inside the EH of a black hole. I believe we'll agree this speck can never escape the black hole, because nothing can come back from behind the event horizon.
Now, imagine the same speck of dust, but inside the overlapping parts of the EH of two black holes passing each other. This speck of dust will never escape any of those two black holes, because it is inside the EH of them both. If these black holes would be able to separate again, the speck caught between them would obviously escape at least one of the black holes, after being behind it's event horizon.
Since this can not happen, the two black holes will be united from the point their event horizons are overlapping, no matter their speed."
Why is the asteroid belt shaped like a triangle?,"It's not. The image doesn't show the main asteroid belt. It shows the Jovian Trojans (in green) , and the Hilda Asteroids (in red).  The Hildas are a dynamical group of a few thousand known asteroids in elliptical orbits that are locked in a 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter, and reach aphelion coinciding with the regions near Sun-Jupiter Lagrange points L4, L3, and L5 in succession.   ""Animation showing Hildas with 3 indicated orbits"" from ""Asteroid (and Comet) Groups"", Petr Scheirich, Retrieved 2020/02/14. In accordance with Kepler's Second Law, objects in elliptical orbits move slower near aphelion than perihelion, and as a result, when you just look at the Hildas, they bunch up near the Lagrange points, and the pattern they appear to show at any one time resembles a triangle. A more complete view of all the Asteroids inside of Jupiter looks like this."
How many planets are there in this solar system?,"In addition to Undo's fine answer, I would like to explain a bit about the motivation behind the definition. When Eris was discovered, it turned out to be really, really similar to Pluto. This posed a bit of a quandary: should Eris be accepted as a new planet? Should it not? If not, then why keep Pluto? Most importantly, this pushed to the foreground the question what, exactly, is a planet, anyway? This had been ignored until then because everyone ""knew"" which bodies were planets and which ones were not. However, with the discovery of Eris, and the newly-realized potential of more such bodies turning up, this was no longer really an option, and some sort of hard definition had to be agreed upon. The problem with coming up with a hard definition that decides what does make it to planethood and what doesn't is that nature very rarely presents us with clear, definite lines. Size, for example, is not a good discriminant, because solar system bodies come in a continuum of sizes from Jupiter down to meter-long asteroids. Where does one draw the line there? Any such size would be completely arbitrary. There is, however, one characteristic that has a sharp distinction between some ""planets"" and some ""non-planets"", and it is the amount of other stuff in roughly the same orbit. This is still slightly arbitrary, because it's hard to put in numbers exactly what ""roughly"" means in this context, but it's more or less unambiguous.  Consider, then a quantity called the ""planetary discriminant"" µ, equal to the ratio of the planet's mass to the total mass of other bodies that cross its orbital radius and have non-resonant periods (so e.g. Neptune doesn't count as sharing Pluto's orbit) up to a factor of 10 longer or shorter (to rule out comets, which has little effect in practice). This is still a bit arbitrary (why 10?) but it's otherwise quite an objective quantity. Now take this quantity and calculate it for the different bodies you might call planets, comparing it to both the objects' mass,  and their diameter,  or with an arbitrary horizontal axis, in order of decreasing discriminant,  Suddenly, a natural hard line emerges. If you look only at the mass and the diameter of the objects (shown in the insets above the plots), then there is a pretty continuous spread of values, with bigger gaps between the gas giants and the terrestrial planets than between Mercury and Eris/Pluto. However, if you look at the planetary discriminant, on the vertical axis, you get a very clear grouping into two distinct populations, separated by over four orders of magnitude. There's a finite set of bodies that have ""cleared their orbits"", and some other bodies which are well, well behind in that respect. This is the main reason that ""clearing its orbital zone"" was chosen as a criterion for planethood. It relies on a distinction that is actually there in the solar system, and very little on arbitrary human decisions. It's important to note that this criterion need not have worked: this parameter might also have come out as a continuum, with some bodies having emptier orbits and some others having slightly fuller ones, and no natural place to draw the line, in which case the definition would have been different. As it happens, this is indeed a good discriminant. For further reading, I recommend the Wikipedia article on 'Clearing the neighbourhood', as well as the original paper where this criterion was proposed, What is a planet? S Soter,  The Astronomical Journal 132 no.6 (2006), p. 2513. arXiv:astro-ph/0608359. which is in general very readable (though there are some technical bits in the middle which are easy to spot and harmless to skip), and from which I took the discriminant data for the plots above. Edit: I must apologize for having included, in previous versions of this post, an incorrect plot, caused by taking data from Wikipedia without verifying it. In particular, the planetary discriminant for Mars was wrong (1.8×105 instead of 5.1×103), which now puts it below Neptune's instead of just below Saturn's, but the overall conclusions are not affected. The Mathematica code for the graphics is available at Import[""http://goo.gl/NaH6rM""][""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CQA4T.png""]. ... and, as a final aside: Pluto is awesome. It was visited in July 2015 by the New Horizons probe, which found a world that was much more rich, dynamic, and active than anyone expected, including what appear to be churning lakes of solid nitrogen ringed by mountains of water ice, among other marvels.  (Note the image has been colour-enhanced to bring out the variety of surface materials; the true-colour version of this image is here.) I, personally, don't feel it's at all necessary to 'grandfather' Pluto into the list of planets to really feel the awe at the amazing place it is - it's perfectly OK for it to be a cool place with cool science, that is also not a planet."
"Why hasn't the ""9th Planet"" been detected already?","Brown and Batygin, the authors of the paper on the possible planet, have a webpage addressing this. A few reasons not already covered: Eris, which is the most distant confirmed object still known in the
  solar system, moves at a speed of 1.5 arcseconds per hour, which is so
  slow that it was missed the first time around. Most surveys of the
  outer solar system would not be able to find Planet Nine, even if it
  were quite bright, as they would just think it is a stationary star. If the planet is near aphelion, it might be an order of magnitude further away than any major or minor planet we've found so far (excluding exoplanets, which are found by methods that don't apply in this case). The authors suggest an aphelion between 500 and 1200 AU. For comparison, Pluto is at 30-50 AU, while Eris at around 100 AU wasn't discovered until 2005. The potential 9th planet would be far larger than Eris, but is also likely to be much further away, and thereby fainter. The WISE survey eliminated Saturn-sized planets within 10,000 AU, and Jupiter-sized planets within 26,000 AU. But the potential 9th planet is far smaller than those. WISE has also done a more sensitive search, which would pick up Neptune-sized objects, but that search has so far covered only a limited part of the sky. The planet will be far harder to spot if it has the Milky Way in the background - there are too many stars potentially drowning out a faint object. Here's the authors' summary:  Estimated orbit for the putative 9th planet. The horizontal axis is the right ascension. The colored segments are regions where it should have been found by existing surveys.
Illustration by Brown and Batygin, assuming fair use applies. The biggest unexplored territory is where, statistically, it is most
  likely to be: near aphelion. Sadly, aphelion is also very close to the
  Milky Way galaxy. Ugh. So where is it? Probably distant. 500 AU+. Probably fainter than 22nd 
  magnitude. Very possibly in the middle of the Milky Way galaxy. Now go find planet nine. More details on the authors' webpage: http://www.findplanetnine.com/p/blog-page.html Finally, the gravitational dominance of the Sun reaches halfway to the nearest star. There's still plenty of unexplored territory for planets smaller than Saturn to hide in. 
Note the log axis. We have a good map for the inner 50 AU, and are starting to find objects around 100 AU, but solar system objects might exist all the way to the outer edges of the Oort cloud.

What is the hottest thing in the universe?,"Energetic neutrinos have been observed from the core of a supernova (SN 1987A). The inferred temperature at the ""neutrinosphere"" is about 4 MeV (equivalent to 50 billion K - ($5\times 10^{10}$ K, Valentim et al. 2017). These are thermal neutrinos with energies that are characteristic of the temperature of the material that produced them. Hence this material is observable and has been observed. The very centre of the proto-neutron star that is responsible for the neutrino emission is likely to be a factor of two or so hotter, but cannot be observed, even with neutrinos, because the ""neutrinosphere"" is opaque to neutrinos. By the time this ""clears"", the proto-neutron star is much cooler - its surface would be orders of magnitude cooler. Arguably we could study the very core of a supernova through gravitational waves if one were to explode in our own Galaxy. Whether this counts as ""observing"" a hot object, I'm not sure. In a similar vein, we have observed ""kilonova"" that appear to be due to the merger of two neutron stars. The temperatures generated in these events are also likely to be of order 100 billion K ($10^{11}$ K), but again these temperatures are not observed directly - the gravitational waves and gamma rays produced in these events are caused by ""non-thermal"" mechanisms."
When will the Sun end all human life on Earth?,"The Sun is gradually getting larger and brighter. In fact, as called2voyage pointed out, its brightness is increasing by 1% every 100 million years. You can see how the Sun will change in the future from this graph: (Source)  According to this paper, within 1 billion (short scale) years from now, the ever-increasing luminosity will have made Earth nearly uninhabitable. The average temperature will have reached 47°C, compared to its current 15°C. Essentially no water will be left either, except at the poles. This may allow for simple life to survive for a while. By 3.5 billion years, Earth will no longer resemble its current self. Its oceans, magnetic field and ozone layer and plate tectonics will be no more. Its surface temperature will skyrocket to roughly 1,330°C, hot enough to melt surface rock. No longer will our planet resemble a pale blue dot, and it will be more like Venus. Our planet is officially dead, along with all life on it. (Source) ~4.5 billion years from now, the Sun will become a red giant and possibly consume Earth. However, according to this paper, it may heat up potentially habitable bodies like Triton, to the point where they would support life. Unfortunately, the Sun won't remain in this stage for long enough — life usually takes billions of years to develop."
"Would we have more than 8 minutes of light, if the Sun ""went out""?","If nuclear fusion were to suddenly stop in the centre of the Sun, then the only clear signature we would have of this is the lack of detectable neutrinos received at Earth, starting about 8 minutes after the reactions ceased. The Sun however would continue to shine for tens of millions of years at roughly its current luminosity. The power source is not ""stored"" photons. The Sun itself would simply resume the slow gravitational contraction that was halted about 4.5 billion years ago when nuclear reaction rates at the centre were able to increase sufficiently to supply the radiative losses from the surface of the Sun. The characteristic (Kelvin-Helmholtz) timescale for the contraction is about
$$\tau_{\rm KH} = \frac{GM^2}{RL},$$
which is 30 million years. i.e. The Sun has enough gravitational potential energy to supply its current luminosity for tens of millions of years. While this is happening, the Sun would approximately maintain its current luminosity, but decrease in radius, meaning that its surface temperature would increase. Once the Sun had contracted to a few times the size of Jupiter (so about 30% of its current radius), the contraction would begin to slow, because the electrons in the core become degenerate and the pressure increases with density by more than expected for a perfect gas. The slowing contraction decreases the rate of potential energy release and hence the solar luminosity. The contraction continues at a slow rate until the Sun becomes a hot ""hydrogen white dwarf"" a few times the size of the Earth, which then cools to a glowing cinder, with no further contraction, over billions of years (see What would the Sun be like if nuclear reactions could not proceed via quantum tunneling? for some more details). Even if you were to not allow the Sun to contract, it would take some time to radiate it's thermal energy. This timescale is approximately
$$\tau_{\rm therm} \simeq \frac{3k_B T M}{m_H L},$$
which assumes the Sun is a perfect gas of protons plus electrons, with an average temperature $T$. If we take $T =10^7$ K and the current solar luminosity, then $\tau_{\rm therm}=$ 40 million years. On the other hand, if your scenario is just that light from the Sun stops being emitted, then of course it goes dark on Earth about 8 minutes later."
"Why does Io cast a hard shadow on Jupiter, but the Moon casts a soft shadow on Earth?","It's due to the larger relative apparent size of the Sun. When the source of light is a point source the shadow is harder, and when it is extended it is softer. Jupiter is approximately 5 times more distant from the Sun than the Earth, so the Sun is approximately 5 times smaller in the sky.

Where did TRAPPIST-1a go?,"To add to Rob's answer, I wanted to expand on where this naming convention comes from. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is the organization which generally sets conventions and definitions. They're the ones who demoted Pluto to being a dwarf planet in 2006. Anyway, before any exoplanets were found, there existed a convention for naming multiple-star systems. The rule was that you gave the system a name, for example Alpha Centauri, and then the brightest star in that system is designated by ""A"". Any other objects are then given the letters ""B"", ""C"", etc. The Alpha Centauri system has three stars in it and so they're named Alpha Centauri A (The brightest of the three), Alpha Centauri B, and Alpha Centauri C (a.k.a. Proxima Centauri). This convention then continued on to naming exoplanets. The star, according to this convention is ""A"", whereas all the exoplanets are given the letters ""b"" and onwards. Note that generally the exoplanet letters are lowercase, whereas they'd be uppercase for stars. Also note that if you have a star (say TRAPPIST-1) around which planets are found, the star's name doesn't then become TRAPPIST-1 A. The ""A"" is implicit. Just to point out another point of interest with this naming convention, the letters of the planets don't always signify their distance from the star. That is, the ""b"" planet isn't necessarily the closest, followed by ""c"", etc. The planets are labeled at their time of discovery. Someone could find a planet, label it as ""b"" and then later find a second, closer planet and label it ""c"". It just so happens that the lettering of TRAPPIST 1 is in order because the first three were found at the same time and labeled according to distance, then the last 4 were found at the same time and labelled according to distance. You can read more about the full set of rules concerning this on Wikipedia's exoplanet naming convention page. There are a lot of caveats such as what to do when your planet is orbiting a binary system."
"If light has no mass, why is it affected by gravity?","Another way to answer this question is to apply the Equivalence Principle, which Einstein called his ""happiest thought"" (so you know it has to be good).  The equivalence principle says that if you are in an enclosed box in the presence of what Newton would call a gravitational field, then everything that happens in that box must be the same as if the box was not in a gravitational field, but accelerating upward instead.  So when you release a ball, you can imagine the ball is accelerated downward by gravity, or you can imagine everything but the ball is accelerated upward, and the ball is simply being left behind (which, ironically, checks better with the stresses you can easily detect on every object around you that are not present on the ball, including the feeling you are receiving from your bottom right now). Given that rule, it is easy to see how light would be affected by gravity-- simply imagine shining a laser horizontally.  In the ""left behind"" reference frame, we see what would happen-- the beam would start from a sequentially higher and higher point, and that raising effect is accelerating.  So given the finite speed of light, the shape of the beam would appear to curve downward, and the beam would not strike the point on the wall of the box directly opposite the laser.  Therefore, this must also be what is perceived from inside the box-- the beam does not strike the point directly across from the laser (as that point is getting higher then the point across from it where the light was emitted), and its path appears to curve downward.  Ergo, light ""falls."" Indeed, this is the crucial simplification of the Equivalence Principle-- you never need to know what the substance is, all substances ""fall the same"" because it's nothing happening to the substance, it is just the consequences of being ""left behind"" by whatever actually does have forces on it and is actually accelerating. Incidentally, it is interesting to note that even in Newtonian gravity, massless objects would ""fall the same"" as those with mass, but to see it requires taking a limit.  Simply drop a ball in a vacuum, then a lower mass ball, then a lower still mass.  All objects fall the same under Newtonian gravity.   So simply proceed to the limit of zero mass, you will not see any difference along the path of that limit.  Nevertheless, Newtonian gravity doesn't get the answer quite right for the trajectory of light in gravity, because Newtonian physics doesn't treat the speed of light correctly."
How did Astronomers deduce that the Sun was not a ball of fire?,"I think it's maybe not the case that there was a moment when the astronomy community conclusively rejected the ball-of-fire hypothesis; astronomers simply accumulated more and more evidence against it. If you want to put a rough date on it, you could put your finger somewhere in the middle of the 19th century, as by then, other ideas had taken hold. Back in the classical period, Anaxagoras had proposed that the Sun was a heap of molten metal. I don't know whether this was widely accepted by his contemporaries. The idea of the Sun as a ball of metal or fire certainly persisted for some time, though perhaps largely for lack of any better ideas. We didn't even understand oxygen and combustion until the work of Lavoisier and others in the late 18th century, so detailed calculations were presumably out of the question for a millennium or two after Anaxagoras. I don't know when calculations of how long combustion could sustain the Sun were first done, but it appears to have been not more than several decades after the theory of combustion was developed. Why? Well, we can say that by the middle of the 19th century, the predominant explanation for the Sun's luminosity was not the burning of coal but instead gravitational potential energy. By the 1860s, it was widely known that chemical reactions could only power the Sun for a few thousand years. We also now had a potentially viable alternative: a decade earlier, Hermann von Helmholtz had begun exploring the idea that gravitational contraction of some sort, by what we now call the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism, was the source of energy, with gravitational potential energy being transformed into heat$^{\dagger}$. Around the same time, Lord Kelvin suggested that meteors falling into the Sun provided the necessary energy, a similar mechanism to Helmholtz's. I believe astronomers continued with the contraction hypothesis through the turn of the century - I've seen an article written around 1900 to that effect. However, during the early and mid- 1900s, quantum theory and nuclear physics were being developed, and the work of Eddington, Bethe and others would lay the groundwork for our current understanding of solar energy production. Previous models (including, finally, Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction) were now known to be insufficient because they allowed the Sun to shine for only thousands or millions of years, and geologists had established that Earth itself was much older than this. Fusion, on the other hand, allows the Sun to survive for billions of years - a timescale that matches up well with the age of the Earth. We also knew that hydrogen and helium were the dominant constituents of the Sun and other stars; while Wollaston and Fraunhofer had performed the first solar spectroscopy observations in the early 1800s, the true composition of the Sun was not accepted for more than a century, when Cecilia Payne made a detailed study of spectral lines. $^{\dagger}$ While this does produce heat in various bodies, including T Tauri stars, it is not significant in most stars beyond that stage."
"Sun constantly converts mass into energy, will this cause its gravity to decrease?","If the sun is constantly converting the mass into energy, then will its gravitational field go on decreasing? It's a very interesting question and the answer is yes! The solar constant indicates the mean solar radiation of electromagnetic waves (mostly in visible and near infrared light and I'll answer based on that.  While the conversion of mass matter† to energy in the Sun's core now represents a loss of mass proper matter, it turns out that that energy (trapped in the Sun and slowly diffusing towards the surface) will have the same gravitational attraction as the matter it came from until it actually escapes the Sun! There is some prompt mass and energy loss via neutrinos and it's significant, perhaps several hundred keV per neutrino I simply don't know the number yet. I'll ask a separate question about it. I'm guessing that losses due to the stellar wind are small, but I'll update here as soon as the following is answered: update: the answer there is that loss via neutrinos is only about 2.3% of the radiative loss, and on average loss via solar wind and coronal mass ejections is about 4E+16 kg/year, or about another 30% relative to the radiative loss described below. The value $I$ is about 1360 Watts per square meter at $R$ = 1 AU which is about 150 million kilometers or 150 billion meters. So the total energy lost per second $P$ is  $$P = 4 \pi R^2 I$$ Taking the time derivative of $E = m c^2$ we get $$\frac{dE}{dt} = P = \frac{dm}{dt} c^2$$ so  $$  \frac{dm}{dt} = \frac{1}{c^2} \ 4 \pi R^2 I$$ That means that the value of the mass that we use to calculate the Sun's gravitational attraction changes by about 4.3E+09 kilograms per second, or 1.3E+17 kilograms per year. The Sun's current mass is about 2.00E+30 kilograms, so this effect changes by a very tiny fraction per year, about 6.7E-14.  Over the age of the Earth of 4.5 billion years, that's 3E-04, or about 0.03% if the Sun's output were constant. It has probably changed over this time of course, so this is just a rough estimate. †Thanks to @S.Melted's answer for clarifying this. added to my answer by @Tosic: The Earth feels no torque from any force during this (the force from radiation is radial), which means its angular momentum is conserved. This means
  $$R_1 v_1 = R v$$
$$R_1 \sqrt{\frac{GM_1}{R_1}} = R \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$$
$$M_1 R_1 = M R$$
  We can see the Earth's orbital radius would change by a factor of 0.03% as well (M1 and M are solar masses)."
Why has Venus's atmosphere not been stripped away by solar wind?,"Venus has a strong ionosphere that protects it against violent solar winds. So, even though Venus has no intrisic magnetic field, it has an effective, induced magnetic field due to the interaction between the solar winds and the atmosphere, that protects it against solar winds. Venus atmosphere is thick enough to have a consequent ionosphere, that would be the difference between Mars and Venus (and Venus was able to keep a thicker atmosphere due to its greater mass, contrary to Mars).

I make no guarantees it's completely accurate, but the numbers seem to pass the sanity check so I think we're good. Caveat the First: The numbers for stars other than the Sun are based on data with a great deal of uncertainty, such as the number of stars in the universe and the average size of a star. The numbers above could easily be off by a factor of 10 in either direction, and are merely intended to give a rough idea of how empty space is. Caveat the Second: The numbers for the Sun and the Milky Way are based on the assumption that you are standing (or floating) at a random point on Earth. Anyone outside the tropics will never have the Sun over their head. People in the northern hemisphere are more likely to have Milky Way stars over their head, with the best odds being people near 36.8° N, because at that latitude straight up passes through the galactic center once a day.26 Note: You can mostly ignore everything in this answer and just look up the solid angle of the Sun to get the same result. All the other stars are really far away and very spread out. The difference in solid angle subtended is five thousandths of a percent more when we add the rest of the universe to the Sun. Let's try to get a somewhat realistic, hard number. To do that, we'll need some assumptions. As pointed out in Michael Walsby's answer1, if the universe is infinite (and homogeneous2), there is only an infinitesimal chance of there not being a star overhead, which normal math treats as exactly zero chance. So let's presume the universe is finite. From here, we're going to cheat a bit. Realistically, we should model each galaxy separately. But we're just going to pretend the entire universe is perfectly uniform (this is true enough as we get farther away from Earth in the grand scheme of the cosmos). Further, we're going to start counting far enough out to ignore the Milky Way and Sun entirely, then add them back in later with different calculations. Given the above presumptions, we can easily calculate the stellar density of the observable universe to be $\delta = \frac{10^{24}\text{stars}}{3.568\cdot10^{80} m^3} = 2.803\cdot10^{-57} \frac{\text{stars}}{\text{m}^3}$ 13. Next, we need to calculate the solid angle14 subtended by a star. The solid angle of a sphere is given by $\Omega=2\pi\left(1-\frac{\sqrt{d^2-r^2}}{d}\right)\text{ sr}$ 15, where $\Omega$ is the solid angle in steradians16 (sr), $d$ is the distance to the sphere and $r$ is the radius of the sphere. Using $D$ as the diameter, that converts to $\Omega=2\pi\left(1-\frac{\sqrt{d^2-\left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2}}{d}\right)\text{ sr}$. Given the average diameter presumed above ($1.4\cdot10^{9}\text{m}$), this gives an average solid angle of $\Omega=2\pi\left(1-\frac{\sqrt{d^2-4.9\cdot10^{17}\text{m}^2}}{d}\right)\text{ sr}$ 17. At this point, we could set up a proper integral, but my calculus is rather rusty, and not very sharp to begin with. So I'm going to approximate the answer using a series of concentric shells, each having a thickness of $10^{22}\text{m}$ (about a million light years). We'll put our first shell $10^{22}\text{m}$ away, then work our way out from there. We'll calculate the total solid angle of each shell, then add all the shells together to get the solid angle subtended by the entire observable universe. The last problem to fix here is that of overlap. Some stars in the farther shells will overlap stars in the nearby shells, causing us to overestimate the total coverage. So we'll calculate the probability of any given star overlapping and modify the result from there. We'll ignore any overlap within a given shell, modeling as if every star in a shell is at a fixed distance, evenly distributed throughout the shell. For a given star to overlap closer stars, it needs to be at a position already covered by the closer stars. For our purposes, we'll treat overlaps as binary: either the star is totally overlapped, or not overlapped at all. The probability will be given by the amount of solid angle already subtended by previous shells divided by the total solid angle in the sky ($4\pi\text{ sr}$). Let's call the probability a given star, $i$, is overlapped $P_i$, the solid angle subtended by that star $\Omega_i$, and the number of stars $n$. The amount of non-overlapped solid angle subtended by a given shell, $k$, is then $\Omega_{kT}=(1-P_1)\Omega_1+(1-P_2)\Omega_2+\ldots+(1-P_n)\Omega_n\frac{\text{ sr}}{star}$. Since we've said stars in a shell don't overlap each other, $P_i$ is the same for all $i$ in a given shell, allowing us to simplify the above equation to $\Omega_{kT}=(1-P_k)(\Omega_1+\Omega_2+\ldots+\Omega_n)\frac{\text{ sr}}{star}$, where $P_k$ is the probability of overlap for shell $k$. Since we're treating all the stars as having the same, average size, this simplifies even further to $\Omega_{kT}=(1-P_k)\Omega_k n\frac{\text{ sr}}{star}$, where $\Omega_k$ is the solid angle of a star in shell $k$. The number of stars in a shell is given by the volume of the shell times the stellar density of said shell. For far away shells, we can treat the volume of the shell as being its surface area times its thickness. $V_\text{shell}=4\pi d^2 t$, where $d$ is the distance to the shell and $t$ is its thickness. Using $\delta$ as the stellar density, the number of stars is simply $n=\delta V_\text{shell}=\delta 4\pi d^2 t$. From here, we can use the calculation for solid angle of a shell (from Probability of Overlap, above) to get $\Omega_{kT}=(1-P_k)\Omega_k \delta 4\pi d^2 t\frac{\text{ sr}}{star}$. Note that $P_k$ is given by the partial sum of solid angle for all previous shells divided by total solid angle. And $\Omega_k$ is given by $\Omega_k=2\pi\left(1-\frac{\sqrt{d_k^2-4.9\cdot10^{17}\text{m}^2}}{d_k}\right)\frac{\text{ sr}}{star}$ (from Model, above). This gives us $\Omega_{kT}=\left(1-\frac{\Omega_{(k-1)T}}{4\pi}\right)2\pi\left(1-\frac{\sqrt{d_k^2-4.9\cdot10^{17}\text{m}^2}}{d_k}\right) \delta 4\pi d^2 t\text{ sr}$. Given that each shell is $10^{22}\text{m}$ away, we can substitute $d_k$ with $k 10^{22}\text{m}$. Likewise, $t$ can be substituted with $10^{22}\text{m}$. And we already calculated $\delta=2.803\cdot10^{-57} \frac{\text{stars}}{\text{m}^3}$ (from Model, above). This gives us
$\Omega_{kT}=\left(1-\frac{\Omega_{(k-1)T}}{4\pi}\right)2\pi\left(1-\frac{\sqrt{(k 10^{22}\text{m})^2-4.9\cdot10^{17}\text{m}^2}}{k 10^{22}\text{m}}\right) 2.803\cdot10^{-57}\frac{\text{stars}}{\text{m}^3} 4\pi (k 10^{22}\text{m})^2 10^{22}\text{m}\frac{\text{ sr}}{star}$  $=\left(1-\frac{\Omega_{(k-1)T}}{4\pi}\right)\left(1-\frac{\sqrt{k^2 10^{44}-4.9\cdot10^{17}}}{k 10^{22}}\right) 2.803\cdot10^{-57} 8\pi^2 k^2 10^{66}\text{ sr}$  $=\left(1-\frac{\Omega_{(k-1)T}}{4\pi}\right)\,2.213\cdot 10^{11}\,k^2\left(1-\frac{\sqrt{k^2 10^{44}-4.9\cdot10^{17}}}{k 10^{22}}\right)\text{ sr}$ From here, we can just plug the numbers into a calculation program. $\Omega_{T}=\sum_{k=1}^{k_\text{max}} \Omega_{kT}$ Where $k_\text{max}$ is just the radius of the observable universe divided by the thickness of a given shell. Thus $k_\text{max}$$=\frac{4.4\cdot 10^{26} \text{m}}{10^{22} \text{m}}$$=4.4\cdot 10^4$$=44000$ $\Omega_{T}=\sum_{k=1}^{44000} \Omega_{kT}$ Because of the large numbers involved, it's difficult to just run this in a program. I resorted to writing a custom C++ program using the ttmath library18 for large numbers. The result was $2.386\cdot 10^{-11}\text{ sr}$, or $1.898\cdot 10^{-12}$ of the entire sky. Conversely, there's about a 1 in 500 billion chance you're standing under a star right now. Note that we ignored the Milky Way and the Sun for this. The C++ program can be found at PasteBin25. You'll have to get ttmath working properly. I added some instructions to the top of the C++ code to get you started if you care to make it work. It's not elegant or anything, just enough to function. WolframAlpha helpfully informed me the Sun has a solid angle of about $6.8\cdot 10^{-5}\text{ sr}$, or about 2.8 million times more than all the stars in the universe combined. The solid angle formula above gives the same answer18 if we provide the Sun's 150 gigameter distance and 0.7 gigameter radius. We could get an approximation for the Milky Way by taking its size and density and doing the same calculations as above, except on a smaller scale. However, the galaxy is very flat, so the odds greatly depend on whether you happen to be standing in the galactic plane or not. Also, we're off to one side, so there are far more stars towards the galactic center than away. If we approximate the galaxy as a cylinder with a radius of $5\cdot 10^{20}\text{ m}$ (about 52000 light years) and a height of $2\cdot 10^{16}\text{ m}$ (about 2 light years), we get a volume of $1.571\cdot 10^{58}\text{ m}^3$ 20. Current estimates of the galaxy's radius are closer to 100000 light years21 22, but I'm presuming the vast majority of stars are a lot closer than that. There are estimated to be 100 to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way21. Let's pick 200 billion for our purposes. This puts the density of the Milky Way at $\delta = \frac{200\cdot10^{9}\text{stars}}{1.571\cdot 10^{58}\text{ m}^3} = 1.273\cdot10^{-47} \frac{\text{stars}}{\text{m}^3}$ 22, or about 4.5 billion times denser than the universe at large. This time, we'll take shells $10^{17}\text{ m}$ thick (about 10 light years) and go out from there. But we need to re-organize the math into a spherical form, so we'll presume the galaxy has the same volume, but is a sphere. This gives it a radius of $1.554\cdot 10^{19}\text{ m}$ 24, or 155.4 shells. We'll round to 155 shells. $\Omega_{T}=\sum_{k=1}^{155} \Omega_{kT}$ Using our formula from above (Calculating Solid Angle), we can start substituting numbers. $\Omega_{kT}=\left(1-\frac{\Omega_{(k-1)T}}{4\pi}\right)2\pi\left(1-\frac{\sqrt{d_k^2-4.9\cdot10^{17}\text{m}^2}}{d_k}\right) \delta 4\pi d^2 t\frac{\text{sr}}{\text{star}}$ $=\left(1-\frac{\Omega_{(k-1)T}}{4\pi}\right)2\pi\left(1-\frac{\sqrt{(k\cdot 10^{17}\text{ m})^2-4.9\cdot10^{17}\text{ m}^2}}{k\cdot 10^{17}\text{ m}}\right) 1.273\cdot10^{-47} \frac{\text{stars}}{\text{m}^3} 4\pi (k\cdot 10^{17}\text{ m})^2 10^{17}\text{ m}\frac{\text{sr}}{\text{star}}$ $=\left(1-\frac{\Omega_{(k-1)T}}{4\pi}\right)\left(1-\frac{\sqrt{k^2\cdot 10^{34}\text{ m}^2-4.9\cdot10^{17}\text{ m}^2}}{k 10^{17}\text{ m}}\right) 1.273\cdot 10^{-47} \frac{\text{stars}}{\text{m}^3} 8\pi^2 k^2 10^{51}\text{ m}^3\frac{\text{sr}}{\text{star}}$ $=\left(1-\frac{\Omega_{(k-1)T}}{4\pi}\right)\cdot\,1.005\cdot 10^6\,k^2\,\left(1-\frac{\sqrt{k^2\cdot 10^{34}-4.9\cdot10^{17}}}{k 10^{17}}\right)\text{ sr}$ Plugging this into the program gives $3.816\cdot 10^{-9}\text{ sr}$, which is $3.037\cdot 10^{-10}$ of the total sky. The odds you're standing under a star in the Milky Way are about 1 in 3.3 billion.

What would happen if an ice cube is left in space?,"It depends on where in outer space you are. If you simply stick it in orbit around the Earth, it'll sublimate: the mean surface temperature of something at Earth's distance from the Sun is about 220K, which is solidly in the vapor phase for water in a vacuum, and the solid-vapor transition at that temperature doesn't pass through the liquid phase.  On the other hand, if you stick your ice cube out in the Oort Cloud, it'll grow: the mean surface temperature is 40K or below, well into the solid phase, so it'll pick up (or be picked up by) gas and other objects in space. A comet is a rough approximation to an ice cube.  If you think of what happens to a comet at various places, that's about what would happen to your ice cube."
Why is moon light not the same color as sunlight?,"The light from the moon is light being reflected from the sun. This is at least one reason you should not expect the Moon to have the same color.  Sunlight hitting an e.g. blue object would appear predominantly blue and similar.  So the color we might expect to see from the Moon is going to be adjusted by the color properties of the Moon's surface. As it happens lunar regolith is essentially gray in color (i.e. neutral), so it more or less reflects the spectrum it receives. The sun, in space, is white No it is not.  There are a couple of reasons. The Sun is an exceptionally bright object (for us) and will saturate our color vision so that it seems like it's white when we look at it directly. The Sun is actually a yellow star.  It's spectrum peaks in the (visual) blue-green range.  There are stars that have a red or blue color. White is a tricky one.  White is a perceived color.  There is no ""white"" wavelength in the EM spectrum.  White is a balance between the three different color sensors your human vision uses.  The Sun itself is not white because the color combination ""white"" we're balanced for is based not on the light from the Sun in the vacuum of space, but on the light that reaches the surface of the Earth and also what is reflected from the Earth (which is part of the ambient lighting we normally experience). why is moonlight white through the atmosphere? It seemed a nice clear sky last night around my neck of the woods and the Moon looked yellow to me.  This will vary with your location and atmospheric conditions, but also with your personal perception of color."
Does matter accumulate just outside the event horizon of a black hole?,"What you're describing is basically the ""collapsed star"" (Eng) or ""frozen star"" (Rus) interpretation of black holes that was common prior to the late mid-1960s. It was a mistake. Suppose you are distant and stationary relative to the black hole. You will observe infalling matter asymptotically approaching the horizon, growing ever fainter as it redshifts. Does it mean that matter ""clumps"" around the horizon? To find out, suppose you throw yourself towards the black hole to try to catch the matter that you see. What you will find is that it fell into the black hole long ago. In other words, the most sensible way to answer whether or not infalling matter clumps on the horizon is to look at the situation from the frame of that infalling matter. And there, it is clear: no, it does not clump, as it crosses the horizon in finite proper time. (As an aside, for a Schwarzschild black hole, falling from rest is exactly Newtonian in Schwarzschild radial coordinate and proper time.) The ""comoving viewpoint"" was recognized by Oppenheimer and Snyder in 1939, but it was not until the 1960s, with the work of Zel'dovich, Novikov, et al., that it was generally recognized as truly significant in the community. In 1965, Penrose introduced conformal diagrams based on the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates (1924/1958) that showed quite clearly that the stellar collapse is not slowed, but instead continues to a singularity. For an overview of the history of this change of viewpoint, cf. Kip Thorne, et al., The Memberane Paradigm (1986). These topics are commonly covered in many relativity textbooks. Ok, but since it still takes an infinite amount time in the frame adapted to a stationary distant observer, does that mean that the horizon never forms in that frame? It does form: the underlying assumption in the argument that it does not would be either that the infalling matter needs to reach the center for the horizon to form or cross a pre-existing horizon to make it expand. But that assumption is simply not true. An event horizon is defined in terms of future lightlike infinity, roughly speaking in terms of whether or not light rays escape if one waits an infinite amount of time. That means the location of the horizon at any time depends on not just what has happened, but also what will happen in the future. In the frame of the distant stationary observer, as matter falls towards the event horizon, it does slow down to asymptotically approach... but the horizon also expands to meet it. Similarly, the initial collapsing matter does not need to collapse all the way to the center for the event horizon to form. How can the finite life-time of the Black hole due to Hawking radiation be made consistant with the infinite amount of time (future) needed for the expansion of the event horizon (in the outer time-frame)?  There's no need to: [edit]that a particular time coordinate doesn't cover the full manifold is a fault of the coordinate chart, not of spacetime[/edit]. From every event, send out an omnidirectional locus of idealized light rays. The event horizon is the boundary of the spacetime region from which none of these light rays escape to infinity. This question has an objective answer--for any given light ray, either it will escape or it won't. An external observer would need to wait infinitely long to know for sure where the event horizon is exactly, but that's a completely different issue.  With Hawking radiation, the black hole shrinks, but it doesn't change the fact that light rays from some events will fail to escape, and thus that an event horizon will exist. Here's a Penrose diagram of a spherically collapsing star forming a black hole that subsequently evaporates:  Light rays run diagonally at ±45° on the diagram. Note that there is a region from which outgoing light rays (running diagonally lower-left to upper-right) don't escape and instead meet the $r = 0$ singularity (the bolded, undashed horizontal line). The horizon itself is the the $r = 2m$ line marked on the diagram and its extension into the star: it should actually go from the (dashed, vertical) $r = 0$ line on the left, rather than extending from the star's collapsing surface. That's because some of the (idealized, noninteracting) light rays from inside the star will also fail to escape to infinity. Now suppose that on this diagram you draw timelike curves that stubbornly stay away from the horizon, and you insist on using a parameter along them as a time coordinate. Does the fact that you've chosen coordinates that exclude the horizon needs to be made consistent with whether or not the event horizon actually exist? The resolution is simple: if you want to talk about the horizon, stop using coordinates that exclude it."
Is there any role today that would justify building a large single dish radio telescope to replace Arecibo?,"Arecibo wasn't just a radio telescope, it was a radar telescope, bouncing megawatt-level radio signals off various bodies in the Solar System.  A single-dish transmitter is far superior to a phased-array or other composite system, because the beam pattern is a simple Airy disk rather than a complicated pattern formed by tens or hundreds of such disks."
Does the Milky Way orbit around anything?,"The object which has less mass and gravitational pull orbits around the nearest object with more mass and gravitational pull. Actually, both the heavier and the lighter object orbit around their common center of mass. It's just that the heavier object doesn't move much (has a tiny orbit), while the lighter object moves a lot (has a wide orbit). E.g. our Sun actually orbits the center of mass of the whole solar system, but that motion is tiny, it barely budges. In the case of a double star, where both partners have about the same mass, you can clearly see how both are making similar orbits around their common mass center. Sun Orbits Around Sagittarius A* which us center of Milky Way. With galaxies, including ours, it's a little different. There is no super-heavy thing at the center, around which everything else is orbiting. Not even the very large black hole at the center of our galaxy is heavy enough for that. Rather, galaxies are clumps of matter that create a common gravitational field. Stars, and everything else, are trapped in this common field and orbit around the common center of mass. So the question is that is that is Milky Way is orbiting around some object or perhaps Black Hole. Same idea. There is no single point-object nearby massive enough for our galaxy to ""orbit"" around it. Our galaxy, along with Andromeda, and a handful of other galaxies, are bound together in what is known as the Local Group. Each galaxy is moving within the common gravitational field of the whole group. The Local Group has a diameter of about 10 million light-years. The Local Group is part of a larger structure, the Virgo Supercluster, which is about 100 million light-years in diameter and has at least 100 galaxies. However, the Virgo Supercluster is more ""loose"" - it is not gravitationally bound together."
How powerful a telescope would allow me to view the astronauts aboard ISS do a space-walk?,"This has been done before, so I don't have to go through all the heavy calculations using Rayleigh criterion accounting for atmospheric diffraction and visible light wavelength. Ralf Vandebergh, a Dutch astronomer, professional photographer and veteran satellite spotter has been busy trying to do exactly this since the 2007 and has indeed succeeded on several occasions by now using a 10 inch (25.4 cm) Newtonian reflecting telescope that has a resolving power (angular resolution on the CCD sensor) of roughly one pixel per meter at the distance to the International Space Station (ISS) that is currently in a 230 miles (370 km) orbit above the Earth:        Ralf Vandebergh’s detail of an image he took on Mar. 21, 2009 showing astronauts working outside the ISS. Credit: R. Vandebergh Vandebergh's personal page also hosts all kinds of other successful observations of the ISS through his telescope and recorded in both photographs as well as some short videos. Why short? Because targeting the ISS as it moves at the speed of 4.8 mi/s (7.7 km/s) is rather tricky, and the atmospheric conditions and times at which the ISS passes over some area on the surface of the Earth don't make it any easier either. But perseverance and hard work have paid well for this individual astronomer.                   Raw video of the ISS as seen through the air turbulence. Note the good visibility of the Lira antenna at the Russian          Zvezda Module in the lower part of the image. Credit: R. Vandebergh So again, skipping the math to calculate the required angular resolution of a telescope and apply that to some arbitrarily selected image sensor size and resolution, we can see that using a well collimated 10 inch Newtonian or a Dobsonian telescope on a clear night can, with some near perfect targeting, produce a direct proof of a spacewalker doing his or her job 230 miles (370 km) high during an EVA. More powerful telescopes would of course produce better resolution images, but the atmospheric effects limit their use and are of course much harder to target an object moving fast over the skies with."
Why does it take so long to transmit an image from New Horizons to Earth?,"New Horizons has just passed the Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) 2014 MU69 also known as Ultima Thule. KBOs form a belt of asteroids (the Kuiper Belt) from Neptune's orbit outwards and of which Pluto is the largest member of the Belt. During the encounter with Ultima Thule, all of the 7 instruments on New Horizons were gathering data (although not all at the same time) and the total data collected is expected to be about 50 gigabits of data (compared to 55 gigabits of data taken during the Pluto encounter in 2015). Since New Horizons is about another billion miles further out than Pluto was and 3 more years have elapsed, there is less power for the (tiny) transmitter and the signals are much weaker. The bit rate is about 1000 bits per second and so the 50 gigabits to transmit this will take 50e9 bits / 1000 bits per second = 50,000,000 seconds or about 579 days. Converting (roughly) to months by dividing by 365.25 and multiplying by 12 shows that it will indeed take about 19-20 months to transmit everything back. The first image at about 300 meters per pixel resolution and so about 100 pixels across the 30 km KBO, should be received on 2019 Jan 1. A second higher resolution image with about 300 pixels across the KBO is expected to be downloaded by 2019 Jan 2. There will be a press conference on 2019 Jan 2 when these images are due to be released and shown. (more details on what to expect when at Emily Lakdawalla's Planetary Society blog entry) After the initial data download, they expect to perform some analysis to see which images have the best data with 2014 MU69 in the frame. Given the uncertainty in the position of 2014 MU69 and the high speed of the encounter, they had to shoot strips of images and not all will contain the target. These data will be prioritized in the downlink so they arrive on the ground first and can be analyzed first. As mentioned by @luis-g there is also the Solar conjunction which will cause a 5 day period (according to PI Alan Stern in the 2019 Jan 3 press briefing) when reception of the data won't be possible. We would expect this to re-occur in January 2020 but these approx. 10 days don't make a large difference to the time taken which is dominated by the weakness of the received signal after the 15W transmission travels the ~4 billion miles and falls off due to the inverse square law, the corresponding low bitrate allowed by the need to have the transmitted data decodeable and the amount of data to transfer."
What is in the center of the universe?,"I think your question is on topic, but @RhysW has linked a very helpful post in understanding why your question is a common misconception about the Big Bang. No Center There is no 'center' to the universe. At any point, a local observer will claim that they are at the center of the universe by the way galaxies move away from them. How can we possibly know this? The universe appears to be both homogeneous (has the same structure everywhere) and isotropic (there is no preferred direction). If these are indeed properties of the universe, then the expansion of the universe must be the same at all other locations (See: The cosmological principle). How the Big Bang and Explosions Differ Additionally, the Big Bang is different from an explosion in the following ways: 1) Particles involved in an explosion slow down eventually due to frictional forces. Think of fireworks (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn_tkJDFG3s). Particles are moving the fastest at the instant of explosion, and slow monotonically with time. The expansion of the early universe does not follow this trend, though sometimes people use the word 'explosion' to describe the enormous volumetric increase (an increase by a factor of $\sim10^{76}$) which occurred between $10^{-36}- 10^{-32}$ seconds after the Big Bang, which is aptly named inflation.    2) An explosion implies the existence of space. For an explosion to take place, particles (whether we're talking about matter or light) must have space to explode into. Strictly speaking the inflation of the universe is an expansion of space-time coordinates, and so the word explosion cannot really apply since there was nothing for space-time to explode into.   "
"Is there a better explanation of this picture showing the very distant star ""Earendel""?","I did the annotation of that figure for the press release, so let me start by apologizing for the poor explanation, and then try to dig deeper into what's going on :) (although you already seem to pretty much get it right). The big orange galaxies all belong to a foreground cluster called WHL0137-08. For known point masses, there is an analytical solution to how exactly the mass deflects and magnifies light from background sources, but galaxies are not points, and we don't know their exact masses. Nevertheless, based on the observed distribution of light, assumed stellar mass-to-light ratios and stellar mass-dark matter halo mass relations, as well as assumed halo density profiles, we can estimate numerically how light from a background source travels through/around the cluster, and hence how it's magnified. This is called a lens model, and because of these not always too well-constrained assumptions, there are quite a few different models. This is why the mass of Earendel is only constrained to within an order of magnitude, namely 50–500 $M_\odot$. A lens model thus returns a magnification factor for each 2D point in the vicinity of the cluster. In certain regions called ""caustic lines"", or just caustics, which lie along 1D lines, the magnification increases tremendously (in principle to infinity). In the picture you see such a caustic, drawn in red. It bends smoothly around a handful of galaxies in the upper left corner, but where it comes close to the galaxy a little below the center, it bends around that one. The reason we're able to see Earendel is that it happens to lie almost exactly on top of the caustic. Figure 2 from the paper (which isn't yet available online, but I think it's ok to share here with proper credits) showing the caustics predicted from four different lens models: 
Credit: NASA, ESA, Brian Welch (JHU), Dan Coe (STScI). The red curve that I used in the image you post is the ""Light-Traces-Mass model"" (LTM; Zitrin et al. 2015). To understand the effect of the uncertainties in the model, the posterior distribution was sampled and used to generate critical curves from each resultant parameter set. Those are the thin brown lines close to the red. In 80/100 of such model runs, Earendel is within 0.1 arcsec of the line, with a maximum of 0.4"". If an objects lies close to, but not on top of, a caustic, its light will be bent around it and reach us from two different directions. Close to Earendel lies a small star cluster (called ""1.1"" in the paper). Because of the way the caustic bends, 1.1 is mirrored not twice but three times, indicated in cyan. In fact there's a second star cluster called ""1.7"" that I didn't mark, to keep it simple, but you see it as slightly enhanced dots of light along the red arc. So, what is that red arc? That's the host galaxy — called WHL0137-zD1, but nicknamed the ""Sunrise Arc"" — of both the star clusters and Earendel. This is a typical feature of gravitational lenses, distorting background galaxies to banana-shaped arcs along directions which are more or less tangential to the cluster. In fact, the Sunrise Arc is one of the longest known, being 15 arcseconds long. The term ""magnification"", usually denoted $\mu$, is used both for the increase in area and the increase in brightness. Usually, if you zoom in on an image of some object, the brightness is conserved so the surface brightness decreases. But with lensing, surface brightness is conserved, so the total brightness increases. Stars are much too small to be spatially resolved by our telescopes, however, so they are seen as point sources. In principle their sizes do increase when they're lensed, and in principle they may also be elongated, but they are so small that they're still way below our resolution, and will always be seen as point sources. Hence, for stars the magnification just refers to the increase in brightness. If Earendel is 10× the diameter of our Sun, its angular extent seen by us would be $\sim10^{-10}\,\mathrm{arcsec}$. Even if Earendel is magnified $10^5$ times — the estimated maximum according to the lens models — it's still of the order of ten microarcsec, unresolvable by both Hubble and James Webb. This resolution is actually within reach for interferometry, but that would require Earendel to be bright in the much longer wavelengths required for that technique, which it isn't."
Two species of dark matter?,"Hot dark matter would be made from very light, fast moving particles. Such particles could not possibly be gravitationally bound to any structure, but rather would be dispersed all across the universe. But dark matter is always ""found"" (or ""inferred"") either gravitationally bound to some visible structure (e.g. weak lensing detection of dark matter associated with colliding galaxy clusters / flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies / abnormal velocity dispersion in galaxy clusters) or not associated to anything visible but nevertheless forming clumps (weak lensing detection of galaxy clusters previously unseen). That is why dark matter is thought to be cold. Additionally, there is a clear distinction between both types: there is not such thing as dark matter that is ""not too cold but not too hot either"" (see footnote as well). Dark matter is either made of particles with less than ~10 eV (hot dark matter, made of light particles, mostly dispersed everywhere) or particles with more than ~2 GeV (heavier, slower particles gravitationally bound to some structure). Both limits are found when imposing the maximum amount in which the candidate particles (neutrinos or something more exotic) can possibly contribute to the actual value of the density parameter due to matter in our expaning Universe. Thus, either DM appears gravitationally bound (cold DM) or dispersed (hot DM), and both types are clearly distinct (10 ev vs 2 Gev). Observations favour the first case. However, Cold Dark Matter is not the ultimate solution, and still faces some problems. Regarding the possibility of mixed solutions, many of them have been already ruled out. Microlensing has ruled out the possibility of unseen compact objects (brown dwarfs, stars, stellar black holes) in galactic halos, in our galactic neighbourhood as well as in the extragalactic domain. Ordinary matter (stones, bricks, dust) cannot possibly be, otherwise they would become hot and re-radiate. Any exotic mix of known particles doesn't work. All we think we know is that DM must be made of some heavy particles yet to be discovered. In order to introduce a more complex model (e.g. different types of particles depending on the structure they appear attached to) one needs a justification (i.e. some predictions that better agree with reality) and nobody has been able to do that yet. Remark Note that Dark Matter particles, either from the hot or the cold type, cannot possibly ""slow down"" and clump too much (e.g. forming planets) because they don't interact electromagnetically like ordinary matter, that is why DM is said to be collisionless. Wherever infalling ordinary matter forms any structure (e.g. protostars or accretion disks), a very important part of the process is thermalisation, i.e. the redistribution of energy of the infalling particles by means of numerous collisions. This cannot happen with Dark Matter."
Why do Black Holes in the middle of galaxies not suck up the whole galaxy?,"You shouldn't think of black holes as ""sucking things in"". Black holes interact with matter through gravity, just the same as any other object. Think of our Solar System. All the planets orbit around the sun because it has a lot of mass. Since the planets have some lateral motion (they're not moving directly towards or away from the sun), they circle around it. This is known as conservation of angular momentum. When talking about gravity, all that matters is the mass of the objects involved. It doesn't really matter what kind of object it is*. If you were to replace the sun with a black hole that had the same mass as our sun, the planets would continue on the exact same orbits as before. Now, the black holes at the centers of most spiral galaxies do accumulate mass. Some of these black holes have accretion disks around them. These are swirling disks of gas and dust that is slowly falling into the black hole. These gas and dust particles lose their angular momentum through interactions with gas and dust nearby and by radiating energy as heat. Some of these black holes have very large accretion disks, and can generate huge amounts of electromagnetic radiation. These are known as active galactic nuclei. So, long story short, black holes don't ""suck"". They just interact with things gravitationally. Stars, gas, and other matter in the galaxy has angular momentum, so it stays in orbit around the center of the galaxy. It doesn't just fall straight in. This is the same reason the Earth orbits around the Sun.  *Disclaimer: When you talk about things like tidal forces, you do need to take into account the size of the objects. But for orbital mechanics, we don't need to worry about it because the distances between the objects are generally much larger than the objects themselves."
Is the Solar core hard?,"The solar core can be considered soft in a relative sense (compared to other materials at the same density), but hard and incompressible in an absolute sense. The material behaves almost exactly like a perfect gas but would be as viscous as ketchup. The equation of state is that of a perfect monatomic gas and thus the pressure $P \propto \rho^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha \sim 4/3$ in the solar core, where heat transport is dominated by radiative diffusion. This is a ""soft equation of state"" - the material is highly compressible - it takes a small fractional increase in pressure to produce a compression. For most solids, $\alpha$ would be in double figures and they are approximately incompressible. However, what you are asking about could be represented by the ""bulk modulus"" (Young's modulus and Shear modulus are not meaningfully defined for a fluid). This is roughly equal to the pressure of a gas and is a measure of how much force in an absolute sense is required to change the volume of something. At the centre of the Sun, this is $2\times 10^{16}$ Pa. This can be compared with the bulk modulus of diamond which is $4\times 10^{11}$ Pa. Thus in that sense, the solar core is much harder than a diamond to compress. In terms of viscosity, the microscopic kinematic viscosity in the solar core is of order $10^{-4}$ m$^2$/s (Ruediger & Kitchatinov 1996) and hence a dynamic viscosity of 15 Pa s. For comparison, the kinematic viscosity of water at 293K is $10^{-6}$ m$^2$/s and the dynamic viscosity is  $10^{-3}$ Pa s. Thus the solar interior fluid is 100-10000 times more viscous than water, depending on how viscosity is defined. Fluids of comparable viscosity would be honey or ketchup. The viscosity of solids (like rocks) meanwhile, is of order $\sim 10^{20}$ Pa s. To understand why the Sun behaves like a perfect gas, one must compare the interaction energies between the particles with their kinetic energies. At a density of 150000 kg/m$^3$ the mean separation of protons and electrons is $\sim 2\times 10^{-11}$ m, with a mutual Coulomb energy of about 100 eV. The kinetic energy of the particles is $3k_BT/2$, and with temperature $T \sim 1.5\times 10^7$ K in the solar core, this is about 1000 eV. Thus the kinetic energies are much greater than the Coulombic binding energies and so the particles behave like a gas. To ""freeze"" into a solid you would need the binding energy to be about 100 times the kinetic energy, which would require much higher densities at that temperature."
"Is it possible to achieve a stable ""selenostationary"" orbit around the Moon?","First off, such an orbit wouldn't be a geostationary orbit since geo- refers to the Earth. A more appropriate name would be lunarstationary or selenostationary. I'm not sure if there is an officially accepted term since you rarely hear people talk about such an orbit. You can calculate the orbital distance of a selenostationary orbit using Kepler's law: $$a = \left(\frac{P^2GM_{\text{Moon}}}{4\pi^2}\right)^{1/3}$$ In this case, $a$ is your orbital distance of interest, $P$ is the orbital period (which we know to be 27.321 days or 2360534 seconds), $G$ is just the gravitational constant, and hopefully it is obvious that $M_{\text{Moon}}$ is the mass of the Moon. All we have to do is plug in numbers. I find that $$a = 88,417\:\mathrm{km}=0.23\:\mathrm{Earth\mathit{-}Moon\:Distance}$$ So I at least match your calculation pretty well. I think you were just relying on Wolfram Alpha a bit too much to get the units right. The units do work out right though. If you want to determine if this orbit can exist however, you need to do a bit more work. As a first step, calculate the Moon's Hill Sphere. This is the radius at which the Moon still maintains control over it's satellite, without the Earth causing problems. The equation for this radius is given by $$r \approx a_{\text{Moon}}(1-e_{\text{Moon}})\sqrt[3]{\frac{M_{\text{Moon}}}{3M_{\text{Earth}}}}$$ In this equation, $a_{\text{Moon}} = 348,399\:\mathrm{km}$ is the Moon's semi-major axis around the Earth and $e_{\text{Moon}} = 0.0549$ is the Moon's orbital eccentricity. I'm sure you can figure out that the $M$'s are the masses of the respective bodies. Just plug and chug and you get $$r \approx 52,700\:\mathrm{km}$$ A more careful calculation, including the effects of the Sun is slightly more optimistic and provides a Hill radius of $r = 58,050\:\mathrm{km}$. In either case though, hopefully you can see that the radius for a selenostationary orbit is much farther than the Hill radius, meaning that no stable orbit can be achieved as it would be too much perturbed by the Earth and/or the Sun. One final, semi-related point. It turns out almost no orbits around the Moon are stable, even if they're inside the Hill radius. This is primarily to do with mass concentrations (or mascons) in the Moon's crust and mantle which make the gravitational field non-uniform and act to degrade orbits. There are only a handful of ""stable"" orbits and these are only achieved by orbiting in such a way as to miss passing over these mascons."
"If Earth is tilted, why is Polaris always above the same spot?","You are correct that the axis of the Earth's rotation is tilted with respect to the plane of its orbit by 23 degrees. But it is incorrect that the direction that the axis points changes by a large amount (it should be 2*23 degrees) over a 6 month time span.  Your assumption: If axis it pointed at Polaris at (1), then it should be pointed at a different star at (2). The axis remains pointed in the same direction throughout the entire year because the laws of physics are that the axis of a spinning object remains pointed in the same direction unless a torque acts on the body to change its orientation. There are torques acting on the Earth (namely the Sun and Moon), but it takes 13000 years to change the direction from ""one way to the opposite way"", not 6 months.  Correct: The orientation of the Earth's spin axis remains pointed at the same star throughout the year (ignoring the slow, 26000 year precession cycle)."
Where does the Solar System end?,"According to the Case Western Reserve University webpage The Edge of the Solar System (2006) an important consideration is that The whole concept of an ""edge"" is somewhat inaccurate as far as the solar system is concerned, for there is no physical boundary to it - there is no wall past which there's a sign that says, ""Solar System Ends Here."" There are, however, specific regions of space that include outlying members of our solar system, and a region beyond-which the Sun can no longer hold any influence. The last part of that definition appears to be a viable definition of the edge of the solar system.  Specifically, valid boundary region for the ""edge"" of the solar system is the heliopause. This is the region of space where the sun's solar wind meets that of other stars. It is a fluctuating boundary that is estimated to be approximately 17.6 billion miles (120 A.U.) away. Note that this is within the Oort Cloud. Though the article above is a bit dated, the notion of the heliopause has been still of interest to scientists, particularly how far away it is - hence, the interest in the continuing Voyager missions, which states on the website, that it has 3 phases: Passage through the termination shock ended the termination shock phase and began the heliosheath exploration phase. Voyager 1 crossed the termination shock at 94 AU in December 2004 and Voyager 2 crossed at 84 AU in August 2007. (AU = Astronomical Unit = mean Earth-sun distance = 150,000,000km) the spacecraft has been operating in the heliosheath environment which is still dominated by the Sun's magnetic field and particles contained in the solar wind. As of September 2013, Voyager 1 was at a distance of 18.7 Billion Kilometers (125.3 AU) from the sun and Voyager 2 at a distance of 15.3 Billion kilometers (102.6 AU). A very important thing to note from the Voyager page is that The thickness of the heliosheath is uncertain and could be tens of AU thick taking several years to traverse. Passage through the heliopause begins the interstellar exploration phase with the spacecraft operating in an interstellar wind dominated environment. The Voyager mission page provide the follow diagram of the parameters listed above  It is a bit complicated as we do not know the full extent of what the dynamics are like out there, a recent observation reported in the article A big surprise from the edge of the Solar System, reveal that the edge may be blurred by a strange realm of frothy magnetic bubbles, Which is suggested in the article could be a mixing of solar and interstellar winds and magnetic fields, stating: On one hand, the bubbles would seem to be a very porous shield, allowing many cosmic rays through the gaps. On the other hand, cosmic rays could get trapped inside the bubbles, which would make the froth a very good shield indeed."
Why is Mars cold?,"Firstly, Mars has a mean distance from the Sun of 1.524 AU, so by the inverse square law the energy it gets from the Sun is about 40% of what the Earth gets. But the main reason that Mars is so cold is that its atmosphere is very thin compared to Earth's (as well as very dry, see below). From Wikipedia Atmosphere of Mars: The atmosphere of Mars is much thinner than Earth's. The surface pressure is only about 610 pascals (0.088 psi) which is less than 1% of the Earth's value. In comparison, the mean surface pressure on Earth is 101,300 pascals. So the atmosphere of Mars is barely more than a vacuum compared to Earth's. So even though the Martian atmosphere is over 95% carbon dioxide, there simply isn't enough of it to trap much heat.  Although carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, the predominant greenhouse gas on Earth is actually water vapour. However, water is usually cycled in and out of the atmosphere very quickly in response to temperature and pressure changes. Carbon dioxide is a problem because it stays in the atmosphere for a long time, and its presence shifts the equilibrium temperature upwards from that of the plain water cycle."
Why is Gaia operating around Earth orbit? Why not send it to Neptune's orbit?,"Well, you thought about the spatial aspect of a parallax measurement, but not about the temporal one. Gaia's intention is to measure 3D positions as well as 3D velocities. For the distance, you need accurate parallactic measurement, which come in with your orbital period.
For a typical Gaia-star with several measurement per year, you'll get 5 values of the parallax after 5 years of time, which you then average. If you'd send Gaia towards Neptune (besides the fact that no one has ever sent an orbiter, to say nothing of a L2 mission that far out) that has a period of 168 years, then after 5 years you'd get... 5/168 th of one paralactic measurement. It simply couldn't achieve its science goals if put around the L2 behind Neptune. Also no one on this planet has any experience in putting something into a outer system L2 point. This is different than putting it into Earth's L2, because reaching the L2 around one of the giants has vast and very precise $\Delta v$ requirements. This would be a massive technological leap, and things don't work that way in space. Small, incremental technological steps are required in an anyways unfriendly environment, to make sure everything works properly and no millions of dollars have been wasted.
Compare that to Gaia's predecessor, the Hipparcos satellite, which was parked in geostationary orbit. Now you could still say, why not use Jupiter hypothetically anyways. Well, the orbital period there is still 11 years, and Jupiter's L2 still suffers from the intense radiation environment that is provided by Jupiter's magnetosphere. This would lead to rapid degradation of the CCDs used for scanning across the sky."
"Why does the Sun have different day lengths, but not the gas giants?","It's a matter of how ""day"" is defined. Wikipedia's article on Jupiter cites this IAU/IAG paper for the length of a Jupiter day.  In it, footnote (e) of table I has the following: The equations for W for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune refer to the rotation of their magnetic fields (System III) The radio emissions of the gas giants have well-defined periodic variations.  These variations are caused by the rotation of the magnetic fields of those planets, and are evidence that they have a reasonably coherent core of some sort that's rotating at a uniform speed.  The periodic variations then represent the rotation speed of that object, which is taken as the rotation speed of the planet. We're reasonably certain the Sun doesn't have a coherent core.  Measuring the variation of the magnetic field doesn't show a well-defined period, and doesn't provide a useful definition of the Sun's rotation speed. "
How can 'HD 140283' be older than the universe?,"It's not - the current age is an estimate. The discrepancy comes from astronomer's attempts to fully and correctly measure aspects of the star, particularly its distance.  From the NASA page: The new Hubble age estimates reduce the range of measurement uncertainty, so that the star's age overlaps with the universe's age — as independently determined by the rate of expansion of space, an analysis of the microwave background from the big bang, and measurements of radioactive decay. Currently, if you take the uncertainty into account, the current estimate for the star's age is 14.5 +/- 0.8 billion years  or between 15.3 and 13.7 billion years - the latter end of the estimate overlaps with the current model of the age of the Universe - so a more correct way of describing this age is that HD 140283 is at least 13.7 billion years old by this estimation. Another paper based on this star in Nature - ""Nearby star is almost as old as the Universe"", a team has narrowed down the age to 13.9 +/- 0.7 billion years, stating that: Taking into account that experimental error, the age does not conflict with the age of the Universe, 13.77 billion years.  more concisely stating that The star's age is therefore at least 13.2 billion years No doubt further work is being performed to further refine the age of the star."
Does the sun cross other spiral arms in its movement around the galaxy's center?,"The reason that the Sun, in principle (but see below), may cross spiral arms is that galactic spiral arms are not rigid entities consisting of some particular stars; rather they are ""waves"" with a temporary increase in density. An often-used analogy is the pile-up of cars behind a slow-moving truck: At all times, all cars are moving forward, but for a while, a car behind the truck will be moving slow, until it overtakes and speeds up. Similarly, stars may overtake, or be overtaken by, the spiral arms. Inside a certain distance from the center of the galaxy called the corotation radius ($R_\mathrm{c}$) stars move faster than the arms, while outside they move slower. Since the stars and the interstellar gas follow the rotation of the arms for a while once they're inside, the density of the arms is higher than outside, but only by a factor of a few (e.g. 
Rix & Rieke 1993). When interstellar gas falls into the potential well it is compressed, triggering star formation. Since the most luminous stars burn their fuel fast, they will mostly have died once they leave an arm. Hence, what we see as spiral arms is not so much the extra stars, but mostly due to the light from the youngest stars which are still inside the arms. Since most luminous also means hottest, their light peaks in the bluish region — hence spiral arms appear blue. At least the most prominent spiral arms (especially grand designs) are thought to be created by these long-lived, quasi-stationary density waves (Lin & Shu 1964). The reason that the density waves exist in the first place is not well-understood, I think, but may have to do with anisotropic gravitational potentials and/or tidal forces from nearby galaxies (e.g. Semczuk et al. 2017). But in fact even small perturbations may spawn gravitational instabilities that propagate as density waves. In computer simulations of galaxy formation, even numerical instabilities may cause this, so the fact that your simulated galaxy has spiral arms doesn't necessarily mean that you got your physics right. When the luminous and hence massive stars die, they explode as supernovae. The feedback from this process, as well as that exerted by the radiation pressure before they die, may help maintaining the density waves, at least in flocculent galaxies (Mueller & Arnett 1972). Perhaps this so-called Stochastic Self-Propagating Star Formation may also initiate the density waves (see discussion in Aschwanden et al. 2018). The rotation speed of the material in the galactic disk is roughly constant with distance from the center (this is mainly due to the dark matter halo hosting a galaxy). Hence, stars close to the center complete a revolution faster than those farther away. In contrast, the spiral pattern rotate more like a rigid disk such that, in an intertial frame, the pattern can be described by a constant angular speed $\Omega_\mathrm{p}$ throughout the disk. However, note that spiral arms are transient phenomena; they appear and disappear with lifetimes of the order of (a few) Myr (e.g. Grand et al. 2012; 2014). Sometimes you also see multiple spiral patterns propagating with different velocities. Note: This section first contained errors based on dubious values for the angular speed of the spiral arms, as pointed out by @PeterErwin and @eagle275. In the case of our Sun, we happen to be located very near the corotational radius $R_\mathrm{c}$; we sit at a distance of $R_0 = 8.32\,\mathrm{kpc}$ from the center of the galaxy (Gillessen et al. 2017), while
$R_\mathrm{c} = 8.51\,\mathrm{kpc}$ (Dias et al. 2019). Using Gaia data, Dias et al. (2019) find a pattern angular speed $\Omega_\mathrm{p} = 28.2 \pm 2.1\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-1}$. At the location of the Sun ($R_0$) this implies a pattern speed of $\simeq235\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This is only a little bit slower than (and in fact statistically consistent with) the Sun's velocity of $239\pm5\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ (Planck Collaboration et al. 2018). If the spiral arms were ""permanent""*, the timescale for the Sun crossing an arm would hence be gigayears. However, because as described above they're quite transient, we might once in a while overtake a spiral arm. I haven't been able to find firm evidence for whether we have or haven't crossed any arms; Gies & Helsel (2005) argue that we have crossed an arm four times within the last 500 Myr, but base this on matching glaciation epochs with passages through spiral arms (and admit that this requires a lower but still acceptable pattern speed). I now wrote to Jesse Christiansen (who the linked article quotes) and asked her if she knows whether or not we are moving in and out of spiral arms; she replied within roughly 8 seconds, tagging Karen Masters who chimed in even faster — they both agree that this is an ongoing debate with no conclusive evidence. Anyway, the article seems to have misunderstood the tweet from Jesse Christiansen. In her animation she shows the journey of the Sun, but shows the galaxy itself as being static, which she did on purpose to keep it simple. Hence, you see the Sun traversing the arms unnaturally fast."
Shouldn't very very distant objects appear magnified?,"Yes.  And they are!  This is called the ""Angular diameter distance turnaround"" (or turnover). In the usual model for expansion $\Lambda CDM$, it is at a redshift of about 1.5 or about 15 billion light-years (corresponding to a light travel time of about 10 billion years, or about 4 billion years after the big bang, the distance is greater due to the expansion of space) I'm using rounded values here, because the actual distance is quite sensitive to the exact parameters of expansion. A galaxy from 400 million years after the big bang (a distance of 32 billion light-years) would look as big as a galaxy that is 2.7 billion light-years away. (These figures from Ned Wright's calculator) It's illustrated in this xkcd comic.  You can see nearby ""galaxies"" are large and bright, more distant galaxies are smaller, very distant galaxies are large, dim, and red.

How does a neutron star collapse into a black hole?,"A neutron star must have a minimum mass of at least 1.4x solar masses (that is, 1.4x mass of our Sun) in order to become a neutron star in the first place.
See Chandrasekhar limit on wikipedia for details. A neutron star is formed during a supernova, an explosion of a star that is at least 8 solar masses. The maximum mass of a neutron star is 3 solar masses. If it gets more massive than that, then it will collapse into a quark star, and then into a black hole. We know that 1 electron + 1 proton = 1 neutron; 1 neutron = 3 quarks = up quark + down quark + down quark; 1 proton = 3 quarks = up quark + up quark + down quark; A supernova results in either a neutron star (between 1.4 and 3 solar masses), a quark star(about 3 solar masses), or a black hole(greater than 3 solar masses), which is the remaining collapsed core of the star. During a supernova, most of the stellar mass is blown off into space, forming elements heavier than iron which cannot be generated through stellar nucleosynthesis, because beyond iron, the star requires more energy to fuse the atoms than it gets back. During the supernova collapse, the atoms in the core break up into electrons, protons and neutrons. In the case that the supernova results in a neutron star core, the electrons and protons in the core are merged to become neutrons, so the newly born 20-km-diameter neutron star containing between 1.4 and 3 solar masses is like a giant atomic nucleus containing only neutrons. If the neutron star's mass is then increased, neutrons become degenerate, breaking up into their constituent quarks, thus the star becomes a quark star; a further increase in mass results in a black hole. The upper/lower mass limit for a quark star is not known (or at least I couldn't find it), in any case, it is a narrow band around 3 solar masses, which is the minimum stable mass of a black hole. When you talk about a black hole with a stable mass (at least 3 solar masses), it is good to consider that they come in 4 flavors: rotating-charged, rotating-uncharged, non-rotating-charged, non-rotating-uncharged. What we would see visually during the transformation would be a hard radiation flash.
This is because during the collapse, the particles on/near the surface have time to emit hard radiation as they break up before going into the event horizon; so this could be one of the causes of gamma ray bursts (GRBs). We know that atoms break up into protons, neutrons, electrons under pressure. Under more pressure, protons and electrons combine into neutrons. Under even more pressure, neutrons break down into quarks. Under still more pressure, perhaps quarks break down into still smaller particles. Ultimately the smallest particle is a string: open or closed loop, and has a Planck length, which is many orders of magnitude smaller than a quark. if a string is magnified so it is 1 millimeter in length, then a proton would have a diameter that would fit snugly between the Sun and Epsilon Eridani, 10.5 light years away; that's how big a proton is compared to a string, so you can imagine there are perhaps quite a few intermediate things between quarks and strings. Currently it looks like several more decades will be needed to figure out all the math in string theory, and if there is anything smaller than strings then a new theory will be required, but so far string theory looks good; see the book Elegant Universe by Brian Greene. A string is pure energy and Einstein said mass is just a form of energy, so the collapse into a black hole really breaks down the structure of energy that gives the appearance of mass/matter/baryonic particles, and leaves the mass in its most simple form, open or closed strings, that is, pure energy bound by gravity. We know that black holes (which are not really holes or singularities, as they do have mass, radius, rotation, charge and hence density, which varies with radius) can evaporate, giving up their entire mass in the form of radiation, thus proving they are actually energy. Evaporation of a black hole occurs if its mass is below the minimum mass of a stable black hole, which is 3 solar masses; the Schwarzschild radius equation even tells you what the radius of a black hole is given its mass, and vice versa. So you could transform anything you want, such as your pencil, into a black hole if you wanted to, and could compress it into the required size for it to become a black hole; it is just that it would immediately transform itself (evaporate) completely into a flash of hard radiation, because a pencil is less than the stable black hole mass (3 solar masses). This is why the CERN experiment could never have created a black hole to swallow the Earth - a subatomic black hole, even one with the mass of the entire Earth, or the Sun, would evaporate before swallowing anything; there is not enough mass in our solar system to make a stable (3 solar mass) black hole. A simple way for a neutron star to become more massive in order to be able to turn into a black hole is to be part of a binary system, where it is close enough to another star that the neutron star and its binary pair orbit each other, and the neutron star siphons off gas from the other star, thus gaining mass.  Here is a nice drawing showing exactly that. Matter falling into a black hole is accelerated toward light speed. As it is accelerated, the matter breaks down into subatomic particles and hard radiation, that is, X-rays and gamma rays. A black hole itself is not visible, but the light from infalling matter that is accelerated and broken up into particles is visible. Black holes can also cause a gravitational lens effect on the light of background stars/galaxies."
How do we have photos of galaxies so far away?,"There are two reasons that often — but not always — light from galaxies millions and even billions of lightyears away make it through the Universe and down to us: First, the intergalactic medium (IGM) is extremely dilute. The number density of particles out there is of the order $n\sim10^{-7}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, or roughly 26 orders of magnitude lower that the air at sea level! That means that if you consider a tube from Andromeda to the Milky Way with cross-sectional area of $1\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, it will contain roughly one microgram of matter (thanks to Rob Jeffries for catching a factor $10^6$ error). Second, even if a photon comes close to an atom, it will only be absorbed if its energy matches closely some transition in the atom. Since most of the atoms are ionized (and thus should be called plasma instead, but in astronomy the distinction if often not made), there are no electrons to absorb the photon. The photons are more likely to interact with the free electrons via Thomson scattering, but the Thomson cross section is immensely small $(\sim10^{-24}\,\mathrm{cm}^{2})$, so even if you consider the CMB photons — which have traveled through the Universe almost since the Big Bang — only around 5% of them have interacted with electrons on their way. In other words: The amount of transmitted light depends on two factors: 1) The amount of matter along the line of sight, and 2) that matter's ability to absorb the light. In the IGM, both are tremendously small. When the light enters the interstellar medium (ISM) inside our galaxy, it may encounter denser clouds with atoms that are able to absorb the light. But usually (although not always) ""dense"" is still very dilute compared to Earth's atmosphere. In general, if a beam of light traverses a region of particles, each with a cross section $\sigma$ (measured e.g. in cm$^2$), passing $N$ particles per area of the beam (measured e.g. in cm$^{-2}$), then the opacity of the medium is given by the optical depth $\tau$, defined by
$$
\tau \equiv N \, \sigma.
$$
The transmitted fraction $f$ of photons is then
$$
f = e^{-\tau}.
$$
In general $\sigma$ depends on the wavelength, and thus part of the spectrum may pass unhindered, while another part may be completely absorbed. The figure below (from here) shows the spectrum of a quasar lying at a distance of 22 billion lightyears, i.e. $10\,000$ times farther away than Andromeda. You see that there are several thin absorption lines (caused by intervening hydrogen clouds whose densities are a factor of 10-100 higher than the IGM), but still most of the light makes it down to us.  Because the light we see from this quasar was emitted so long ago, the Universe was considerably smaller at that time, and thus the density was larger. Nonetheless, only a small fraction is absorbed. The farther away the light is emitted, the longer ago it was, which means smaller Universe, and higher density, and thus the more light is absorbed. If you consider this quasar (from here) which lies 27 billion lightyears away, you see that much more light is absorbed in part of the spectrum. Still, however, much light make it through to us.  The reason that it is only the short wavelengths that are absorbed is quite interesting — but that's another story."
How do we know that black holes are spinning?,"The gravitational field of spinning matter, or a spinning black hole, causes matter around it to start spinning. This is called ""frame dragging"" or ""gravitomagnetism"", the latter name coming from the fact that it's closely analogous to the magnetic effect of moving electric charges. The existence of gravitomagnetism is tied to the finite speed of gravity, so it doesn't exist in Newtonian gravity where that speed is infinite, but it's present in general relativity, and for black holes it's large enough to be detectable. Also, for purely theoretical reasons we expect that all black holes are spinning because a non-spinning black hole is the same as a spinning black hole with an angular velocity of exactly zero, and there's no reason why a black hole's angular velocity would be exactly zero. On the contrary, because they are so much smaller than the matter that collapses to produce them, even a small, random net angular momentum of the collapsing matter should lead to a rapidly spinning black hole. (The classic analogy for this is an ice skater spinning faster when they pull their arms in.)"
How large can a ball of water be without fusion starting?,"You really need a full-blown stellar evolution model to answer this precisely and I'm not sure anyone would ever have done this with an oxygen-dominated star. To zeroth order the answer will be the similar to a metal-rich star - i.e. about 0.075 times the mass of the Sun. Any less than this and the brown dwarf (for that is what we call a star that never gets hot enough at its centre to initiate significant fusion) can be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. A star/brown dwarf with the composition you suggest would be a bit different.  The composition would be thoroughly and homogeneously mixed by convection. Note that other than a thin layer near the surface, the water would be completely dissociated and the hydrogen and oxygen atoms completely ionised. Hence the density of protons in the core would be lower for the same mass density than in a ""normal star"".  However, the temperature dependence is so steep I think this would be a minor factor and nuclear fusion would be significant at a similar temperature. Of much greater importance is that there would be fewer electrons and fewer particles at the same density. This decreases both the electron degeneracy pressure and normal gas pressure at a given mass density.
The star is therefore able to contract to much smaller radii before degeneracy pressure becomes important and can thus reach higher temperatures for the same mass as a result. For that reason I think that the minimum mass for hydrogen fusion of a ""water star"" would be smaller than for a star made mainly of hydrogen. But how much smaller? Back-of-the-envelope time! Use the virial theorem to get a relationship between perfect gas pressure and the temperature, mass and radius of a star. Let gravitational potential energy be $\Omega$, then the virial theorem says $$ \Omega = -3 \int P \ dV$$ If we only have a perfect gas then $P = \rho kT/\mu m_u$, where $T$ is the temperature, $\rho$ the mass density, $m_u$ an atomic mass unit and $\mu$ the average number of mass units per particle in the gas. Assuming a constant density star (back of the envelope) then $dV = dM/\rho$, where $dM$ is a mass shell and $\Omega = -3GM^2/5R$, where $R$ is the ""stellar"" radius. Thus
$$\frac{GM^2}{5R} = \frac{kT}{\mu m_u} \int dM$$
$$ T = \frac{GM \mu m_u}{5k R}$$
and so the central temperature $T \propto \mu MR^{-1}$. Now what we do is say that the star contracts until at this temperature, the phase space occupied by its electrons is $\sim h^3$ and electron degeneracy becomes important. A standard treatment of this is to say that the physical volume occupied by an electron is $1/n_e$, where $n_e$ is the electron number density and that the momentum volume occupied is $\sim (6m_e kT)^{3/2}$. The electron number density is related to the mass density by $n_e = \rho /\mu_e m_u$, where $\mu_e$ is the number of mass units per electron. For ionised hydrogen $\mu_e=1$, but for oxygen $\mu_e=2$ (all the gas would be ionised near the temperatures for nuclear fusion). The average density $\rho = 3M/4\pi R^3$. Putting these things together we get
$$h^3 = \frac{ (6m_e kT)^{3/2}}{n_e} = \frac{4\pi \mu_e}{3}\left(\frac{6 \mu}{5}\right)^{3/2} (Gm_e R)^{3/2} m_u^{5/2} M^{1/2}$$
Thus the radius to which the star contracts in order for degeneracy pressure to be important is
$$ R \propto \mu_e^{-2/3} \mu^{-1} M^{-1/3}$$ If we now substitute this into the expression for central temperature, we find
$$ T \propto \mu M \mu_e^{2/3} \mu M^{1/3} \propto \mu^2 \mu_e^{2/3} M^{4/3}$$ Finally, if we argue that the temperature for fusion is the same in a ""normal"" star and our ""water star"", then the mass at which fusion will occur is given by the proportionality
$$ M \propto \mu^{-3/2} \mu_e^{-1/2}$$ . For a normal star with a hydrogen/helium mass ratio of 75:25, then $\mu \simeq 16/27$ and $\mu_e \simeq 8/7$.  For a ""water star"",  $\mu = 18/13$ (18 mass units divided by an oxygen nucleus, 2 protons and 10 electrons) and $\mu_e= 9/5$ (18 mass units divided by 10 electrons). Thus if the former set of parameters leads to a minimum mass for fusion of $0.075 M_{\odot}$, then by increasing $\mu$ and $\mu_e$ this becomes smaller by the appropriate factor $(18\times 27/13\times 16)^{-3/2} (9\times 7/5\times 8)^{-1/2} = 0.223$. Thus a water star would undergo H fusion at $0.017 M_{\odot}$ or about 17.5 times the mass of Jupiter! NB This only deals with hydrogen fusion. The small amount of deuterium would fuse at lower temperatures. A similar analysis would give a minimum mass for this to occur of about 3 Jupiter masses."
Why does gas form a star instead of a black hole?,"Essentially gas does, it just happens to form a star first.  Mass is not the only factor in creating a black hole. You also need for this mass to reach a high density. In the process of doing this, a star usually forms. The energy producing processes in the star interior produce a pressure that balances the gravitation attraction. This prevents a star from reaching a critical density needed for black hole formation. As these energy producing processes run out of useable fuel the star will eventually collapse onto itself creating a black hole.  So you can't just take a large volume of gas and create a black hole. Other physical processes occur. "
Why are we building larger land-based telescopes instead of launching larger ones into space?,"It's cheaper. (1) With adaptive optics you can get 0.1 arc second resolution on the ground (admittedly only on a mountain top with particularly good air flow, but still!). This eliminates one of the major advantages of space until you get above several meters mirror diameter. (2) Rocket fairings are the shrouds which protect payloads during the supersonic atmospherics speeds reached during launch. A 5 meter fairing is about the largest that can be flown, which limits the size of the one-piece mirrors which can be launched.  (The Dreaded Webb Telescope's mirror is in pieces which will assemble themselves in space -- a very scary and very expensive piece of design.) (3) Servicing a telescope on the top of Mauna Kea or in the high Chilean Andes is a difficult and expensive process. Servicing a telescope in orbit makes that look like small change.  (Cost comparable to the cost of building a new giant scope on Earth.) And in-orbit servicing can't even be done with current technology except in low earth orbit. (4) While high resolution is one frontier in astronomy, going deep is another, and going deep requires big mirrors.  A 30 meter mirror on Earth gathers much more light than a 5 meter mirror in space.  The giant terrestrial telescopes simply do a better job of being light buckets for spectroscopy than anything we can yet put into space. The bottom line is that with the development of adaptive optics, space-based telescopes of currently buildable and launchable size lost their main advantage over ground-based telescopes.  And since they're 10x to 100x the cost, they are simply not worth building for many purposes. Space based telescopes still hold a significant edge in parts of the spectrum blocked by the atmosphere such as UV and IR (Webb), and for certain tasks involving long-term high accuracy photometry (Kepler) and astrometry (Gaia).  But for general purpose use, the balance seems firmly on the ground's side for large telescopes. This will change if space flight becomes cheaper -- the SpaceX BFR, for example, with its 9 meter fairing and dramatically lower launch costs, offers great hope for space telescopes."
Are photons aged?,"Photons can't have a perspective. If we have a particle with mass, we can imagine taking a frame of reference in which that particle is at rest.  We can then see things ""from the particle's perspective"".  But there is no frame of reference in which a photon is at rest. Photons always move at the speed of light in every frame of reference.   If I try to set up a frame of reference which is moving at the speed of light there is a singularity. The universe has no time, and the whole of space is squashed into two dimensions.  So in a very real way, a photon doesn't have a perspective. We can only consider time in a frame of reference that includes it. It makes perfect sense to say that the photons are one year old in our frame of reference. And that is the best we can say."
How old is the oldest light visible from Earth?,"The oldest light in the universe is the cosmic microwave background. Roughly 380,000 years after the Big Bang, protons and electrons ""recombined""1 into hydrogen atoms. Before this, any photons scattered off the free electrons in the plasma filling space, and the universe was essentially opaque to light. Once recombination occurred, however, photons were able to ""decouple"" from the electrons and move through space unimpeded. This relic radiation is still observable today; it has been redshifted and cooled. We can detect light from very distant objects, and we have. It makes more sense to talk about distance in terms of redshift; the larger the redshift, the farther away an object is. There are a number of extremely high-redshift objects, some of which have had their measurements confirmed, and others of which have not. Candidates include All of these objects would have formed some hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang, however, so the light we see from them is much ""younger"" than that of the cosmic microwave background. 1 I've never liked the usage in this context, as this was the first time they combined; the ""re"" is kind of misleading."
Is Earth's moon the only one where a total eclipse of the sun covers the entire sun?,"As planets get farther from the Sun, the Sun takes up a smaller part of the sky.  The Sun is about 31 arc-minutes when viewed from Earth, but just 6-7 from Jupiter and 3-4 from Saturn.   Less than 2 from Uranus and about 1 arc-minute from Neptune, not much bigger than Venus appears from Earth when Venus is visibly large in the sky and when Venus transits the Sun, viewed from Earth, its size is about 1 arc-minute, about the same size that the Sun appears from Neptune.  To get a sense of what size the Sun is from Neptune, look at a photo of a Venus transit. Jupiter has 5 satellites capable of creating a total eclipse, the 4 Galilean satellites and the tiny but close Almathea, which is irregularly shaped, so it wouldn't be the same size as the Sun. Saturn has 6. All are larger than the Sun when viewed from Saturn.    Uranus, because the Sun is quite small that far away, has 12 moons that can create a total eclipse.  All 12 are considerably larger than the Sun in the Uranus' sky but because of Uranus's nearly sideways axial tilt, solar eclipses are rare and only happen at the midpoints in its orbit every 42 years. Neptune has 7, but due to its axial tilt and Triton's off-equator orbit, eclipses are rare. Io probably casts the largest shadow.   Though Pluto and Charon cast a shadow over the largest percentage of the other object, about once every 120 years.   Two of Pluto's smaller moons, Nix and Hydra are large enough to block the Sun completely though eclipses from them are probably rare. As far as I can tell, having checked, our Moon appears unique in our solar-system in being a nearly perfect fit over the sun. Further reading if interested, though there's some variation in the answers, they only mention 4 of Jupiter's moons."
"Why is our solar system ""tipped"" about 63° with respect to the plane of our galaxy?","What you could think at first, regarding the orientation of any planetary system, is that it should be roughly in the plane of the galaxy, simply by angular momentum conservation. But, when you take a look at observations, you see that protoplanetary disks orientation is not what you would expect, with no preferential orientation (protoplanetary disks are embryo of planetary systems, that makes them interesting). In the following figure, the orientation corresponds to the inclination between the line of sight and the rotation axis of the disk.  Why there is this distribution of orientation? The angular momentum scenario is nice but far to simple: star formation occurs in gas clouds in the interstellar medium, and these clouds are known to be turbulent (Larson, 1981). Turbulence simply disrupts the gas, and is dominent over the global angular momentum of the cloud. Actually, you can even test that with numerical simulations of star formation: put an initial angular momentum consistent with observations, and some turbulence (subsonic or slightly supersonic, also in accordance to observations), and you will get a misalignement of the rotation axis, due to turbulence."
"In this image taken by Voyager 1, which is closer: the earth or the moon?","I used JPL Horizons to get the position vectors of each relative to the SSB on Sep 19, 1977. Subtracting Voyager's position from each, and computing $ \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}  $ yields: So, the Earth is closer."
"How did Hubble know the red shift difference between ""moving away"" and ""old""?","The ""redshift"" measurements that Hubble used to determine his law are based on looking at the spectrum of distant galaxies. That is, splitting the light coming from the object in its constituent colors (e.g. by passing it through a prism). If you look at such a spectrum, you will notice that certain lines (colors) are missing. These are so-called absorption lines, and correspond to the physical properties of specific atoms in the object. The location of these lines are determined by physics and are universal; they are the same for all objects. However, if you look at the spectrum of a distant object you find that all these lines are shifted a little bit towards the red. By comparing to the absorption lines of gases on Earth, we can establish how far the lines are shifted, the so-called ""redshift"". This is very different to the reddening of older stars. As the stars grow older they cool down, which means that the light they emit has more red light (compare to a fire burning bright yellow when it's hot and a darker red when cooling down). This shift affects the overall distribution of the emitted light, but importantly does not affect the absorption lines, which stay in the same place (color). To show this, here's two spectra from BBC revision notes for exams taken at age 16. Spectrum from the Sun:
 Spectrum from a distant galaxy:
 You can see the lines in the latter have shifted towards the red end."

Are new stars less pure as generations go by?,"The chemical enrichment of the Universe over time is indeed a thing. The plot below (source) shows observational measurements of the cosmic density of ionised Carbon in the Universe against redshift (higher redshift -> further back in time). The abundance of other heavy elements over time shows a similar trend.  Stars are explicitly classified based on their metallicity, and its direct relation to which generation of stars they are part of. This is known as the Baade chemical classification. The first stars to form from primordial gas are confusingly known as Population III. These stars have yet to be observed, but it's hoped that the James Webb Space Telescope may glimpse them. They are theorised to be very massive and short lived, hence the difficulty in detecting them. The next generation, formed from the enriched material from this first generation of stars are known as Population II. And the subsequent generation, of which our own Sun is a member, are Population I stars. Population I stars have the highest metallicity, due to the fact they formed from material that has already participated in Population III and II star formation. The metallicity of a star is almost entirely determined by the metallicity of its birth cloud.  Stars do swallow up small amounts of material over their lifetimes, but this does not significantly affect the overall metallicity of a star. A stars lifetime is mostly set by it's mass, and whilst metallicity does have a small effect, it doesn't change significantly due to outside effects over a stars lifetime."
Closest star system to Alpha Centauri?,"The sun is the nearest star to Alpha Centauri (unless you count Proxima Centauri, which is really part of the same system). There is a very small and dim pair of brown dwarfs, called Luhman 16 that are closer, at about 3.6 light years from Alpha Centauri. Brown dwarfs are not true stars, but they do glow from their own heat. They were only discovered in 2011. It is possible that there are other very dim objects, but these would not be stars either in the strict sense."
How are black holes found?,"There are many, many ways of doing this. This is by far the most well known. It has been mentioned by the others, but I'll touch on it.  Light coming from distant bodies can be bent by gravity, creating a lens-like effect. This can lead to multiple or distorted images of the object (Multiple images give rise to Einstein rings and crosses). So, if we observe a lensing effect in a region where there isn't any visible massive body, there's probably a black hole there. The alternative is that we are peering through the dark matter 'halo' which surrounds (and extends passed) the luminous components of every galaxy and galaxy cluster (See: Bullet Cluster). On small enough scales (i.e. - the central regions of galaxies), this is not really an issue.  (This is an artist's impression of a galaxy passing behind a BH) Spinning black holes and other dynamical systems involving black holes emit gravitational waves. Projects like LIGO (and eventually, LISA) are able to detect these waves. One major candidate of interest for LIGO/VIRGO/LISA is the eventual collision of a binary black hole system. Sometimes we have a black hole in a binary system with a star. In such a case, the star will orbit the common barycenter. If we observe the star carefully, its light will be redshifted when it is moving away from us, and blueshifted when it is coming towards us. The variation in redshift suggests rotation, and in the absence of a visible second body, we can usually conclude that there's a black hole or neutron star there. Going in to a bit of history here, Salpeter and Zel'dovitch independently proposed that we can identify black holes from shock waves in gas clouds. If a black hole passes a gas cloud, the gases in the cloud will be forced to accelerate. This will emit radiation (X-rays, mostly), which we can measure. An improvement on this is the Zel'dovitch-Novikov proposal, which looks at black holes in a binary system with a star. Part of the solar winds from the star will be sucked in to the black hole. This abnormal acceleration of the winds will, again, lead to X-ray shock waves.  This method (more or less) led to the discovery of Cyg X-1 Cyg A is an example of this. Spinning black holes act like cosmic gyroscopes — they do not easily change their orientation. In the following radio image of Cyg A, we see these faint gas jets emanating from the central spot:  These jets are hundreds of thousands of light years long — yet they are very straight. Discontinuous, but straight. Whatever object lies at the center, it must be able to maintain its orientation for very long. That object is a spinning black hole. Most quasars are thought to be powered by black holes. Many (if not all) of the candidate explanations for their behavior involve black holes with accretion disks, e.g. the Blandford-Znajek process."
Can the moon appear to be in any position in the sky?,"Like the sun, the moon, from our perspective on the surface of the Earth, rises in the East and sets in the West. However, it does not rise exactly due East and set exactly due West. If you were to track the position of the moonrise along the horizon over the course of a year, you would notice that is varies considerably. It cannot, however, be located everywhere in the night sky, even over the course of a year. To understand why, we need to understand some celestial geometry.  The ecliptic plane is the plane which a hypothetical line between the Earth and the sun sweeps out over the course of a year. In the image above, you can see 
how the Earth's orbit exists within this plane.  Also notice that the line from the Earth's geographic south pole through its north pole (its rotational axis) is not perpendicular to this ecliptic plane. In fact it is 23.5 degrees off this perpendicular direction. Notice that the Earth's rotational axis points in the same direction regardless of which side of the Sun the Earth is currently on. This rotational axis always points towards the star Polaris. This means that on different parts of the year, the sun will rise at varying points along the horizon.  The Earth's equatorial plane is a plane defined to extend out from the Earth's equator in all directions. This plane is inclined relative to the ecliptic plane by 23.5 degrees (the same amount as the rotational axis is tilted relative to the perpendicular direction of the ecliptic plane).  Now consider the Earth moon system. In order to determine how far North or South the moon can appear to rise from, you need to consider the angle between the Earth's equatorial plane and the moon's orbital plane. Since the Earth's rotational axis is inclined 23.5 degrees relative to the ecliptic, and the Moon's orbit is inclined 5.14 degrees relative to the ecliptic, the highest the Moon's orbit can be relative to the equatorial plane of the Earth is 28.64 degrees.  Thus, the Moon cannot be directly overhead of any point on the surface of the Earth if that point is 28.64 degrees above or (by an symmetric argument) below the equator. Thus, the Moon cannot appear in every location in the sky for a given location on Earth. There are parts of the sky that the geometry of the Earth moon system simply will not permit the Moon to exist."
Do moons have moons?,"I don't think there are any in the Solar system. We do have around 250 asteroids with moons. Rhea's ring seems to be the only exception.   Edit: Originally I said ""a moon with a moon would be an unstable system, due to the gravitational influence of the planet."" @Florian disagrees with this. However, the answer is more complex than the Hill sphere alone.   At first approximation, the Hill sphere gives a radius in which orbits around a moon could be stable. Our Moon's Hill radius is 64000 km.    For our own Moon, we know that most low orbits are unstable due to mascons: mass concentrations below the surface which make the Moon's gravitational field noticeably uneven. There are only four inclinations where an object orbiting the Moon avoids all mascons and would be stable: 27º, 50º, 76º, and 86º. High orbits above the Moon aren't all safe either: above 1200 km and inclinations of more than 39.6º, Earth's gravity disrupts the satellite's orbit. Note that these orbits are comfortably within the Moon's Hill sphere. There are stable orbits at high inclinations and high eccentricity:
  As for other moons in the solar system: most of them are smaller and orbit around larger planets, so their Hill spheres are small, and the planet's gravity will disrupt much of the volume inside the Hill sphere too. Moons below the limit where their gravity is strong enough to make them spherical, will have problems with uneven gravitational fields. Mascons may also be present. "
Why are there uneven bright areas in this photo of black hole?,"No, you aren't seeing the shape of the accretion disk. Although its plane is almost that of the picture it is far larger and fainter than the ring that is seen. The reason for this asymmetry is almost entirely due to Doppler beaming and boosting of radiation arising in matter travelling at relativistic speeds very close to the black hole. This in turn is almost entirely controlled by the orientation of the black hole spin. The black hole sweeps up material and magnetic fields almost irrespective of the orientation of any accretion disk. The pictures below from the fifth event horizon telescope paper makes things clear.  The black arrow indicates the direction of black hole spin. The blue arrow indicates the initial rotation of the accretion flow. The jet of M87 is more or less East-West (projected onto the page), but the right hand side is pointing towards the Earth. It is assumed that the spin vector of the black hole is aligned (or anti-aligned) with this. The two left hand plots show agreement with the observations. What they have in common is that the black hole spin vector is mostly into the page (anti-aligned with the jet). Gas is forced to rotate in the same way and results in projected relativistic motion towards us south of the black hole and away from us north of the black hole. Doppler boosting and beaming does the rest.  As the paper says:  the location of the peak flux in the ring is controlled by the black hole spin: it always lies roughly 90 degrees counterclockwise from the projection of the spin vector on the sky."
Do all stars have an Oort cloud or is it a rare occurence?,"Awesome question, especially since we know so little of the answer. Nobody knows for sure how the Oort Cloud formed - I'll put that out there right now - but the current hypothesis is that it was originally part of the Sun's protoplanetary disk. All of the ice and rock coalesced into small bodies - proto-comets, if you will. While these bodies were much closer in to the Sun than they are today, they were tossed far out by gravitational interactions with the gas giants. Other interstellar comets could also have been captured by the Sun, adding to the population. So why is the Oort Cloud spherical? After all, the protoplanetary disk was just a flat disk. Why were the orbits of the objects perturbed? Well, the Oort Cloud objects are only loosely bound to the Sun - relatively, that is. They can be influenced by passing stars or other objects. It appears that galactic-scale tidal forces, combined with the influence of passing stars, molded the Cloud into its current spherical shape. So what does this all tell us? Well, we know other stars have protoplanetary disks, right? Some also have exoplanets - gas giants like Jupiter. They are also subject to tidal forces and the passing of nearby stars. So, theoretically, there's no reason why other stars shouldn't have Oort Clouds. So can we find them? The answer is, most likely, no. Here's why. According to Wikipedia, The outer Oort cloud may have trillions of objects larger than 1 km (0.62 mi), and billions with solar system absolute magnitudes brighter than 11 An absolute magnitude of a solar system object of 11 is very dim. Now, the object's apparent magnitude is how it would look from a given distance; the absolute magnitude is how it looks from a distance of 1 AU (in the case of Solar System objects, this quantity is denoted $H$). Oort-cloud objects are 2,000 - 50,000 (or more) AU away-- so these objects, to us in the same solar system, have an apparent magnitude much fainter than 11. The point of that poorly-explained interlude is that these objects are faint. Very faint. And objects in Oort Clouds around other stars would appear even fainter. Using the distance modulus, we can calculate the apparent magnitude of an object if the distance to that object and its absolute magnitude are known: $$m-M=5(\log_{10}d-1)$$ (from here) where $m$ is apparent magnitude, $M$ is a scaling of $H$ normally used for stars, and $d$ is the distance in AU. Given an Oort Cloud object $x$ light-years away, you can figure out how bright (or dim) it would appear, given that 1 light-year is 63241 AU. Try this with the distances of nearby stars, and you'll realize how dim objects in these stars' Oort Clouds would be. As a final note: We don't know for sure if other Oort Clouds exist. From what I've been able to find, we don't have sufficiently powerful telescopes to observe these hypothetical Clouds, and so we don't (and may never) know if they exist. I hope this helps. This paper was instrumental in this answer. Start at page 38 for the relevant information. This page, too, has some good information. As I found from a link from an answer to this question on Physics, we've found Kuiper-Belt-like disks around other stars. This means it is certainly plausible for these stars to have Oort Clouds, too. And exocomets have been detected, which is another good sign."
How do I calculate the inclination of an object with an amateur telescope?,"Any telescope can be made to give you the information that you are looking for.  The first thing that you will need to know is the location of the ecliptic which varies throughout the year.  Or are you looking to find in relation to the the celestial equator? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_equator Either way, you would start of the same by find the Declination (D) and Right Ascension (R.A) of the object in question.  You do not need a telescope to find this, unless you are unable to see the object with the naked eye.  If the telescope has a polar mount and is properly set up.  You can read the R.A. and D off of the mount.   Otherwise it will require some trigonometry and knowing where you are (at least your latitude) You will need to determine the Altitude and Azimuth of the object.  Which is really just the direction from North and the angle from horizontal that your telescope is pointing.  You could do this with a compass and protractor or even an astrolabe.  Knowing this you can then convert to R.A and D with the following formulas: $$RA = \arctan(\frac{- sin(Az) \times \cos(Alt)}{\cos(Lat) \times \sin(Alt) - \sin(Lat) \times \cos(Az) \times \cos(Alt)})$$ $$Dec = \arcsin(\sin(Lat) \times \sin(Alt) + \cos(Lat) \times \cos(Alt) \times \cos(Az))$$ You are looking for the inclination to the ecliptic, so you are mostly concerned with the declination.  The ecliptic changes in declination throughout the year from 0 at the equinox to +/- 23.5 at the solstice.  So your inclination from the ecliptic would be the Declination of your object +/- the Declination of the ecliptic. "
Why can't we see Saturn's phases from earth?,"Phases are just different perceived illuminations of an object at different illumination and observing angles. If the observer is, with respect to the object, located in a similar direction as the light source shining on the object then you should expect to see the vast majority of the object illuminated, if the observer is located in the opposite direction you would see the object back-lit, and if you are at right angles observing the object with respect to the direction of the light source you would see the object half-illuminated. Since Mercury and Venus are always inside Earth's orbit and move with different rates around the Sun as Earth does, the Earth (the observer) is able to locate itself at any angle with respect to the light source that shines on the observed planet. This means that you can see any phase of Mercury or Venus (except from a perfect 100% illuminated phase due to the body of the Sun blocking the view). Here you have an example for Venus:  Now think about what happens from the point of view of an Earth's observer for the exterior planets. The Earth will never have a chance to see the planet's back-lit side since there's no position in its orbit that would allow for this. As seen from the other planet, the Earth is always close to the Sun, so it can be seen almost exclusively during the day, which means that from the Earth you almost exclusively see illuminated regions of the planet. Mars is the closest exterior planet, so the Earth manages to gain enough elongation to see a bit of the night side, but it is a tiny fraction of the disk as viewed from here. Here you have a picture of the phases of Mars as seen from the Earth:  This is even worse for far away planets. Saturn is so far away that from its vantage point, that the Earth is basically always close to the Sun (to the light source).  From the Earth, Saturn seems always fully illuminated, by an extremely small margin that allows to see a slim crescent of darkness in perfect conditions. Only with spacecraft like Cassini and Voyager have we been able to see what Saturn looks like from behind. The first time humanity did this was in 1980 with photographs like this one (from Voyager):  Before that we had never seen the night side covering more than a percent of the disk. Even the shadow of Saturn cast over the rings is nearly impossible to spot from the Earth. Look at this amateur photograph that shows precisely a bit of that shadow over the rings behind Saturn (bottom-right part):  That shadow is almost non-existent from Earth's point of view, and it's all because Earth's orbit is inside Saturn's and Saturn is far away from the Earth. The Earth is always so close to the line connecting the light source (the Sun) and the illuminated object (Saturn), that you shouldn't expect any more phases than ""full"" from here. Simple geometry."
How do we distinguish old craters from new ones on the Moon?,"Aside from the excellent points made in James K's answer, there are other ways to date craters.  For example, when the rays of one crater overlay those of another, we know that the former is younger than the latter. We can also estimate ages of large craters by counting subsequent craters inside the crater floor.  Crater counting is one of the more common ways of estimating the age of lunar surface features. We can also determine ages of some craters by looking at whether it was affected by known ancient lunar processes.   Then there is radiometric dating.  Large impacts spread materials across the surface of the moon, so the Apollo mission samples contained ejecta from many craters, some of which are identifiable by things like mineral composition unique to that part of the moon.   Once you have a good date for one crater, you can use that data to help determine the age of others.  For example, if the floor of a crater has X smaller craters  in it, and you know how old that crater is,  you can then use those counts to estimate ages of other craters with similar counts.   With enough varied data sets, you can generate some pretty good functions for estimating absolute ages. For example,  have a look at the image of the Aristarchus Plateau below:  NASA (image by Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter) [Public domain] Notice the two craters at the bottom of the plateau.  The one on the left is the crater Herodotus, and the one on the right is Aristarchus.   Looking at the differences between the two of them, the first thing you notice is that Herodotus is filled in with the same lava that fills the basin around the plateau, but Aristarchus does not have that fill.  So right there we know that Herodotus pre-dates the event that filled in Oceanus Procellarum, while Aristarchus came later.  This makes Herodotus at least 1.2 billion years old, which is the current best estimate for the last time lava flowed on the moon. Now, we can do better than that with sampling.  If we get a sample of the basalt inside Herodotus, we can use radiation dating to determine when it crystallized, and that would give us a very good upper limit of the age of the crater.  And in fact we did get such samples from Apollo, and that, plus crater counting, plus looking at other features around it with known ages, plus the amount of degradation in the crater walls and the coloration of the material, we can tell that Herodotus dates to the Imbrium era, or about 3.8 billion years ago. As for Aristarchus crater, you can see lots of evidence that it is young.  For one thing, its interior and ejecta are incredibly bright - it's the brightest crater on the moon.  We know from radiological dating and crater counting that similarly bright craters are young.  The walls of the crater have minimal slumping, and the ejecta around the crater is still well defined. Aristarchus is one of the 'Copernican' craters, so named because they all formed during the Copernican period, which starts 1.2 billion years ago and goes right up to the present.  Other large copernican craters include Copernicus, Tycho, and Kepler, among others. Now look at this wider, high contrast image of the Tycho region.  You can see Copernicus and Kepler on the right, and Tycho lower center.  Note that the crater rays overlap each other, and by careful examination we can tell the order of the impacts.  That helps us further refine the relative ages of the craters,  and if we can narrow down the age of one with sampling or other techniques, it helps narrow down the ranges of the others.  Btw,  the order of creation from oldest to newest Copernicus, Kepler, Aristarchus, Tycho. Here's a pretty good reference describing a number of techniques for dating features on the moon: Relative Crater Age Determination This is an iterative process - each time you narrow down the age of a crater, that can be used as data to further refine the ages of others,   But it's not a precise science - age estimates of various craters can still vary by hundreds of millions of years.  There is still a lot we don't know about how the Moon formed and evolved."
How do scientists know that the distant parts of the universe obey the physical laws exactly as we observe around us?,"We don't know in general but to the extent we can measure, the laws seem to be the same, even if conditions are not. For example radioactive decay: We know how fast various elements decay, and we can observe the results of radioactive decay in distant supernovae.  The conclusion is that, for at least some elements, the rate of radioactive decay is the same on Earth as it is in distant supernovae. After accounting for redshift, spectral emission lines remain unchanged by distance. This implies that the fine-structure constant is indeed constant. Distant galaxies have gravitational fields, and interactions between galaxies proceeds in the same way in distant galaxies as it does in local ones. Eventually, the justification is philosophical:  There is no observational reason to believe gravity behaves differently in distant parts of the universe, and so we believe that it does not, In the extreme conditions of the early universe, some physical laws were different.  For example, instead of distinct electromagnetic and weak fields, there was a single Electroweak field.  But this can be described as single ""law"" with the electromagnetic and weak interactions being just the low energy approximation of the electroweak interaction. So if it were discovered that Gravity (for example) was working differently in distant parts of the universe, but that there was a consistent pattern or rule for how it varied, then that would simply become the new theory of gravity (with general relativity becoming only the local approximation to this new law). There is a more fundamental assumption: that the behaviour of matter and energy in the universe can be modelled by ""laws"".  There are no angels dancing on pinheads. The justification for this is strictly in the realm of philosophy."
9th planet location?,"It's too dim to be seen during a normal survey during the majority of its
orbit. Update:  Scientists at the University of Bern have modeled a hypothetical 10 Earth mass planet in the proposed orbit to estimate its detectability with more precision than my attempt below. The takeaway is that NASAs WISE mission would have probably spotted a planet of at least 50 Earth masses in the proposed orbit and that none of our current surveys would have had a chance to find one below 20 earth masses in most of its orbit.  They put the planets temperature at 47K due to residual heat from formation; which would make is 1000x brighter in infrared than it is in visible light reflected from the sun. It should however be within reach of the LSST once it is completed (first light 2019, normal operations beginning 2022); so the question should be resolved within a few more years even if its far enough from Batygin and Brown's proposed orbit that their search with the Subaru telescope comes out empty. My original attempt to handwave an estimate of detectability is below.
The paper gives potential orbital parameters of $400-1500~\textrm{AU}$ for the semi major axis, and $200-300~\textrm{AU}$ for perihelion. Since the paper doesn't give a most-likely case for orbital parameters, I'm going to go with the extreme case that makes it most difficult to find. Taking the most eccentric possible values from that gives an orbit with a $1500~\textrm{AU}$ semi-major axis and a $200~\textrm{AU}$ perihelion has a $2800~\textrm{AU}$ aphelion. To calculate the brightness of an object shining with reflected light, the proper scaling factor is not a $1/r^2$ falloff as could be naively assumed.  That is correct for an object radiating its own light; but not for one shining by reflected light; for that case the same $1/r^4$ scaling as in a radar return is appropriate. That this is the correct scaling factor to use can be sanity checked based on the fact that despite being similar in size, Neptune is $\sim 6x$ dimmer than Uranus despite being only $50\%$ farther away: $1/r^4$ scaling gives a $5x$ dimmer factor vs $2.25$ for $1/r^2$. Using that gives a dimming of 2400x at $210~\textrm{AU}\;.$ That puts us down $8.5$ magnitudes down from Neptune at perihelion or $16.5$ magnitude.  $500~\textrm{AU}$ gets us to $20$th magnitude, while a $2800~\textrm{AU}$ aphelion dims reflected light down by nearly $20$ magnitudes to $28$ magnitude. That's equivalent to the faintest stars visible from an 8 meter telescope; making its non-discovery much less surprising. This is something of a fuzzy boundary in both directions. Residual energy from formation/radioactive material in its core will be giving it some innate luminosity; at extreme distances this might be brighter than reflected light. I don't know how to estimate this. It's also possible that the extreme cold of the Oort Cloud may have frozen its atmosphere out. If that happened, its diameter would be much smaller and the reduction in reflecting surface could dim it another order of magnitude or two. Not knowing what sort of adjustment to make here, I'm going to assume the two factors cancel out completely and leave the original assumptions that it reflects as much light as Neptune and reflective light is the dominant source of illumination for the remainder of my calculations. For reference, data from NASA's WISE experiment has ruled out a Saturn-sized body within $10,000~\textrm{AU}$ of the sun. It's also likely too faint to have been detected via proper motion; although if we can pin its orbit down tightly Hubble could confirm its motion. Orbital eccentricity can be calculated as: $$e = \frac{r_\textrm{max} - r_\textrm{min}}{2a}$$ Plugging in the numbers gives: $$e = \frac{2800~\textrm{AU} - 200~\textrm{AU}}{2\cdot 1500~\textrm{AU}} = 0.867$$ Plugging $200~\textrm{AU}$ and $e = 0.867$ into a cometary orbit calculator gives a $58,000$ year orbit. While that gives an average proper motion of $ 22~\textrm{arc-seconds/year}\;,$ because the orbit is highly eccentric its actual proper motion varies greatly, but it spends a majority of its time far from the sun where its values are at a minimum. Kepler's laws tell us that the velocity at aphelion is given by: $$v_a^2 = \frac{ 8.871 \times 10^8 }{ a }  \frac{ 1 - e }{ 1 + e }$$ where $v_a$ is the aphelion velocity in $\mathrm{m/s}\;,$ $a$ is the semi-major axis in $\mathrm{AU},$ and $e$ is orbital eccentricity. $$v_a = \sqrt{\frac{ 8.871 \times 10^8 }{ 1500 } \cdot \frac{ 1 - 0.867 }{ 1 + 0.867 }} = 205~\mathrm{m/s}\;.$$ To calculate the proper motion we first need to convert the velocity into units of $\textrm{AU/year}:$ $$205 \mathrm{\frac{m}{s}}\; \cdot  \mathrm{\frac{3600 s}{1 h}} \cdot \mathrm{\frac{24 h}{1 d}} \cdot \mathrm{\frac{365 d}{1 y}} \cdot \mathrm{\frac{1\; AU}{1.5 \times 10^{11}m}} = 0.043~\mathrm{\frac{AU}{year}}$$ To get proper motion from this, create a triangle with a hypotenuse of $2800~\textrm{AU}$ and a short side of $0.043~\textrm{AU}$ and then use trigonometry to get the narrow angle. $$\sin \theta = \frac{0.044}{2800}\\ \implies \theta = {8.799×10^{-4}}^\circ   = 3.17~\textrm{arc seconds}\;.$$ This is well within Hubble's angular resolution of $0.05~\textrm{arc seconds};$ so if we knew exactly where to look we could confirm its orbit even if its near its maximum distance from the sun. However its extreme faintness in most of its orbit means that its unlikely to have been found in any survey. If we're lucky and it's within $\sim 500~\textrm{AU},$ it would be bright enough to be seen by the ESA's GAIA spacecraft in which case we'll located it within the next few years. Unfortunately, it's more likely that all the GAIA data will do is to constrain its minimum distance slightly. Its parallax movement would be much larger; however the challenge of actually seeing it in the first place would remain."
Why did Venus not lose its atmosphere without a magnetic field?,"There is an interesting article on the magnetosphere of Venus on the ESA Science and Technology site. You can find the article here and it will probably answer your question. The article states, like you did, that some planets, like Earth, Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn, have magnetic fields internally induced by their iron core. These magnetic fields shield the atmosphere from particles coming from solar winds. It also confirms your statement that Venus lacks this intrinsic magnetosphere to shield its atmosphere from the solar winds. The interesting thing, however, is that spacecraft observations, like the ones made by ESA's Venus Express, have shown that the Venusian ionosphere's direct interaction with the solar winds causes an externally induced magnetic field, which deflects the particles from the solar winds and protects the atmosphere from being blown away from the planet. However, the article also explains that the Venusian magnetosphere is not as protective as Earth's magnetosphere. Measurements of the Venusian magnetic field show several similarities, such as deflection of the solar winds and the reconnections in the tail of the magnetosphere, causing plasma circulations in the magnetosphere. The differences might explain the fact that some gasses and water are lost from the Venus atmosphere. The magnetic field of Venus is about 10 times smaller than the earth's magnetic field. The shape of the magnetic field is also different. Earth has a more sharp magnetotail facing away from the Sun and Venus has a more comet-shaped magnetotail. During the reconnections most of the plasma is lost in the atmosphere. The article explains therefore that although Venus does not have an intrinsic magnetic field, the interaction of the thick atmosphere with the solar winds causes an externally induced magnetic field, that deflects the particles of the solar winds. The article suggests, however, that the different magnetic field may mean that lighter gasses are not as protected and therefore are lost into space. I hope this sufficiently answers the question."
Why does the Moon appear gray when passing between the Sun and the Earth?,"That's what it really would look like if you were there with DSCOVR. The albedo of the Moon is only about 0.136, about half of the Earth's average albedo. Of course the part with clouds is higher. I was shocked too, but it was explained in written copy that accompanied  the release of the original image.  Shouldn't the Moon appear as bright as a full Moon seen at midnight from Earth? It does. If the moon were a diffuse, white ball, a full moon would be about seven times brighter! If you watch the image or GIF, the Moon is roughly the same brightness as central Australia or the Sahara region. Phil Plait explains well in Bad Astronomy. There's a lot to read here. EDIT: I just ran across these images of astronauts on the surface while reading this answer. Their suits are not 100% white to begin with, but the Lunar soil - at least in these locations - is significantly darker. It is close to the same color as the (presumably) nearly-black radiator fins for the heat sink of the RTG unit (2nd photo) at the astronaut's foot.   above: ""Buzz Aldrin carries the EASEP."" from here  above: ""Astronaut Alan L. Bean from Apollo 12, put the Plutonium 238Pu Fuel from the Lunar Module into the SNAP 27 RTG"" from here.  above: Image from NASA/NOAA from Bad Astronomy"
Is it a coincidence that on the far side of the moon almost no seas are visible?,"The current configuration has the Moon's center of mass closer to the Earth than the Moon's center of figure by a couple of kilometers. The reason for that disparity is that the Moon's far side has a much thicker crust than does the Moon's near side. The near side in places has no crust at all. This is a stable tidally locked configuration. Other configurations, with the Earth's center of mass, the Moon's center of mass, and the Moon's center of figure not being more or less co-linear are not stable configurations. There is an alternate configuration that is stable. If what is now the far side was facing the Earth and what is now the near side was facing away from the Earth, that would also a stable tidally locked configuration. However, the current configuration is slightly favored energetically / entropically than is the alternate configuration. Update This answer does not directly answer the question. There currently is no definitive answer to the question of why the near side and far side of the Moon are so very distinct geologically. There are instead many competing conjectures. Science is cool with ""we don't know"". Or, as Isaac Asimov put it, “The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka! ' but 'That's funny…'”"
Is Venus in some way tidally locked to... Earth?,"@BMF's comment links to (Gold & Soter 1969) Icarus 11, (3), November 1969, pp 356-366 Atmospheric tides and the resonant rotation of Venus. Since it is paywalled I'll add a short summary: From the abstract: The observed spin-orbit resonance of Venus, whereby the same side of Venus faces the Earth at each inferior conjunction, cannot be explained adequately by gravitational interaction with the Earth alone. The expected solar tidal drag on the solid body of Venus would easily overwhelm the Earth's couple upon any reasonable permanent deformation of Venus. If there exists, however, a solar atmospheric tide, partly thermally induced and similar to that known on the Earth, its torque may counteract that due to the solar solid body tide at a particular rotation period. The small interaction with the Earth is then sufficient to lock the period to one of the resonances in the vicinity of that angular velocity. The paper explains that if Venus' $J_{22}$ (transverse gravitational quadrupole moment) were about the same magnitude as Earth's it would be far too weak for this synchrony to be induced by gravitational interaction between these two planets because the tidal forces from the Sun would overwhelm the effect: The spin-orbit resonance between the two planets is undoubtedly due to the action of the Earth upon the net permanent de- formation (or transverse quadrupole moment) of Venus. But in order for this rather weak torque, which is significant only near inferior conjunction, to overcome the constant drag of solar tidal friction on the body of Venus, the permanent quadrupole moment required for Venus would have to be at least an order of magnitude larger than comparison with the Earth would suggest.  It then proposes that the tidal interaction with the Sun might be coincidentally cancelled by torque from Venus' atmospheric tidal effects. The paper discusses the history of understanding of transfer of angular momentum from a planets atmospheric tides to the planet itself: It was first shown by Lord Kelvin (Thompson, 1882) that the Earth's atmospheric tides transfer angular momentum and energy from the orbit to the rotation and tend to accelerate the latter. Holmberg (1952) suggested that the associated production of mechanical energy might be sufficient to balance the dissipation of oceanic and solid body tides, so that the Earth's present rotation rate would be one of stable equilibrium over geological time. Subsequent studies, however, appear to confirm the older view that the Earth is in fact slowing down; i.e., that the energy loss in conventional tides exceeds the input through atmospheric tides. Nevertheless, the notion that a planet's rotation rate might be stabilized in the balance between the opposing two kinds of tides is perhaps the key to the resonant rotation of Venus. and concludes (in 1969) that this is probably what's happening. This is the extent of my answer, certainly in the fifty years since this paper it's been looked at in greater detail, but as far as I can tell there are no competing theories. Update: The problem was also addressed by (Ingersoll and Dobrovolskis  1978) in Venus' rotation and atmospheric tides and by (Bills 2005) Variations in the rotation rate of Venus due to orbital eccentricity modulation of solar tidal torques J. Geophys. Res. 110, E11007 More recently Auclair-Desrotour, Laskar & Mathis (2017) Atmospheric tides in Earth-like planets A&A 603, A107 have addressed the general topic in great detail and Venus is examined in great detail, but I can't tell if they address this subject directly or not.  The paper also describes the rapidly evolving studies of Venus by Earth-based radar observation in the 1960's such that by 1969 Venus' apparent synchronicity became obvious at about the same time the Moon landings began. Radar studies of Venus started early, as discussed in   FIG. 1. Radar determination of the retrograde sidereal period of Venus. With increasing accur- acy, the values have converged toward the reson- ant period of --243.16 days. The next nearest resonant periods are at -201 and -308 days.

How can comets have tails if there's no air resistance in space?,"There are two forces that can cause the formation of a tail: the solar wind and radiation pressure. The first misconception in your question is ""the dust [travels] slower than the nucleus"".  The tail is not left trailing behind the comet, it is pushed away from the comet by the sun. When the comet is moving away from the sun, the tail is in front of the comet. Now radiation pressure is small but real. When light shines on something there is a small force. This pushes dust back from the comet in the direction opposite to the sun. The dust is still affected by gravity and a curved dust tail results. The ultraviolet light from the Sun ionises the gas and gives it an electric charge. The solar wind carries magnetic fields and the gas (or more properly plasma) follows these fields in a straight line back from the sun. So space around the Sun is not empty. There is powerful light and magnetic fields that are strong enough to push the dust and gas released by the comet away from the coma, and form the tail."
Is the influence of gravity instantaneous?,"The first question as stated has a rather trivial answer: ""If the sun magically disappeared, instantly, along with all its influences, how long would it take its gravity to stop having an effect on us?"" Since the Sun's gravity is among its influences, it would instantly stop having an effect on us. That's just part of the magical situation, and doesn't even involve any physics. A bit more interesting is the question without the bolded part. In general relativity, changes in the gravitational field propagate at the speed of light. Thus, one might expect that the magical and instant disappearance of the Sun would not affect earth for about eight minutes, since that's how long light from the Sun takes to reach Earth. However, this is mistaken because the instant disappearance of the Sun itself violates general relativity, as the Einstein field equation enforces a kind of local conservation law on the stress-energy tensor analogous to the non-divergence of the magnetic field in the electromagnetism: in any small neighborhood of spacetime, there are no local sources or sinks of stress-energy; it must come from somewhere and go somewhere. Since the magical instant disappearance of the Sun violates general relativity, it does not make sense to use that theory to predict what happens in such a situation. Thus, the Sun's gravity instantly ceasing any effect on the Earth is just as consistent with general relativity as having any sort of time-delay. Or to be precise, it's no more inconsistent. My big question, now, is: ""How do we know it's instant?""  It's not instant, but it can appear that way. We can't possibly move an object large enough to have a noticeable gravitational influence fast enough to measure if it creates (or doesn't create) a doppler-like phenomenon. We don't have to: solar system dynamics are quite fast enough. An simple calculation due to Laplace in the early nineteenth century concluded that if gravity aberrated, Earth's orbit would crash into the Sun on the time-scale of about four centuries. Thus gravity does not aberrate appreciably--more careful analyses concluded that in the Newtonian framework, the speed of gravity must be more than $2\times10^{10}$ the speed of light to be consistent with the observed lack of aberration. This may seem quite a bit puzzling with how it fits with general relativity's claim that changes in the gravitational field propagate at the speed of light, but it's actually not that peculiar. As an analogy, the electric field of a uniformly moving electric charge is directed toward the instantaneous position of the charge--not where the charge used to be, as one might expect from a speed of light delay. This doesn't mean that electromagnetism propagates instantaneously--if you wiggle the charge, that information will be limited by $c$, as the electromagnetic field changes in response to your action. Instead, it's just something that's true for uniformly moving charges: the electric field ""anticipates"" where the change will be if no influence acts on it. If the charge velocity changes slowly enough, it will look like electromagnetism is instantaneous, even though it really isn't. Gravity does this even better: the gravitational field of a uniformly accelerating mass is toward its current position. Thus, gravity ""anticipates"" where the mass will be based on not just current velocity, but also acceleration. Thus, if conditions are such that the acceleration of gravitating bodies changes slowly (as is the case in the solar system), gravity will look instantaneous. But this is only approximately true if the acceleration changes slowly--it's just a very good approximation under the conditions of the solar system. After all, Newtonian gravity works well. A detailed analysis of this can be found in Steve Carlip's Aberration and the Speed of Gravity, Phys.Lett.A 267:81-87 (2000) [arXiV:gr-qc/9909087]. If he was wrong, how do we know it's not? We have a lot of evidence for general relativity, but the best current evidence that gravitational radiation behaves as GTR says it does is Hulse-Taylor binary. However, there is no direct observation of gravitational radiation yet. The connection between the degree of apparent cancellation of velocity-dependent effects in both electromagnetism and gravity, including its connection with the dipole nature of EM radiation and quadrupole nature of gravitational radiation, can also be found in Carlip's paper."
"Why do (most of) the planets rotate counterclockwise, i.e. the same way the Sun does?","Even though I'm a professional astronomer (but not an expert on this field), I don't have a good answer. AFAIK, this question is still open. Actually, the fact that most planets in the Solar system rotate in the same sense as they orbit the Sun is an important constraint on possible planet formation scenarios (of which still several are presently discussed by scientists). For example, the idea that planets form out of dust collected at the centre of vortices in the proto-planetary disc can be almost ruled out, because retrograde vortices are much more stable and long-lived than prograde ones (Jupiter's red spot is a retrograde vortex), and hence planets should be retrograde, but aren't."
"If you lived on the far side of the Moon, how could you infer the existence of Earth?","A body tide seismometer on the lunar far side would pick up both the solar tide, and the 20 inch body distortion produced by the earth.
While ""tidally locked"", the moon is not in a perfectly circular orbit, and also wobbles a bit; libration. Your seismometer should pick up both effects. Watching the parallax of mars cycle every 28 days, as suggested in comments above, might be a simpler way to go."
What happens to the 99.9 % of the sun-rays that do not fall on any planets or any other celestial body?,"The light from the Sun spreads, at least initially, in a roughly isotropic fashion into the universe. As it gets further from the Sun, some of that light will interact with the interstellar medium (ISM) and therefore some of the energy emitted by the Sun will be used to excite atoms and molecules or even ionise some atoms. This will be the fate of almost all the light which is emitted from the Sun in the direction of the plane of our Galaxy, which contains sufficient molecular gas and dust to block starlight travelling through it for any distance. We know this happens because we can ""see"" dark clouds in the Milky Way, that can be penetrated by longer wavelength radiation to reveal all the billions of Sun-like stars that lie behind them. Roughly speaking, about half the visible light from the Sun will be absorbed every 1000 light years when travelling in directions within $\pm 5$ degrees of the Galactic plane, so it is essentially all absorbed within a few thousand light years. But most of the Sun's light is not travelling in the direction of the Galactic plane, and interstellar and intergalactic space has a very low density of gas and dust. The equivalent extinction number for the intergalactic medium is that light travels many billions of light years with almost no chance of being absorbed (see Zu et al. 2010). This means that most of the light from the Sun will travel to cosmological distances (billions of light years) over the course of the next billions of years. Indeed, light emitted from the Sun shortly after its birth has already travelled 4.5 billion light years. That this happens is demonstrated by the fact that we can observe galaxies (the light from which is nothing more than the summation of light from many stars like the Sun) that are 4.5 billion (and more) light years away. As the sunlight travels towards cosmological distances, its wavelength is ""stretched"" by the expansion of the universe, becoming redder and redder. We know this happens because distant galaxies have redshifted spectra. If the universe keeps expanding, then its matter density will continue to decrease and there is little to stop the radiation from the Sun travelling on forever, with a wavelength that scales as the scale factor, $a$, of the universe. We could consider a co-moving and co-expanding cube containing the Sun's radiation as the universe expands. The total radiative energy inside that cube diminishes as $a^{-1}$ - that is, the energy content of the universe in the form of radiation from stars (and other sources) becomes energetically less important as the universe expands and appears to be being superseded by the energy contained in the vacuum itself (a.k.a. dark energy). In conclusion, most of the energy emitted by the Sun is not ""used"" for anything; it propagates into space, becoming more and more dilute and less energetically important as cosmic time marches on."
Why doesn't the moon twinkle?,"The first handful of hits on Google actually return incomplete and even wrong answers (e.g. ""Because the Moon is much brighter"" which is plain wrong, and ""Because the Moon is closer"" which is incomplete [see below]). So here's the answer: As you mention, when light enters our atmosphere, it goes through several parcels of gas with varying density, temperature, pressure, and humidity. These differences make the refractive index of the parcels different, and since they move around (the scientific term for air moving around is ""wind""), the light rays take slightly different paths through the atmosphere. Stars are immensely far away, effectively making them point sources. When you look at a point source through the atmosphere, the different paths taken from one moment to another makes it ""jump around"" — i.e. it twinkles (or scintillates). The region in which the point source jumps around spans an angle of the order of an arcsecond. If you take a picture of a star, then during the exposure time, the star has jumped around everywhere inside this region, and thus it's no longer a point, but a ""disk"". The same is true for the Moon, but since the Moon (as seen from Earth) is much larger (roughly 2000 times larger, to be specific) than this ""seeing disk"" as it's called, you simply don't notice it. However, if you are observing details on the Moon through a telescope, then the seeing puts a limit on how fine details you can see.  The same is even true for planets. The planets you can see with the naked eye span from several arcsec up to almost an arcmin. Although they look like point sources (because the resolution of the human eye is roughly 1 arcmin), they aren't, and you will notice that they don't twinkle (unless they're near the horizon where their light goes through a thicker layer of atmosphere). The image below may help understanding why you see the twinkling of a star, but not of the Moon (greatly exaggerated):  EDIT: Due to the comments below, I added the following paragraph: As described above, what makes a light source twinkle depends on its apparent size compared to the seeing $s$, i.e. its angular diameter $\delta$ defined by the ratio between its absolute diameter $d$ and its distance $D$ from Earth:
$$
\delta = 2 \arctan \left( \frac{d}{2D} \right)
\simeq \frac{d}{D}\,\,\,\mathrm{for\,small\,angles}
$$ If $\delta \lesssim s$, the object twinkles. If it's larger, it doesn't. Hence, saying that the Moon doesn't twinkle because it's close is an incomplete answer, since for instance a powerful laser 400 km from Earth — i.e. 1000 times closer than the Moon — would still twinkle because it's small. Or vice versa, the Moon would twinkle even at the distance it is, if it were just 2000 times smaller. Finally, to achieve good images with a telescope you not only want to put it at a remote site (to avoid light pollution), but also — to minimize the seeing — at high altitudes (to have less air) and at particularly dry regions (to have less humidity). Alternatively you can just put it in space."
How can we tell that the Milky Way is a spiral galaxy?,"There are several clues. The first one, and the simplest one, is that we live in a disk. As you can see on images like the ones from the 2MASS survey in the infrared range:
 We clearly see that we are inside a disk, since what we see when we look around us is a disk seen edge-on. It does not look like an ellipsoid or any other shape; it looks like a disk. The other strong clue we have is the velocity of stars of the Milky Way, we can measure. First, we see an overall rotational motions, and, when you look closely to the patterns (like in the following image, that is observations in the radio range of the Milky Way at Green Bank Observatory), you can deduce that stars are even ordered into spirals:
"
Are there any stars that orbit perpendicular to the Milky Way's galactic plane?,"The Sun and most of the other stars are in the bulging disk of the Milky Way galaxy, but about 1% of the galaxy's stellar mass is in the galactic halo.  The halo also includes 50 globular clusters and about 20 satellite galaxies according to Helmi 2008: The stellar halo of the Galaxy.  Here is a nice graphic:  Note that the Sagittarius Stream of stars is extremely close to passing the galactic poles.  If you were on a planet next to one of these stars as it passed a pole, you would probably have a glorious view of the Milky Way stellar disk. Bodies in the galactic halo don't necessarily follow the elliptical paths predicted by Kepler, so their orbits may not be consistently perpendicular to the galactic plane.  Some stellar streams have extremely odd orbital paths like the Phlegethon stellar stream, referenced in this answer:  There is some speculation that the Halo stellar streams are the remnants of dwarf galaxies the Milky Way has absorbed.  Indeed, Liang et al. say that: the Galactic halo has complicated assembly history and it not only
interacts but also [is] strongly mixed with other components of the Galaxy
and satellite dwarf galaxies"
Why are the Pillars of Creation pillar-shaped?,"Your option #3 is correct; the shape has little to do with the relative motion of the gas and stars. The pillars are part of the giant molecular cloud (GMC) which is giving birth to news stars. Stars are formed when some regions inside the cloud meet the Jeans criterion, i.e. are sufficiently dense and cold that gravity overcomes pressure. Because the density of such clouds is largest in the center (see e.g. Chen et al. 2021), stars will tend to form first in the center. Stars are formed with a distribution of masses. The most massive ones — the so-called O and B stars — emit copious amounts of ultraviolet photons, which heat and ionize the surrounding medium. A hot, ionized bubble inside the otherwise cold, neutral, and dusty cloud called a Strömgren sphere then forms. The dark pillars are remainders of the neutral gas, whereas the bluish region is the ionized region, containing newborn stars. In this answer about the Carina Nebula, I calculated the typical size of a Strömgren sphere, which we can write approximately as
$$
R_\mathrm{S} \simeq 10\,\mathrm{lightyears} \times\color{red}{\left(\frac{Q(\mathrm{H}^0)}{10^{50}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}}\right)^{1/3}}
\color{blue}{\left(\frac{n_\mathrm{H}}{300\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}\right)^{-2/3}}
\color{green}{\left(\frac{T}{10^4\,\mathrm{K}}\right)^{0.23}},
$$
where the three colored terms show typical values of the rate of emitted UV photons $\color{red}{Q(\mathrm{H}^0)}$ from a handful of massive stars, and the neutral hydrogen density $\color{blue}{n_\mathrm{H}}$ and temperature $\color{green}{T}$ of the cloud. This equation tells you two things, namely that But the GMC is not homogeneous; it will have regions that are quite a lot denser, and quite a lot less dense, than the average. According to point #2 above, if some region is, say, 10× more dense than its surroundings, the ionized bubble will propagate $10^{-2/3} \sim 1/5$ as far in this region. The overdensity will therefore shield the part of the cloud that is behind it from the UV radiation of the stellar cluster. This effect causes ""pillars"" of neutral gas to appear behind the dense regions. In the animation below I attempt to show the evolution of the Strömgren sphere. Stars are formed first in the center, but a secondary high-density region (which perhaps is too hot to start forming its own stars) shields the gas behind it, shaping a pillar.  The image below shows you the ""pillars of creation"" with their surroundings, where you can see the stellar cluster in the center of the Eagle Nebula responsible for this shape: 
Credit: NASA/ESA/STScI/WikiSky. Neutral gas is quite efficient at blocking light, because the atoms have many electronic transitions available for absorbing photons. Moreover, the gas is full of dust, which also absorbs light. In contrast, ionized gas is much less efficient at absorbing light, and moreover the dust will tend to be destroyed by the free-streaming UV radiation (sublimation from heating), and by high-temperature particles (sputtering). (when I say ""ionized gas"", this means that hydrogen — which comprise ~90% of the atoms — is more or less fully ionized. But helium and heavier elements still have bound electrons which may absorb some of the light.) Hence, the neutral regions are very opaque, while the ionized regions are transparent."
Are black holes spherical during merger?,"No need to guess. There's solid research done in this field. Even Wikipedia has some info: As two black holes approach each other, a ‘duckbill’ shape protrudes
  from each of the two event horizons towards the other one. This
  protrusion extends longer and narrower until it meets the protrusion
  from the other black hole. At this point in time the event horizon has
  a very narrow X-shape at the meeting point. The protrusions are drawn
  out into a thin thread. The meeting point expands to a roughly
  cylindrical connection called a bridge. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_black_hole#Shape There are research papers with images showing the results of calculations of the shape of the event horizons during merger. Here's an example:  The image above is taken from this paper: On Toroidal Horizons in Binary Black Hole Inspirals We examine the structure of the event horizon for numerical
  simulations of two black holes that begin in a quasicircular orbit,
  inspiral, and finally merge. We find that the spatial cross section of
  the merged event horizon has spherical topology (to the limit of our
  resolution), despite the expectation that generic binary black hole
  mergers in the absence of symmetries should result in an event horizon
  that briefly has a toroidal cross section."
Why did the big bang not just produce a big black hole?,"Your problem essentially arises from trying to apply Schwarzschild black hole logic, the assumptions of which are pretty much maximally violated at the big bang. The following were true at the big bang, and violate the usual black hole formation logic. The event occurred everywhere in space, not actually a point. In particular, the energy was uniformly distributed everywhere. The net gravitational potential was therefore near zero, and there was no one point to which everything could collapse. Furthermore, since stuff was everywhere, there was no expanse of vacuum (in a flat spacetime, no less) outside the collapsing region. And furthermore, things were moving rapidly, were in a highly excited state, and were not in thermal equilibrium (until inflation hit, and then things were too diluted and causally disconnected to collapse en masse). As for what we could describe the universe as at time $t=0$, we have no idea. General relativity has a spacelike singularity there, and it subsequently cannot say anything beyond that. It is expected that general relativity is not a correct description of spacetime in the pre-inflation era, in large part because quantum mechanics introduces significant effects in those conditions, and it is well known that the two theories are incompatible. Edit: This question has been asked on the physics SE many times. https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/20394/55483 https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/3294/55483 https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/26435/55483 Perhaps the answers there will be illuminating."
Can small gas planets exist?,"According to the article ""Minimum planetary size for forming outer Jovian-type planets - Stability of an isothermal atmosphere surrounding a protoplanet"" (Sasaki, 1989), not only is this possible, but is suggested to have been an evolutionary stage for the development of Uranus and Neptune.  But there are a few conditions to allow this to happen, primarily due to distance from the sun, hence temperature. The article's findings suggest that the critical mass for 'atmospheric collapse' is 0.2 of the current mass of the Earth for distances of 5 AU or greater for our solar system (this value of course would vary, depending on the parent star).  This critical mass increases the closer you are to the parent star - the article explicitly states that Mercury and Mars are too small for this to occur. "
Why does the alignment evaluation image from JWST look like this?,"A quick check by pasting the image into PowerPoint and rotating a line shows that the spikes have threefold symmetry; they're at -30°, 30° and 90°. This is exactly what you would see from diffraction by the ""spider web"" of the dark edges that separate the 18 hexagonal subunits of the primary. But it's also exactly what you would see from a single giant hexagonal aperture. The devil is in the details, since the pattern will change depending on how wide of a range of wavelengths is being passed, which will tend to smear out some aspects of the power spectrum. The secondary mirror is supported by a spider with elements at 60°, 90 and 120°. The three diffraction spikes they will produce will be perpendicular to them, but also spaced every 30° degrees rather than every 60°. I took the Fourier transform of the monochrome image illustrating JWST's clear aperture from @pela's answer and we can instantly see similarities. The horizontal spike at 0° is the diffraction pattern of the vertical element of the spike, and the light/dark banding in it (characteristic of slit diffraction) is nicely reproduced. The other two that should appear at at +/- 30° are hidden under the sixfold star pattern of the mirror's ""hexagonal theme"". How much of the six-pointed star's power is from the ""spider web"" of the internal gaps between elements versus the mirror's external jagged edge versus just a big giant hexagonal hole? It's difficult to say without a more careful analysis with a full model. The spotted pattern within the arms of the stars in some images below will smear out once it is averaged over wavelength (smearing the power spectrum by scaling radially)  Here's the files processed and here's the script:"
What did LIGO Actually See? (Gravitational waves discovery),"The actual image isn't much. I was able to find it from Science, and this is all it is:  It's just a ripple, seen at slightly different times from two different observatories. The shift fits perfectly by shifting it by the speed of light difference in their locations. Thus is the proof of gravity waves. It should be noted that the reason there are two instruments is to provide a cross check against other vibration sources. Each observatory works by detecting vibrations on a 4 km scale, down to a very small order of magnitude (1/10,000 the width of a proton). When the two are compared, then one can assume the signal must have come from a non-local source, which only Gravity Waves fit that definition."
"Considering our methods of exploration, how likely is it that there are unfound planets (not dwarf planets) in our solar system?","Objects closer (to Sun) than Neptune that are large enough to be considered planets (and not dwarf planets) can't remain 'hidden'. If it's there, the light from the sun will bounce off it and we will see it. As it moves in its orbit, we will notice the position in the sky change, so we will know it isn't a star. I would like to give a more broad answer to this question though:
What is the maximum size of an undiscovered solar system object and how does it change as you get further from the sun? The further out a solar system object is, the harder it is to detect. The rate at which it gets harder is severe; the light we receive from an object scales roughly as $1/r^4 $. ($1/r^2$ for the light travelling from the Sun to the object, and again, $1/r^2$ for the light travelling from the object to us on earth). We are able to detect some very small earth-crossing asteroids. Some as small as ~50 metres across. At a guess (and this is just based on my intuition, not any calculations), there are probably no undiscovered objects larger than 1 km close to earth. As you travel to the outer solar system (Jupiter to Neptune), the number of bodies increases dramatically. There are currently ~700,000 known solar system bodies and most of them occur in this area. It is believed that all asteroids larger than 10 km have been found. In the area immediately beyond Neptune (30 AU to 100 AU), we have been finding many pluto-like objects in the past two decades, objects with diameters of 500 km or more. For reference, Pluto is about 2200 km across. It is entirely plausible that there are some, if not many, similar objects at this distance range that have not yet been found. Some of these would classify as dwarf planets, in that they are round, orbit the sun, but have not cleared 95% of their orbit of other matter. And finally - and this is where it gets exciting - where it gets really far out, there may be an undiscovered large planet, out at ~700 AU. Referred to as Planet Nine, this is a hypothetical object that some (noteworthy) astronomers believe exist because of patterns they see in the orbits of other distant dwarf planets. From calculations, they estimate that it would be as heavy as 10 earths and travel between 200 and 1200 AU. However, these distances are so large and the sunlight out there is so dim, that even with the best telescopes and two years of looking, they haven't found it. Finally, I'd like to share two graphs. The first one is of distance (of closest approach, or perihelion) vs diameter of various outer solar system bodies. In the bottom right corner there is a noticeable lack of dots, indicating roughly where we don't yet have the capability of seeing objects that small and distant. The second is an expanded but slightly less accurate diagram of the same.

Where did the Sun get hydrogen to work with if it is in the 3rd generation of stars?,"Most of the galaxy's gas is not incorporated into stars and remains as gas and dust. This is not really my area of expertise, but papers such as Evans et al. 2008 and Matthews et al. 2018 seem to suggest that in the Giant Molecular Clouds where most stars in the Milky Way Galaxy form, the star formation efficiency is about 3-6%. So the vast majority of the gas (94-97%) is not made into stars. In very dense environments such as globular clusters, which were formed much earlier in the Milky Way's history, the star formation efficiency get as high as approx. 30%. The canonical quoted rate for ""regular"" spiral galaxies like the Milky Way is about 1 solar mass of new stars are made per year, which is very low summed across the whole galaxy.  Stars also give off a fair amount of their outer, hydrogen rich outer layers during the later red giant phases when the stellar wind is stronger and the atmosphere expands a huge amount (radius of the Sun during the red giant phase will be about what the Earth's orbit is now). Also in the end state when the white dwarf is formed, it's only the core and inner layers that form the white dwarf. The typical white dwarf mass is about 0.6 times the mass of the Sun (S. Kepler et al. 2006) and so there will be a fair amount of unfused hydrogen-rich outer atmosphere left over after the star dies. For higher mass stars, even more of the mass goes into the (ejected at high speed) envelope than goes into the remaining neutron star. These high mass stars are much rarer though; most of the Milky Way's stars are faint, cool M dwarfs."
"Is saying that what we see of an object 1 light-year away happened 1 year ""ago"" in any a way useful view of the universe?","You're right that astronomers don't really care what's going on in a some galaxy right now; we care about how they evolve through time, and how its light has been altered during its journey (e.g. redshift and extinction). We don't know how a particular star or galaxy has evolved since it emitted the light we observe, except in  a statistical sense, and that ""statistical sense"" has been obtained through observing similar objects at various distances and hence times, and building physical models that explain the observed properties. That is not to say that the time it has taken light to reach us is not a concept used by astronomers, at least in cosmology and extragalactic astronomy. It is called the lookback time, and is cosmologically linked to the distance from us, the redshift of the light reaching us, and of course also the age of the Universe at the time of emission. It is not uncommon to see plots in the literature showing some property of galaxies as a function of lookback time. Because of these relationships, however, astronomers typically use neither distance nor time, but simply use redshift when talking about some distant galaxy or phenomenon. For less distant phenomena, such as stars inside our own galaxy, which are not cosmologically redshifted, we use parsec (or kiloparsec) which is ~3.26 times a lightyear. That said, I think there is in fact a virtue in ""pangs of weird existential nostalgia"" when trying to enthrall laypeople. Firstly, I think it's easier to relate to the difference between ""when humans started cultivating the land"" and ""when dinosaurs roamed around"" than to relate to ""12 thousand lightyears"" and ""a hundred million lightyears"", which are both ridiculously far away. Secondly, I think teaching/reminding people that we always look back in time is a fascinating feature of physics. Furthermore, there are some specific experiments involving short distances where the exact delay between emission and observation is important. Examples include predicting the eclipses of Jupiter's moons, as commented by @antlersoft, and communicating with rovers on Mars, as described in @Nuclear Hoagie's answer."
How was the mass of Venus determined?,"How was the mass of Venus measured for the first time? In the mid 19th century, Urbain Le Verrier's predicted of the existence of a then unknown planet beyond the orbit of Uranus. He even predicted this planet's orbit. The discovery of Neptune based on his predictions was perhaps his greatest accomplishment. Le Verrier then went on to investigate Mercury. He used observations of Mercury, Venus, the Sun (as a stand-in for the Earth) and Mars and calculated that Mercury should precess by 532 arc seconds per century based on Newtonian mechanics. Along the way, he had to (and did) estimate the mass of Venus. There was a problem here; the observed precession of Mercury's orbit is 575 arc seconds per century, 43 arc seconds per century greater than his calculated value. This led Le Verrier to conjecture that there was a planet even closer to the Sun than Mercury. Despite the failure to discover the non-existent planet tentatively named Vulcan, Le Verrier's estimate for the mass of Venus was fairly close to the correct figure, within a couple of percent. Once the cause of this 43 arc second per century discrepancy was discovered by Einstein, the mass of Venus was determined with even greater accuracy. Of course, once probes were sent into orbit about Venus, its mass was determined with greater accuracy yet. Reference:

Why does Jupiter have so many moons?,"Mass. The more massive a body, the larger the gap between its lowest and highest orbit; the range of speeds at which a random body entering its gravity is likely to remain as its satellite. Sun has millions of satellites if you count all the asteroids; smaller planets tend to have one or two moons at most (Pluto with five being a notable and not fully explained exception) To a lesser degree there's a matter of shape too. A regularly round body will have more regular and stable orbit than a potato-shaped one. Jupiter, being a gas giant is perfectly round. This doesn't play that much of a role though, especially with higher orbits. And last but not least, no destabilizing influence of other bodies. It's very hard to maintain a lunar orbit - artificial satellites around our Moon last only a couple years each, because relatively close neighborhood of Earth tends to destabilize orbit of anything orbiting the Moon. Jupiter being a single massive planet with relatively tiny (relatively to its mass) moons doesn't have them influence each other all that much. "
How exactly does Hawking radiation decrease the mass of black holes?,"I'm going to give you an intuitive answer. Keep in mind, this is not the ""actual"" answer, as the Hawking radiation is quite a bit more complex than the typical pop-sci explanation with virtual particles. But some intuitive justification is possible nevertheless. I don't see how this event contributes to evaporation of the black
  hole (, since the particles do not originate from the black hole). You're missing a key point here. When the pair was generated, those were virtual particles. After one side of the pair was absorbed by the black hole, and the other side was released, the released part is a real particle. Huge difference there - virtual vs real. Virtual particles don't really exist the same way that you and me exist. They seem to exist for a very short time; the more energetic they are, the shorter the interval of their virtual ""existence"", per the Heisenberg equation. In many ways they are just a mathematical trick. Think of the vacuum, where no real particles exist. Before, it's just vacuum. Right now, a virtual pair flickers briefly, then it's gone. In the future, it's vacuum again. What was the energy before? Zero. What is the energy in the future? Zero. What's the energy during the flicker? Well, it basically zero, within the limits permitted by Heisenberg's equations. Bottom line is, virtual particles come and go, and they do not contribute to the energy balance of some empty chunk of space. (I am ignoring here the concept of vacuum energy, for the sake of an intuitive explanation.) But let's say one of the virtual particles gets trapped by the black hole, so it cannot annihilate with its counterpart. The other particle flies off in the opposite direction and escapes the black hole. What's worse, this is now a real particle - we've exceeded the duration permitted by the Heisenberg equations, so the one that escapes is not virtual anymore. How did that particle become real? This is a big issue, because virtual particles don't require an energy budget to briefly exist, while real particles do carry energy forever. Something prevented the virtual pair from annihilating itself, and boosted one of the components to the status of real particle. The virtual pair has zero energy. The real particle that gets away has non-zero energy. That energy has to come from somewhere. It comes from the black hole. The black hole gives up some of its mass / energy (same thing) to boost one particle from virtual to real. The other particle is captured - but being virtual anyway, it doesn't really matter. What this intuitive explanation doesn't say is how the boost actually happens. I dunno, magic. Somehow one of the virtual particles gets a chunk of energy from the black hole and becomes real. Again, this is not the actual process. The actual process is more complex. This is just a pop-sci fairy tale. EDIT: To hit closer to home, Hawking radiation is more like a close relative to the Unruh effect. Say an inertial observer sees empty space here in this chunk of volume. An accelerating observer would not see empty space in the same volume, but instead would see blackbody radiation. That's the Unruh effect. Well, gravity and acceleration are the same thing, per general relativity. So the strong gravity near a black hole is equivalent to strong acceleration. Something similar to the Unruh effect must happen there. That's the Hawking radiation. http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2015/12/hawking-radiation-is-not-produced-at.html EDIT2: The other answers currently on this page provide useful alternative points, so check them out too."
Why do the planets in our solar system orbit in the same plane?,"In the protostar stage of the Sun, it was surrounded by a (spinning) gas cloud. This cloud behaved like a fluid (well, a gas is a fluid), so it flattened out into an accretion disk due to conservation of angular momentum. The planets eventually formed from the dust/gas in the disk from compression of the dust in the disk. This process won't end up moving the dust out of the plane (all the vertical force of gravity is toward the disk), so the final planet is in the plane too. Why does an accretion disk have to be flat? Well, firstly, let's imagine the protostar and gas cloud before the accretion disk formed. Usually such a setup will have particles spinning in mostly one direction. The ones spinning in retrograde orbits will end up reversing themselves due to collisions. In this gas sphere, there will be an equal number of particles with positive and negative vertical velocities (at a given point in time; due to rotation the velocity signs will flip). From collisions, eventually these will all become zero. A particle revolving around a planet will always revolve such that the projection on the planet is a great circle. Thus we cannot have a particle with vertical velocity zero but with vertical position nonzero (as that would imply an orbit that isn't a great circle). So as the vertical velocity decreases, the orbit inclination decreases too. Eventually leading to an accretion disk with very little vertical spread. "
"Are there observable changes in a star about to become supernova, minutes or hours before the explosion?","I think your best bet would be detecting neutrinos generated by nuclear burning inside the star (as we do for the Sun). Once the star hits the carbon-burning stage, it's actually putting out more energy in neutrinos than in photons. During the silicon-burning phase, which lasts for a few days and is what creates the degenerate iron core (that collapses once it is massive enough), the neutrino flux increases to about 1047 erg/s a few seconds before core collapse. (The peak flux during core collapse is about 1052 to 1053 erg/s). This paper by Asakura et al. estimates that the Japanese KamLAND detector could detect the pre-supernova neutrino flux for stars at distances of several hundred parsecs, and provide advance warning of a core-collapse supernova several hours or even days in advance. Since your characters are in the same system as the star, they'd hardly need a large underground detector to pick up the neutrinos. This plot shows an example of neutrino luminosity (for anti-electron neutrinos) versus time for a pre-supernova star (from Asakura et al. 2016, based on Odrzywolek & Heger 2010 and Nakazato et al. 2013); core collapse begins at t = 0s.  By measuring the spectrum of energies for different types of neutrinos and their time evolution, you could probably get a very good idea of how far along the star was, particularly as we can probably assume your characters have much better models for stellar evolution than we currently do. (They'd also want to get accurate measurements of the star's mass, rotation rate, maybe internal structure via astroseismology, etc., in order to fine-tune the stellar-evolution model; these are all things they could do pretty easily.) The core collapse itself would be signalled by the enormous increase in neutrino flux. This ""What If"" article by Randall Munroe estimates that the neutrino flux from a core-collapse supernova would be lethal to a human being at a distance of around 2 AU. Which, as he points out, could actually be inside of a supergiant star, so your characters would probably be a bit further away than that. But it does show that the neutrino flux would be easily detectable, and that your characters might well get radiation poisoning from it if they were closer than 10 AU. (Of course, you'd want to detect it more directly than just waiting around till you started to feel sick, since that might take longer than the shock wave takes to reach the surface of the star.) This is just to bring home the fact that they wouldn't have any problem detecting the neutrinos...."
What's the fastest moving object in the universe?,"The answer to this is surprising: We are. And many (if not all) other galaxies. And they move faster than light. See, the universe is expanding, at an accelerating rate. The fabric of spacetime itself stretches out, so that galaxies seem to move away from each other. The interesting thing is that relativity does not forbid these from moving away faster than light. While local space is flat and the local speed of light must be upheld, this need not hold at a global scale, so it is possible to have frames which move away from each other faster than $c$. Indeed, there are some galaxies that are moving away from us faster than light (the only reason we see them is that they used to be closer and moving at a slower speed). Any pair of galaxies that are 4200 Mpc away from each other (that is, with a redshift of 1.4), are moving away from each other faster than light in each other's frames (numbers stolen from the linked page). Since the only consistent way to talk about motion is relative, one can say that we are moving away from other galaxies faster than light, since the reverse is also true. This can put galaxies in the bucket of the fastest moving objects in the universe. As for which is the fastest, I don't know, we would have to find a pair of galaxies which are the farthest apart (distance measured in the frame of the galaxy, of course), but since the universe is probably more than what we observe1, we can't pinpoint the pair of galaxies for which this is true. For those who think that it is cheating2 to short-circuit the question with space expansion, there are other objects that go faster than light (they are not the fastest objects in the universe though), and these can be found on good 'ol Earth. Electrons: In nuclear reactor cooling pools3, we have a phenomenon known as Cerenkov radiation. Basically, emitted beta particles move faster than the speed of light in water. This creates an effect of similar origin as the sonic boom, where strong light emanates from the medium.   Saywhat? You think I'm cheating again2 by putting everything relative to the speed of light in a medium? Alright, fine. Here are some fast objects that don't require space expansion to be fast, nor do they involve any trickery of semantics where the medium in which they are being measured is not mentioned. Many have already been mentioned by astromax. Tachyons:These are particles which go faster than $c$ — this does not violate relativity as long as they never decelerate to subluminal speeds. However, there isn't much (any?) experimental evidence for these. A lot of BSM models do predict their existence, though. So there's still some cheating here, on to bradyonic matter: Gluons: These are massless, and though they don't occur freely (except possibly in glueballs, though these most probably have mass) they do travel at $c$. But these can't move at any other speed, so again, this is slightly cheating. On to fermionic matter: Neutrinos: Now these are viable candidates. The electron neutrino is known to have very, very little mass (we have an upper bound for it, which gives ), and as a result it can easily attain very high speeds. Put it in a gravitational field, and it goes even faster. If you want macroscopic objects, however: 1. Due to cosmic expansion, there can be galaxies that are no longer visible to us. Some galaxies may never have been visible to us, if we start watching from when galaxies started forming. 2. I, for one, agree with you. 3. And other places where you have massive particles being emitted really fast into  a medium"
Can Pluto be seen with the naked eye from Neptune when Pluto and Neptune are closest?,"No, it cannot. Far from it. The closest approach between both planets is roughly 16 AU due to the 3:2 orbit resonance. Pluto will even then be a tiny dot among many with a brightness around 14 mag. You can try that with Stellarium yourself, placing the observer on Neptune and looking for Pluto. You just have to find the right time. One such time is approx. in the year 2877."
"If Alpha Centauri A's solar system exactly mirrored our own, what would we be able to detect?","This is a broad question and too broad for me to answer comprehensively. It should be broken down into Doppler methods, transits and direct imaging; and that's before we get to questions of detecting Kuiper belts, radio emission etc. Direct Imaging Exoplanets might also be detected by direct imaging. At the distance of Alpha Cen, a separation of 1 au corresponds to an angular separation of about 0.7 arcseconds. This is easily within the angular resolution of big astronomical telescopes, but the problem is the contrast between the very bright star and the very faint planet. This means that even though the point spread function (what a point source looks like when imaged), might be very sharp, with a full-width at half maximum of <0.1 arcsec, there is still enough light at 0.7 arcseconds to mask a nearby exoplanet. To get around these problems, astronomers use coronagraphs (that block some of the light from the central star) and clever adaptive optics imaging techniques to make the images as sharp as possible. The observations are conducted in the infrared to maximise the relative brightness of the planet with respect to the star (in particular, the exoplanets may emit some thermal infrared if they are giant planets or reasonably close to their star). State of the art observations of Alpha Cen A are presented by Wagner et al. (2021). These would be able to detect Jupiter from 4.4 light years, but probably not Saturn or the ice giants. However, as pointed out by userLTK, Jupiter would not be stable in the Alpha Cen AB system and any planets would be restricted to <3.8 au orbits. Nevertheless, an astronomer near Alpha Cen A would detect Jupiter with our current technology by direct imaging. As for closer in planets, Wagner et al. say that their current observations are able to place a limit that they would be able to detect Neptune-sized objects within the habitable zone of Alpha Cen A. Unfortunately, none of the Solar System objects meet this description so the inner Solar System planets would not be (currently) detectable. However, the prospects for the future look good. Quanz et al. (2015) suggests that the direct imaging system on the ELT (METIS), exploiting its higher angular resolution, should be capable of imaging the thermal emission from Earth-sized exoplanets at 1 au around Alpha Cen A. Doppler Technique The reflex radial velocity semi-amplitude of a star for the case of a planet of mass $m_2$ orbiting a star of mass $m_1$, in an elliptical orbit with eccentricity $e$, and orbital period $P$ and with an orbital axis inclined at $i$ to the line of sight from Earth is:
$$  \left( \frac{2\pi G}{P}\right)^{1/3}\frac{m_2 \sin i}{m_1^{2/3}} (1-e^2)^{-1/2}.      $$
A (very) detailed derivation is given by Clubb (2008). So I built myself a little spreadsheet and assumed that all the planets were seen optimally at $i=90^{\circ}$ (they could not all be seen optimally, but the smallest inclination would be about $i=83^{\circ}$ for Mercury, so it doesn't make too much difference) I'll also assume the mass of Alpha Cen A is about $M \simeq 1.1M_{\odot}$. The results are The limits of what are possible are well illustrated by a planet around Alpha Cen B, claimed to be in a 3 day orbit and with a mass similar to the Earth (Dumusque et al. 2012, and see exoplanets.org). The radial velocity semi-amplitude detected here was $0.51\pm 0.04$ m/s, and some spectrographs, notably the HARPS instruments, are routinely delivering sub 1 m/s precision. Thus Jupiter and Saturn would be detectable (but recall, would not have stable orbits), Uranus and Neptune are right on the edge of detectability (remember you can average over many RV observations), but the terrestrial planets would not be found (Earth detections would require precisions below 10 cm/s). Remember also that the weaker signals would have to be dug out from the larger signals due to the Jupiter- and Saturn-like planets. However, there is a second limitation: to find a planet using the Doppler method you need to observe for at least a significant fraction of the orbital period. Given that current m/s precisions have been available for only $\sim 5$ years, it is unlikely that Saturn would yet have been detected. A picture that illustrates the situation can be obtained from the exoplanets.org website, to which I have added lines that approximate where RV semi-amplitudes would be for 10 m/s and 1 m/s precision (assuming the Alpha Cen A mass and circular orbits). I've marked on the Earth, Jupiter and Saturn. Note that few objects have been discovered below the 1 m/s line. Also note the lack of planets between the 1 and 10m/s lines with periods longer than a couple of years - the recent increase in sensitivity has yet to feed through to lower mass, longer period exoplanet discoveries.  In conclusion: only Jupiter would have been so far found by the Doppler technique. Transit techniques I'll also add a few comments about the transit technique. Transit detection will only work if the exoplanets orbit such that they cross in front of the star. So high inclinations are mandatory. Someone who is better at spherical trigonometry should use the published data for the Solar System to work out how many (and which) planets transit in some highly optimal orientation. Given that the planets have orbital inclinations with a scatter of a few degrees, then some straightforward trigonometry and a comparison with the solar radius, tells you that these orbits will generally not all transit for any particular viewing angle. Indeed a number of the Kepler-discovered multiple transit systems are much ""flatter"" than the solar system. The Kepler satellite is/was capable of detecting very small transiting planets thanks to its very high photometric precision (the dip in flux is proportional to the square root of the exoplanet radius). The picture below, presented by the NASA Kepler team (slightly out of date now), shows that planetary candidates have been discovered that are down to the size of Mars. However these tend to be in short period orbits because a transit signal needs to be seen a number of times, and Kepler studies this patch of sky for about 2.5 years (when this plot was produced). So from this point of view, possibly Venus would have been seen, but none of the other planets could be confirmed. However, there is a wrinkle. Alpha Cen A is way too bright for these kinds of studies and way brighter than the Kepler stars. You would have to build a special instrument or telescope to look for transits around very bright stars. Some of this work has been done by ground-based surveys (mainly finding hot Jupiters). A new satellite called TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, launched in April 2018) is a two year mission, focused on finding small planets (Earth-sized and bigger) around bright stars. However, most of its targets (including Alpha Cen) are only observed for a 1-2 months, so only the inner parts of their planetary systems will be probed. "
"Could any known, living organisms on Earth survive on Mars?","The most likely candidate would be the Tardigrade. These little guys handle vacuum and radiation just fine. So long as water is provided, according to tests done in LEO the Tardigrade would survive on Mars. Even if they do dehydrate, they spring back to life once water is provided again."
How could a hobbyist astronomer determine apparent magnitude of a star?,"The easiest way to determine the magnitude of a given star is probably to use the Pogson relation. The idea is to determine the magnitude of a star knowing the magnitude of a reference star; it is thus quite easy, using a well-known reference as Vega or Sirius. The Pogson relation is given by: $$m_1-m_2=-2.5\ log\ \left({\frac{E_1}{E_2}}\right)$$ where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the magnitudes of star 1 and star 2 (your reference star), and $E_1$ and $E_2$ brightness (that could be in arbitrary units, which is a good news for you). With a CCD detector the brightness is easy to determine since it's just the flux of a pixel. You don't have to convert it in physical units (as Watt per square meter) since you have a ratio $\left({\frac{E_1}{E_2}}\right)$, so the raw intensity is enough to determine the magnitude. As for any other measurement with a CCD camera, you have of course to determine the bias, dark and flat-field and to reduce your data before estimating any magnitude. The precision will depend on the number of observations performed and, as always, it is better to perform several short exposure images than a single long exposure one."
Why doesn’t the Sun fill the sky on Mercury?,"When looking at the first image, you need to take into account perspective distortion in images with a narrow field-of-view. This is the same effect that makes people look closer together than they actually are when photographed through zoom lenses (which is useful to bear in mind when reading the news these days!). Mercury is not as close to the Sun as the first image makes it appear. You also need to bear in mind that objects in space tend to lack ""depth cues"": in the atmosphere, objects further away will become blurrier and more ""washed out"" due to scattering. In space, this does not apply."
Did I see another planet?,"You don't say what time you were looking. Here is a screenshot from Stellarium at 10pm Wisconsin time on 25th March 2016. Jupiter is in the ESE, but the altitude is a bit lower than 60 degrees. Seems fairly conclusive. You were seeing Ganymede and a Europa/Io combination. "
Why do Jupiter’s moons have so much water?,"tl;dr: They have more water because they captured it as ice, and it’s easier to hold onto ice than water vapor. Planets (and by extension, moons) beyond the frost line were formed with ice as a part of their cores, so they in a sense started off with more water than terrestrial bodies closer to the sun. A surface level explanation boils down to one thing: the frost line. There is a line (roughly twice the Sun-Mars distance at ~3 AU) beyond which water can exist as ice for an indefinite amount of time exposed to the Sun (that of course is not to say ice can’t exist inside this region, but rather that it needs accommodations like being obscured from the Sun for large chunks of time). Because water can exist as a solid beyond this point, it can (mixed with rocks and metals) contribute to the formation of planetesimals which leads to planets, leading to much larger planets (gas giants). Inside the line, water is vaporized and only kept by planets with masses large enough to hold onto it. As you can see, by this reasoning gas giants (and by extension meteors, moons, dwarf planets etc) beyond the frost line are just naturally going to have more H2O because it’s a lot easier for a planet to hold onto ice than water vapor, seeing how the latter can escape if the Boltzmann distribution of its speeds has a big enough tail beyond the escape velocity of the body. Once ice is captured, methods like geothermal heating can melt ice closer to the core of the body, leading to a situation like Europa where there is believed to be liquid water under its surface. While I’ve probably glossed over a lot of important details, this is a (hopefully) digestible explanation."
Is it odd that our Sun has so many planets?,"From an exoplanet-finding point of view, the Sun has between one and three planets. The major exoplanet-finding techniques in current use involve watching for either periodic Doppler shifts as the planet's gravitational pull causes the star to wobble, or periodic brightness shifts as the planet transits the star.  Both require that the planet is large enough and close enough to generate a measurable signal and that the orbital period is short enough to let astronomers distinguish periodic variations from one-off variations; the transit method additionally requires that the planet's orbit crosses the star from the point of view of Earth (which favors close-in orbits).  Looking at the Solar System with these techniques: If you look at this graph of exoplanet discoveries, Jupiter is solidly in the cluster of blue Doppler discoveries, Saturn is just past the ""we've been watching for one full orbit"" right-hand edge of that cluster, Earth and Venus are somewhat below the sloped minimum-period-mass line, and everything else is nowhere near the detection range. The reason the Sun has far more known planets than any other star is simply because we've got a better look at it."
Did I see Pluto with my naked eye?,Pluto is something like magnitude 14. The limit for the human vision is somewhere between magnitude 6 (widely accepted) and 8-ish (highly trained observers with perfect vision in ideal conditions using special techniques - and it's a bit controversial anyway). There's zero chance that was Pluto. It was definitely a fixed star.
What will succeed the Arecibo Observatory?,"There's no simple answer. In the immediate future, different radio telescopes around the world will pick up the slack in various ways; how that happens will depend on the needs of individual observers and collaborations. Unless someone was to build an identical observatory at the same latitude as Arecibo, with the same frequency range, receiver options and field of view . . . we'll have to spread out the observing. Given that we didn't really expect to lose Arecibo for more than about a year$^{\dagger}$, there are a lot of things up in the air. Insert ""probably"" and ""maybe"" into this answer wherever you please. I do pulsar timing, so I'll talk about what a future without Arecibo might look like from our perspective. My collaboration's two main instruments were Arecibo and the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope (GBT), with roughly half of the observing time at Arecibo and half at the GBT. There aren't firm plans in place for the exact strategy we'll take going forward, but we'll have to decrease our observing cadence at the GBT (i.e. how often we observe certain pulsars) so we can use some of the time to observe pulsars we'd normally observe using Arecibo. So the GBT can take some of the load, but as we only have a finite amount of observing time, that impacts our other observations. We'll likely have to decrease the cadence of observations and the number of pulsars we monitor regularly. Pulsar timing arrays will also have options with other existing instruments in the immediate future. A key one is the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) in Canada. The folks at CHIME will actually be able to observe all of our northern hemisphere pulsars (CHIME Pulsar Collaboration, 2017), which is excellent. In the short-term, CHIME will slightly lessen the burden of losing Arecibo. We've also done a little bit of timing with the Very Large Array, although I don't think that'll be a major player in the future. That brings us to telescopes currently in the planning stages or under construction. The DSA-2000 (Hallinan et al. 2019) will hopefully see first light in the late 2020s and would likely become a major part of our ongoing observations. The Square Kilometer Array will also be extremely important for radio astronomy as a whole - I don't know whether we in particular will be using it a lot. The SKA should also reach completion in the next decade. And, of course, the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will open exciting opportunities for a lot of subfields of radio astronomy. These are just the current potential options from my corner of the astronomical world - and they're quite tentative. Arecibo was our most-used screwdriver in the toolbox, so we've certainly been hit. We'll hopefully be able to somewhat supplement the GBT with CHIME and ideally DSA-2000 a decade from now - so in that sense, those will effectively succeed Arecibo for our observations. In reality, all that means is that we won't lose quite as much of our observing capacity - but it doesn't come close to making up for the loss. Other collaborations and astronomers will presumably increase their usage at the observatories that are best equipped for their observations, depending on frontend/backend requirements and field of view. It's not going to be fun. We'll be set back. But science will go on. We'll figure it out. It's worth updating this answer now that the white paper for the proposed Next Generation Arecibo Telescope (NGAT) has been released. The Arecibo Observatory has proposed a phased array of small dishes mounted on a circular platform ~300 meters in diameter (or potentially multiple smaller platforms) which would be angled in various directions to provide reasonable sky coverage. One variant involved 1,112 9-meter dishes, as smaller dishes provide a higher packing efficiency and therefore maximize collecting area. Regardless of the precise configuration, the sinkhole that housed the former 305-meter dish would ideally be the new array's home. The aim is for frequency coverage from 200 MHz to 30 GHz via four broadband receivers and a frequency-dependent field of view ranging from 6 degrees at 300 MHz to 3.5 arcminutes at 30 GHz, a significant field of view increase over its predecessor by a factor of 500. The dishes would also be equipped with transmitters for radar observations. Whether the NGAT will be built is a question for which nobody has any answers just yet. It would cost roughly $450 million, which could take money away from other projects unless it received special Congressional funding or support from private sources. Additionally, the setup has not been tested on such a large scale, so there are some technical and engineering concerns (the group did consider but reject single-dish and classical array designs). All that said, the design was put together in an impressively short amount of time, and even if the NGAT isn't build, the scientific considerations that went into it may inspire future designs for replacement telescopes at Arecibo. $^{\dagger}$ This isn't totally true - a scenario where we lose Arecibo had already been studied in detail. But . . . I think a lot of folks felt that it was more likely that it would be out of commission for a bit but could be salvaged in some way, and hopefully brought back online before too long. This was not the Thursday we were expecting. Over two and a half years have passed since the announcement of the telescope's decommissioning and its subsequent unexpected collapse, meaning we can switch the question from what will succeed the Arecibo Observatory to what is succeeding the Arecibo Observatory. Some of my predictions came true, but some new developments have taken place. The site In October 2022, NSF announced that it would be transforming Arecibo into a new educational center, soliciting proposals for specifics. The decision did not include funds for continuing the other still-operational instruments at the site, notably, the 12-meter radio telescope and the LIDAR facility. This was effectively a death knell for the construction of the NGAT -- or alternative designs -- at Arecibo, and in fact any future science there. Astronomers at the observatory have continued to push for a replacement at the site, however. In May of 2023, a group proposed a modified version of the NGAT, dubbed NGAT-130. NGAT-130 somewhat resembles NGAT, but consists of 102 13-meter dishes, with a collecting area that of a single 130-meter-diameter telescope. The group describes the design as ""scientifically competitive"" with NGAT but reasonably cheaper. As with NGAT, and particular in light of the NSF announcement, NGAT-130 doesn't have great chances. It's entirely possible that it could be built at another site -- there are better locations for radio astronomy than Puerto Rico -- but any such plan would be strongly dependent on finding a source of funding. I'm not sure I see a way for that to happen without private funding or an (unfortunate) decision to axe DSA-2000. Observations I'm again writing this from my particular corner of radio astronomy -- pulsars and FRBs -- and in the intervening period since the loss of Arecibo, we've seen some alternative options emerge. Three telescopes folks have been submitting proposals to even more than previously have been the GBT, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in India, and the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST)$^{\dagger\dagger}$ in China. All three have the advantages that 1) they're world-class facilities and 2) they can cover much of the same declination range that Arecibo did. All are highly oversubscribed already, but we can still in principle see many of the objects we used to with Arecibo. That said, in the bands I'm interested in, only FAST can reach Arecibo's sensitivity; I recently wrote in a proposal that it's currently the only telescope in the world that can see a couple of the sources I'm interested in. There are ways to mitigate this very specific issue for the GBT and GMRT: since pulsars are broadband sources with power-law spectra scaling with frequency as something like $\nu^{-2}$, you can shift observations of dim pulsars to lower frequencies. For instance, pulsars previously barely detectable at L-band (center at ~1400 MHz) with Arecibo could be observed with the GBT's 800 MHz prime focus receiver. You still won't recover the old signal-to-noise ratio, and shifting frequencies presents new issues, but hey, it's something. And after all, for most pulsars, this isn't a huge issue. When I originally composed this answer in November 2020, I wrote that science would go on. And it has, and it will continue to do so. Arecibo is missed. But we keep going. It's what we do. $^{\dagger\dagger}$ FAST, by the way, has turned out to be an absolutely bonkers tool for pulsar and FRB studies."
"Which planet, viewed from which other planet would appear the largest?","Here is a table with planets, their minimum/maximum distances from the Sun, their minimum distance (assuming the planet's aphelion and its neighbour's perihelion coincide, which they don't, so the actual minimum distance is a bit higher), the size of the largest of the two (indicated with a *), and finally the maximum apparent size $s$, which is given by $s = 2 \tan^{-1}\frac{\text{radius}}{\text{minimum distance}}$. All data was taken from Wikipedia. So the Earth as seen from Venus would be the largest, but as Earth has only half the albedo of Venus, Venus as seen from Mercury will probably be brightest (Venus is largest for us if it's in conjunction with the Sun, so 0% illuminated, but for Mercury it happens if it's 100% illuminated). Jupiter from Mars (or Saturn) is definitely smaller. I've seen other users being able to calculate exact (maximum) brightness and gladly defer to them for that information."
Why is there a gap in this image of supernova discoveries?,"The coordinate system in this image is RA and Dec. It is a coordinate system which uses the Earth's equator (projected onto the sky) as its midline. The inverted U is the Milky Way. The Milky Way is full of dust and gas, and blocks our view of galaxies (and supernovae) behind it. There is enough dust in the plane of the galaxy to block our view in that direction. For example the galaxy IC 342 is one of the nearest galaxies, and would be brilliant if it were not close to the galactic plane. There may be other galaxies that are completely hidden. Our galaxy's bulk not only hides supernovæ that are in other galaxies, it also hides most of the supernovæ that occur in the Milky Way"
Why don’t supergiants at least start to fuse nickel into even heavier elements before going supernova?,"The final stages of nucleosynthesis are a statistical equilibrium process. At the same time as nuclei are being built up, photodisintegration is breaking them down. The temperatures required to produce zinc by fusion are high enough that the radiation field is energetic enough to break it up. So there is some present in the mix, but nowhere near as much as nickel. It is also the case that $^{60}$Zn is unstable, decaying (or neutronising) in minutes into copper and then nickel. In fact, there is an increasing penalty for producing any heavier elements with $n/p=1$, because they will beta (plus) decay (or neutronise/electron-capture) to increase the $n/p$ ratio on short timescales."
Is there any known moon of a moon? [duplicate],"No. One explanation for the equatorial ridge on Iapetus involves a now-lost subsatellite, so perhaps such objects existed in our Solar System's past. Subsatellites tend to get rapidly removed by tidal forces causing changes to the orbit. Depending on the parameters of the system, the orbit may decay until the subsatellite collides with the moon or breaks up at its Roche limit. Alternatively it may migrate outwards until the subsatellite becomes unbound: at this point it would become a moon of the planet, though likely on an unstable orbit that would lead to scattering or a collision. The orbital evolution tends to be faster for more massive subsatellites. See Kollmeier & Raymond (2018) for details, who note that any subsatellites orbiting the candidate Neptune-sized exomoon in the Kepler-1625 system would need to be smaller than Ceres to survive."
How dense are Saturn's rings?,"Elements of answer: It is not an easy question, as we lack of data to constrain strongly the density and mass of Saturn's rings. However, a first clue of their density is their optical depth (that is a measure of the transparency of a medium). The densest rings are the one of the main ring system (rings A, Cassini Division, B and C) plus ring F; they are characterized by optical depth larger than 0.1 (up to about 5 for the densest part of ring B). Rings in the faint ring system (E and G) have very small optical depth (lower than $10^{-5}$). With this regard, B is indeed the densest ring of Saturn's rings. (edit) Looking around ([1] and [2]) you can find numbers that help to figure out the density of this ring. Knowing its mass (about $2.8\times10^19$ kg) and its extend (from 1.527 to 1.951 Saturn radii, with a typical thickness of 100 m), you can deduce a mean density of about 10 kg.m$^{-3}$ (about 10 times denser than the terrestrial atmosphere at sea level). Just for fun: This gives you an idea of what means the optical depth. In the densest parts of ring B, optical depth is between 2.5 and 5, so you'll definitely notice you're in the ring. It is probably more complicated than that (with ring particles ranging from dust size to house size), but you get the idea.
 Side note: Optical depth is a measure of transparency of one medium; it measures how radiation is neither scattered nor absorbed by the medium. It expression is given by $$\frac{I}{I_0} = {\rm e}^{-\tau}$$ where $I_0$ is the source intensity, $I$ the observed intensity, and $\tau$ the optical depth. Sources:"
Why is the Sun's density less than the inner planets?,"The sun isn't the same density all the way through. According to MSFC's solar interior page, the core density at the centre of the sun is a whopping 150,000 kg/m$^3$. Surrounding it the radiative zone is around 20,000 - 200 kg/m$^3$ (already less dense than water). Eventually at the edge is the convective zone - the density at the part that we see is much less dense than our own air... So although the Sun's average density isn't very remarkable, the core is the densest place in the solar system. (Sun cross section from Wikipedia.org)"
Is oxygen really the most abundant element on the surface of the Moon?,"Yes, that's correct; it's also true for the Earth's crust. The reason is that ""rocks"" are typically made up of components containing combinations of silicon or one or more metals (e.g., magnesium, aluminum, iron) and oxygen, such as silica ($\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$); alumina ($\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$); lime ($\mathrm{CaO}$); iron oxide ($\mathrm{FeO}$); and magnesium oxide ($\mathrm{MgO}$). Examples of common lunar minerals formed from these components includes plagioclase feldspars (mixtures of NaAlSi$_{3}$O$_{8}$ and CaAl$_{2}$Si$_{2}$O$_{8}$), pyroxene (typically XYSi$_{2}$O$_{6}$, where X and Y are metals such as calcium, sodium, iron, magnesium, and aluminum), and olivine (made up of Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$ and Fe$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$), along with oxide minerals like ilmenite (FeTiO$_{3}$). (Source) Since in all these cases you have between one and two oxygen atoms for every non-oxygen atom, you end up with oxygen as the most abundant single element."
Is the Sun visible from Proxima Centauri to human eyes?,"Well, there's two things we'll need for this: apparent magnitude (the brightness that an object appears to have) and absolute magnitude (the actual brightness an object has). Both of these scales are logarithmic, with brighter objects being lower and dimmer objects being higher. Astronomers have determined that the Sun's absolute magnitude is 4.83. Knowing this, we can find the apparent magnitude of the Sun from Proxima Centauri's location. Apparent and absolute magnitudes are related by the equation: $$M = m - 5 (\log_{10}{d}-1)$$ Where $M$ is the absolute magnitude, $m$ is the apparent magnitude, and $d$ is the distance, in parsecs. Astronomers have determined that Proxima Centauri is 1.3 parsecs from us. So the apparent magnitude can be determined as: $$m = 4.83 + 5(\log_{10}{1.3}-1) ≈ +0.4$$ As made clear in this paper, most humans can see objects with apparent magnitudes as dim as $5$ without using tools. So yes, it is certainly visible, and would be quite bright. It is between Procyon and Achernar, the 9th and 10th brightest star on Earth's night sky. For a comparison, Proxima Centauri has an apparent magnitude of $+11.13$ from Earth's perspective. If we want to compare the two, we could use this formula: $$v_b = 10^{0.4 x} = 10^{0.4×(11.13-0.4)} \approx 19588$$ So the Sun would appear almost 20,000 times brighter from Proxima Centuari than PC appears from the Sun."
Can our Sun become a black hole,"The choice between the three fates of stars (white dwarf, neutron star, black hole) is entirely determined by the star's mass. A star on the main sequence (like most stars, including our sun) is constantly in a balance between the inward pressure of gravity and the outward pressure of the energy generated by the hydrogen fusion that makes it ""burn"".1  This balance stays relatively stable until the star runs out of whatever its current fuel is - at that point, it stops burning, which means there's no longer outward pressure, which means it starts collapsing.  Depending on how much mass there is, it might get hot enough as it collapses to start fusing helium together. (If it's really massive, it might continue on to burn carbon, neon, oxygen, silicon, and finally iron, which can't be usefully fused.) Regardless of what its final fuel is, eventually the star will reach a point where the collapse from gravity is insufficient to start burning the next fuel in line.  This is when the star ""dies"". If the star's remains2 mass less than 1.44 solar masses (the Chandrasekhar limit3), eventually gravity will collapse the star to the point where each atom is pushed right up against the next.  They can't collapse further, because the electrons can't overlap.  While white dwarfs do shed light, they do so because they are extremely hot and slowly cooling off, not because they're generating new energy.  Theoretically, a white dwarf will eventually dim until it becomes a black dwarf, although the universe isn't old enough for this to have happened yet. If the collapsing star is above the Chandraskhar limit, gravity is so strong that it can overcome the ""electrons can't overlap"" restriction.  At that point, all the electrons in the star will be pushed into combining with protons to form neutrons.  Eventually, the entire star will composed primarily of neutrons pushed right up next to each other.  The neutrons can't be pushed into occupying the same space, so the star eventually settles into being a single ball of pure neutrons. Black holes are the step beyond neutron stars, although they're worth discussing in a bit more detail.  Everything, in theory, has a Schwarzschild radius.  That's the radius where a ball of that mass would be so dense that light can't escape.  For example, the Schwarzschild radius for Earth is about 9mm.  However, for all masses smaller than somewhere between 2-3 times the mass of the sun, it's impossible to squeeze the matter small enough to get it inside that radius.  Even a neutron star isn't massive enough. But a star that becomes a black hole is.  We don't actually know what happens to a star once it's become a black hole - the edges of the ""hole"" itself is simply the Schwarzschild radius - the point light can't escape.  From outside, it doesn't matter whether the matter collapsed to the point that the neutrons started overlapping, whether it stopped just inside the radius, or whether it continued collapsing until it broke all known physical laws.  The edges are still the same, because they're just a cutoff based on the escape velocity. 1  I'm ignoring the red giant phase here, since it's just a delay in the ""run out of fuel"" step.  Basically, the core is helium ""ash"", while the hydrogen fusion process takes place further and further out.  Once that runs out, you get a nova and the collapse continues. 2 Likewise, I'm ignoring the mass that stars shed in their various nova phases.  All given masses are based on the remnants left behind. 3 Every source I've found for Chandrasekhar mass, except Wikipedia, gives 1.44 or 1.4 solar masses (which are compatible).  Wikipedia gives 1.39, and gives at least one source to back that number."
"If two white dwarfs collided, would they become a star?","The answer to your question is both yes and no, depending on the circumstances. Two white dwarfs colliding would likely yield a Type Ia supernova, assuming the combined mass exceeded the Chandrasekhar limit ($\sim1.4$ solar masses). The unstable object resulting from the collision could not be supported by electron degeneracy pressure; when the temperature rises rapidly due to the collision, there is nothing to stop it (compare this to thermal pressure in a ""normal"" star, which can make the star expand or contract to compensate for changes in temperature). The rise in temperature triggers fusion, which then increases the temperature, which triggers more fusion . . . and so on and so on, in a very short time span. This is the same process, more or less, as in an accretion-powered type Ia supernova. The resulting explosion destroys the object, ejecting matter into space. As with normal Type Ia supernovae, this sort of collision would likely happen in a binary system, with two white dwarfs in close orbits losing energy to gravitational waves and spiraling in (the odds of two unrelated white dwarfs colliding is very, very low). I'm not sure how luminous this event would be in the gravitational wave spectrum; likely fainter than a neutron star-neutron star inspiral but still strong. The speeds of the components could be quite fast, meaning that a lot of energy would be released in the collision. Things are slightly more complicated if the combined mass is less than the Chandrasekhar limit. An example system that is predicted to undergo a collision is SDSS J010657.39-100003.3. The total mass of the two white dwarfs is $\sim0.6$ solar masses, certainly below the limit. In roughly 37 million years (Kilic et al. (2011)), they will collide and form a subdwarf - fusing helium, interestingly enough (compare this to the carbon/oxygen fusion in Type Ia supernova, which in those circumstances is unstable). Similar scenarios could play out in other systems. This sort of a star would not be a ""normal"" star in the sense that it wouldn't truly be on the main sequence - just a bit below it. It would be an O- or B- type subdwarf, less luminous than main sequence stars of the same spectral type. I saw a couple of articles on these objects claiming that they would be stars just like the Sun - it's not true! Given that white dwarfs are highly depleted in hydrogen - remember, they are the degenerate cores of old stars - there can be virtually no hydrogen burning, even in a shell. Core helium burning is the only option. On a final note, one explanation for the formation of R Coronae Borealis variables is the collision of two white dwarfs. I don't think we have solid evidence yet for preferring this over other models (e.g. something involving hydrogen loss from the outermost shell), but if it is the correct pathway, then the answer to your question could be a definitive yes. Note that this would require intermediate-mass white dwarf progenitors."
What is the current accepted theory as to why Venus has a slow retrograde rotation?,"There seem to be a few, and none are accepted by the whole scientific community. The main ones: That final one seems to be the most recent, being proposed by Alexandre Correira and Jacques Laskar in 2001. Their research seems to imply that the conditions on Venus and its distance for the sun make a retrograde spin slightly more likely than a forward one."
"Why does light accelerate instantaneously to c, while no other phenomena do it? [closed]","""Accelerate instantly"" would imply that a photon takes many different velocities at the same point in time. In fact, it would imply that a photon takes on every velocity between $0$ and $c$ simultaneously, but that clearly makes no sense at all - a particle cannot have many instantaneous velocities simultaneously. When a photon is created, it is traveling at $c$. A photon is always traveling at $c$, there is no such thing as a stationary photon which is then accelerated. As an imperfect analogy, consider a pressure wave like sound traveling through air - the pressure wave itself is the movement of energy, you can't have a sound wave that remains stationary and does not move. Similarly, a stationary photon does not exist - if it exists, the electromagnetic wave (which is the photon) must be moving at $c$. As another analogy, consider what happens when you throw a rock into a pond - ripples expand from the point of contact. How fast were the ripples moving before you threw the rock? That's unanswerable, since the ripples did not exist before you threw the rock. The ripples are simply the movement of water, so the ripples require movement - the ripples come into existence already moving."
Quantum Mechanics after the detection of Gravitational Waves,"No more than the observation of light waves disproves quantum mechanics. Light has properties of both a particle and a wave. At low energies, the particle nature of light is hard to detect: radio waves are made of photons, but individual radio wave photons are pretty hard to detect. I'm not sure that we have directly detected individual photons with energies below the infrared band.  Gravitational waves (probably) also have both a wave and a particle nature. The gravitational field is probably quantised. But at the frequencies and sensitivity at which LIGO operates, individual quanta cannot be measured. So this detection does not prove the ascendency of GR over QM. If anything, understanding extreme events like black hole mergers might lead to a theoretical understanding of the quantum nature of gravity."
What keeps galaxies together?,"The galaxy is kept together by the combined mass of the matter in the galaxy, of which the supermassive black hole is a negligible part. There are galaxies that don't have a central black hole (such as the Triangulum galaxy), and they are also held together by their combined mass. In particular, the dark matter of the galaxy is what provides most of the mass that holds the visible matter together. Galaxies usually have far more dark matter than visible matter. This mass is distributed in a roughly spherical shape, with the greatest density towards the centre of the galaxy, and dropping off further from the centre. This ""dark matter halo"" is substantially larger than the visible disc."
"Why is one picture of this star blue with red, and the other red with blue?","They are two pictures of the same object. The Southern Ring Nebula. They look different because we are looking at different wavelengths. The picture on the left is near infrared (about the range 0.7 - 5 $\mu m)$, while the one on the right is mid infrared (JWST is sensitive to up to 30 $\mu m$). Both kinds of light are impossible to see with our eyes, therefore, by definition, they don't have a color. There is no such color as infrared. So how do we display these images on an RGB monitor? Essentially, we are entitled to choose the color we want. Scientists usually choose the color so that the image is (i) clear to read, the important features are highlighted (ii) pleasant to the eye. In this case (but this is not a rule), the longest wavelengths have been displayed in red, and the shortest in blue. Mimicking in some way the fact that in the visible spectrum red has the longest wavelength and blue/violet the shortest. This color coding is useful because a scientist can tell at a glance what regions of the nebula are emitting the longest and the shortest wavelengths. If one also knows what processes emit what kind of light, this gives the picture a clear and immediate meaning. As instance you can tell by looking at the left picture that the central part is mainly ionized gas (blue light, shortest wavelengths) while the external region is dust and molecular Hydrogen (longer wavelengths). In the mid infrared image the colors are reversed, because ionized gas emits more strongly in the red part of mid infrared (thus the central region is red), while in the external region we see hydrocarbon grains that emit in the shortest wavelengths of mid infrared.

Why did it take so long to invent telescopes given glass was used 4000 years ago in Mesopotamia?,"Ancient glass was opaque or at most translucent.  It was also often full of bubbles.  Glass was not even suitable for windows until the first century AD, and even then it was as a means of letting some light in, it wasn't useful for looking through. Lenses were made in Mesopotamia, but using quartz crystal instead of glass, and were costly. Nero is said to have had glasses made from emerald.  Only an emperor could afford such luxury. Transparent glass and the development of techniques to make flat planes of glass date from about 1000 AD and was developed in Venice.  This is just an example of slow evolution of technology.  Making transparent glass requires a pure source of silica and soda ash (or potash, but that comes with other issues), chemistry to supply various oxides that improve transparency, more advanced metallurgy, better furnaces and so on. Transparent glass is said to be the discovery of Angelo Barovier in the middle of the fifteenth century. Glass had developed to a quality that made is a suitable substitute for quartz in lens making by the 16th century, but it was still secret knowledge that few held. The process of grinding and polishing glass to a suitable degree takes time, and needs the development of fine abrasives (or you just end up with lens that is so scratched to be opaque again). It was only after the printing press had been developed that the theory of lens-making became widely known, and the first telescopes were designed. Even then, the idea of using a telescope at night wasn't immediate.  The people making lenses weren't the same as the people who tracked the planets. Lenses for telescopes need to be an order of magnitude better in quality than lenses for correcting long-sightedness. The glass does have to be shaped and polished very precisely. The technology and skills required for this were not fully developed and shared before 1600. sources: Ancient glass

What's the map on Sheldon & Leonard's refrigerator of?,"It's the Beethoven basin region on Mercury.

The image is taken from abstract number 1913 submitted to the 2012 Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, by Frank Preusker and colleagues. 
NASA / JHU APL / Carnegie Institution of Washington A collage of MESSENGER photos from 2011 debuted on the Apt. 4A freezer door around the same time.

Is it possible for a lunar eclipse to occur before sunset,"Yes, barely. The atmosphere bends light, especially at rise and set. When the sun appears to be on the horizon, it is actually about a degree below the horizon. This means that when the sun and moon are actually aligned they would both be visible. You can simulate this in Stellarium (or another planetarium system that simulates atmospheric effects) Set the time to a MJD of 61102.43689, (2026-03-03 10:29:07 UTC) the location to N 30° 38' 55.14"", E 111° 52' 48.64"" and use ""Zero Horizon"" (rather than the default picture of a field). There will always be some locations at which the moon is rising during an eclipse, so this is quite common. But actual locations on land where both horizons are visible and the air is clear enough to see the moon that low are rare. This is strictly an atmospheric effect, it wouldn't be possible if the Earth had no atmosphere.   This was observed by the French astronomer Antoine-François Payen, described in his 1666 treatise Selenelion ou apparition luni-solaire en l'isle de Gorgonne.  The word ""Selenelion"" (a portmanteau of Greek selene + helion, ie ""moon-sun"") has been occasionally been used in English to describe this phenomenon."
Are binary neutron star mergers needed to explain the abundance of gold?,"The creation of some very heavy neutron-rich elements, like gold and platinum, requires the rapid capture of neutrons. This will only occur in dense, explosive conditions where the density of free neutrons is large. For a long time, the competing theories and sites for the r-process have been inside core-collapse supernovae and during the merger of neutron stars. My understanding is that it has become increasingly difficult for supernovae to produce (in theoretical models) sufficient r-process elements to match both the quantity and detailed abundance ratios of r-process elements in the solar system (see for example Wanajo et al. 2011; Arcones & Thielmann 2012). The conditions required, particularly a very neutron-rich environment in the neutrino-driven winds, are just not present without the fine tuning of parameters (see below). Instead, the models invoking neutron star mergers are much more robust to theoretical uncertainties and successfully produce r-process elements. The question mark appears to be only over their frequency at various times in the evolution of a galaxy and exactly how much enriched material is ejected. The announcement of GW170817 makes this all more plausible. A neutron star merger has been seen. The behaviour of the optical and infrared emission after the event matches the expectations of merging neutron star models (e.g. Pian et al. 2017; Tanvir et al. 2017). Of particular note is the developing  opacity and fading in the blue and  visible, with the spectrum 
becoming dominated by the  infrared with broad spectral features. This is the expectation for an expanding cloud of material that is heavily polluted by the presence of lanthanides and other r-process elements (Chornock et al. 2017). The reasonable agreement between the observations and models suggests that indeed a large quantity of r-process elements were produced in this explosion. To go from there to the claim that the origin of gold is solved (as claimed in the press conference) is a step too far. The amount of r-process material produced has large uncertainties and is model-dependent.
The rate of mergers is only constrained to about an order of magnitude in the local universe and is not measured/known in the early universe. What could be said is that this channel for r-process production has been directly observed and so must be taken into account. On the other hand, r-process production by the supernova channel is not yet ruled out. Some simulations at least, that involve rotation and magnetic fields appear to be still ""in the game"" (e.g. Nishimura et al. 2016). It could be that the presence of significant r-process material in very old metal-poor stars requires a supernova channel, since the merger of neutron stars takes some considerable time to occur (e.g. Cescutti et al. 2015; Cote et al. 2017). The overall picture is still uncertain. A review by Siegel (2019) concludes that the best fit to the available evidence is that some rare type(s) of core collapse supernovae (known as ""collapsars"") are still the best bet to explain the Milky Way r-process elements. The primary evidence for this is the presence of Europium (an r-process element) enhancements in some very old halo stars and the general trend of decreasing Eu/Fe with increasing Fe, suggesting a more alpha-element-like production site for the r-process - i.e. supernovae."
Trying to identify something I saw in the sky,"This is a rocket starting its engine. More specifically, this was SpaceX Falcon 9 B1061.9 launching the Globalstar FM15 mission on June 19, 2022 at 4:27 UTC (0:27 EST). The specific event from this launch that you observed was SES-3 (Second stage Engine Startup 3), i.e. the 3rd and final firing of the second stage engine. This is done to boost the sattelite into its final orbit, and indeed occured around 2:15 AM EST. 6 minutes after this event, the sattelite was deployed from the rocket. The ""ring"" and ""puff"" you saw are the exhaust gases of the rocket, and the ""small light"" is the rocket engine itself. Since at that moment the rocket was slightly over 1000km in altitude, it was high enough for these gases to be illuminated by the sun, even though at ground level it was still the middle of the night."
"Pluto's orbit overlaps Neptune's, does this mean Pluto will hit Neptune sometime?","No, Pluto is a so called resonant trans-neptunian object; the orbital period of Pluto is almost exactly 3:2 (1.5) times that of Neptune. This means that every time Pluto nears perihelion and is therefore closest to the Sun and also closest to the orbit of Neptune, Neptune is always at a specific angle (50° according to Wikipedia) in front or behind Pluto.

Is this photocomposition of Andromeda's galaxy and the Moon accurate?,"The Andromeda Galaxy's angular size is about 178x63 arc-minutes and the Moon is about 31 arc-minutes wide. Relatively speaking, the Andromeda Galaxy's apparent size is nearly 6x2 Moons. So from the photo, their relative sizes in the sky appears to be very roughly accurate. The galaxy appears to have been superimposed from another image just to show what the galaxy might look like in the sky if it were brighter."
Why didn't the Big Bang produce heavier elements?,"I think that your thought process is flawed in that you assume that by drastically increasing the temperature you are guaranteed to get heavy elements. As odd as this may sound, this isn't the case (especially during the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)) for a few reasons. In fact, if you took a hydrogen-only star and made it go supernova, you wouldn't get heavy elements like you see in current stars going supernova. BBN Timescale One major point to consider is that the BBN era is calculated to be only ~20 min long. That isn't really much time to form elements. Sure, supernovae happen in an instantaneous flash, but there are other things going on there, which I'll get to in a second. The main point here is that fusing takes time and 20 min isn't that much time to form heavy elements. Deuterium To get heavy elements, you need to build up to them. You can't just smash together 50 protons and 50 neutrons and get tin. So the first step is to smash together a proton and neutron to get deuterium, but here you already run into a problem known as the deuterium bottleneck. As it turns out, the huge temperatures actually (and somewhat counterintuitively) impede the creation of deuterium. This is mainly because the deuteron will end up having so much energy that it will be able to overcome the binding energy (and deuterium has pretty low binding energy being that its only two nucleons) and will likely break apart again. Of course, given the density and temperature you can still get a good amount of deuterium simply by force of will, but not as much and not at the rate you'd expect otherwise. Another point that makes deuterium form less frequently that you'd naïvely expect is that the proton to neutron ratio before BBN was about 7:1 due to the proton being more favorable to be created since it has a slightly lower mass. So 6 out of 7 protons didn't have a corresponding neutron to combine with and had to wait for deuterium to form first before it could combine with anything. Tritium, Helium, Lithium, Oh My! Deuterium is then the catalyst for forming all the next stages of particles in your soup. From here you can throw them together with various other things to get $^3\mathrm{He}$, $^3\mathrm{H}$, and $^4\mathrm{He}$. Once you've got a good amount of deuterium, tritium, and helium isotopes floating around, you can start making lithium and if you're lucky a bit of beryllium. To Boron and Beyond But now, once again you run into a bottleneck, and one more severe than the deuterium bottleneck. You can't easily jump to heavier elements with what you have on hand. The next fusion chain, and the way stars do it, is the triple-alpha process which helps to form carbon but to perform this chain and build up enough carbon you need a lot of time. And we only have 20 minutes! There just isn't time to form the carbon we need to progress along the fusion cycle. As I hinted at the beginning, pure hydrogen stars also wouldn't produce heavy elements upon supernova for this reason. They're able to produce heavy elements now because they've had billions of years before their SN event to build up a base amount of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, etc. that can aid in the heavy element fusion processes. So you don't have the time to follow the triple alpha process and make carbon — what about other processes? Surely the temperatures are high enough that you can do different fusion methods not seen in stars. Well... no. You can't even smash together lots of $\mathrm{He}$ or $\mathrm{Li}$ to get really heavy elements because of the fact that heavy nuclei are only stable if they have way more neutrons than protons. And we already said there was a big neutron deficiency early on so the chance you have enough neutrons hanging around to smash together to get, say $^{112}\mathrm{Sn}$ (that's tin with 62 neutrons), is pretty small. What's more, you can't even try to either skip carbon by making something slightly heavier or form something intermediary between lithium and carbon. Again, this is because of stability issues. So with no other options, you have to shoot for carbon after lithium, and as stated above, you just don't have time for that. TL;DR Overall, BBN is limited to getting only to lithium because of limited time, proton to neutron abundance ratios, and fusion bottlenecks that slow things down. All these come together to produce ~75% $^1\mathrm{H}$, ~25% $^4\mathrm{He}$, ~0.01% $^2\mathrm{H}$ and $^3\mathrm{He}$, and trace amounts of $\mathrm{Li}$."
Which of the planets would be detected if they were exoplanets?,"The distance moduli at 5, 500, 50,000 and 5,000,000 are -4.1, 5.9, 15.9 and 25.9 respectively. We add that to the absolute visual magnitude of the Sun, 4.8, to get apparent magnitudes of 0.7, 10.7, 20.7 and 30.7 respectively. Most planets are detected by the Doppler wobble in the parent star or if the planet transits in front of the parent star. Some are detected by direct imaging, but these are planets much larger than Jupiter, orbiting at much greater distances than Jupiter (although see below). Both the main detection techniques require relatively bright stars. The Doppler wobble technique relies on measuring small velocity shifts. These would be of the order of 10 m/s caused by Jupiter, but only 7 cm/s caused by the Earth. To claim a detection requires observing the star over two orbits (at least). Current technology would easily detect Jupiter, probably Saturn, but possibly not the Earth, if you observed for long enough. But to collect enough photons requires a star brighter than about 13-15 mag. So only your closest distances are possible. The transiting technique has found (large) planets around stars a little fainter than this, but these tend to be in short period orbits. No Jupiter-like (in terms of size and orbit) have been founds by transits and no Earth-like ones either. You could just detect a Venus-like planet for your closest two distances. There is also the factor of orientation to consider. The probability of alignment such that a transit occurs is something like stellar radius/planet orbit radius. For Venus this about $6\times 10^{-3}$, and even more unlikely for the more distant planets. So my conclusion is yes, you would detect planets at the first two distances using the Doppler wobble technique (providing you observed for 20 years or so). But you wouldn't see anything by looking for transits, unless you were very lucky and spotted Venus, again at your closest two distances. More information and detail

If Alpha Centauri A's solar system exactly mirrored our own, what would we be able to detect? Note added. There are currently instruments probing Alpha Centauri for planets, by direct imaging. This corresponds to your first distance. I need to check their sensitivities... There is also a possibility in the near future (with SKA) of detecting radio emissions from an Earth-like planet/civilisation at the first of your distances.

"How far is the Earth/Sun above/below the galactic plane, and is it heading toward/away from it?","Humphreys & Larsen (1995) suggest, using star count information, a distance of $20.5 \pm 3.5$ pc above the Galactic plane; consistent with, but more precise than the Bahcall paper referred to by Schleis.  Joshi (2007) is more guarded, investigating some systematic uncertainties in the estimation techniques and ends up with distances between 13 and 28 pc above the plane.
This paper gives an excellent review of the topic in its first couple of pages. The Sun moves at about 15-20 km/s with respect to a local standard of rest defined by the general motion of stars in our vicinity around the Galaxy. In three-dimensions, this ""peculiar velocity"" is $U=10.00 \pm 0.36$ km/s (radially inwards), $V=5.25 \pm 0.62$ km/s (in the direction of Galactic rotation) and $W=7.17 \pm 0.38$ km/s (up and out of the plane).  (Dehnen & Binney 1998) The Sun executes oscillations around its mean orbit in the Galaxy, periodically crossing the Galactic plane. I borrowed this illustration (not to scale!) from http://www.visioninconsciousness.org/Science_B08.htm to show this oscillatory motion.
As the Sun is currently above the plane and moving upwards, and each cycle takes about 70 million years with an amplitude of 100pc (Matese et al. 1995), it will be roughly 30 million years before we cross the plane again.  EDIT: An update. A new analysis by Karim & Mamajek (2016) yields a distance above the plane of $17.1 \pm 5$ pc and they provide a meta-analysis of previous analyses that gives a median distance of $17.4 \pm 1.9$ pc. They also refer to a paper by  Schonrich et al. (2010) that gives the velocity away from the plane as $7.25 \pm 0.37$ km/s (though with an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.5 km/s)."
"If dark matter bends light, how do we know the stuff in the sky is where we think it is?","The local dark matter density is actually quite tiny, on the order of $\rho\sim10^{-19}\text{ g/cm}^3$ (see e.g. Bovy & Tremaine (2012)). This means that there is roughly $0.001$-$0.01M_{\odot}$ of dark matter per cubic parsec - a staggeringly small amount. 1000 cubic parsecs would contain about one solar mass of dark matter - and that's a cube 10 parsecs in length on each side! Now, the distribution of dark matter in galaxies is not homogeneous - it follows, roughly, a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, decreasing in density from the center of the galaxy - but on the scale of parsecs (and certainly in the Solar System), we can consider it to have roughly uniform density. On small scales, then, we have approximate homogeneity and low density. This means that any gravitational lensing effects from dark matter should be extremely low or self-cancelling, arising only from inhomogeneities containing large clumps of dark matter. However, such clumps are unlikely to form solely through dark matter's interaction with itself (if we discount the MACHO hypothesis, which, as far as I know, is not currently favored). On intergalactic scales, however, dark matter can have some effects. Weak lensing is a commonly-observed phenomenon in galaxy clusters, which may have extremely high fractions of dark matter. There are several techniques currently used to model the mass distribution of the lensing galaxy (see the KSB+ method) and to reconstruct the image and position of the original galaxy via deconvolution (see Chantry & Magain; a visual example is given here). I'm not too familiar with either technique, though, so I can't give you a good overview. Even large-scale lensing has large mass requirements. zephyr pointed out that the foreground object that created the Einstein cross contained $\sim10^{10}M_{\odot}$ of dark matter (van de Ven et al. (2010)). That is enormous!"
The moon has just the right speed not to crash on the Earth or escape into space. What are the odds?,"There isn't a ""Goldilocks speed"" for orbit.  If you put two objects in space, and give them a velocity relative to each other, then provided that velocity is less than the escape velocity (at their relative distance) the two objects will orbit each other. Those orbits will be elliptical, and it is possible that the ellipse is skinny and ""eccentric"" enough for the two bodies to collide when they are closest to each other. But for an object that is several hundred thousand km from Earth, there is a quite a wide range of possible elliptical orbits. So when (and if) the grand collision happened, there was a huge amount of matter that was ejected up into space.  Some probably was moving so fast that it escaped, Some certainly went into orbits that didn't have enough energy and so were small skinny ellipses and the matter fell back to Earth.  But there was a lot that ended up in some kind of elliptical orbit.  This matter was not all in the same orbit, but it started to coalesce, and form into a single ball, under its own gravity. Other moons weren't formed like this, they either formed at the same time as their planets as a ""mini solar system"" (such as the four major moons of Jupiter) or they were captured from the asteroid or Kuiper belts).  Initially, the captured moons may have had rather elliptical orbits. But most moons are in rather circular orbits.  Even if the moon was originally in an elliptical orbit, tidal effects will tend to make the orbit more circular.  A planet and moon system has a certain amount of angular momentum and a certain amount of energy.  The angular momentum can't change, but energy can be converted into heat and since tides dissipate some energy as heat, the orbit will tend to change to a shape that minimizes energy, for a given amount of angular momentum.  That shape is a circle.  (See Is the moon's orbit circularizing? Why does tidal heating circularize orbits?) So the effect of tides is to give moons the ""Goldilocks speed"" that keeps them in a circular orbit."
How did Eratosthenes know that the sun is far away?,"The sun and the moon go around the observer once a day, Eratosthenes knew that the apparent size of moon doesn't change.  This must mean that Alexandria is near the centre of the moon's orbit.  But the apparent size also doesn't change when viewed from anywhere.  So everywhere is close to the centre of the moon's orbit.  Thus the moon must be much further than the radius of the Earth. If the moon were 6000 miles from the Earth, then it would seem to grow and shrink in size as it passed by (such an effect can be seen on Mars, where the moon really does orbit close to the planet) And the Sun is further still. At half moon, the sun seems to be at $90^\circ$ to the moon.  This is only possible if the sun is much further away than the moon. In conclusion, the distance to the sun must be very very large in comparison to the radius of the Earth, and we can assume that that the rays of light from the sun are parallel."
What is this web on the surface of the Sun?,"The dark lines are colder areas at the edge of the convection cells, where the cooled down plasma sinks towards the inside of the Sun. Now ""colder"" for the surface of the Sun, is still pretty hot, as explained here.  The yellow parts are where the plasma rises to the surface. 
Each yellow spot (which is actually the size of a country) is called a granule, and this web-like appearance is called granulation.  In the outer part of the Sun (the convection zone in the image below), there is convection, that is hotter plasma floats towards the top, cools down at the surface, and sinks back down, like in a lavalamp.   The existence of a convective zone in the outer part of the star is determined by the mass of the star, and all stars with a convective zone in their upper layer are thought to have such granulation patterns. So stars like our sun, or smaller have these patterns.  For larger stars, though, the convective zone is in the inner part of the star, and the outer part of the star is the radiative zone, so there might not be the same patterns on the surface. "
Could liquid water have existed in open space 15 million years after the Big Bang?,"Let's interpret your question to be about whether the conditions would permit blobs of water to remain liquid, whether or not water existed yet. And the answer is No, because the pressure was by then far too low. Basically, space was already a vacuum, just not as hard a vacuum as intergalactic space is now. It is appealing to imagine an era when the universe was simultaneously dense enough and cool enough for liquid water (and thus perhaps humans) to exist. But alas it is not so. At the time of the creation of the cosmic microwave background, around 370 thousand years after the Big Bang, the temperature was around 3,000K, but the pressure was around $10^{-17}$ atmospheres (see the Wikipedia article Chronology of the Universe, and search for ""Recombination"")."
How early could we detect an asteroid the size of the one that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs?,"It could be as little notice as a few days. There is a large variation in the amount of warning we would have before an asteroid strike similar in energy to Chicxulub.  Let’s examine the case in which we would have the least warning. The lower bound to the estimated energy released by the Chicxulub collision is 1.3e24 joules https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater#Impact_specifics.
We know the object ‘Oumoamoa was moving at about 50km/s at 1 au from the sun https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBOumuamua , which is the distance of the earth from the sun.  The earth itself is moving at about 30 km/s with respect to the sun, so if they struck in opposition,  the difference in velocity could be 80 km/s. For kinetic energy impact, we know $e=1/2*mv^2$, or energy = 0.5*mass times the square of the velocity.  So $m=2e/v^2$, so m is approximately 4e14kg.  If we assume an asteroid a bit denser than iron at 1e4 kg/m^3, then the volume of the asteroid is 4e10m^3.  If we assume the asteroid is a sphere, then since the volume of a sphere is $V=4/3\pi r^3$, then the radius is $r^3 = (3/4*V/\pi)$ or $r$= 2.121km.
Let’s assume the asteroid is matte black so it hardy reflects any light, give it an albedo of 0.02.  Then the absolute magnitude of the asteroid of this size and albedo at 1 AU from an observer is 17, using the tables here https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/ast_size_est.html.  Let’s suppose that we spot the asteroid when it is much much brighter than at one AU (or 1.5e8 km), with the same apparent magnitude as Pluto (magnitude 14).  Since magnitude is a log scale, that is $2.5^3 = 16$ times as bright. Brightness varies as square of distance, so the asteroid will be at $1.5e8/4$, or 3.75e7 km away from earth when it’s spotted.  At 80 km/s relative velocity, the time from seeing it to impact is 4.6875e5 seconds, or about 5.4 days. Notes: The above outlined scenario is almost impossibly unlikely. A much more likely scenario is that an asteroid from our known asteroid belt strikes earth, in which case we would probably know it was going to collide years before the strike. The object Oumoamoa was classified as an asteroid rather than a comet due to its lack of corona, but now it has an ‘I’ designation for the first Interstellar object which is neither a comet nor an asteroid.  One could argue that I shouldn’t use it as an example given that the question asks about asteroids, but I think it is perfectly reasonable. We don’t ever know a collision with 100% accuracy.  There is always error in our orbit estimations.  We can’t even tell if satellites are going to collide in earth orbit, it’s just probabilities. I don't have a good idea of how long a new object of a certain apparent magnitude will be in the night sky before it's discovered by someone.  If someone thinks we would notice this object sooner due to transits or some other reason, I may amend this answer."
What is a parsec and how is it measured?,"A parsec is approximately 3.26 times a light year or 206,265 Astronomical Units (AU). According to ""Cosmic Reference Guide"" (Caltech), the word 'parsec' stands for ""parallax of one arc second"", and is (according to the website): the length of the long leg of a right triangle, whose short leg is one astronomical unit when the angle between the Sun and the Earth, as seen from an object in space (a star for example), is one arcsecond Illustrated (from the link above): "
Is the universe considered to be flat?,"I think the reason you're suffering from conflicting sources is that you're mixing both new and old, out-of-date pieces of information. First off, the book you cited was published in 2001 - 15 years ago - and the other article you cite was published in 1999 - 17 years ago. There's been a lot of work done in the past 15 years, often under the term ""precision cosmology"", in an attempt to really nail down the precise content, shape, size, etc. of our Universe. By the early 2000's we pretty much knew the science behind everything (we knew about dark matter, dark energy, had well-developed theories on the Big Bang, etc.) but what we didn't have, were good, solid, believable numbers to put into these theories, explaining why the flatness of the universe was still contested in your sources. I'll direct you to two incredibly important observatories which have been paramount in achieving our goal of having ""good numbers"". The first is the Wilkinson Microwave Anistropy Probe (WMAP), launched in 2001, and the second is the Planck satellite, launched in 2009. Both missions were designed to stare intently at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation and try to sort out the treasure trove of information which can be gleaned from it. In this vein, you might also come upon the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), launched in 1989. This satellite had a similar purpose as the other two, but was not nearly as precise as the later two missions as to provide us with good numbers and definitive statements by the early 2000's. For that reason I'll mostly focus on what WMAP and Planck have told us. WMAP was a hugely successful mission which stared at the CMB for 9 years and created the most detailed and comprehensive map of its day. With 9 years of data, scientists were really able to reduce the observational errors on various cosmological quantities, including the flatness of the universe. You can see a table of their final cosmological parameters here. For the flatness, what you want to do is add up $\Omega_b$ (the baryonic matter density), $\Omega_d$ (the dark matter density), and $\Omega_\Lambda$ (the dark energy density). This will give you the overall density parameter, $\Omega_0$, which tells you the flatness of our universe. As I'm sure you know from your sources, if $\Omega_0 < 1$ we have a hyperbolic universe, if $\Omega_0 = 1$ our universe is flat, and $\Omega_0 > 1$ implies a spherical universe. From the results of WMAP, we have that $\Omega_0 = 1.000 \pm 0.049$ (someone can check my math) which is very close to one, indicating a flat universe. As far as I know, WMAP was the first instrument to give a truly precise measurement of $\Omega_0$, allowing us to say definitively that our universe appears flat. As you say, the BOOMERanG experiment also provided good evidence for this, but I don't think the results were nearly as powerful as WMAP's was. The other important satellite here is Planck. Launched in 2009, this satellite has provided us with the best high precision measurements of the CMB to-date. I'll let you dig through their results in their paper, but the punchline is that they measure the flatness of our universe to be $\Omega_0 = 0.9986 \pm 0.0314$ (calculated from this result table), again extremely close to one. In conclusion, recent results (within the past 15 years) allow us to definitively state that our Universe appears flat. I don't think, at this time, anyone contests that or believes it is still uncertain. As it usually goes with science, answering one question has only resulted in more questions. Now that we know $\Omega_0 \simeq 1$, we have to ask why is it one? Current theory suggests it shouldn't be - that it should be either enormously small or enormously large. This is known as the Flatness Problem. That in turn delves into the Anthropic Principle as an attempted answer, but then, I'm getting out of the scope of this question."
Why is the observable Universe larger than its age would suggest?,"The easiest explanation for why the maximum distance one can see is not simply the product of the speed of light with the age of the universe is because the universe is non-static.  Different things (i.e. matter vs. dark energy) have different effects on the coordinates of the universe, and their influence can change with time.  A good starting point in all of this is to analyze the Hubble parameter, which gives us the Hubble constant at any point in the past or in the future given that we can measure what the universe is currently made of: $$ H(a) = H_{0} \sqrt{\frac{\Omega_{m,0}}{a^{3}} + \frac{\Omega_{\gamma,0}}{a^{4}} + \frac{\Omega_{k,0}}{a^{2}} + \Omega_{\Lambda,0}} $$
where the subscripts $m$, $\gamma$, $k$, and $\Lambda$ on $\Omega$ refer to the density parameters of matter (dark and baryonic), radiation (photons, and other relativistic particles), curvature (this only comes into play if the universe globally deviates from being spatially flat; evidence indicates that it is consistent with being flat), and lastly dark energy (which as you'll notice remains a constant regardless of how the dynamics of the universe play out). I should also point out that the $0$ subscript notation means as measured today. The $a$ in the above Hubble parameter is called the scale factor, which is equal to 1 today and zero at the beginning of the universe. Why do the various components scale differently with $a$? Well, it all depends upon what happens when you increase the size of a box containing the stuff inside. If you have a kilogram of matter inside of a cube 1 meter on a side, and you increase each side to 2 meters, what happens to the density of matter inside of this new cube? It decreases by a factor of 8 (or $2^{3}$). For radiation, you get a similar decrease of $a^{3}$ in number density of particles within it, and also an additional factor of $a$ because of the stretching of its wavelength with the size of the box, giving us $a^{4}$. The density of dark energy remains constant in this same type of thought experiment.  Because different components act differently as the coordinates of the universe change, there are corresponding eras in the universe's history where each component dominates the overall dynamics. It's quite simple to figure out, too. At small scale factor (very early on), the most important component was radiation. The Hubble parameter early on could be very closely approximated by the following expression: $$H(a) = H_{0} \frac{\sqrt{\Omega_{\gamma,0}}}{a^{2}}$$ At around: $$ \frac{\Omega_{m,0}}{a^{3}} = \frac{\Omega_{\gamma,0}}{a^{4}} $$
$$ a = \frac{\Omega_{\gamma,0}}{\Omega_{m,0}}  $$
we have matter-radiation equality, and from this point onward we now have matter dominating the dynamics of the universe. This can be done once more for matter-dark energy, in which one would find that we are now living in the dark energy dominated phase of the universe. One prediction of living in a phase like this is an acceleration of the coordinates of universe - something which has been confirmed (see: 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics). So you see, it would a bit more complicating to find the distance to the cosmological horizon than just multiplying the speed of light by the age of the universe. In fact, if you'd like to find this distance (formally known as the comoving distance to the cosmic horizon), you would have to perform the following integral: $$ D_{h} = \frac{c}{H_{0}} \int_{0}^{z_{e}} \frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\sqrt{\Omega_{m,0}(1+z)^{3} + \Omega_{\Lambda}}} $$ where the emission redshift $z_{e}$ is usually taken to be $\sim 1100$, the surface of last scatter. It turns out this is the true horizon we have as observers. Curvature is usually set to zero since our most successful model indicates a flat (or very nearly flat) universe, and radiation is unimportant here since it dominates at a higher redshift. I would also like to point out that this relationship is derived from the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric, a metric which includes curvature and expansion. This is something that the Minkowski metric lacks."
What are the odds that the Sun hits another star?,"The distances between stars are HUGE and stars are tiny compared to the astronomical scales of distance between neighboring stars. The sun, is about 0.0000001 or one ten-millionth of a light year. The probability of a star (to be generous, say a $10 R_\odot$ star) colliding with the Sun is tiny. Every star has a different velocity vector and different positions in space-time. The probability that their positions will intersect in a relatively short timescale is almost zero. Imagine throwing a tiny dart, and hitting a bullseye the size of an atom from several miles away. That still is larger than the probability of the Sun and some other star colliding in the near future (5 billion years is a tiny moment of time when it comes to events like these). According to Wikipedia, it takes about 30 trillion years for a star to undergo a close encounter with another star. Even if the encounter is less than 1 AU, the stars would probably just pass by and not do anything special. For a complete collision and merge, you'd need the distances to be much, much smaller, about $0.1 R_\odot$. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future Also, according to Wikipedia: While stellar collisions may occur very frequently in certain parts of the galaxy, the likelihood of a collision involving the Sun is very small. A probability calculation predicts the rate of stellar collisions involving the Sun is 1 in $10^{28}$ years. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_collision#Stellar_collisions_and_the_Solar_System Back to crude math, assuming an uncertainty of 2 AU, the probability given these parameters is equal to: $$\dfrac{5 \cdot 10^9 \text{ years}}{3 \cdot 10^{13} \text{ years} \cdot 10^{24} \text{ stars in the universe}} \cdot \dfrac{0.1 R_\odot}{450 R_\odot} = \dfrac{1}{27,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000} = \dfrac{1}{2.7 \cdot 10^{31}}$$ Warning: This is only a very crude estimate, don't take this as a ""real, super-mathy"" answer. But I still hope this helps. Edit: That equation above is still probably too big. Asked a question about this: If two stars collide, what is the probability that they merge to form a single star?"
Why can't we observe the Oort cloud with a telescope?,"The angular resolution of the telescope really has no direct bearing on our ability to detect Oort cloud objects beyond how that angular resolution affects the depth to which one can detect the light from faint objects. Any telescope can detect stars, even though their actual discs are way beyond the angular resolution of the telescope. The detection of Oort cloud objects is simply a question of detecting the (unresolved) reflected light in exactly the same way that one detects a faint (unresolved) star. Confirmation of the Oort cloud nature of the object would then come by observing at intervals over a year or so and obtaining a very large ($>2$ arcseconds) parallax. The question amounts to how deep do you need to go? We can do this in two ways (i) a back of the envelope calculation assuming the object reflects light from the Sun with some albedo. (ii) Scale the brightness of comets when they are distant from the Sun. (i) The luminosity of the Sun is $L=3.83\times10^{26}\ W$. Let the distance to the Oort cloud be $D$ and the radius of the (assumed spherical) Oort object be $R$.
The light from the Sun incident on the object is $\pi R^2 L/4\pi D^2$.
If we now assume that a fraction $f$ of this is reflected uniformly into a $2\pi$ solid angle. This latter point is an approximation, the light will not be reflected isotropically, but it will represent some average over any viewing angle. To a good approximation, as $D \gg 1$ au, we can assume that the distance from the Oort object to the Earth is also $D$. Hence the flux of light received at the Earth is
$$F_{E} = f \frac{\pi R^2 L}{4\pi D^2}\frac{1}{2\pi D^2} = f \frac{R^2 L}{8\pi D^4}$$ Putting some numbers in, let $R=10$ km and let $D= 10,000$ au. Cometary material has a very low albedo, but let's be generous and assume $f=0.1$.
$$ F_E = 3\times10^{-29}\left(\frac{f}{0.1}\right) \left(\frac{R}{10\ km}\right)^2 \left(\frac{D}{10^4 au}\right)^{-4}\ Wm^{-2}$$ To convert this to a magnitude, assume the reflected light has the same spectrum as sunlight. The Sun has an apparent visual magnitude of -26.74, corresponding to a flux at the Earth of $1.4\times10^{3}\ Wm^{-2}$. Converting the flux ratio to a magnitude difference, we find that the apparent magnitude of our fiducial Oort object is 52.4. (ii) Halley's comet is similar (10 km radius, low albedo) to the fiducial Oort object considered above. Halley's comet was observed by the VLT in 2003 with a magnitude of 28.2 and at a distance of 28 au from the Sun. We can now just scale this magnitude, but it scales as distance to the power of four, because the light must be received and then we see it reflected.
Thus at 10,000 au, Halley would have a magnitude of $28.2 - 2.5 \log (28/10^{4})= 53.7$, in reasonable agreement with my other estimate. (Incidentally my crude formula in (i) above suggests a $f=0.1$, $R=10\ km$ comet at 28 au would have a magnitude of 26.9. Given that Halley probably has a smaller $f$ this is excellent consistency.) The observation of Halley by the VLT represents the pinnacle of what is possible with today's telescopes. Even the Hubble deep ultra deep field only reached visual magnitudes of about 29. Thus a big Oort cloud object remains more than 20 magnitudes below this detection threshold! The most feasible way of detecting Oort objects is when they occult background stars. The possibilities for this are discussed by Ofek & Naker 2010 in the context of the photometric precision provided by Kepler. The rate of occultations (which are of course single events and unrepeatable) was calculated to be between zero and 100 in the whole Kepler mission, dependent on the size and distance distribution of the Oort objects. As far as I am aware, nothing has come of this (yet)."
Age of the universe and time dilation,"The answer is yes time dilation does affect how much time an observer experiences since the big bang until the present (cosmological) time. However there is a certain set of special observers called comoving observers, these are the observers to which the Universe appears isotropic to. For example we can tell the Earth is moving at about 350 km/s relative to a nearby comoving observer by measuring the anistropy in the cosmic microwave background (in fact it causes a relatively large anistropy, the pictures of the CMB you see from WMAP, etc are with this anistropy factored out). One special property of a comoving observer in the Universe is that they maximize the age of the Universe, i.e. no other observer can experience more time since the big bang than a comoving observer (in case you ask there is no observer that minimizes the time since the big bang). When we talk about the age of the Universe we are talking about the age of the Universe from the pov of a comoving observer."
Is it possible to mount a telescope on a plane? Is it beneficial?,"This has been done.  SOFIA takes advantage of the fact that some infrared bands are visible at atltitude, these are attenuated by water in the atmosphere so they're less visible on the ground. There have been infrared observatories before SOFIA: The first use of an aircraft for performing infrared observations was in 1965 when Gerard P. Kuiper used the NASA Convair 990 to study Venus. Three years later, Frank Low used the Ames Learjet for observations of Jupiter and nebulae.[20] In 1969, planning began for mounting a 910 mm (36 in) telescope on an airborne platform. The goal was to perform astronomy from the stratosphere, where there was a much lower optical depth from water-vapor-absorbed infrared radiation. This project, named the Kuiper Airborne Observatory, was dedicated on May 21, 1975. The telescope was instrumental in numerous scientific studies, including the discovery of the ring system around the planet Uranus.[21] The proposal for a larger aircraft-mounted telescope was officially presented in 1984 and called for a Boeing 747 to carry a three-meter telescope. The preliminary system concept was published in 1987 in a Red Book. It was agreed that Germany would contribute 20% of the total cost and provide the telescope. Other airborne astronomy is more incidental. Around solar eclipses, you'll often see some astronomy flights. Some of these are tourism, others perform science. These are usually passenger aircraft temporarily modified (scopes installed that look through the existing windows). These take advantage of the fact you can lengthen the eclipse by flying along its path, and you can reach eclipses in places otherwise inaccessible."
Why there is no smoke around the Sun?,"The sun isn't on fire.   Fire is actually very rare in the solar system.   It requires chemical potential energy, which happens on earth because of life.  Photosynthesis uses solar energy to build things out of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen (and some other elements).   It's these carbon chain structures that are ultimately flammable, and pretty much, only in an Oxygen atmosphere.   Oxygen atmosphere is produced by the same photosynthesis.   The sun's heat comes from nuclear fusion which doesn't make smoke.    Also, the nuclear fusion only happens deep the inside of the sun, the outside is just a thick blanket of molecules - mostly hydrogen.   The sun also isn't transparent.  The light we see from the sun is like the light we see from a red hot piece of metal or lava.   Red hot metal doesn't smoke (unless you drop water on it - which is actually steam.)   The sun, like red hot metal or lava, glows bright because of temperature. In a certain sense, the tail of a comet is kind of like steam being made by the heat of the sun."
"Why did they decide to hit Dimorphos in the retrograde direction rather than prograde; was it a ""coin-toss"" or were there implications for observing?","The original orbital period of Dimorphos was approximately 11.92 hours.  The DART scientists weren't sure how much momentum was going to be exchanged due to the collision since they weren't sure how much would be lost to ejecta. There was a fear that if they hit Dimorphos from a prograde direction, that the orbital period would be increased to 12 hours.  A 12 hour orbital period would not be ideal for studying the results since it would coincide with the Earth's diurnal period.  In addition, the lighting during the collision was considered favorable for observation from Earth for a retrograde strike. From McQuaide et al. [2021], Dimorphos orbits Didymos with a period of 11.92 hours. The planned
retrograde  impact will reduce this orbit period. The retrograde
impact was chosen over a prograde  impact partly because the resulting
increase in the orbit period for a prograde impact  would cause
Dimorphos’s orbit around Didymos to be nearly exactly 12 hours,
synchronized with Earth’s diurnal period. Earth-based observations
would see  Dimorphos in the same configuration each observing
opportunity. A retrograde impact  and resultant orbit period reduction
allows for more unique observations from night-tonight. Finally, the
retrograde impact also provides for better lighting conditions, as it
occurs on the sunlit side of Didymos. Secondary reflection from
Didymos may allow  imaging of the night side of Dimorphos. Here are some geometry figures from the same paper:  As the OP notes, the difference in resultant orbital velocities between a prograde and retrograde strike would have been quite small, and so were not a factor in the decision of collision direction."
A moon in eccentric orbit dipping below Roche limit,"Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 (SL9 for short) is a great example of a moon in a highly eccentric orbit that passes through the Roche limit at periapsis. SL9 was discovered in 1993, but is thought to have been orbiting Jupiter for 20-30 years prior to discovery. It passed through Roche limit of the Jupiter/Comet pair and is thought to have broken apart in July of 1992. The pieces then collided with Jupiter in July of 1994. SL9 had an extremely eccentric orbit ($e \approx 0.9986$), with apojove of almost a 1/3 AU!  This ""loose"" orbit allowed massive orbital perturbations by the Sun at apojove, which eventually led to its demise. Here is a nice figure of its last passes:  Note: In this case, the tidal forces were dominant over the gravitational forces, so the SL9 fragments never came back together once they were broken apart.  But SL9 passed deep into the Roche boundary of Jupiter prior to its collision. This may only be a partial answer to the above question. If SL9 had grazed the Roche boundary just enough to be barely broken apart, I don't know if it would have come back together prior to hitting Jupiter. After SL9 was split apart by tidal forces, as is shown in the above image, the pieces got further and further apart. This is exactly what we expect to happen since the pieces in higher orbit have a slower orbital speed and the pieces in lower orbit have a faster orbital speed. If SL9 had been in a stable eccentric orbit, the fragments would have continued to break up until they were small enough to withstand the tidal forces. Over many orbits, they would spread out and intermingle into an eccentric ring. This may not be the only time an object is first broken up and then later collides with a larger body.  Check out this set of craters on Ganymede! "
Why are there so many binary systems?,"Collapsing gas clouds fragment into multiple cores because the Jeans mass, that determines the minimum mass that becomes gravitationally unstable to collapse, becomes smaller if the cloud is able to contract without heating up too much.  i.e.
$$M_J \propto T^{3/2} \rho^{-1/2},$$
where $\rho$ is the cloud density. Thus if the cloud density can increase but the temperature stays constant(ish), then the Jeans mass shrinks and the cloud becomes unstable to further fragmentation. Multiple systems with $n>2$ are inherently unstable unless they are hierarchical. i.e. a star in a wide orbit around a close pair can be stable, as could two close binary systems orbiting each other. The condition for stability is roughly that the separation of the wider star must be 5-10 times that of the inner pair ([dependent on mass ratios and eccentricities - Eggleton & Kiseleva 1995). In most other cases, what happens is the ejection of other stars from a multiple system, leaving behind a binary system Durisen et al. (2001). What makes a binary stable? We'll what would make it unstable? I'm not sure why you think they should spiral in towards each other. This can't happen unless there is some dissipative mechanism, like tidal interactions. Gravitational waves are ineffective in all but close binaries involving compact stellar remnants. They can't ""break away"" because they are gravitationally bound. EDIT: Note that it isn't true that most systems are binaries. The majority of ""systems"" are in fact single stars. The binary frequency for solar-type stars is about 50% - i.e. as many singles as binaries; but the binary frequency for the much more numerous M-dwarfs is probably around 30% and so single stars outnumber binary systems, though it is not clear whether that is true at birth Duchene & Kraus (2013)."
Can a tectonically inactive planet retain a long-term atmosphere?,"You make the connection that a lack of plate tectonics on a planet indicates a ""dead"" core and thus said planet has no magnetosphere. As such, I'm going to interpret your question as, can a planet without a magnetosphere retain an atmosphere long-term? As proof, I offer up Venus. Venus' Magnetic Field Venus is a planet without a magnetosphere generated by a core. It is thought that the cause for this is Venus' slow rotation rate (of nearly 243 days) and a lack of convection, allowing for bulk motion in the core. As I'm sure you know, you need moving charge to make magnetic fields and Venus' core just isn't moving. As such, we see that Venus is a tectonically dead planet - it's surface is roughly 500 million years old, whereas Earth's surface gets recycled every 100 million years or less due to our plate tectonics. Now, Venus is not entirely devoid of a magnetic field. Ironically enough, it's lack of a magnetosphere allows for the generation of a magnetic field by it's atmosphere. Because the Sun's radiation is more or less directly hitting the atmosphere, Venus has a strong ionosphere. When you get lots of charged particles moving around in an atmosphere, you get a magnetic field. But on the whole, this field is very, very weak compared to a true magnetosphere such as we have on Earth. I found this source which talks a lot about this concept and why Venus doesn't have a magnetosphere. Check it out to get a lot more in depth detail. Venus' Atmosphere So, Venus has no appreciable magnetosphere (or plate tectonics). Why does it have an atmosphere? And boy does it have an atmosphere. The surface pressure on Venus is estimated to be $\sim93\:\mathrm{atm}$. In short, the answer is that the inundation of solar wind against an atmosphere is not necessarily the major contributing factor to atmospheric loss. It can be, but not always. For example, Mercury, another planet with a weak (but non-zero) magnetosphere, has no atmosphere (if it ever did) because it is so close to the Sun that the solar wind likely blew away that atmosphere long ago. Venus on the other hand is far enough away that the solar wind just can't strip the atmosphere. Here I'm going to quote wikipedia directly (emphasis mine). A lack of magnetic field does not determine the fate of a planet's atmosphere. Venus, for instance, has no powerful magnetic field. Its close proximity to the Sun also increases the speed and number of particles, and would presumably cause the atmosphere to be stripped almost entirely, much like that of Mars. Despite this, the atmosphere of Venus is two orders of magnitudes denser than Earth's. Recent models indicate that stripping by solar wind accounts for less than 1/3 of total non-thermal loss processes. Atmospheric Loss If the solar wind isn't the contributing factor in atmospheric loss, what is? The answer to that is a process known as Jean's Escape. To put it simply, for gas particles in the atmosphere to escape into space, they need enough energy to climb out of the planet's gravity well. Some particles will have that energy and thus escape into space. Over time, the atmosphere bleeds off, little by little (this is happening for Earth too!). The factors that contribute to the rate at which a planet loses its atmosphere are such things as the the planet's mass and radius, and the mass of the atmospheric particles. Let's look at Venus. It is comparable in mass and size to Earth and so has a reasonably appreciable gravity well. For something to escape Venus it must be traveling at $10.4\:\mathrm{km/s}$ (compared to the Earth's $11.2\:\mathrm{km/s}$). But, for Venus at least, the important factor there is that the atoms and molecules in its atmosphere are heavy. It is almost entirely ($\sim97\%$) carbon dioxide which has a mass of $\sim44\:\mathrm{amu}$. That means, the chances of such a massive particle getting the energy to escape is pretty small. Out-gassing Just one more point to add to this. One may argue that possibly the atmosphere is/can be replenished continuously, but that won't work here because we're assuming the planet is tectonically dead. You can't really have out-gassing on a planet with no active surface. Conclusion There are many factors that determine atmospheric escape. Different planets will lose their atmospherics for different reasons. However, it is entirely possible for a planet, under the right conditions, to maintain an atmosphere long-term, despite lacking a global magnetosphere. As we can see from Venus, the conditions are generally that the planet should be sufficiently far from the star, its atmosphere should be sufficiently dense and comprised of heavy particles, and the planet itself should be large enough to have an appreciable gravity well. If these conditions are all met, a planet may retain an atmosphere without having a magnetosphere to protect it."
Why does the 70-solar-mass black hole in the LB-1 system challenge current astrophysics?,"There're several pieces of information one needs to understand this. Although stars more massive than 70 solar masses exist, when they become black holes, they usually lose mass in the process. The exact amount of mass lost depends on the metallicity (which is a technical term that describes how much ""metals"" - the astronomer's definition of metals is anything heavier than hydrogen & helium - is in the star). The companion star that we see today is at solar metallicity, so it's probable that the original star (the one that became the black hole) was also at solar metallicity. Unfortunately, that means it shouldn't leave a 70-mass black hole remnant. From the paper: This [70 solar mass black hole] would strongly challenge current stellar evolution models, which only allow for the formation of black holes up to $25 M_{sun}$ at solar metallicity. Where, then, did this 70-solar mass black hole come from? The paper discusses a few alternatives. The obvious one is that two smaller black holes simply merged to form this one. Problem with that is, you still need two 35-solar mass black holes, and 35 is clearly > 25. (In principle you could also have a 25-solar mass black hole merge with a 45-solar mass black hole, but that still leaves the question of where the 45-solar mass black hole came from in the first place.) Note also that this black hole probably didn't arise from neutron stars merging, since neutron stars have a mass limit of about 2 solar masses. Finally there is three black holes merging into one, but this is unlikely: mergers are already rare events, and having two mergers must be even rarer. Here're a few more unlikely explanations I can think of: The paper discusses a couple of more credible alternatives: In any case, the system is now an attractive target for telescopes. Update: there are now several articles claiming an error in the analysis, and that there is no 70-solar mass black hole in this system."
"We know what a nova is, but how?","Following a reference to Darley et al., ApJ 746, 61 (2012) from your Wikipedia link gives a (very technical) discussion of nova progenitors, including distinctions between nova systems where the secondary stars are main sequence or supergiant stars, and distinctions among white dwarfs with different chemistries.
The first sentence of that paper is  A classical nova (CN) outburst occurs in an interacting
  binary system comprising a white dwarf (WD, the primary) and
  typically a late-type main-sequence (MS) star (the secondary)
  that fills its Roche lobe (Crawford & Kraft, 1956). That suggests the 1956 paper is the original proposal for the Roche overflow model of the classical nova.
Like many original-idea papers, it's a pretty clear read.

More modern observations of novae are compared to detailed models of the dynamics of the surface dynamics, models which have been debated vigorously for decades; the current generation of comparisons to data are sensitive to details like the amount of helium accumulating on the white dwarf's surface during the nova event. It seems unlikely that such details could even come close if the underlying assumptions about the basic physics of the erupting star were wrong. Note that a classical nova system can be thought of as a type of contact binary star.
For any reasonable estimate of the size of the giant star, a distance of 10 AU between the two members of the pair seems like an overlarge estimate.
Ten astronomical units of separation viewed from a distance of 50 parsecs is already a gap of 0.1 seconds of arc. I wouldn't expect to see visible-light photographs showing both the giant star and the white dwarf, but rather that all of the information about the binary systems comes from spectroscopy."
How is Uranus' north pole defined?,"From the Report of the IAU/IAG Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements of the Planets and Satellites (2000), section 3: The rotational pole of a planet or satellite which lies on the north side of the invariable plane will be called north, and northern latitudes will be designated as positive. The planetographic longitude of the central meridian, as observed from a direction fixed with respect to an inertial system, will increase with time. The range of longitudes shall extend from 0° to 360°. Thus, west longitudes (i.e., longitudes measured positively to the west) will be used when the rotation is prograde and east longitudes (i.e., longitudes measured positively to the east) when the rotation is retrograde. The ""invariable plane"" in question is the invariable plane of the Solar System. By contrast, the usual convention for quoting obliquity is to use the right-hand rule (fingers curl in direction of rotation, thumb points north). This is inconsistent with the definition used to determine the north pole but people seem to prefer having the rotation period always be a positive number."
When will the number of stars be a maximum?,"TL; DR Somewhere between now and a few hundred billion years time. (For a co-moving volume) Now read on. If stellar remnants are included, then the answer is very far in the future indeed, if and when the constituents of baryons begin to decay. So let's assume  that ""stars"" means those things that are undergoing nuclear fusion reactions to power their luminosity. Let's further assume that the stellar mass function, ($N(m)$ is the number of stars per unit mass) we see in the neighbourhood of the Sun is representative of populations in all galaxies at all times (difficult to make a start, without assuming this). The number of stars that have been born is equal to the sum over time (the integral) and over mass of $N(m)$ multiplied by the rate at which mass is turned into stars in a comoving volume of the universe $\Phi(t)$. We then need to subtract a sum over time and mass of the rate of stellar death in the same comoving volume. The rate of stellar death is the rate of stellar birth at a time $t-\tau(m)$, where $\tau(m)$ is the mass-dependent stellar lifetime. We ignore mass transfer in binary systems and assume that multiples can be treated as independent stellar components.  Thus the number of stars at time $t$ is approximately
$$N_*(t) = \int_0^{t} \int_m N(m) \Phi(t') - N(m)\Phi(t'-\tau(m))\ dm\ dt'\ .$$
To find where this is a maximum, we differentiate with respect to time and then equate to zero. i.e. We look for the time when the stellar birth and death rates are the same. I was going to (and possibly still will) attempt some sort of analytic approximation, but Madau & Dickinson (2014) have done it better and taken into account the metallicity dependence of stellar lifetimes and the chemical evolution of galaxies. The star formation rate peaked about 10 billion years ago, is more than an order of magnitude lower now and is exponentially decreasing with a time constant of 3.9 billion years. The integrated stellar mass is shown in their Fig 11 (shown below). It is still increasing today, but at a very low rate and has not passed through a maximum. The reason for this is that most stars have masses of 0.2-0.3 solar masses and lifetimes much longer than the age of the universe. Even if these stars are added at a very slow rate, their death rate is zero at present.  If star formation did continue at a low-level then the number of stars would only begin to significantly diminish once the stars near the peak of the stellar mass function, that were born at the earliest times, start to die. The lifetime of a 0.25 solar mass star is around a trillion years (Laughlin et al. 1997).  On the other hand if star formation ceased now then the number of stars would immediately begin to diminish. Perhaps we could argue that the current exponential decline will continue and the peak 
will come in another few billion years when stars of 0.8-0.9 solar masses begin dying off. However, that is futurology given that we have no first principles theory that explains the time-dependence of star formation, so I believe the best answer that can be given is somewhere between now and a few hundred billion years time. Note that this answer assumes a co-moving volume. If the question asked is phrased in terms of the observable universe then because the number of stars has nearly reached a plateau, then the answer becomes close to whatever age the volume of the observable universe is maximised. I say ""close to"" because you have to factor in that the observable universe includes stars in distance slices at all cosmic epochs. I am unwilling to undertake this horrendous calculation, but note that the current concordance cosmological model has our observable universe slowly increasing from around a radius of 45 billion light years now, to about 60 billion light years in the far future Davis & Lineweaver 2005, and this may compensate for a slow decline in the number of stars in a co-moving volume."
How many stars and galaxies can be seen by the naked eye?,"In the best sky conditions, the naked eye (with effort) can see objects with an apparent magnitude of 8.0. This reveals about 43,197 objects in the sky. There are 9 galaxies visible to the naked eye that you might see when observing the sky, and there are about 13 nebulae that you might see. Sources:"
"If months are based on the moon, then why are the months longer in the Gregorian calendar than lunation?","Ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians came up with “administrative” calendars of 30 days, that were easier to calculate than “real” lunar months of sometimes 29, sometimes 30 days. At the end of the 12 months, they added five days of religious observances, sometimes positive, sometimes negative. When Julius Caesar conquered Egypt, he knew about the very regular Egyptian calendar and appointed his mathematicians and astronomers (if we can really call them that, as Roman science wasn’t very developed) to discuss with their Egyptian peers and devise a better calendar for the Roman Republic (reminder that Caesar was not the Emperor; the first one was Augustus, his [adoptive] son, and not right away). Eventually, it was decided in Rome that, in order to follow with the seasons, the already-existing Republican Roman calendar was to be modified. It contained 10 months of 29 and 30 days plus a “winter” of 59 days, which became divided in January and February. As Julius Caesar was the one who brought this change, he was “honored” by having a month renamed from Quintilis (“Fifth”) to Julius (our July)—and that month was given 31 days, as well as a few others. Also, the beginning of the year was shifted (at this point or later; it’s not clear) to January, making the “numbered months” off with their new rank—e.g. “October” is not eighth (“octo”) anymore. Caesar’s reform was not well applied, and eventually, Augustus had to enforce the new calendar, and he was also “honored” with a 31-day month, right after Julius’, so that’s how Sextilis (“Sixth”; and it had 30 days) became Augustus (with 31 days). The rest is basically adjusting here and there to make it a total of 365 days at the end of the year, someone sometime having the “brilliant” idea of alternating 30- and 31-day months (a little like nature “alternates” between 29- and 30-day lunar months). Side note… In some languages, the word for Moon and the word for month is the same—it’s already quite similar in English! For example, Romanian has “Luna” for both, and Korean has ”dal.”"
"When stars explode after running out of fuel, why are new stars born from the remnants?","New stars are not formed from the nebulae created when a parent star explodes. In space there is thin interstellar gas and plasma. This gas is buffeted and blown by the solar winds of stars, and the shockwaves of supernovae.  The gas is mostly Hydrogen and Helium. Stars die in two ways.  The most common way is for their outer layers to be blown out into space in a fairly gentle way. This process forms a ""planetary nebula"" The outer layers are formed mostly of hydrogen and helium, but are enriched by other elements. Or stars can die as supernovae. These are much more energetic. Even so, much of the gas blown out is Hydrogen and Helium as it comes from the outer layers of the star, but it will be further enriched by heavier elements. There are different kinds of supernovae with different mixtures of elements. The elements blown off of dying stars mixes with the interstellar gas, enriching it and compressing it.  This mixture of gas is still mostly hydrogen and helium and hydrogen is the main fuel for stars! If the gas is sufficiently compressed (for example by a supernova shockwave) then its own gravity can start to pull it together, ultimately forming stars. So stars are not formed from the iron ""ashes"" of dead stars, but from a mixture of the original Hydrogen fuel that has never been in a star, and the outer layers of stars that are made of ""unburnt"" hydrogen that was blown off the star as it died."
"Is the science in ""Don't Look Up"" realistic?","Short observational arcs present difficulties in orbit determination.  A couple of examples (taken from Wikipedia) : In principle, three observations are sufficient to determine an orbit. But with only a few observations over a limited time, it would be very challenging to establish the orbit with sufficient accuracy to determine that a collision is certain. What could happen is that a short observational arc allows for ""pre-covery"" images to be found. These are photographs of the object at earlier times, which may have been taken for some other purpose and only co-incidentally contain the comet.  Finding pre-covery images allow for much greater accuracy in the orbit determination, and may allow for an Earth impact trajectory to be determined."
Are we really star-stuff from the interior of collapsing stars?,"The straightforward answer is, ""Yes, we are made of star stuff."" Some of it will be from the interior of collapsing stars, some will be from supernovas, some from normal everyday fusion, and some from other processes. The answers from @HDE226868 and @RobJeffries on this question on where heavier elements come from gives good background, including this nugget: The split between r-process and s-process production of heavier than iron (peak) elements is about 50:50. ie They weren't mainly made in supernovae, which is a frequent, incorrect claim. but of most importance is Rob's final point: The relative contributions of various sites to the r-process remains an unsettled matter. You could also read my answers on this topic in Physics Stack Exchange. On following Rob's links I think this provides you with an excellent overall answer (and relative percentages) A more up-to-date visualisation of what goes on (produced by Jennifer Johnson) and which attempts to identify the sites (as a percentage) for each chemical element is shown below. It should be stressed that the details are still subject to a lot of model-dependent uncertainty.
   Looking at C and N - the majority seems to be from dying low mass stars, and Ca and Fe are from exploding stars, which indicates that Carl is not far off the mark."
Which planet came first in our Solar system?,"The planets (probably) formed by the accumulation of planetesimals, and they all formed over roughly the same time span. Inner protoplanets had access to more matter, so they probably were able to accumulate that matter faster. On the other hand, a lot of the matter in the Solar System is volatile, so it's more likely to condense in the colder parts of the protoplanetary disk. Also, gravity favours a ""greedy"" formation mechanism. A more massive protoplanet will tend to accumulate matter faster than a smaller protoplanet in the same region, due to its stronger gravity. Most of the matter in the Solar System outside the Sun is in Jupiter, so it's reasonable to assume that Jupiter was an early winner in the matter gathering contest. There are good reasons to believe that Jupiter actually formed closer to the proto-Sun, migrated even closer, and then migrated outwards when it had accumulated a large fraction of its mass. From Wikipedia, the grand tack hypothesis proposes that Jupiter formed at 3.5 AU, then migrated inward to 1.5 AU, before reversing course due to capturing Saturn in an orbital resonance, eventually halting near its current orbit at 5.2 AU. It's hard to know the details of the formation of our planetary system. Fortunately, we now have a lot of data about other planetary systems, including some young systems that are still in the early stages of formation, and that data helps us refine our general theories of planetary system formation, as well as theories about the formation of our system. However, a lot of that data is fairly crude, and it's biased because it's a lot easier to detect large exoplanets close to their star than small distant ones. We can use computers to test theories of Solar System formation. You set up a mathematical model with a bunch of planetesimals, dust, and gas orbiting the proto-Sun, and then crunch the numbers to see if it evolves into something resembling the real Solar System. If it does, your model might be correct. If it doesn't, you adjust the parameters and try again. This process consumes a lot of computing power, since you need to make accurate gravitational calculations involving hundreds and thousands of objects. So the people doing this research generally run their models many times, looking for solid trends, and to help them weed out effects that are due to errors caused by the modeling calculations. These studies have found that it's quite likely that a lot of planetesimals were ejected into the outer Solar System, or even out of the Solar System's gravitational well and into interstellar space. And of course a lot got thrown into the Sun. One current theory of late system formation is known as the Nice model, originally published in 2005. However, as that article mentions, more recent research indicates that the Nice model needs some adjustments. A study from 2011 claims that there's a high probability that our system originally had 5 giants, but one of them got thrown out of the system. Young Solar System's Fifth Giant Planet?, by David Nesvorny. Recent studies of solar system formation suggest that the solar system's giant planets formed and migrated in the protoplanetary disk to reach resonant orbits with all planets inside 15 AU from the Sun. After the gas disk's dispersal, Uranus and Neptune were likely scattered by gas giants, and approached their current orbits while dispersing the transplanetary disk of planetesimals, whose remains survived to this time in the region known as the Kuiper belt. Here we performed N-body integrations of the scattering phase between giant planets in an attempt to determine which initial states are plausible. We found that the dynamical simulations starting with a resonant system of four giant planets have a low success rate in matching the present orbits of giant planets, and various other constraints (e.g., survival of the terrestrial planets). The dynamical evolution is typically too violent, if Jupiter and Saturn start in the 3:2 resonance, and leads to final systems with fewer than four planets. Several initial states stand out in that they show a relatively large likelihood of success in matching the constraints. Some of the statistically best results were obtained when assuming that the solar system initially had five giant planets and one ice giant, with the mass comparable to that of Uranus and Neptune, was ejected to interstellar space by Jupiter. This possibility appears to be conceivable in view of the recent discovery of a large number free-floating planets in interstellar space, which indicates that planet ejection should be common."
Could we carve a large radio dish in the Antarctic ice?,"Great question! There are many open and active antarctic permanent bases and several antarctic astronomical observatories. There are even major large projects that involve substantial drilling and removal of ice such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The biggest construction project is probably the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station. This is certainly a valid idea to consider and should not be dismissed out of hand by ""Antarctica is hard"". From Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station: The new station included a modular design, to accommodate rises in population, and an adjustable elevation to prevent it from being buried in snow. Since roughly 20 centimetres (8 in) of snow accumulates every year without ever thawing the building's designers included rounded corners and edges around the structure to help reduce snow drifts. Basically I think @PeterErwin's comment summarizes the problem nicely. For more details see their link and also Challenges That Face South Pole Architecture which mentions the following: WIND ICE FLOW ICE CREEP Basically everything is built up on stilts above the surface. This lets wind blow under things and prevents snow drifting which would quickly burry a surface structure. The South Pole Telescope consisting of a 10 meter point-able dish is also built on an elevated platform sitting on stilts to prevent drifting (see below). You could propose heating the entire dish to de-ice and de-snow it regularly, and pumping out the melt water, but power is at a premium at the South Pole. Fuel is flown in on airplanes during a short summer season and burned in electrical generators for power. Building something that requires electrical power to constantly melt drifting snow has serious practical hurdles. At least two very large, single dish telescopes have been built into naturally occurring depressions in local rock: Arecibo at 18.3° N and FAST at 25.7° N latitudes. Both telescope designs have large primary focus structures (small buildings where people can work) suspended high above the ground at the primary focus of the dish, and in order to view the celestial equator and to track objects as the Earth rotates, moveable cables suspended from very tall towers were designed allow these structures to move around by about in two directions by roughly +/-19° and +/-26°. For more on that see this answer to Is there an advantage to the equatorial region of the far side of the moon for a radio telescope or would any crater on the far side work? Arecibo succumbed to deterioration of its cables caused by environmental factors and fell down. Maintaining these kinds of necessary tall structures in the high winds and snow storms at the South Pole would be quite a challenge as well.

How is it possible that we haven't discovered anything in the Oort cloud yet?,"It's not very surprising that no Oort Cloud objects have been detected via occultations. They're extremely rare, even for our most advanced space-based observatories. According to Ofek & Nakar 2010, published about one year after the launch of Kepler, the telescope would be able to detect between $0$ and $\sim100$ occultation events of Oort Cloud objects, assuming that it monitored $\sim10^5$ stars for a time $\tau=3$ years - both of which ended up being underestimates.$^{\dagger}$ Part of the reason for the uncertainty is that the parameters of the Oort Cloud are not tightly constrained. Varying the inner radius $r_{\text{min}}$ from 1000 to 5000 AU, or varying the index $\alpha $ of the number density distribution $n\propto r^{\alpha}$ from $-4$ to $-3$, can produce changes on the expected occultations by a couple orders of magnitude. The problem becomes apparent when you consider that 1) occultations are intrinsically short and infrequent and 2) they're one-off events. It's not the same as detecting a transiting exoplanet, or observing an expected occultation from a minor planet whose orbit is already known. Therefore, it's hard to tell whether an event is a true occultation or simply a glitch of some sort. The second point of the paper was to present methods for validating possible events. Ground-based surveys of Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) have been performed, but they suffer from atmospheric effects, as you might expect. Given that occultations would last on the order of 1 second, atmospheric scintillation becomes a problem for the high-cadence searches required (Alcock et al.). Given that some ground-based surveys just for KBOs a few kilometers across, like the Taiwanese-American Occultation Survey, have returned no detections (Zhang et al. 2008), it might not be surprising that ground-based Oort Cloud searches are also extremely difficult. ${\dagger}$ By comparison, the CoRoT mission, assuming it monitored $\sim10^4$ stars over the same period, was expected to detect essentially no occultations, according to the same analysis."
Is there a theoretical maximum size limit for a star?,"According to current knowledge, yes. If the gas cloud is too massive, the pressure of the radiation prevents the collapse and the star formation. The article Stars Have a Size Limit by Michael Schirber, it's about 150 Solar Masses. However, there's the Pistol Star, which is speculated to be 200 SM.  In the article 'Das wechselhafte Leben der Sterne' by Ralf Launhard (Spektrum 8/2013) there's a diagram with information that when the mass is over 100 SM, the star can't form because of radiation pressure. The exact value of the limit is not speculated in the article. "
How far apart are stars in a binary system?,"Distances ($a$) between binary stars vary wildly, from the order of the radius of the stars, to more than a light-year! The plot below (from here) shows a compilation of several surveys, with the color indicating the method by which they've been detected. Separations are roughly normally distributed in $\log a$, peaking at a typical separation of tens of AU. The corresponding periods have median values of a few hundred years (e.g. Raghavan et al. 2010; Duquennoy & Mayor 1991).  As commented by Oddthinking, if stars are too close we are no longer able to resolve them visually (green bars). But we can still detect them spectroscopically (yellow bars): If we observe the blended spectral lines of two stars, we see the lines shift back and forth as the two stars orbit each other and their light is Doppler shifted. On the other hand, if stars are too far from each other, their orbital periods of several thousand years makes it impractical to observe them orbit each other (we have only observed double stars for some 200 years); instead they're detected because they simply follow the same path through space — i.e. they have a common proper motion (blue bars). As commented by PM2Ring, the fact that the two $x$ axes suggest a 1:1 correspondence between orbital radius and period seems odd — by Kepler's law, this also depends on mass. My random guess is that, because low-mass stars (which are most abundant) are poorly constrained (difficult to observe) and high-mass stars are rare, then most observed binaries are of the order of a Solar mass. If they're not too far from each other in mass, then there is an approximate correspondence."
How did Ole Christensen Romer measure the speed of light?,"Ole Rømer did not measure a change in the frequency of light. He measured an apparent change in the orbital period of Io, one of Jupiter's moons. The orbit of Io can be measured very accurately by observing when it enters or leaves the shadow of Jupiter. When the Earth is moving away from Jupiter, Rømer noted that the orbit of Io appeared to be very slightly longer than when the Earth was moving parallel to Jupiter.  Suppose the orbital period of Io is $p$ seconds. If you are not moving and you observe an eclipse at time $t$, the next eclipse will be at time $t+p$. However, if you are moving away from Io, the next eclipse will be seen at $t+p+x$, where $x$ is the time that light takes to travel from your position at time $t$ to your position $p$ seconds later. The delay over a single orbit was too small for him to measure (about 30 seconds). But the delay was cumulative, and over about 30 orbits of Io, the orbit was delayed by about a quarter of an hour. He noted: [This] appears to be due to light taking some time to reach us from the satellite; light seems to take about ten to eleven minutes [to cross] a distance equal to the half-diameter of the terrestrial orbit.  Of course, Rømer didn't know the actual size of the half-diameter of the terrestrial orbit (the astronomical unit) However putting the modern value of about 150 million km this gives a value of the speed of light at about 220000km/s, which is not so far from the modern value of about 300000km/s"
What is the accepted theory as to why Uranus' axis is tilted so severely?,"Nasa.gov speculates that
the most likely possibility is that an object with a mass close to that of Earth's collided with Uranus, causing it to rotate on its side from then on. A recent test by Space.com suggests that ""Planet Uranus Got Sideways Tilt From Multiple Impacts"". These findings suggest that two or more smaller collisions probably occurred, asserting that the early solar system was probably more turbulent than most would think."
What causes a star to become a pulsar?,"It's generally dictated by how massive the star is. Remember what a pulsar is, it's a very rapidly rotating, highly magnetized neutron star.  Neutron stars are a category of objects which have masses between 1.4 and 3.2 solar masses. This is the end stage of stars which are not massive enough to form black holes (they're held up by neutron degeneracy pressure), but are massive enough to overcome electron degeneracy pressure (which is what prevents white dwarves from further gravitational collapse). "
Amateur observing targets for binary star systems?,"Okay! Here are some of the popular targets, search for the season of visibility yourself please. The above list describes the angular seperation between the stars and also the magnification required to resolve it, both explicitly. So, this list is not only for amateurs, but there are some intermediate ones which you can try if you have a good enough telescope."
Why do some electromagnetic waves continue travelling while others disappear?,"Electromagnetic radiation will continue to travel until it is absorbed.  Some of your wifi signal is escaping to space where it may continue traveling for a very long time. However, the strength of your wifi signal will degrade with distance according to the inverse square law.  So if you double the distance between your device and the wifi transmitter, your signal will be reduced by 3/4. When you move far enough away, eventually your signal will degrade enough that your device will no longer be able to decode the signal.  So the radiation doesn't ""disappear"" but instead, your device will just be able to pick up less of the energy.  Of course, if you separate the device and transmitter by a concrete wall, some of the signal will actually be ""disappearing"" as it is absorbed by the wall. The CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) on the other hand, was not emitted from a point source, and is not subject to the inverse square law.  Instead, as wikipedia points out, the CMB is very nearly uniform in all directions, but the tiny residual
variations show a very specific pattern, the same as that expected of
a fairly uniformly distributed hot gas that has expanded to the
current size of the universe. So one can imagine that wherever we are in the universe, we can point an antenna in any direction and get about the same amount of signal (excepting Doppler shift) from the CMB. Of course, if we point our antenna towards existing matter, we will expect some or all of the CMB to have been absorbed in that direction. In many cases, astronomers can tell a lot about the composition of gas in absorption based on the narrow frequencies of the CMB that was absorbed. Back in the early 2000s, I spent quite a bit of time looking for cosmic formaldehyde in absorption lines of the CMB near the center of our galaxy, as an indicator for early star formation."
Where do we have it from that the Moon is migrating away from Earth?,"There are, I think, at least four parts to this argument: the first being the theoretical argument that ties it all together and the remainder being observational evidence for the Moon's orbit increasing in size. 1. The underlying theoretical argument. This, of course, is the idea that tidal braking causes the Earth to slow down in its rotation and the Moon to move further out in its orbit. (Once upon a time this also caused the Moon to slow its rotation, until it became tidally locked, with its rotation period = its orbital period.) This predicts two things: the Moon should be gradually getting further away from the Earth over time; and 2) The Earth should be slowing down in its rotation (days getting longer) over time. There are at least three sets of evidence supporting this. 1. The increasing distance of the Moon, as derived from lunar laser ranging. The key point here is that it's the average distance that's increasing. Since the Moon's orbit is elliptical, the distance varies over the course of one lunar orbit, and there are additional variations introduced by the gravitational influence of the Sun, other planets, the not-perfectly-spherical shapes of the Earth and Moon, etc. What this means is that if you trace the Moon's distance over time, you will see it increasing and decreasing, but you will also see that the average distance is gradually getting larger. (And this is what has been measured with the laser ranging experiments; e.g., this 1994 article by Dickey et al. which found that semi-major axis of the Moon's orbit was increasing by about 3.8 cm/year.) 2. The slowing down of the Earth's rotation. As required by basic physics, if the Moon is getting further out in its orbit, and thus gaining angular momentum, there has to be a compensating loss of angular momentum, and this happens via the Earth gradually spinning more slowly. This has been measured in at least two ways: A. Timing of historical lunar and solar eclipses. There are Chinese records of eclipses going back to roughly 400 BC, and Babylonian records back to almost 800 BC, as well as more recent Greek, Arab, and European records. These can be used to estimate changes in the length of the day, in two ways. First, some records include an approximate time of day, so we can run our calculations backwards and figure when an eclipse visible at, say, Babylon in 200 BC should have occurred. And even when we only know the day (and location) of an eclipse, we can predict where it should have been visible. As explained by this article describing a 2016 study by Stephenson et al.: ""The oldest event in the catalog, a total solar eclipse that occurred in 720 B.C.E., was observed by astronomers at a site in Babylon (now modern-day Iraq). But, working backward, today’s astronomers would have predicted that the eclipse should have been seen a quarter of a world away, somewhere in the western Atlantic Ocean. The discrepancy means Earth’s rotation has gradually slowed since the 8th century B.C.E."" B. Geological and paleontological measurements of the length of the day.* It turns out there are some geological records which can be used to derive the number of days in a lunar cycle, or the number of days in a year, millions or hundreds of millions of years in the past. One way is via the analysis of ""tidal rhythmites"", which record alternating effects of ocean tides. Since tides have cycles of twice per day (high and low tides) due to the Earth's rotation and twice per lunar orbit (spring and neap tides), you can use the combination to work out how many days there were in a lunar orbit. There can also be yearly variations, which allows you to work out how many days there were in a year when the tidal rhythmites were formed. Another way is by studying certain fossils, where the growth of part of the organism is recorded in both daily and annual variations: for example, the growth of a shell can vary over the course of a day, but also over the course of a year (e.g., more growth in summer, less in winter). Putting this together allows you to figure out how many days there were in a year when the organism was alive. A fascinating recent example is this careful study of a 70-million-year-old fossil of a rudist (an extinct type of mollusc), which reveals that a year had 372 days back then, so that each day was 23.5 hours long instead of 24 hours."
Why don't the inner moons of Jupiter have tidally-induced volcanism?,"It’s because they are much smaller than Io.  Tidal forces are differential forces, that is, they result from the difference in gravitational pull on one side of a body compared to the other.  When an object is small, the difference in distance to the two sides of it is necessarily small as well. According to Wikipedia, Amalthea, the largest of those four innermost moons has a long axis that is only 250 km, and the others are smaller yet. The strength of the tidal heating scales as the body’s radius to the 5th power, quite a strong dependence.   The small mass plays a role, too, but the dependence on radius is stronger. For this same reason, small objects on Earth don’t feel tidal stretching from our Moon, yet the Earth as a whole does. On a related note, the inner three of those four satellites are inside Jupiter’s Roche limit, the orbital distance at which a purely self-gravitating body should be pulled apart by tidal forces.  But they survive because most small bodies aren’t held together primarily by gravity (just as your own body isn’t) - the internal electromagnetic forces between atoms (which manifests macroscopically as the rigidity of the rock) is the main source of the bodies’ structural strength."
"Why is the solstice the first day of summer, and not the central day?","The English word ""summer"" means the season of the year that is associated with higher temperatures and shorter nights.  There is no official ""first day of summer"" and different groups of people take different conventions. One possible convention is to take ""June, July and August"" as summer, so the first day of summer is June 1st.  This is the convention taken by the Met Office in the UK, and roughly corresponds to the warmest temperatures in the UK. (The reason that the warmest temperatures are not around the solstice is nothing to do with astronomy, it is because the surface takes some time to warm up, so there is a lag between the longest day and the highest temperature) Another possible convention is to take June 21st  to Sept 20th as ""summer"".  This fits the solstice and equinox and still roughly corresponds to the warmer days of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.  This is the convention in many modern calendars. Another possibility is to take the ""cross-quarter days"" (named in Gaelic Samhain, Imbolc, Beltane, and Lughnasadh) So summer would be from Beltane/May day to Lughnasadh/Lammas day: May 1st - August 1st.  This matches the shortest nights, but generally, May is cooler than August in the UK, so is not consistent with summer meaning ""warmest season of the year"". The big point here is that, there is no official definition of summer."
Why didn't the Event Horizon Telescope team mention Sagittarius A*?,"There was a mention of Sagittarius A* during the Q+A portion of the press conference; the team indicated that they hope to produce an image sometime in the future (although they were careful to make no promises, and they're not assuming they'll be successful). That said, I'm not wholly surprised that we ended up seeing M87, rather than Sgr A*, for a couple reasons which the team mentions in their first paper: Neither of these are impossible hurdles to overcome, but they're certainly very real difficulties that can't be ignored."
Can a planet with no atmosphere be orbited at extremely low altitudes?,"Yes, but. Firstly the 400km orbits of the ISS are already extremely low, in comparison to the 6400km radius of the Earth.   See https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/ for pictures of orbits.  So if you rephrase in terms of orbital radii it becomes ""We can orbit at 6800km. Can we orbit at 6401.75km?""  And the answer is certainly ""yes"" However take care, because although you said the highest mountain was 1km, is the planet spherical. A rotating planet won't be spherical, because an equilibrium shape will be an oblate spheroid.  The Earth's radius is 20km more at the equator than at the pole.  If you are orbiting an planet like the Earth, but with no atmosphere, and your altitude is 750m above Mt Everest, you might get a surprise when you pass over the Andes, as Mount Chimborazo has a peak that is more than 2000m further from the center of the Earth. But let's say you're being careful about that.  Then you will be able to orbit.  However there is very little margin of error.  Planets don't have a perfectly even gravitational field. Mountains, mantle plumes, mass-concentrations all distort the orbit.  And in the case of Earth, your orbit will also be perturbed by lunar and solar tides.  Now if the gravity of a mantle plume only has to change your velocity by a very small amount to lower  your orbit by 750 m  (which is only about 1 part in 8000) and crash your space craft. So, while arbitrary low orbits are possible in principle, you wouldn't plan to orbit a planet with only a few meters of leeway. What this also means is that you'd be very surprised to find a moon with such a low orbit.  Such a moon would probably not stay in orbit for long."
"Which is brighter, Mars as seen from Earth, or Earth as seen from Mars?","We can use the expression that is commonly used to estimate the apparent magnitude of a planet or asteroid in the Solar System: $$\boxed{m=5 \log \frac{1329}{d \cdot \sqrt p}+5 \log (D_s \cdot D)-2.5\log f(F)}$$ Where: m is the apparent magnitude log is the decimal logarithm d is the diameter in km p is the albedo Ds is the distance to the Sun in Astronomical Units (AU) D is the distance Earth-Planet in Astronomical Units (AU) F is the phase angle f(F) is the phase function As a phase function we will use the usual one: $$f(F)=\dfrac{1+\cos F}2$$ 1. Magnitude of Mars. Opposition (maximum) $d=2\cdot 3389.5$ km $p=0.15$ $D_s = 1.381497$ AU. Mars Perihelion $D=1.381497 - 1.016714$ AU. Mars Perihelion and Earth Aphelion $F=0$ Opposition $$m \simeq -2.97$$ 2. Magnitude of the Earth in quadrature = greatest elongation as seen from Mars $d=2\cdot 6371$ km $p=0.367$ $D_s = 1.016714$ AU. Earth Aphelion $D=\sqrt{1.381497^2 - 1.016714^2 \ }$ AU. Mars Perihelion and Earth Aphelion $F=\dfrac{\pi}2$ Earth at greatest elongation as seen from Mars $$m \simeq -3.21$$ Probably the greatest brightness of the Earth as seen from Mars will not be when the Earth is exactly in quadrature, just as the greatest brightness of Venus as seen from the Earth is not exactly at quadrature but when it is somewhat closer to the Earth. But if already with the Earth in quadrature we obtain $m \simeq -3.21$ that is a greater brightness than $m \simeq -2.97$ we can claim (according to this estimation), that the maximum brightness of the Earth as seen from Mars is slightly higher than the maximum brightness of Mars as seen from the Earth, although the difference between the both is not large. A similar thread: Formula to calculate the apparent magnitude of Earth from arbitrary distances Best regards."
"Why, since Earth is in free fall towards Sun, are tides affected by Sun's gravity? Why aren't the oceans ""weightless"" like astronauts?","Yes, the sun does raise tides in just the same way that moon raises tides. It is the difference in gravity that causes the tide. So it is your point 1 and 2.  The rotation of the earth causes the tides to move, but don't actually cause the tidal force. The Earth also raises tides on astronauts, but an astronaut is so small that the difference in gravity between her head and her feet is tiny, and the tidal effect is consequently also tiny (and negligible) The moon raises tides in the same way. The Earth is is freefall in its orbit with the moon too. Alternatively you can think in terms of a rotating frame of reference. In such a frame, the side of the earth nearer the sun is moving at sub orbital speed, so gravity is stronger than the centrifugal force.  On the other side the centrifugal force is stronger, the effect is to pull water towards and away from the sun."
Why do the planets orbit in the same direction?,"The same reason (almost) all of them rotate in the same direction: because of the conservation of angular momentum. Before a star and its planets exist, there’s just a cloud of disorganized gas and small molecules. The Solar System formed from such a cloud around 4.6 billion years ago.  On that scale, there is some small amount of rotation within the cloud. It could be caused by the gravity of nearby stellar objects, local differences in mass as the cloud churns, or even the impact of a distant supernova. The point is, all molecular clouds have at least a little rotation. In a large system like a molecular cloud, each particle has some angular momentum, and it all adds together across a very wide area. That’s a lot of momentum, and it is conserved as the cloud continues to collapse under its own gravity. That angular momentum also flattens the cloud, which is the reason why the Solar System is near-planar.  When the cloud finally collapses, it forms a star and shortly after planets. However, angular momentum is always conserved. That's why planets all follow the same orbit, and why almost all of them rotate in the same direction. There's nothing to turn them the other direction, so they will continue spinning in the same direction as the original gas cloud. There are a few exceptions, though. Whenever objects formed in such a way that sent them orbiting the opposite direction, they usually collided with objects going in the same direction as the original cloud. This destroyed any outlying objects or sent them in the same direction as the original cloud. Still, two huge exceptions are planets Venus and Uranus. Uranus spins on an axis of almost 90-degrees (on its side). Venus meanwhile spins the opposite direction as Earth and the other planets. In both cases there is strong evidence that these planets were struck by large objects at some point in the distant past. The impacts were large enough to overcome the angular momentum of the bodies, and give them a different spin. There are also a range of other theories; for example, some astronomers think that Venus may have been flipped upside-down. Point is, there were irregular events that happened to both of these planets."
How does gravity really work,"First of all: ""How gravity really works"" is a deep question, and any serious scientist would quickly concede that all we have is an incomplete working model. You certainly have heard about  General Relativity; the first image on the page is your trampoline.  Our working model, General Relativity, is working because it explains a lot of observations very nicely. (Careful, here is another deep question lingering: ""Explains"" means that we can predict some observations from other observations with the model of gravity we have in our  mind. It does not necessarily mean that we understand the ""real nature"" of the underlying issues.) But we are very confident that the model is working over a wide range of observations. One of the last ""first-time"" observations which followed the predictions and thus gave us more confidence in the model was the two black holes colliding lately. Lately? Well, billions of years ago. We just learned about it lately.  Here is a link to a New York Times article with an impressive video. (I think one can still read a limited number of Times articles for free, so try it out.) Our model of gravity is incomplete because it doesn't connect well to the model of nature we have for other things (elementary particles, quantum physics). For a while (like 70 years or so) it didn't connect at all; Einstein himself completely failed to connect the dots, which was probably not encouraging since he had received the Nobel Price for laying one of the foundations of quantum physics and was the obvious authority about gravity. If he couldn't do it, who could? If I'm not mistaken, the physicists today are making progress, slowly. This connection between quantum physics and gravity is one of the main unresolved problems in modern physics. Last, let me address your concern about the planets spiraling into the sun. This idea probably comes from actual balls on an actual trampoline spiraling in, I suppose. You probably know that the balls lose speed due to friction, much the same way you slow down on your bike when you stop pedaling. Some of the kinetic energy is transformed into heat.  And you know what? You are right. Given enough time, the planets would eventually fall into the sun. Low-flying satellites fall back to earth after a few years, because there are still traces of atmosphere slowing them down out there. The reason is that there is ""friction"" in the wider sense involved in all large-scale processes in the universe. That is actually one of the fundamental physical principles making up the world we know. It's just that the near-vacuum between the planets doesn't provide that much friction, and the planets are fairly massive bodies with an enormous mass and kinetic energy. It will take a long long time for them to lose enough energy that they'll be so close as to touch the sun. (Perhaps too long to happen at all.) In fact, over human life times the planets, moons and stuff are almost perfect examples for movement without friction. But in the astronomical time scale -- billions of years --, there certainly is friction. For example, the moon is showing us always the same side because friction slowed its rotation so that the rotation is now ""locked"" with its orbit. Bottom line: The idea that gravity bends space and time ""explains"" all large-scale observations so far; the ""trampoline"" is a good model for a 2-dimensional ""space"", i.e. a surface, if you ignore friction. "
Why is the summer solstice night shorter than the winter solstice day?,"Why is the summer solstice night shorter than the winter solstice day? Aside: If you use your sunrise / sunset calculator you will see that day and night are not equal at the equinoxes. The reason for this disparity is the same as the reason for disparity between the length of shortest summer night versus the length of the shortest winter day. The disparity is primarily a consequence of how sunrise and sunset times are defined and calculated. The calculated sunrise time is defined as the moment when the top of the Sun is expected to first appear above the flat horizon. Similarly, the calculated sunset time is defined as the moment when the top of the Sun is expected to finally sink below the flat horizon. The two key factors that lead to the noted disparity are that Adding the sun's apparent radius and typical refraction angle results in the center of the Sun being 50 arc minutes (0.833 degrees) below the horizon at the calculated times of sunrise and sunset. These two factors account for almost all of the observed disparity between the shortest summer night and the shortest winter day. Most sites do not go beyond the standard 50 arc minutes below the horizon calculation, so on those sites (which is the vast majority of sites that calculate sunrise / sunset times), those two factors alone account for all of the observed disparity. User d_e made a great comment, which is that the effect depends strongly on latitude. At the equator the path of the center of the Sun at sunrise and sunset is always perpendicular to the horizon (ignoring atmospheric refraction). Even after accounting for the non-zero diameter of the Sun and atmospheric refraction, the path of the Sun is very close to vertical at sunrise and sunset. The 100 arc minute offset (2*50 arc minutes) amounts to a small time difference. Aside: The longest days at the equator occurs on the equinoxes rather than the solstices, which is when the days are shortest. Looking at locations outside of the tropics and the polar regions, the longest and shortest days are always on the June and December solstices in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa in the southern hemisphere. Latitude has a significant effect as sunrise and sunset occur at increasing angles with respect to the vertical as absolute latitude increases. As an extreme, consider Rovaniemi, Finland. This town is located just south of the polar circle. The most recent sunrise was at 1:31 AM on 6 June 2022. The next sunset won't be until 1:04 AM on 7 July 2022. That's nearly a 31 day long ""day"". A portion of the Sun remains just above the horizon even at local solar midnight during that 31 day long interval. On the other hand, a portion of the Sun will appear above the horizon on the December solstice for over 2 hours and 14 minutes. There are multiple issues with this standard 50 arc minute offset. A lesser issue is that the Sun does not always appear to be 32 arc minutes across. The eccentricity of the Earth's orbit makes this apparent size vary. A much bigger issue is the 34 arc minutes used for calculating atmospheric refraction. The 34 arc minutes used for atmospheric refraction is based on the average environmental lapse rate (how much temperature drops, on average, with increasing altitude) of 6.5 kelvins/kilometer. On a very nice day the lapse rate can be much closer to the dry adiabatic lapse rate of 9.8 kelvins/kilometer as opposed to average environment lapse rate. On a rather nasty day with a temperature inversion (lots of smog, fog, low clouds, etc.), the lapse rate can be close to zero, or even negative. The variation in lapse rate can make calculated sunrise and sunset times off by five minutes. That said, there is no way to calculate sunrise/sunset times for anywhere on the Earth and for years into the past / into the future without using a canned value for atmospheric refraction (and for the Sun's apparent radius). So that's what those websites do. Finally, if there's a mountain or tall building off to your east (or west), the sunrise and sunset time calculations do not account for that mountain or tall building. The websites that calculate sunrise / sunset times assume the Earth is a triaxial ellipsoid with no obstructions."
How much magnification is needed to see the planets of solar system?,"You're probably asking the wrong question - which I am going to answer anyway, and after that I am going to answer the question you should have asked instead. As a general rule, there isn't much point in pushing the magnification above 2x the diameter of the instrument, measured in mm. 3 inch, that's 75mm, that's 150x max. Beyond that limit, even under ideal skies the image is large but blurry. After that, seeing (or air turbulence) pushes that limit further down. Your aperture is small enough that it almost never suffers from seeing, but larger instruments are often affected. It varies greatly with time, place and season. There are times when a 12"" dobsonian, that in theory could do 600x, is clamped down by seeing to 150 ... 180x. There are times when you could take a 20"" dobsonian all the way up to 1000x - but that's very, VERY rare, it's the stuff of legends. Assuming average seeing conditions and instruments of usual size (refractors of 3...4"" aperture, reflectors 6"" or larger), here are some rules of thumb: Jupiter is seen best under mid-high magnification. It's rare that more than 200x is beneficial. This is because it's a very low contrast object, and additional magnification comes at the cost of less contrast, which makes things worse. Saturn works best at high-ish magnification, bit more than Jupiter but maybe not much more. Around 200 ... 250x usually works. It depends on what you do - if you're trying to see the ring divisions, push it a bit higher. Mars can use the highest magnification that you could generate, given the instrument and the conditions. It's a very small object, contrast is not bad, so crank it all the way up. Most instruments are limited by seeing when observing Mars. Moon is the same as Mars. As you can see, magnification is never an issue for you. More magnification will not make it better. In fact, more magnification always means the image is more blurry, not more crisp - it's always a compromise between size and blurriness that decides the optimal magnification. Don't worry, everyone begins thinking that more is always better. Soon enough, experience shows them what's really going on. That being said, I believe it's not magnification that's giving you trouble, but the general condition of the optical stack that you're using. These are things that are extremely important, and yet are ignored by many, many amateurs - and the results are not optimal. Here are a few things that you should investigate: Collimation Is your scope collimated? In other words, are all optical elements aligned on the same axis? The likely answer is no. It makes a huge difference in the scope's performance, especially for planets. Here's a collimated scope, compared to the same scope out of collimation:  Further information on Thierry Legault's site, which is extremely informative. A series of articles and documents regarding collimation: http://www.cloudynights.com/documents/primer.pdf Gary Seronik: A Beginner’s Guide to Collimation Gary Seronik: Collimation Tools: What You Need and What You Don’t Gary Seronik: No-Tools Telescope Collimation Note: Some telescopes (e.g. pretty much all refractors) do not require collimation; they are collimated from factory and hold collimation pretty well. But most reflectors (SCTs, all newtonians including dobsonians, etc) do require this periodic maintenance. Thermal equilibrium At 3"" aperture, this is probably not a big issue, but there's no reason why you should add another problem to the existing ones. Your scope should be at the same temperature as the air around it, otherwise its performance decreases. Take it outside 1 hour before you start observing, and that should be enough for you.  Larger telescopes (around 10"" ... 12"" and larger) should use active ventilation for better cooling (a fan on the back of the mirror). More details here: Gary Seronik: Beat the Heat: Conquering Newtonian Reflector Thermals — Part 1 Gary Seronik: Beat the Heat: Conquering Newtonian Reflector Thermals — Part 2 In your case, simple passive cooling for 1 hour should be enough, but it's worth reading those articles. Focal ratio A 3"" scope, at 300mm focal length, that's an f/4 instrument. That's a pretty steep f/ ratio. Most eyepieces will not do well with such a blunt cone of light, and will start to exhibit aberrations that blur the image. Only very expensive eyepieces work well at such low focal ratios - things like TeleVue Ethos, or Explore Scientific 82 degree eyepieces. Try and keep the planet in the center - most aberrations are lower there. Even very simple eyepieces do better in the middle of the image. Look at the stars. Are they tiny and round in the center, and large and fuzzy at the edge? Those are aberrations from various sources (eyepiece, primary mirror, etc). Coma Of course, at f/4 even the best eyepieces out there cannot do anything about coma - an aberration coming out of any parabolic mirror, which becomes pretty obvious around f/5, very obvious at f/4, and a major problem at f/3. Again, coma is zero in the center of the image, and increases towards the edge.  A coma corrector is used in some cases, such as the TeleVue Paracorr, but I strongly recommend that you DO NOT use one - I suspect your instrument is aberrating in ways that overwhelm coma anyway. Jupiter would not be too blurry even at full f/4 coma at the edge. This paragraph is for informational purposes only. Coma should become a concern with large telescopes, using high quality optics, with a focal ratio of around f/5 and less. E.g., you have a 20"" dob with an f/4 mirror, then you should worry about coma - provided that collimation and so on are taken care of. Optics quality An f/4 parabola is not super easy to make at any size. I've made my own optics, and the lower the f/ ratio, the more difficult the process is. Many small, cheap telescopes are made in a hurry, and the difficult focal ratio poses additional problems - as a result, many manufacturers do a poor job. There are even cases where the primary mirror is left spherical, with disastrous results. This is something you can do nothing about. If the primary mirror is bad, then that's just the way things are. An optician might try to correct it, but it's a difficult process, and quite expensive. I only added this here so you are informed. This is what I would do in your case: I would take the scope out 1 hour before observing, every time. I would try and learn how to collimate the scope. I would try to figure out a few simple collimation techniques, and a few simple tests. I would spend a few days / weeks practicing that. I would keep reading about collimation. When collimation is at least partially under control, I would learn how to properly focus the scope. Seems simple, but it can be tricky. Use a bright star, and try and make it as small as possible. Use the Moon when it's visible, and try and make it crisp and clear. Do not try this with a miscollimated scope, since it's pointless. After a few months, when I gain confidence that the scope is in better shape, very well collimated, very well focused, I might try to borrow a better eyepiece from a friend. I said borrow, not buy. Something like a 3 ... 4mm eyepiece, good quality, that would give me a comparison for the existing eyepieces. This ONLY makes sense with a scope that is in perfect collimation, perfect temperature, perfect focus. If an improvement is seen, then get a better eyepiece - but do not spend hundreds of dollars for an expensive eyepiece that will then be used in a tiny cheap scope. Second-hand eyepieces often work exactly as well as new ones. If you know someone in your area who makes mirrors, see if they agree to put your primary mirror on the Foucault tester, and assess its condition. But beware: the results might be very disappointing. Or not. You kind of never know with these little scopes. EDIT: After the scope is collimated and so on, you could try to increase magnification by using a 2x barlow with your eyepieces, but do not expect miracles - the image will be bigger, but probably rather ""mushy"". More magnification is not always better, there's always a trade-off. Good luck, and clear skies to you!"
Does the Sun have permanent geographical features?,"As you suspect the Sun does not have any permanent surface features. Up till 1951 the longest actually observed sunspot group lasted 134 days see http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1951ASPL....6..146P. That duration gives you an idea how long sunspot groups last. There are associated with coronal holes which would last about as long. However, the structure (shape size) of the group and any coronal hole would be constantly changing.  Temporary maps are made and there is a heliographic co-ordinate system, with a latitude and longitude.  The sunspots show the rotation of the Sun, and so a north and south solar pole can be found. North is in the same side of the ecliptic as the Earth's north pole).  Solar longitude is much more arbitary. The zero helographic meridian is defined as the plane (solar pole to solar pole) passing through where the solar equator crossed the plane of the ecliptic (earths orbital plane) at Greenwich mean noon on January 1, 1854. see http://wso.stanford.edu/words/Coordinates.html
Since then astronomers have just used a constant rotation rate based upon the suns equatorial rotation rate. These are called Carrington Solar Coordinates A similar system is used for the longitude of the gas giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn."
Why do satellites arcs end abruptly when observed from Earth,"Because satellites are only visible when they are in sunlight, they are not visible when they go into the Earth's shadow. The app most likely predicts where this occurs and ends the arc. In other words, it does not make sense for an observer to look for a satellite when it is not visible, so there is no need to draw the path when it is in the shadow."
Is it possible to detect gravitational lensing of stars behind the Moon?,"Measuring the gravitational deflection of light by the Moon is just out of reach of current observational techniques. The angular deflection caused by the lensing of a distant background object by a foreground (nearby) object is given by
$$\theta \simeq 4 \frac{GM}{Rc^2},$$
where $M$ is the mass of the lensing object and $R$ is the closest projected distance of the ray from the centre of the mass. For the Moon, the maximum deflection would occur when the ray just grazes the limb of the Moon and would equal 26 micro-arcseconds. At present the most accurate instruments for measuring precision positions are VLBI radio observations of point sources, where 10 micro-arcsecond relative positional precision can be ""routinely achieved"" (Reid & Honma 2014). To use this technique you need bright, radio point sources to be close in position to the Moon. This is certainly possible and has been done many times using the Sun as the lensing object, although the claimed accuracies of a short time-series of measurements on single sources is an order of magnitude lower and so probably wouldn't work for the Moon (e.g. Titov et al. 2018 ). The Gaia astrometry satellite has likely end-of-mission positional precisions of about 5 micro-arcseconds for bright stars, but it is unclear what the precision is for a single scan (which would be needed because the Moon moves!). However, to counterbalance that, one could also average the lensing effect over many stars surrounding the Moon and of course average this for different stars with the Moon observed at different times over the entire Gaia mission. Unfortutunately, although in principle this could be done, because of the way that Gaia scans the sky it is always pointing away from the Moon and so there will be no observations towards the Moon that would be capable of revealing these small deflections (e.g. see here)."
Why don't (or can't) stars be more than 325 or so times the mass of the sun? What limits their size?,"There is basically an upper limit to the mass of a star because their luminosity is so great that the radiation pressure prevents the accretion of further mass. However, the upper limit depends on the composition of the accreting material. This is because the effect of the radiation depends on the opacity of the material - stuff that is more metal-rich is more opaque. The upper limit you refer to is a bit too high for compositions similar to the Sun (I think more like $200 M_\odot$ would be the limit for that). For stars born in the distant past that were metal-poor, or even born from primordial material with no metals, the upper limit could be much higher. For primordial material, with no metals at all, the physics that determines the upper limit is likely to be fragmentation. Primordial gas is quite transparent to radiation, but this also means it is poor at radiating away the heat from gravitational contraction. In principle, much larger bodies can only begin to contract towards being very massive stars if some of the gas is ionised or if there is hydrogen in molecular form. However, this cooling also reduces the Jeans mass, allowing the collapsing cloud to fragment into a cluster of smaller objects before a supermassive $(>10^6 M_\odot)$ star/black hole could form. Nobody knows for sure how supermassive black holes formed. It seems likely that they grew from seed intermediate black holes that formed from very massive primordial stars - perhaps thousands of solar masses - or even by direct collapse to black holes of mass $10^4-10^6 M_\odot$ without ever forming a stable star."
Why is it okay to watch a sunset but not an eclipse?,"During a sunset, the Sun is lower in the sky than during most of the day - much lower. Therefore, light from the Sun travels through about 120 miles of dense atmosphere, compared to the roughly 2 miles it travels through from straight up. Here's a rough sketch (not to scale) to demonstrate this. It is clear that $B>A$:  Light scatters in the atmosphere; in fact, one type of scattering is why the sky is blue. The longer travel distance means that there is much more scattering of ultraviolent light, which in turn means that the light you see is less intense. Okay, you say. But doesn't the eclipse still block a lot of light? Well, unless there's 100% coverage - totality - there's still plenty of light coming from the uncovered part of the Sun, and that matters. The uncovered part is as bright as it normally is, and looking at that part is just as dangerous with or without the eclipse. There's one more thing to consider, which is that people watching a sunset don't look at the Sun; they look at the clouds and sky around the Sun. If you look directly at the Sun, your eyes will be damaged, no matter what's happening, an eclipse or a sunset."
Are there more stars in the universe than grains of sand in the Earth?,"A quick google gave me these (approximate) figures: 7.5 x 1018 grains of sand in all the beaches and deserts of the world 7 x 1022 stars in the observable universe If these are reasonable estimates, then there are approximately nine thousand stars in the observable universe for each grain of sand on Earth. (By observable universe, I mean in all the galaxies that we can detect with our most powerful telescopes.) Robert Krulwich: Which Is Greater, The Number Of Sand Grains On Earth Or Stars In The Sky?"
Why do sunspots appear dark?,"Typical sunspots have a dark region (umbra) surrounded by a lighter region, the penumbra. While sunspots have a temperature of about 6300 °F (3482.2 °C), the surface of the sun which surrounds it has a temperature of 10,000 °F (5537.8 °C). From this NASA resource: Sunspots are actually regions of the solar surface where the magnetic field of the Sun becomes concentrated over 1000-fold. Scientists do not yet know how this happens. Magnetic fields produce pressure, and this pressure can cause gas inside the sunspot to be in balance with the gas outside the sunspot...but at a lower temperature. Sunspots are actually several thousand degrees cooler than the 5,770 K (5496.8 °C) surface of the Sun, and contain gases at temperature of 3000 to 4000 K (2726.9 - 3726.8 °C). They are dark only by contrast with the much hotter solar surface. If you were to put a sunspot in the night sky, it would glow brighter than the Full Moon with a crimson-orange color! Sunspots are areas of intense magnetic activity, as is apparent in this image:  You can see the material kind of getting stretched into strands. As for the reason it is cooler than the rest of the surface: Although the details of sunspot generation are still a matter of research, it appears that sunspots are the visible counterparts of magnetic flux tubes in the Sun's convective zone that get ""wound up"" by differential rotation. If the stress on the tubes reaches a certain limit, they curl up like a rubber band and puncture the Sun's surface. Convection is inhibited at the puncture points; the energy flux from the Sun's interior decreases; and with it surface temperature. All in all, the sunspots appear dark because the are darker than the surrounding surface. They're darker because they are cooler, and they're cooler because of the intense magnetic fields in them."
Why do planets and satellites in the Solar system look so wildly different if they came from more or less the same matter?,"This questions can be split in two; for planets and satellites. The diversity of planets reflects in part the diversity in terms of chemical composition of the protoplanetary disk. We know that UV radiation from the sun can dissociate complex molecules or even very simple ones; for example, when UV rays split water molecules the result is free hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Since hydrogen is extremely lightweight they can be transported easily on the flux of stellar winds. So water, to keep with that example, if close to the sun could end up been dissociated and depleted from the region of the disk, but above the so called ""snow line"" UV radiation from the Sun was so weak that this couldn't happen as often and thus water molecules (which are very heavy in comparison to single hydrogen atoms), stayed there. That only explains the dichotomy between interior and exterior planets in terms of water content, and even then, some processes (like the late heavy bombardment) might add some water to the interior (as it happened on Earth). But this reasoning is not only for water, carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane and hundredths of different molecules have their own ""frost lines"". Closer to the sun the carbon can't be methane is a volatile gas that gets quickly pushed outwards, but at some tenths of AUs methane can remain in stable conditions and can even condensate into liquid droplets. All of this just to say that the protoplanetary disk was NOT homogenous in terms of chemical composition, and was not homogeneous in terms of density or pressure. The thermal and chemical gradient across the nebula ensures some diversity and complexity for the entire planetary system. Here you have a beautiful diagram showing how different chemical compounds could condensate in different temperatures and pressures on the protoplanetary disk.  Also accretion of planetesimals is more energetic closer to the Sun (meaning that breakups can occur more frequently and is difficult for a planet to grow large), while in the outer regions planets can increase in mass with regularity since collisions with other planetesimals are performed at lower relative speeds (because of how two similar orbits have a difference in periods that gets larger when you get closer to the Sun and thus larger relative velocities). This coupled with the gravitational interactions of the protoplanets and the early disk (see planetary migration and nice model etc...) allow for different accretion rates and the accretion of materials of different composition of what was found in the original place of formation of a particular planetesimal. This also helps to keep a wide variety on planetary masses. A wide variety in planetary masses is the starting point for a larger variation as the planets evolve in time and diverge from their initial conditions. A rocky small planet (Mercury) might have less heat trapped inside than a larger one (Earth), due to the smaller energy released by smaller accretion rates. Thus it might get cold rapidly and a magnetosphere due to a melted interior can't happen. The absence of a magnetosphere allows for solar wind charged particles to erode your atmosphere by sputtering. Instead on a planet like Earth, the larger mass has led to a melted interior that in turn generated a magnetosphere that lasted for billions of years, in Mars it lasted some time but now is almost gone so the atmosphere has also been almost destroyed. On Earth the presence of an atmosphere leds to all sorts of chemical erosions, and phenomena. Also, it's melted interior coupled with the specifics of its chemical composition and thickness of the crust allow for a mechanism called plate tectonics. Tectonics can't happen on Venus because the crust is not as thick (due to different composition) and thus it doesn't break apart in plates but just deforms and folds in a complex behaviour that is unique to Venus. Also collisions with planetesimals can alter the future evolution of similar planets. Venus was probably very similar to Earth (similar mass, very similar composition and not so dissimilar temperatures as one might think) but their paths diverged completely as tectonics on Earth recycled the lithosphere and on Venus the carbon dioxide got more trapped in a greenhouse effect, and because Earth had a collision with another planet that have us our Moon, which is a mechanical stabilizer while a random collision with Venus (with different impact parameters) led to an extremely slow rotation and long days (but no moons). Longer days mean different insulation, and that changes drastically the climate of a planet. On Mars days are similar to Earth's but since it is smaller and the atmosphere has gone many things are very dissimilar from Earth. Also, Mars has no tectonics (the crust is thicker than Earth's and moves like a monolithic object) so there are few volcanoes and they grow huge (while on earth a single hot-spot generated by a mantle plume drills several holes on the crust as the plate moves on what is called a volcano chain) and there are stress faults like Valles Marineris (unique in the Solar System) that on Earth would have been relaxed by tectonic movements. To see how different the evolution of two planetary objects can be just by making them different mass take a look at our Moon. It has the same chemical composition (it is a chunk from Earth in fact), it is basically at the same distance to the Sun as Earth, it lives in the same interplanetary environment (same solar radiation, solar wind, impact rates etc...), and still it is completely different. This is all due to mass! The moon can't retain a large atmosphere as Earth because it has less gravitational pull. The same temperature for our atmosphere there means that the particles reach escape velocity easily and start to escape from the gravity well. With no atmosphere, not internal heat, the moon lacks almost any type of erosion in across billions of years of evolution. Processes of erosion on Earth have made the diversity of geological formations to explode in comparison to those found on the Moon. Even then the moon has its own peculiarities and dynamical features unique to it. Now we are getting closer to the satellites question. They in fact should look almost the same, since they are formed from very very similar material in extremely similar conditions. And indeed we believe that moons originally were very similar (for example the 4 Galilean moons). But Io is to close to Jupiter and the other moons interact with it in such a way that the geological processes are completely different. Water and volatiles evaporated quickly as it heated up by tidal forces from Jupiter. These tidal forces were not as strong in Europa since it is farther away, thus it only melted part of the icy crust creating an ice analog of plate tectonics which generated a plethora of diverse formations. Satellites evolve. Enceladus shoots jets because of tidal interactions and orbital resonances with other moons. Some moons like Japeto have a dual colored surface because of the material sprayed by Enceladus landing on on one of its sides. Some moons like Triton have nothing to do with the other because they formed in another region of the solar System and later got trapped by the gravitational pull of a planet (Neptune in this case). As I mentioned before. Atmospheres (density, composition and pressure) are largely dependent on the mass of the planet or moon. Look at this graph:  It shows the velocity of gas molecules in relation to temperature of the gas. For larger temperatures gas molecules move faster. In a planet with low mass, the escape velocity is lower than one with a larger mass. Thus a planet closer to the sun (at higher temperature) needs to be larger in size if it wants to preserve the same gas molecules in its atmosphere as a planet that is farther away (colder). You can see why Earth's atmosphere could trap and retain water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane nitrogen and other gases while it is unable to trap hydrogen and helium (because they are lighter and thus for the same temperature they can move as fast as needed to escape Earth). Meanwhile, the Moon, which has the same heat coming from the Sun as Earth, since it is less massive it can't retain almost any gases (maybe a bit of Xenon). Titan, is a huge moon thus it can retain many gaseous molecules like Nitrogen and Oxygen (those in turn make the pressure high enough to retain also volatiles like methane in a liquid form on the surface). But why doesn't Ganymede has the same atmosphere as Titan if they are basically the same size? Because Ganymede is closer to the Sun, larger temperature means that the molecules move faster and thus they escape its attraction easily. As you can see the complex processes of atmospheres of a moon or a planet change everything (erosion, recycling processes, chemical corrosion, etc...) and in turn that diversity in atmospheres comes from a diversity of masses and distances to the Sun. I think the Solar System is a chaotic system, dynamically, geologically, chemically etc... Chaos means that for an small difference in initial conditions the system will evolve in exponentially diverging different states. Planets and moons might have started as similar objects but history and the chaotic dynamics of the system have evolved into completely different environments. Not only that, but the truth is that planets didn't started as equals but were very different from the beginning, so imagine how far away is Venus to become a Titan, or an Io to become an Earth. Also there are processes and conditions that are specially well suited for divergence. For example: Earth is very dynamic while Mars, Venus, Mercury, the Moon and others are totally not. Why? because on Earth water can exist in 3 different states of matter. We can find liquid water, water vapor and ice in different regions and seasons. And that is because Earth is at an average temperature and it's atmosphere has just the right pressure to allow this. Earth's conditions are very close to the triple point of water (where all three states of matter coexist), that's why we have a water cycle on Earth, with rivers and glaciers eroding the landscape and clouds regulating the climate.  Mars, Venus, Mercury, all have temperatures and pressures were this can't happen, not only on water but on many compounds present there. You know where this can happen? On Pluto! This was very surprising, Pluto shows a variety of terrains and geological features that exceeds all expectations. Now we know this is because Pluto is extremely dynamic (as Earth) and a lot of erosion and geo-chemical processes can occur, but this is not because of water (since Pluto has low pressure and low temperatures), but because of Nitrogen and Neon! Both elements have their triple point inside to Pluto's range of conditions and thus Neon rivers, Nitrogen glaciers and hazes are expected on this dwarf planet. It is indeed an interesting question. How incredible are the laws of nature that allow for extreme variety even between brothers. I wonder how a planet around any other star might be, our simplistic categories of hot Jupiters, mini-Neptunes, super-Terras, etc... are just so primitive and restrictive. What wonders await us in this complex and diverse cosmos is beyond our comprehension."
Why does the Earth have a tilt of ~23°?,"First up, the tilt is exactly 23.45 degrees. The reason for Earth's tilt is still not yet really proven, but scientists at Princeton stated on August 25, 2006 that planet Earth may have 'tilted' to keep its balance. Quote: By analyzing the magnetic composition of ancient sediments found in the remote Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, Princeton University's Adam Maloof has lent credence to a 140-year-old theory regarding the way the Earth might restore its own balance if an unequal distribution of weight ever developed in its interior or on its surface. The theory, known as true polar wander, postulates that if an object of sufficient weight -- such as a supersized volcano -- ever formed far from the equator, the force of the planet's rotation would gradually pull the heavy object away from the axis the Earth spins around. If the volcanoes, land and other masses that exist within the spinning Earth ever became sufficiently imbalanced, the planet would tilt and rotate itself until this extra weight was relocated to a point along the equator. Same goes for the lack of proof about the exact consequences on the planet or if it'll happen again. All that is still being researched and debated, but those Princeton scientists have thrown in some interesting perspectives which you'll discover when you visit the link I provided and completely read what they wrote. Besides ""consequences"" for Earth as a planet, it should be noted that the tilt of Earth is the reason why we have seasons. So even when we yet have to find out what the consequences for Earth (as a planet) have been and/or will be, we do know that the tilt surely has consequences for all beings that live on planet Earth… the seasons that influence us all: summer, fall, winter, and spring. And - last but not least - as for your question how they know where 0 degrees would be, you just have to look at the Earth's rotation around the sun. Take a 90° angle of the planet's orbit and you know where 0° would be. But I guess a picture explains more than a thousand words, so I quickly created the following graphic: "
Can we (theoretically) spin the black hole so strong that it will be broken apart by centrifugal force?,"Can we (theoretically) spin the black hole so strong so it will be broken apart by centrifugal force? For a Kerr-Newman (rotating, charged, isolated) black hole of mass $M$, angular momentum $J$, and charge $Q$, the surface area of the event horizon is given by
$$A = 8M\left[M^2 + (M^2-a^2-Q^2)^{1/2} - Q^2/2\right]\text{,}$$
where $a = J/M$. An extremal black hole occurs when $M^2 = a^2 + Q^2$. Beyond that, if the black hole is even more overspun or overcharged, is an ""overextremal"" Kerr-Newman spacetime, which wouldn't really be a black hole at all, but rather a naked singularity. Thus, I interpret your question as asking whether or not a black hole can be be spun up to the extremal limit and beyond, so as to destroy the event horizon. It's very probable that it can't be done. Wald proved in 1974 that as one flings matter into a black hole to try to increase its angular momentum, the nearer to an extremal black hole it is, the harder it is to continue this process: a fast-spinning black hole will repel matter that would take it beyond the extremal limit. There are other schemes, and though I'm not aware of any completely general proof within classical general relativity, the continual failure of schemes like this is well-motivated by the connection between black hole dynamics and thermodynamics. For example, the Hawking temperature of the black hole is $T_\text{H} = \kappa/2\pi$, where
$$\kappa = \frac{\sqrt{M^2-a^2-Q^2}}{2M\left(M+\sqrt{M^2-a^2-Q^2}\right)-Q^2}$$
is the black hole's surface gravity. Thus, even reaching the extremal limit is thermodynamically equivalent to cooling a system to absolute zero."
Terrestrial Exoplanet Skies – I've Built a Visual Sky Chart. Is it Accurate?,"I think the star,its halo and cloud can't be darker than the sky color even early M type still look blindingly bright orange-red on the sky not dim orange-red.
The sky color, if heavier i think it will look more ""desaturate""(brighter too but not bright to the point it's brighter than the star) and thecolor shift toward the red side(you are correct) that dense sky will be affected by the color of starlight very intensely to the point it's almost have the same color of the starlight
example: 10 bars sky on a planet around K5V sun would look light orange-ish grey also the cloud would look bright orange, same color for the star's halo.
example2: 10 bars sky on a planet around A5V sun would look bright pale teal/cyan with yellowish white cloud same color for the star's halo.
example3: 5 bars sky on a planet around A5V sun would look powder blue with pure white cloud, same color for the star and its halo."
Which atom is a Neutron star made of?,"Yes neutrons can exist outside the atom (or nucleus). In free space a neutron will beta decay into a proton, and electron and an anti-neutrino on a timescale of 10 minutes. However, in the dense interiors of a neutron star, the electrons form a degenerate gas, with all possible energy levels filled up to something called the Fermi energy.  Once the Fermi energy of the electrons exceeds the maximum energy of any possible beta-decay electron, then beta decay is blocked and free neutrons become stable. This is what happens inside a neutron star and you end up with mostly neutrons with a small fraction perhaps a few per cent electrons and protons. In the outer parts of the neutron star, the protons and neutrons can still arrange themselves into nuclei (but not atoms), but these nuclei are extremely neutron-rich (they would not normally exist in nature) and are only stabilised against beta decay by the process I described above. The very outer envelope may consist of completely ionised iron-peak element nuclei and there may be an ultrathin (few cm) layer of recognisable ionised hydrogen, helium and carbon (e.g. Wynn & Heinke 2009). Once the density reaches about $3 \times 10^{16}$ kg/m$^3$ it becomes more favourable for the neutrons and protons to organise themselves into ""macro-nuclei"" - long strings and sheets of nuclear material, known colloquially as nuclear pasta. At higher densities still, the pasta dissolves into a soup of mostly neutrons with about 1 per cent protons and electrons. The diagram below (from Watanabe et al. 2012) shows roughly how these layers are arranged. It should be stressed that this is based on theoretical modelling, with the theory becoming less certain the further into the neutron star you go. Testing these ideas involves nuclear and particle experiments, observations of pulsars, of neutron star cooling, of X-ray bursts, mass and radius estimates in binary systems, pulsar glitches, etc., etc. None of the details have been observationally confirmed beyond dispute, but the basic picture below fits what we know. In particular, the the crust and the n,p,e fluid regions are well understood in theory. The details of the nuclear pasta phases are still the subject of a lot of theoretical work, as are the details of superfluidity in the interior, and what happens in the very central regions (solid neutron core, extra hadronic phases, boson condensation, quark matter) is still theoretically difficult and observationally untested except perhaps to say that the softest equations of state have been ruled out by the existence of $2M_{\odot}$ neutron stars.

Is the sun's volume shrinking currently?,"Is the sun shrinking currently? It's the other way around: The Sun is slowly growing hotter and thus is slowly expanding. The Sun accumulates ever more helium in its core as it ages. This growing amount of fusion ash results in the core getting hotter, which in turn results in the Sun expanding in volume. This completely overwhelms what one would expect from looking only at the mass loss due to fusion and solar winds. The solar mass loss rate currently is on the order of $10^{-13}$ solar masses per year. At that rate, it would take on the order of ten trillion years for the Sun to consume or expel all of its mass. That's a much longer time span than the Sun's much faster aging process. The Sun has five to seven billion years or so left on the main sequence. Shortly before the time the Sun leaves the main sequence, it will be about twice as luminous and considerably larger than it is now. Shortly after the the Sun leaves the main sequence, it will be much more luminous and even larger than it was just before it left the main sequence."
"If the Moon were impacted by a suitably sized meteor, how long would it take to impact the Earth?","As several people have said, this is incredibly unlikely. Part of the reason why is that the ""circling the drain"" effect you describe doesn't really happen for solid objects much less dense than black holes. Orbits are not ""precarious"" in that way. So, suppose something large enough and fast enough to change its velocity noticeably, but not large enough or fast enough to shatter it, did hit the Moon. The effect would be to shift the Moon from its present almost circular orbit around the Earth, into an elliptical one. Depending on the direction of the impact, it would either get a bit nearer to the Earth than it is now, once per orbit, or a bit further away (it also might swing North and South a bit). What is important though, is that this elliptical track is stable at least for a while. Suppose it gets knocked into an orbit that is 220000 miles from the Earth at its closest and 240000 miles at its furthest, that is where it will stay. It will not ""spiral in"". Over a long enough period the gravity of the Sun also comes into play and things may shift a bit, but that is a relatively small effect. Now, suppose that the impact was really big, or perhaps there were a long series of impacts (starting to look like enemy action..) so that the innermost point of the ellipse was eventually driven down to within a few thousand miles of the Earth, somehow miraculously not smashing the Moon to fragments in the process. At this distance it starts to matter that the near side of the Moon is closer to Earth than the far side, so that Earth's gravity pulls on it more strongly. If it orbited closer than about 3000km to the surface of the Earth for long (the Roche limit) these forces would eventually pull it to pieces, and Earth would probably have a pretty set of rings for a short time before internal collisions between the bits caused them to rain down on Earth and kill everyone. Finally suppose the impact(s) was(were) so big that they actually put the Moon into an elliptical orbit whose innermost point was so close to Earth that the Earth and Moon touched. This is manifestly impossible without shattering the Moon, but in that case, the Moon would indeed hit the Earth. The time for the impact would be about 1/4 of the Moons current orbital period, which is to say about a week. "
What would happen if someone had a telescope and watched Betelgeuse when it goes supernova?,"No, it would not be a problem. Supernovae are not at all like flashbulbs – they brighten over a period of many days and dim again even more slowly. Here are a number of different light curves taken from Wikipedia:
 The rise is fast on an astronomical scale – several orders of magnitude over a period of roughly ten days – but very slow on a human scale. An amateur looking at it would not notice any significant change in brightness, but if the same person came back a few hours later or the next night, the change would be very evident. As far as we can tell, the reason is that the light at peak brightness is caused by emissions from material blown off by the explosion. For example, in Type 1a SNe, most of the light is from the radioactive decay of the huge mass of ejected nickel-56 (half life 6 days). The Wikipedia article on supernovae is quite good and covers this all in more detail."
How do we know the laws of physics are the same throughout the universe?,"Let's start in the middle: What is the furthest radius we can prove from earth, with absolute certaintity, that the laws of physics do not vary? Zero. Proofs are found in mathematics and court rooms, and are impossible in natural science. The best we can do is have falsifiable theories. This holds for every description of reality - there's no ""proof"" even for the Laws of Gravity. So, what could we observe that would tell us that physical constants or relationships between physical quantities are different in other parts of the universe, or at other times during its existence? For a change of natural laws over time, we can look at the isotope distribution in rocks here on earth. We should be able to tell whether the decay rate of various elements was different at earlier times by looking at how many of each of their decay products are around. To summarize, we cannot say with ""absolute certainty"", but what we observe seems to indicate that natural laws are the same throughout the universe."
What should I look for in a first telescope for a child?,"A desire to see “the planets” is admirable but not realistic. An affordable back yard telescope will turn planets into shaky white blobs, not Hubble images. The resulting disappointment acts as an incentive for more magnification… which produces bigger, shakier white blobs. I’m a big believer in binoculars for introductory astronomy viewing. The magnification is great for our Moon, and high enough to see Jupiter’s moons. The field of view is generous which makes spotting objects easy. Aiming is nimble enough to catch the space station as it whizzes by. A significant advantage of binoculars for beginner observers is the upright image. All astronomical telescope images are upside down... or upside down and backwards... which takes some getting used to. I bought my daughter a tripod for her binoculars. But she usually just lays on her back in the grass with the binos. My astronomy club has a 14” Celestron in a full-on observatory, but I spend most of my observing time outside the observatory with my 15X70 binoculars. And the Binos were the only optics I took to the solar eclipse. A downside of binoculars is sore arms from holding them. A tripod is a poor solution because it must be higher than your eyes. I use a monopod which started life as a telescoping paint roller handle."
Is there any planet bigger than a star?,"The answer depends on whether you mean is any planet bigger than any star, or whether the planet and star have to be in the same system and have been discovered/measured, rather than just that they could exist in principle. There are a few known planets with measured radii that are bigger than the lowest mass stars.
Here is a plot from Chabrier et al. (2008) (and plenty more data will have been added since), which shows the basic picture. This is the mass-radius plot for both stars and exoplanets.
 It turns out that there are some hot Jupiters that have radii about twice that of Jupiter in our Solar System. You can find examples at exoplanets.org, such as HAT P-67b and XO-6b. These planets are bigger than theory suggests for a ""cold"" exoplanet, probably because of ""insolation"" (heating by their parent star) - e.g. Enoch et al. (2012). On the other hand, the smallest stars, those just above the brown dwarf limit of $\sim 0.075M_\odot$, that are predicted to have radii (at least once they are a billion years old and have reached the main sequence), of about 1.3 times that of Jupiter. At older ages they can become even smaller - about the size of Saturn (black dashed line). In terms of measurements, there are low-mass objects in eclipsing binaries and also a handful of very low-mass stars that have interferometric radii. For example Proxima Cen (the nearest star to the Sun) is reported to have an interferometric radius of $(0.145 \pm 0.011)R_\odot$ (or 1.44 Jupiter radii) by Demory et al. (2009) and so this is clearly smaller than the biggest exoplanets. If one demands that the exoplanet and star are part of the same system, then although they could exist in principle (as per the discussion above), there aren't any examples (yet). The curves in the plot above are not dependent on the type of star a planet orbits. Therefore, in principle, it might be possible for a $>1M_J$ planet to be found orbiting a (only just) smaller $<0.1 M_\odot$ star, even if it receives negligible insolation. In practice, giant exoplanets are rare around low mass stars, so it could be some time before an example is found. However, a close candidate might be GJ3512b which is an exoplanet with $M\sin i = 0.46 M_{\rm Jup}$ (i.e. this is a minimum mass, since the orbital inclination $i<90^{\circ}$) that orbits an M5.5V star quite similar to Proxima Cen (Morales et al. 2019). The star has an estimated radius of $(0.139 \pm 0.005) R_\odot$ and the age is thought to be a few billion years. Looking at the curves in the plot then a cold exoplanet with $i \sim 30^{\circ}$ might be comparable in size to the star. Unfortunately, the exoplanet doesn't transit so no radius measurement is available and it is unlikely to be inflated by stellar insolation because it is in a relatively wide orbit around a faint star An interesting suggestion is that a young exoplanet might offer the best chance of being bigger than its host star. This is because the contraction timescale of a giant planet is longer than the pre main sequence contraction timescale of its star. The curves in the plot above for 1 Gyr and 10 Gyr show this effect, but it is even more extreme for ages $0.1$ Gyr. Thus the best chance of finding planets bigger than their host stars is to look at young systems in star forming regions. Some of these may already have been found using direct imaging, though in my opinion these quite high-mass ""exoplanets"" ($>5$ Jupiter masses) orbiting at very large distances ($>100$ au) are more like binary brown dwarfs."
"Is Jupiter's Red Spot ""locked in place"" or does it move around?","It does drift relative to other parts of the atmosphere. The lack of a surface makes defining the actual rotation period of Jupiter rather difficult. The currently accepted value of 9h:55m:29.7s is based on the average rotation of the interior, inferred from magnetic field measurements. The Red Spot was previously used to define the rotation period, averaging at 9h:55m:42s. With no surface features to break up the winds, this period is quite stable. In the longer term the drift speed does vary. The spot has ""lapped"" the planet at least 10 times since the early nineteenth century. Its drift rate has changed dramatically over the years and has been linked to the brightness of the South Equatorial Belt and the presence or absence of a South Tropical Disturbance. The timelapse by Voyager shows the relative movement in different bands. "
"How did Kepler ""guess"" his third law from data?","Kepler's account of how the third law came to be is as follows (Caspar p.286; emphasis mine): On the 8th of March of this year 1618, if exact information about the time is desired, it appeared in my head. But I was unlucky when I inserted it into the calculation, and rejected it as false. Finally, on May 15, it came again and with a new onset conquered the darkness of my mind, whereat there followed such an excellent agreement between my seventeen years of work at the Tychonic observations and my present deliberation that I at first believed that I had dreamed and assume the sought for in the supporting proofs. But it is entirely certain and exact that the proportion between the periodic times of any two planets is precisely one and a half times the proportion of the mean distances. Although Kepler does not actually describe inspiration that led him to believe this, the curious phrasing provides a very strong clue when combined with some background biographical information: Thus, Kepler's statement is is equivalent to saying that the data makes a slope of 1.5 on a log-log graph, a which is a very simple linear relationship on this scale.

Why do some supermassive black holes have a * in their name?,"How the name came to be chosen is discussed in this paper1 (§3, pp. 4–5): Eight years after the discovery, one of us (Brown) invented the name

Is the light we see from stars extremely old?,"Yes, the speed of light in vacuum (or c) is 299,792,458 m/s and one light-year is the distance the light travels in one Julian year (365.25 days), which comes out to 9.46073 × 1015 meters. The exact value is 9,460,730,472,580,800 meters. Since c is the maximum speed at which all energy, matter, and information in the Universe can travel, it is the universal physical constant on which the light-year (ly) as one of the astronomical units of length is based. That means that visible light as an electromagnetic radiation cannot travel faster than c and in one Julian year it can traverse a maximum distance of d = t * c d is distance in meters t time in seconds c the speed of light in vacuum in meters per second If we calculate this distance for a 4.243 ly distant object, that comes out as 4.243 * 365.25 * 86,400 s * 299,792,458 m * sˉ¹ or exactly 40,141,879,395,160,334.4 meters (roughly 40 trillion kilometers or 25 trillion miles). That is the distance the light traveled since it was last reflected of (or in our case emitted from, since Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf star) the surface of a celestial object to be 4.243 Julian years later visible at our observation point, in this case our planet Earth from where the distance to Proxima Centauri you quoted was measured. The more powerful the telescope, the further into the past we can see because the light is much older! This goes the same regardless of the distance of the object you're observing, but astronomy is particularly neat in this regard and we can observe objects that are so distant that we see them from the time when they were still forming. For further reading on other units used to measure far away objects you might be interested in reading this question on the parsec."
Is lithium considered a metal in astronomy?,"The latter. To astronomers, a metal is any element that is not hydrogen or helium, because these elements together constitute most of the elements in the Universe, by far. This means that, in many circumstances all other elements can be neglected, at least to first order. By mass, H and He account for some 74% and 24% in the present-day Universe, respectively, while the next-most abundant elements are on the <1% scale. And because these elements are also heavier, if you consider the abundance by number, H and He account for roughly 99.9% of all atoms. Lithium, on the other hand, only account for a few billionths of all atoms. Here's an overview of the abundances in the Solar System, in terms of number densities, i.e. not mass densities: 
Credit: Wikimedia Commons user 28bytes, under C.C.-by-S.A.-3.0. The reason for the zig-zag pattern is that, in general, elements with an even number of protons are more stable than those with an odd number, as discussed in this post. Note that the $y$ axis is logarithmic, i.e. each tick mark denotes a ten-fold increase in abundance. The axis is arbitrarily scaled to $10^6$ silicon (Si) atoms, so the Si dot is at $\log A \equiv 6$. Oxygen, for instance, is at $y \simeq 7.15$, so it is $10^{7.15-6}\simeq14$ times more abundant than Si. The terminology used by astronomers may be considered wrong by other physicists and chemists. But why do we use the term at all? To distinguish some of the elements from other elements, based on their properties, I'd say. In astronomy, it very often makes sense to consider the elements of the Universe as divided in three: In physics, you may be more concerned with the material's ability to conduct electricity and hence consider sodium a metal until the pressure becomes too high, after which you call it a non-metal. In chemistry, you may be more interested in the materials ability to form bonds, and hence do not consider arsenic and antimony metals. So, I think you can say that there isn't a formal definition of the term ""metal"" — it depends on the context. From Wikipedia: Around 95 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals (or are
likely to be such). The number is inexact as the boundaries between
metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of
universally accepted definitions of the categories involved Apart from these practical reasons, there are also historical reasons, as discussed in this answer by Rob Jeffries."
Was Galileo expecting to see so many stars?,"tl;dr: Probably yeah, Galileo was a smart guy and probably reasoned that if he could get a better view, he could see more stuff (like stars) Consider what a night sky looks like with absolutely no light pollution; it’s pretty spectacular, with an ocean of stars. When Galileo was alive, light pollution wasn’t nearly as much of an issue as it is now, and so he would have observed this ocean of stars at its peak every new moon. Since some of these stars are fainter than others, and that there were so many he could see, I don’t think it would’ve really surprised him to find that what once looked like a blank part of the sky had a couple stars, inasmuch as I would not be surprised if looking down on a village from a far away mountain to find more buildings or people if I used some binoculars. It does not take a lot of imagination for him to make that jump. To give context for why Galileo was surprised, what was groundbreaking for his time was that the geocentric model of the universe was seemingly contradicted by the moons orbiting Jupiter; the notion put forward by his contemporaries was that geocentricity was a matter of not only science but of divine appointment: nothing could orbit anything but the Earth for it was the footstool of God, etc. And so, to see something orbit around something else was not only a scientific paradigm shift, but went against the popular religious ideologies of his time. That, for Galileo, was likely much more surprising than finding the innumerable amount of stars of the night sky to be a little more innumerable than he could see. To your final question, I doubt there would be any historical info about this because it wasn’t worth noting. Astronomers were familiar with the idea of there being stars obscured for one reason or another, like the full moon or what have you, and so I would be more surprised if they thought that the only stars out there were the ones they could see."
Why can't stars be multicolored like gas giants?,"Just rotation is the wrong tree to bark up on. You see color variations on gas giants due to differences in composition, i.e. ammonia vs. sulfuric acid clouds on Jupiter, which are transported differently on the rotating planet in the up/downwelling bands. Spots on stars originate due to very different physics. At the temperatures which are prevalent on stellar surfaces, molecules are mostly dissociated and ionized, we call this state a plasma, so no more colour effects due to ammonia or others. Star spots are concentrations of the local magnetic field, which is coupled to the plasma dynamics. The magnetic field pushes the gas aside and lets the surface cool locally. This makes dark spots that you see on stars like our sun. There is a transition region in terms of surface temperature of 2000-3000K, at the masses of brown dwarves. Those failed stars seem to exhibit dark bands on their surfaces, which are thought to be due to absorption from exotic, high-temperature molecules like TiO and VO (Titanium and Vanadium oxide)."
How often do stars pass within 1 light year of the Sun?,"TL;DR  There is an encounter within 1 light year about once every half a million years. So about 9000 close encounters during the lifetime of the Sun The answer to the second part of your question is that the stars near the Sun are extremely well mixed, with a range of ages from a few million years to 12 billion years. None of them are identifiably ""following the Sun"". Some details Using the re-reduction of the Hipparcos astrometry, Bailer-Jones (2014) has integrated orbits for 50,000 stars to look for objects that might come or might have come close to the Sun. The K-dwarf Hip 85605 is the winner on that timescale, with a ""90% probability of coming between 0.04 and 0.20pc between 240,000 and 470,000 years from now"". The next best is GL710 a K-dwarf that will come within about 0.1-0.44pc in 1.3 million years. On a statistical basis, some work has been done by Garcia Sanchez et al. (2001). They estimate, using the Hipparcos data, that encounters within 1pc occur every 2.3 million years. However, the Hipparcos data isn't complete for low-mass, faint objects. Making a correction for this, the authors estimate a $<1pc$ encounter every 100,000 years. The probability for closer approaches scales as the inverse of the square of the separation. i.e. the timescales for approaches closer than 0.1pc is 100 times longer. There are plenty of big error bars in all this work - recall that an error of 1km/s in velocity leads to a 1pc error in position after 1 million years. All this should be nailed down really well by Gaia results in the next 2-3 years. Update There is a new paper based on Gaia DR3 astrometry by Bailer-Jones (2022). The star GL710 is now much more firmly constrained, coming within 0.060-0.068 pc of the Sun  in 1.26-1.33 million years. A new contender on the scene is HD7977, a G3 dwarf that may have come even closer at 0.02-0.12 pc about 2.72-2.80 million years ago. There are a total of about 50 stars that will or have passed within 1 pc of the Sun in the last $\pm 6$ million years - so about one known encounter every 240,000 years. But note that this cannot possibly be a complete list and the figure is a lower limit even over this period, because faint stars and high velocity stars can move in and out of Gaia's sensitivity range on these sorts of timescales and thus would not be in the current catalogues. Bailer-Jones (2018) (using Gaia DR2 data) attempted to correct for this incompleteness and estimated an encounter rate within 5 pc of $545 \pm 59$ per million years. With the inverse-square scaling mentioned above (and also advocated by Bailer-Jones), this becomes about 1 encounter within 1 pc every 50,000 years or about 1 encounter within 1 light year every 0.5 million years. Assuming this rate is roughly correct over the whole lifetime of the Sun then this would yield 9000 close encounters over its 4.5 billion year lifetime (arguably there might have been a slightly smaller number of stars earlier in the Galaxy's history, but this might be outweighed by the Sun probably gradually migrating outwards from a radial position with a higher stellar density.) Projecting this further, then if you are prepared to wait 50 million years, then you might expect an encounter within 0.1 light years, which is in the Oort cloud and really starting to get interesting as far as the timescales of mass-extinction events go."
Why do stars explode?,"Short answer:  A tiny fraction of the gravitational potential energy released by the very rapid collapse of the inert iron core gets transferred to the outer layers and this is sufficient to power the observed explosion. In more detail: Consider the energetics of an idealised model star. It has a ""core"" of mass $M$ and initial radius $R_0$ and an outer envelope of mass $m$ and radius $r$. Now suppose the core collapses to a much smaller radius $R \ll R_0$ on such a short timescale that it decouples from the envelope. The amount of gravitational potential energy released will​ be $\sim GM^2/R$. A fraction of this released energy can be transferred to the envelope in the form of outward moving shocks and radiation. If the transferred energy exceeds the gravitational binding energy of the envelope $\sim Gm^2/r$ then the envelope can be blown into space. In an exploding star (a type II core collapse supernovae) $R_0\sim 10^4$ km, $R\sim 10$ km and $r \sim 10^8$ km. The core mass is $M \sim 1.2M_{\odot}$ and  the envelope mass is $m \sim 10M_{\odot}$. The dense core is mostly made of iron and supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The star is said to have ""run out of fuel"" because fusion reactions with iron nuclei do not release significant amounts of energy. The collapse is triggered because nuclear burning continues around the core and so the core mass is gradually increased and as it does so it gradually shrinks (a peculiarity of structures supported by degeneracy pressure), the density increases and then an instability is introduced either by electron capture reactions or photodisintegration of iron nuclei. Either way, electrons (which are what is providing the support for the core) are mopped up by protons to form neutrons and the core collapses on a free fall timescale of $\sim 1$ s! The collapse is halted by the strong nuclear force and neutron degeneracy pressure. The core bounces; a shock wave travels outwards; most of the gravitational energy is stored in neutrinos and a fraction of this is transferred to the shock before the neutrinos escape, driving away the outer envelope. An excellent descriptive account of this and the previous paragraph can be read in Woosley & Janka (2005). Putting in some numbers.
$$GM^2/R = 4\times 10^{46}\ {\rm J}$$
$$Gm^2/r = 3\times 10^{44}\ {\rm J}$$ So one only needs to transfer of order 1% of the collapsing core's released potential energy to the envelope in order to drive the supernova explosion. This is actually not yet understood in detail, though somehow supernovae find a way to do it. A key point is that the rapid collapse takes place only in the core of the star. If the entire star collapsed as one, then most of the gravitational potential energy would escape as radiation and neutrinos and there would be insufficient energy even to reverse the collapse. In the core collapse model, most (90%+) of the released gravitational energy is lost as neutrinos, but what remains is still easily sufficient to unbind the uncollapsed envelope. The collapsed core remains bound and becomes either a neutron star or black hole. A second way to cause a star (a white dwarf) to explode is a thermonuclear reaction. If the carbon and oxygen can be ignited in nuclear fusion reactions then enough energy is released to exceed the gravitational binding energy of the white dwarf. These are type Ia supernovae."
Why are there no green stars?,"Human color vision is based on three types of ""cones"" in the eye that respond differently to different wavelengths of light. Thus, not counting overall brightness, the human color space has two degrees of freedom. In contrast, the spectra of stars are very close to a black body, which depends only on effective temperature. As one varies the temperature, the color of a star should make a one-dimensional curve in this color space. Thus, unless some perverse shenanigans are going on, it is intuitive that we necessarily miss most of colors, i.e. there will be no stars of those colors. Our Sun actually has a peak at about $500\,\mathrm{nm}$, which is a green. However, that's just the peak: since the Sun also radiates lots of light with shorter wavelength (bluer) and also longer wavelengths (redder), the resulting mixture doesn't look green to human eyes. An image from wikipedia on the color of a blackbody of a given temperature:  Note that the colors at near edges of this color space aren't accurate, because the sRGB standard used in computers only covers a fairly small triangle portion of it. Still, that's a complication that's not very important here."
What are the differences between a Black Hole and a Supermassive Black Hole,"Stellar mass black holes form from the collapse of massive stars at the end of their lives. You can then find them scattered throughout galaxies, just like you find massive stars. They typically have a mass a few times the mass of the sun. Supermassive black holes are found at the centers of galaxies. They typically have mass of millions of Suns.  Recently they have started to discover Intermediate Mass Black Holes which blur the lines between a stellar black hole and supermassive black hole. The typically have a mass in the range 100 to one million solar masses."
"How else can a star form, other than gravitational collapse?","About 15ish years ago, this was still a heated and pressing open question: what is the dominant mechanism by which most stars (i.e., low-mass stars) form? This came to the fore in a showdown between the two main hypotheses for stellar formation: gravitational collapse and competitive accretion. Under gravitational collapse, star-forming molecular clumps, of typically hundreds to thousands of solar masses (M$_{\odot}$), fragment into gaseous cores that subsequently collapse to make individual stars or small multiple systems. In contrast, competitive accretion theory suggests that at birth all stars are much smaller than the typical stellar mass (∼0.5M$_{\odot}$), and that final stellar masses are determined by the subsequent accretion of unbound gas from the clump For a concise yet in-depth discussion of these controversies, see this paper by Clarke (2006). Comparing updated simulations (for examples, including more realistic radiation effects and turbulence) with observations essentially ruled out the models of competitive accretion in favor of gravitational collapse models. Since then, this result has advanced further, with some apparent exceptions. For example, a recent study of the Orion Nebula found that accretion may play a role in determining the final stellar masses, but that is not necessarily news - we've known for a while now that accretion can play an important role in stellar evolution. But regarding the question of stellar formation itself, this recent study does not seem to give hope for competitive accretion models, despite the pop sci headlines (or maybe I've misunderstood something here?). In molecular clouds, accretion may play a role in aiding gravitational collapse, as molecular cloud dynamics is a complicated multi-scale process. For high mass stars, the situation is ever more complicated, as accretion disks can cause a star or protostar to become gravitationally unstable and fragment into smaller stars. Keep in mind, however, that the IMF for high mass stars is more uncertain than low mass stars, and so we can expect theory of high mass stellar formation to be more uncertain. Note, that the vast majority of stars are not considered to be ""high mass."" To the OP's question: Does it mean that there are other ways by which a star can form? I mean, other than the gravitational collapse of gas and dust? I interpret the language of the Wikipedia article as an attempt to being fair, in the sense that, gravitational collapse is by far the most likely formation scenario for most stars, especially for stars like our Sun, while leaving some room for unlikely yet possible alternatives in, perhaps finely tuned, regions of the parameter space. Another possibility that is considered are stellar mergers, but this also has issues when confronted with observations, and requires some fine tuning of binary hardening in clusters and interactions with tertiary components and is really only feasible in clusters with just the right density."
Are we made of the stuff of one star or more stars?,"The precise presolar history isn't known. I'll try to tell a likely story backward in time. Our sun probably has brothers and sisters scattered throughout the Milky Way. Further back in time our sun likely was part of on open star cluster like the Hyades. Open star clusters are not stable and eject stars over hundreds of millions of years. (More about attempts to find Sun's siblings.) Such star clusters typically form in nebulae like the Orion Nebula. Dense nebulae typically contain short-lived stars with multiple solar masses, which typically end as supernova, adding heavy atoms to the nebula and surrounding interstellar medium. Our sun is rich in heavy atoms, easy to detect in spectral lines of sunlight or in solar wind; those atoms cannot have formed in the sun, because its core is not yet hot enough to form these elements; some will never form in the sun. Earth mainly consists of chemical elements heavier than helium. Stars like our sun, rich in heavy elements, are called population I stars (astronomers call all chemical elements besides hydrogen and helium metals). Population I stars (and Earth) can only have formed, at least in parts, from supernova remnants. Old stars, born in a time, when the immediate predecessor(s) of our sun were born, can still be found in the Milky Way. They are called population II stars. They contain less material made of heavy elements than our sun, but still more than provided by the big bang. Therefore there must have existed even older stars, called population III stars. Supernovae also can destabilize the interstellar medium due to shock fronts, eventually leading to local collapse especially of nebulae. Presolar grains are still raining down on Earth; ""the elements in these particles were made at different times (and places) in the early Milky Way"". By this, the likely answer to the question is, that we probably consist of remnants of several supernovae, and of several generations of supernovae."
Does a planet's mass or gravity affect the height of it's mountains?,"Yes, gravity definitely affects the maximum heigh of mountains. Think on a solid bar of steel. It sticks straight because of the electronic forces. But when you make it larger and larger gravity makes it bend: gravity starts being considerable, but still smaller than electronic forces. If you make the bar larger, there will be a moment in which the weight of the whole bar will be larger than the short-range electronic force: your bar will break purely due to gravity. Exactly the same happens to mountains made of solid rock (as opposed to sedimentary ones quoted by Hobbes). There is a point,k depending on the strenght of planetary gravity, where it takes over short-range electronic forces, making the mountain collapse. This is exactly the force that ""rounds up"" the planets, as opposed to the non-spherical asteroids."
Why did Mars lose its magnetic field?,"Our own magnetic field is generated by convection currents in Earth's liquid outer core. A useful summary from Physics.org: Differences in temperature, pressure and composition within the outer core cause convection currents in the molten metal as cool, dense matter sinks whilst warm, less dense matter rises. This flow of liquid iron generates electric currents, which in turn produce magnetic fields. The spiralling caused by the Coriolis force means that separate magnetic fields created are roughly aligned in the same direction. Mars used to have a liquid iron core, but it was never as extensive as Earth's and has long since solidified. Once our own core cools enough to solidify, we too will lose our magnetic field."
Shouldn't this cause a fire?,"It could start a fire if the screen is at the focal point of the optical system. That is how you light fires with a magnifying glass. Here, the blackboard is likely away from the focal point, so you can see the shape of the eclipse (and you get a bigger image) without setting things on fire. Although this is fairly safe, there are a few things to pay attention to: Not an answer to the question, but an important note: Observing the Sun is the most hazardous thing you can do in astronomy. Make sure you know what you are doing before you try."
Simple experimental evidence that Earth revolves around Sun,"The answer is ironic: Without good instruments, there is no evidence. The people who thought that the Sun went around the Earth were perfectly correct as far as the actual evidence went until the early 1700s and mid-1800s when two lines of evidence opened up that showed that the Earth moved. Wikipedia has a correct but over-complicated explanation. The easiest way to think about it is to imagine yourself at a stop sign in a car in the rain, and the rain is falling straight down. When you start moving, the rain's apparent direction of fall changes so that it appears to be falling from ahead of you and slanting down towards you. That's aberration. In the early 1700s, the stars were discovered to be shifting position, and in 1727, James Bradley correctly identified it as abberation of starlight due to the motion of the Earth around the Sun. (For any star in the ecliptic, the Earth is moving towards it at some time of the year and away from it six months later.) Wikipedia's article on parallax is better, and I refer you to it for details. Basically, if you hold your finger up before you and look at it with your left eye closed, and then with your right eye closed, it appears to jump with respect to the background -- the wall beyond or the trees outside or whatever. Switch back and forth between your eyes quickly to see it clearly. As the Earth circles around the Sun, nearby stars also appear to shift their position relative to the more distant stars.  A key point here is that there were good scientific reasons to suppose that the stars were much smaller than the Sun. Seen through a telescope, stars showed disks and if they were like the Sun, their distance could be deduced from those disks. And they were close enough that if the Earth really went around the Sun, parallax should have been observed. But it wasn't and the lack of any noticeable parallax was a strong empirical argument against Heliocentric theories. In reality of course parallax exists, but the parallax of all stars is small, because they are much further away than was estimated from their disks. (The visible disks were actually diffraction disks and not true disks at all -- but it was not until nearly a century later that diffraction began to be understood.)  Friedrich Bessel first measure the real parallax of a star in 1838."
Is it possible to do planet observation during the day?,"Jupiter can be seen during the day.  This image is by Philip Crude. Philip is an experienced astro-photographer. On his webpage http://www.billionplanetsquest.com/p/planets.html he gives details of the equipment and settings used: This image was captured through my [i.e., Philip Crude's] Celestron CGEM-800 using a ZWO ASI120MC camera at prime focus. Resolution 640 x 480, 35fps best of 900, Brightness @ 1, Gamma @ 48, Gain @ 11. The image was acquistioned with SharpCap and processed with RegiStax and CS6. Philip also tweeted the image here. The main difficulty is pointing the telescope in the right direction, as you won't be able to align it against the background of stars, so you need to predict the position and point the telescope accordingly."
"Why is the Eagle Nebula so ""static""?","It appears to be static because it's huge beyond your imagination. The distance to the nebula is 7,000 light years. Its apparent size is 7 arc minutes. Therefore its linear size is about 14 light years. Think about that. The whole nebula is so big, it takes light 14 years to cross it. Any motion therein must necessarily be much, much slower. No wonder you're not seeing much change. Data source: wikipedia Calculation using Wolfram Alpha"
Why do galaxies collide?,"The universe is expanding on a large scale. But locally things are always messy. Locally, galaxies are not set in stone, they move relative to each other, and the directions are random. If they're moving towards each other fast enough, then they will collide. Also, there's gravity. Some galaxies are bound to each other by gravity, and that will tend to pull them together. As to why galaxies move at all, relative to each other - well, things in this universe have kinetic energy, and it's distributed randomly. Being distributed randomly, all kinds of scenarios are possible - things running away from each other, zooming past each other, bumping into each other, etc. It's a messy and random universe, and the order of expansion becomes apparent only on the largest scale."
Is Jupiter still an anomaly?,"A recent study indicates that Cold Jupiters similar to Saturn and Jupiter greatly outnumber Hot Jupiters. The authors studied 18 years worth of data to find long-period exoplanets, that is planets far from their host star.  Cold Jupiters, being farther from their host star, have longer periods than Hot Jupiters. Therefore, they need to be observed over a longer time frame to see multiple transits. ETs would need to observe the Sun for 12 years before seeing two transits of Jupiter, and that still wouldn't be enough to confirm its presence.   Planets that are further out also induce smaller variations in the velocity of their host star, so the spectrum of the star is shifted by a smaller amount. Therefore higher resolution spectrographs are needed to detect Cold Jupiters using the radial velocity method.  Finding more Warm and Hot Jupiters at the beginning of the era of exoplanetary discovery was an observational bias due to the limits of the instrumentation available at the time, and the amount of time needed to find long-period exoplanets. "
Are there any double stars that I can actually see orbit each other?,"Probably Porrima, $\gamma$ Vir, is the best candidate for most observers in the Northern Hemisphere to see changes in a binary orbit, particularly using a small telescope. It is a pair of stars with similar size and visual magnitude, of about 3.6. Their orbital period is about 169 years, but the orbit is eccentric, e = 0.88. They are also relatively close at about 40 ly. Periapsis was in 2005, so the stars are now moving away from each other, but their rate of separation is decreasing. Separation at periapsis was about 0.4 arcsec, so would not have been resolved using a small telescope in 2005. By 2015 their separation was ~2.5 arcsec, and will increase to ~3 arcsec by 2020. I estimated a position angle change between 2015-2020 of ~7 degrees. These changes should be detectable with a 100-200 mm (4-8 inch) telescope. Since most short period binaries are close together, with nearly circular orbits, and often more distant, they are very difficult or impossible to resolve with a small telescope. As mentioned in @MichaelWalsby's answer, it is also possible to observe the orbit of the white dwarf binary companion to Sirius, the brightest star visible in the night sky. Sirius is only 8.6 ly away, and their orbit has a semi-major axis of about 7.5 arcsec, an eccectricity of e = 0.59, and a period of about 50 years. If this pair were similar in brightness, they would be an easy answer to this question. Unfortunately, Sirius B, or the Pup (as the companion is known to amateur astronomers), is ~10 magnitudes dimmer than Sirius, and usually lost in its glare. It takes a night with excellent seeing, i.e. a stable, non-turbulent atmosphere, especially since Sirius never gets much above 30 degrees elevation at the mid-northern latitude where I live. I have only seen the Pup 4 or 5 times (one view was probable but not certain) over almost 6 decades of observing, and I have never seen it in a telescope with aperture under 300 mm. I know other amateurs that have seen Sirius B in 150-200 mm telescopes, but mostly at lower latitudes. However, by seeing Sirius B at intervals separated by decades, I have observed its polar angle change. I believe the separation of Sirius B is now over 10 arcsec, and still increasing slightly. So for the next couple of decades, observing it might be a bit easier. In recent winters I have  tried with telescopes from a 120 mm refractor to a 250 mm Dobsonian, and occasionally larger, but still have not seen it for several years. This Hubble photo of Sirius gives some idea why Sirius B is hard to observe in small telescopes. Also, many eclipsing binaries are often observed, and their light curves measured. By analyzing light curves, orbital elements can be estimated. However, these indirect orbital observations are  probably stretching the intent of the original question."
Is the Astronomical Unit measured from the Sun's center or from the surface?,"The AU is, by definition, exactly 149,597,870,700 m. This is based not on a distance to the sun (which varies) but on the shape of an ellipse that closely approximates the orbit of the Earth.  An ellipse has two foci. In a Keplerian, two-body orbit, the combined centre of mass of the two bodies lies at the focus of the ellipse. For the Earth/sun this is only an approximation since there are more than two bodies in the solar system. An ellipse has a long axis, and half this long axis is called the semimajor axis.  The original notion for the AU was that it would be the semimajor axis of the Earth. Equivalently it is the average of the shortest and longest distances of the Earth from the focus of the ellipse.  And since, to a good approximation, the sun is at the focus of the ellipse, the AU is the average distance to the sun. The actual semi-major-axis is slightly variable, due to perturbations of other planets. By 1976 a new definition was needed in terms of a theoretical, negligible-mass particle in a circular one-year orbit about the sun (in that definition it was the theoretical distance to the centre of the sun from the particle), and by 2012 the known accuracy of the AU was such that corrections would need to be made to account for General Relativity. It was then decided to fix the length, rather than try to account for ever more accurate measurements. For comparison, the semimajor axis is measured as 149,597,887,500 m. This differs from the defined value by 10km.  The actual distance to the sun varies by about 4 million km"
How can Io be tidally heated while it is in tidal lock?,"How can Io be tidally heated while it is in tidal lock? It is tidally locked in a mean motion sense of ""tidally locked"". That Io is in an eccentric orbit rather than a circular orbit means that tidal stresses can and do build up. Lainey et al. claim that the global energy dissipation in a tidally-stressed moon is given by
$$\dot E = -\frac{21}2 \frac{k_2}Q \frac{n^5R^5}G e^2$$
where The ratio $k_2/Q$ strongly depends on the makeup of the moon's interior. Compared to a moon with a solid interior, a moon with a partially molten interior will have a slightly higher value of $k_2$ and a significantly lower value of $Q$. Io's volcanism is a sign of a moon with at least a partially molten interior. The power of five on the mean motion and moon radius means that a large moon that orbits close to its parent planet will be subject to vastly more tidal stress than a small moon that orbits far from the parent planet. Io is a large moon (larger than our Moon) and it orbits fairly close to Jupiter. Finally, even though Io's eccentricity is small, it is not zero. The fact of $e^2$ means that the tidal energy dissipation strongly depends on eccentricity. Those tidal stresses normally would act to circularize Io's orbit about Jupiter, thereby reducing the tidal stresses. However, Io is also in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance with Europa and Ganymede. These interactions tend to increase Io's eccentricity. This has been hypothesized to lead to an interesting hysteresis loop (e.g., Yoder). Suppose Io's interior is cool and its eccentricity is very low. This makes tidal stresses very low. This reduces the impact of Jupiter's circularization effects on Io's orbit. The resonance effects now begin to dominate, making Io's orbit become more eccentric. Tidal stresses now become significant and Io's interior warms up. At some point, the tidal stresses that lead to circularization dominate over the effects of Europa and Ganymede. Io's orbit circularizes and Io's interior cools. Rinse and repeat. Lainey, et al. ""Strong tidal dissipation in Io and Jupiter from astrometric observations,"" Nature 459.7249 (2009): 957-959. Yoder, Charles F. ""How tidal heating in Io drives the Galilean orbital resonance locks."" Nature 279.5716 (1979): 767-770."
Why is there a mountain inside the Herschel crater on Mimas?,"In the extreme energy of a large impact, the rock behaves like a liquid (It isn't actually completely melted, though some is. The extreme forces cause the rock to flow). As the impactor hits the moon, rock is pushed out, and since it is surrounded by relatively solid rock, it is pushed up. Then gravity takes over as the rock that has been pushed up now pushes back down. This forces rock to flow towards the centre of the crater. And again, in the centre, there is nowhere to go but up.  Once the rocks have settled they act as solid rock again, and the central peak (and crater edge) are preserved.  This is seen not only on Mimas, but on many other large craters. You can see this effect when something falls into water. Water splashes back forming a central peak. 

 You can also see peak formation in a sandbox model of cratering

Is it possible to completely see the edge of a half moon at night?,"As uhoh has written in the comments, this phenomenon is known as ""planetshine"", and in this case more specifically ""earthshine"". The sunlight hits the earth and is reflected to the moon, illuminating what cannot be directly reached by the sunlight.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetshine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthlight_(astronomy)"
What (the heck) is a Super Worm Equinox Moon?,"All those adjectives being smooshed together signify an uncommon event. That's why you've never seen them together like that before. All 3 conditions have to hold true: It's a supermoon, which means the full moon coincides with the moons perigee or nearest approach. That can make it appear up to 30% brighter than one at apogee (farthest away). These happen about every 13 months and it doesn't have to be exact so usually, we get 2 of them in a row, like we did this year. February had a supermoon and so did March. It's a worm moon, which means it is occurring in the month of March (see @astrosnapper's answer for a better explanation of that). It's during an equinox, basically the first day of spring (or autumn). If any one of those isn't happening then it can't be called a Super Worm Equinox Moon. Apparently, the term supermoon (all one word, by the way) is a relatively recent thing. I tried to view it on Google N Gram viewer, but... It is a particularly bright full moon and it does deserve to have its own terminology, IMO. Update: The rarity of the event is certainly relative. I saw a tweet from National Geographic that we also had a super worm equinox moon 19 years ago."
Why are radio telescopes often built into natural depressions?,"Depressions are ideal for extremely large single-dish telescopes like Arecibo and FAST for several reasons, but the single greatest advantage is structural. These instruments are several hundred meters in diameter and therefore require delicate support systems to maintain their shape and avoid collapse. You could certainly try and build a freestanding dish, but it would be even harder than it already is. The karst depression FAST was built in, Dawodang, is close to spherical, like the telescope, making building the support structure comparatively easy (Zhu et al. 2018). Besides the structural benefits unique for these large dishes, building a telescope in such a depression provides natural shielding from radio frequency interference. Some radio telescopes built on flat ground, like those at the Green Bank Observatory, are similarly protected by the surrounding hills (as well as, in Green Bank's case, a large radio quiet zone). Both Arecibo and FAST benefit from walls of their depressions -- one reason Arecibo's current site is considered promising for the telescope's possible successor, regardless of configuration (Anish Roshi et al. 2021). Finally, depressions provide drainage. Water can flow to the center of the natural bowl and, particularly in karst topography, subsequently seep into the ground -- one advantage they have over other types of depressions, like craters or mine pits. While karst is permeable, it isn't fragile, so you don't have to sacrifice stability for the sake of drainage. Basically, the structural advantages of depressions are applicable just to these extremely large telescopes, but there are side benefits, albeit ones which other, smaller radio telescopes not located in depressions can achieve in other ways."
Intuitive explanation of the source of energy that cause Jupiter and Saturn to migrate outward in the Grand Tack Hypothesis?,"First let's try to understand why planets migrate inwards. Planets are formed in a protoplanetary disk; a huge disk of gas and dust that accretes on to a newly forming star at the centre. Gravitational interactions between the planets and the gas in the disk play a very important role in planetary formation and evolution. As planets orbits within the disk, they generate 'spiral density waves'. These are simply changes to the density of the gas in the region local to the planet, which move at a different speed compared to the rest of the material in the disk. The consequence is that the wave exterior to the planet exerts a negative torque and acts to slow the planet down. The wave interior to the planet exerts a positive torque and speeds it up. The net effect is that the negative torque wins, which causes the planet to lose angular momentum and migrate towards the star. On the timescales of planetary formation this is a relatively fast process, and typically affects lower mass planets. When you have a planet as large as Jupiter, something else happens. The torques that the planet exerts on the disk are so strong that the repel the gas away from its orbital region entirely, opening up a 'gap' in the disk. The planet now migrates inwards following the natural evolution of the disk ie. the timescale that gas naturally migrates and accretes on to the star. The planet and the gap migrate inwards together as one. This is a much slower than the process than the one described for smaller planets, hence why Saturn was able to catch up with Jupiter. So, why did Jupiter migrate outwards? When Jupiter and Saturn became locked in an orbital resonance, they formed a common gap in the disk. Saturn essentially cleared the region exterior to Jupiter, reducing the torque exerted on Jupiter by the outer part of the disk. But the gas repelled away by Jupiter in the inner region became piled up at the inner edge of the disk, increasing in density and enhancing its own torques back on Jupiter. The net effect is now that the positive torques from the inner disk overcome the negative torques from the outer disk, and the planets migrate outwards. For this to work, you need quite a specific scenario. Modelling suggests that outward migration can only occur when the inner planet is 2-4x larger that the outer planet. For further reading I would highly suggest this recent review by Raymond & Morbidelli (2020), which gives an excellent description of our best current models of the formation of the Solar System."
Is it a coincidence that both the Sun and the Moon look of same size from the Earth?,"The coincidence isn't so much that they appear very similar sizes from Earth, but that we are alive to see them at the point in time in which they appear very similar sizes.  The moon is slowly moving away from the Earth, and at some point in the future the moon will be unable to totally eclipse the sun and conversely, if you could step far into prehistory, you would be able to see the moon with a much greater angular diameter than you see it now. Most research I've found on the topic seem to be unavailable through my institute, however I did find one paper, ""Outcomes of tidal evolution"", which references results from Goldreich's research on the subject. This qualitative description of the eventual disruption of the Earth-Moon system is confirmed by the results of Goldreich's numerical integration, which showed that the moon will recede to 75 Earth radii, when spin-orbit synchronism will be reached; then the Moon's orbit will decay steadily inward because of the influence of the Sun. For reference, the Moon is currently at a distance of approximately 60.3 Earth radii.  As such, the moon will steadily move away until synchronism would be reached, and from that point begin to recede towards the Earth due to the tidal affects of the Sun on the Earth disturbing the synchronization. It would seem that at some eventual point in the far distant future, it will return to this coincidental position once again. Counselman III, Charles C. ""Outcomes of tidal evolution."" The Astrophysical Journal 180 (1973): 307-316."
Do these results mean that I have found this exoplanet?,"It could be an exoplanet transit (but that doesn't mean it is). The star in question, TIC92352620, is an F8 main sequence star, which would be much larger than any plausible planet. If a planet transits in front of such a star, you expect a very rapid entry and exit to the eclipse with a flattish bottom, where any curvature can be attributed to limb darkening on the host star. The transit should repeat and look the same each time. I'd say your potential transit passes that test, so it could be a Jupiter-sized planet on a 4-day orbit. Even then, there are false positives that can produce similar results (e.g. the presence of a contribution of light from an eclipsing binary star that encroaches within the point spread function of the instrument - i.e. an unrelated star contaminating the data). As to where you go from here, well, the discovery of an unremarkable transiting exoplanet is of interest, but not really headline news any more. A significant amount of work would remain to confirm the candidate and rule out possible false positives. At the least, because this is a bright star, one should obtain spectroscopy that shows any radial velocity deviations are very small, commensurate with a planetary nature for the companion. Some information on eliminating (some) false positives in TESS data https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/nora-dot-eisner/planet-hunters-tess/talk/4733/2174551"
How does the evolution of a solar system not break the second law of thermodynamics?,"The total entropy actually increases, as the molecular cloud shrinks under gravity. It may seem that as the molecules are getting closer, they are more ordered, which means less entropy. That is however only one part of the process. The second (important) part is: when the molecules are closer, they also have higher kinetic energy (since they descended into lower gravitational potential). So the gas is getting hotter, as it shrinks. The increase in temperature of the gas is increasing its entropy, because the molecules occupy more momentum space. This increase in entropy via temperature is bigger than the decrease in entropy via the shrinking itself. Later on, the hot condensed gas (or hot planet) radiates the heat into the space and cools down. You end up with a cold planet which indeed has lower entropy than the original gas cloud, because it is no longer hot. But the entropy increase was carried away by the radiated photons. So in total - entropy of the universe increased (the radiated photons are out there somewhere). You can find some more detailed discussion of this topic on the excellent web page by John Baez or here."
What's the reason that we have a different number of days each month?,"You make a great point. The reason behind the discrepancy between the dates is due to a complicated history behind it. The calendar is based on the calendar created by ancient Romans, which is based on one Moon cycle. One lunar cycle is  29.53 days. www.universetoday.com/20620/lunar-year/ which does not evenly divide into the 365.25 days of the year. Note: The Romans borrowed the calendar from the ancient Greeks to develop the idea of a 10-month calendar that left approximately 60 days unaccounted for. Consequently, the earliest ancient Roman calendars had months that were either 29 or 30 days to account for this discrepancy.  The Romans started using the 10-month calendar in 738 B.C. Their months were initially called: To account for the remaining $\sim60$ days, Mensis Ianuarius (January) was added to the beginning of the year and Mensis Februarius (February) to the end of the year during Numa's reign around 700 B.C. with a leap year every 4 years.  Leap years were decreed by proclamation the pontifex maximus, in such years an extra month was added to the calendar. Quoted from PM 2Ring The calendar stayed in that order until 452 B.C. when a small council of Romans, called the Decemvirs, moved February to follow January.  However,  in the initial 36 years of its adoption leap days were added every 3 years due to a misunderstanding (Romans used inclusive counting), Quoted from PM 2Ring so that caused a big problem. In fact, by the start of the reign of Julius Caesar, the previous calendar was off by a whole week! Julius Caesar noticed this and thus modified the Roman calendar in 46 B.C. to make each month have either 30 or 31 days, with the exception of Februarius[February], which had 29 days, with the three year leap year fixed into a four year leap year. Quintilis[July] was later renamed Julius[July] in his honor. Likewise, Sextilis[August] later became Augustus[August] to honor Augustus (Gaius Octavius, the first Roman Emperor). Augustus[August] was also given an extra day (taken away from Februarius[February]), so that Augustus and Julius would have an equal number of days, representing their equal power. This is the Julian Calendar. This calendar was extremely accurate, but was still not accurate
  enough as it drifts by approximately 3 days every 400 years. So after
  a few hundred years, the drift becomes noticeable
  (i.e. the seasons don't properly match the calendar), which is
  important for farming, and therefore human survival.  quoted from  CJ Dennis Then a pope named Pope Gregory XIII modified the Julian calendar again in October 1582. This is the currently used Gregorian calendar. He made it so that  Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar This calendar is the most accurate calendar currently used, and won't be a single day off until the year of $\pm 3200$ AD. It isn't perfect though. Compared to the tropical year, it is 27 seconds too long. This is... due to astronomical effects (the
  rotation of the Earth speeding up and slowing down, etc.) we can't be
  more precise than that.  quoted from CJ Dennis As for your other question, unless the plates taken had accurate dates of when recorded, it would be rather impossible to calculate precisely."
How fast are we moving relative to the CMB?,"Yes, our (i.e. the Sun's) motion in the ""global"", or comoving, reference frame can be measured accurately from the dipole of the cosmic microwave background. The latest results from the Planck Collaboration et al. (2018) yielded a velocity of
$$369.82\pm0.11\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}
$$
in the direction

\ell & = & 264.021º\pm0.011º\\
b    & = & 48.253º\pm0.005º

$$
(in Galactic coordinates). Since Earth orbits the Sun with some $30\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, there's a small, biannual correction to this result. On much larger timescales ($\sim100\,\mathrm{Myr}$) our motion round the Milky Way alters our comoving velocity with the order of $\sim100\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$."
Why can't light escape from a black hole?,"A black hole has an event horizon which 'marks the point of no return'. So yes, light cannot escape from a black hole. Why? Well, think of a 'spacetime fabric'. It's the easiest way to understand the physics at work here, in my opinion. Usually, the fabric would look like this: 
(source: whyfiles.org)  However, a black hole has so much gravity that one could say it 'rips' the spacetime fabric: 
(source: ddmcdn.com)  When the light hits this area of amazingly intense gravity, it simply cannot get out - the light travels 'along' the fabric, and since there is a rip in the fabric, one could say it simply goes away - it becomes part of the singularity. This is a simplification, of course, but it's enough to understand at least part of the physics behind this phenonenom."
how far away could we detect that Earth has life?,"I had put off answering this question because it seems too broad without specifying what sort of detection methods are proposed. But if you answer it directly from the perspective of - if we were to take the solar system and put it at some distance from us, would we able to detect signs of life on planet Earth - then the answer is probably not. Using current technology (and by that I mean experiments and telescopes that are available now) we would probably be unable to detect life on Earth even if observed from a distance of a few light years. Therefore there are no stars within this sphere (other than the Sun). No planets quite like the Earth have yet been detected around another star. That is to say, none that have a similar mass, radius and orbit at 1 au (or close to it) from a solar-type star [EDIT: There is of course now a close contender in Kepler-452b, though it is 60% bigger than Earth; Jenkins et al. 2015.]. With current technology, it is just about in reach. Therefore any directed search for life on Earth has a limited number of places in which to start. If you can't detect the planet at all then there is absolutely no chance of looking at its atmospheric composition to look for biomarkers (e.g. oxygen along with a reducing gas like methane, or chlorofluorocarbons from an industrial civilisation - Lin et al. 2014). The only exoplanets for which atmospheric compositions have been (crudely and tentatively) measured are ""hot Jupiters"". - giant exoplanets orbiting very close to their parent stars.  A ""blind"" search could look for radio signatures and of course this is what SETI has been doing. If we are talking about detecting ""Earth"", then we must assume that we are not talking about deliberate beamed attempts at communication, and so must rely on detecting random radio ""chatter"" and accidental signals generated by our civilisation.
The SETI Phoenix project was the most advanced search for radio signals from other intelligent life. Quoting from Cullers et al. (2000): ""Typical signals, as opposed to our strongest signals, fall below the detection threshold of most surveys, even if the signal were to originate from the nearest star"". Quoting from Tarter (2001): ""At current levels of sensitivity, targeted microwave searches could detect the equivalent power of strong TV transmitters at a distance of 1 light year (within which there are no other stars)..."". The equivocation in these statements is due to the fact that we do emit stronger beamed signals in certain well-defined directions, for example to conduct metrology in the solar system using radar. Such signals have been calculated to be observable over a thousand light years or more. But these signals are brief, beamed into an extremely narrow angle and unlikely to be repeated. You would have to be very lucky to be observing in the right direction at the right time if you were performing targeted searches.  Hence my assertion that with current methods and telescopes there is not much chance of success. But of course technology advances and in the next 10-20 years there may be better opportunities. The first step in a directed search would be to find planets like Earth. The first major opportunity will be with the TESS spacecraft, launching in 2017, capable of detecting earth-sized planets around the brightest 500,000 stars. However, it's 2-year mission would limit the ability to detect an Earth-analogue. The best bet for finding other Earths will come later (2024 perhaps) with the launch of Plato, a six-year mission that again, studies the brightest stars. However, there is then a big leap forward required to perform studies of the atmospheres of these planets. Direct imaging and spectroscopy would probably require space-borne nulling interferometers; indirect observations of phase-effects and transmission spectroscopy through an exoplanet atmosphere does not require great angular resolution, just massive precision and collecting area. Spectroscopy of something the size of Earth around a normal star will probably require a bigger successor to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST - launch  2018), or even more collecting area than will be provided by the E-ELT in the next decade. For example Snellen (2013) argues it would take 80-400 transits-worth of exposure time (i.e. 80-400 years!) to detect the biomarker signal of an Earth-analogue with the E-ELT! It has been suggested that new radio telescope projects and technology like the Square Kilometre Array may be capable of serendipitously detecting radio ""chatter"" out to distances of 50 pc ($\sim 150$ light years) - see Loeb & Zaldarriaga (2007). This array, due to begin full operation some time after 2025 could also monitor a multitude of directions at once for beamed signals. A good overview of what might be possible in the near future is given by Tarter et al. (2009)."
What is the formula to predict lunar and solar eclipses accurately?,"Calculation of solar eclipses can be done using Besselian elements. The basic idea is to compute the motion of the Moon's shadow on a plane that crosses the Earth's center. Then, the shadow cone of the Moon can be projected on the Earth surface. The Besselian elements are the following:  what you have to do now is to compute the variation of these parameters, which are time-dependent. It happens that it can be done using polynomial expensions for a given reference time $t_0$. The polynomial expension is of the form, for a Besselian element a: $$a = a_0 + a_1\times t + a_2\times t^2 + a_3\times t^3$$ (a third order expension is enough in general), with $t = t_1 - t_0$, $t_0$ being the Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT) to the nearest hour of the instant of greatest eclipse.

Why do we believe that the super massive black holes at the centers of two merging galaxies would themselves merge?,"The SMBHs reside in the bottom of the galactic potentials, which are dominated by the galaxies' dark matter halos. But although dark matter dominates gravity, collisions between gas and dust particles in the interstellar medium causes enough friction that the baryonic component of the galaxies is decelerated. This will cause the other components of the galaxies to decelerate as well, through gravitational attraction: traveling through the interstellar medium, the mass (baryonic and non-baryonic) attracted by the SMBH will tend to increase in density behind the SMBH, slowing it down, and effect called dynamical friction. Moreover, despite dark matter (and, in practice, stars and black holes since they're so small) being collisionless, there are several ways of ""relaxing"", i.e. to evolve towards an equilibrium. In the context of galaxy merging, the most important mechanism (I think) is ""violent relaxation"", where the rapid change of the gravitational potential causes particles to relax, e.g. more massive particles tend to transfer more energy to their lighter neighbors and so become more tightly bound, sinking towards the center of the gravitational potential. Although SMBHs are…, well, supermassive, the potential will (usually) be dominated by dark matter, gas, and stars, so the new gravitational potential will also cause the SMBHs to seek towards the bottom in the same fashion, and eventually merge."
Future of CMB observations: How will our knowledge of the early universe change?,"This is a great question. I know of a couple of really big things about inflation people want to be able to nail down by using the cosmic microwave background.  The first is measuring what are known as E- and B- modes, which are the curl-free and divergence-free components to the modes of cmb radiation:  Essentially, measuring large scale Gaussian B-modes from primordial gravitational waves will help constrain the energy scale of inflation. It may also be able to rule out most ekpyrotic and pure curvaton/inhomogeneous reheating models (same source). The other thing people are looking at is this idea of primordial non-Gaussianity, which are second order corrections to the Gaussian fluctuations present in the cmb (review article; early planck results). Measuring a parameter called $f_{nl}$ (deviation from Gaussianity) has been a fairly crucial part of current and future studies and will also help rule out various inflationary models. This $f_{nl}$ parameter is defined as follows: In this case the multipole coeﬃcients $a_{lm}$ of the CMB
    temperature map can be written as
    $$a_{lm} = a_{lm}^{(G)} + f_{nl} a_{lm}^{(NG)} $$
    where $a_{lm}^{(G)}$ is the Gaussian contribution and $a_{lm}^{(NG)}$ is the non-Gaussian contribution."
Why is there a matter/anti-matter asymmetry in the universe?,"Currently, there's no single explanation for this.  The simplest explanation is that there isn't any imbalance — there are large antimatter bodies in the universe; just separated from us. However, these would have to be pretty far away (otherwise the boundary annihilation would be detectable). Theoretically, this requires antimatter to have clumped early on, which is rather unlikely/impossible. A far more likely explanation is that charge-parity symmetry is violated. In other words, flipping the charges and parities in a reaction may not lead to the same dynamics — the outcome (when the charge/parity is flipped back) or distributions of outcomes may not be the same. Usually, we expect that if we flip the charges on both sides of a reaction, the reaction proceeds in the same manner (with same probabilities, etc). There is evidence that suggests that this may not be true. If this is indeed the case, then the matter-antimatter imbalance is not that hard to explain."
Why can't we feel the Earth's revolution?,"You do, but it's too small to really notice First, it's not correct to say that we don't feel Earth's rotation because it's rotating at a constant speed. Think about driving a car, or riding in an airplane.  Whether you're cruising down the road at 90 kph, or soaring through the air at 900 kph, you don't really ""feel the speed"". However, When you take a sharp turn, or take off from the runway, you definitely feel something.  That's the acceleration.  It doesn't matter if your speedometer stays steady - if you take a sudden 90 degree turn, you're going to feel it. More relaxed turns, such as going through a roundabout, or when the airplane circles the airport before landing, are much less likely to spill your drink. Even if Earth is spinning at a constant speed, the spin is a change in direction, which requires acceleration. Acceleration is quite noticeable, depending on its magnitude.  Even just sitting down, you can feel the pull of Earth's 9.8 m/s² gravity - your body's ""weight"", as it were. So how large is the acceleration keeping Earth in orbit?  About 0.0059 m/s².
What about the acceleration of Earth's rotation?  A ever so slightly larger 0.0339 m/s². Small wonder that it seems like you can't feel these forces!"
What will happen to life on Earth when the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies collide?,"What will happen to life on earth or human beings on earth? Assuming that human beings, or life, still exists on Earth at that time, they will have survived so much due to the ongoing death of the sun, that the gravitational pertubations due to the galactic collision will be nothing. Keep in mind that in about 1-2 billion years, the sun will be so hot and large that all the water will have boiled off the earth into space.  About 3 billion years from now, the surface of the Earth will be so hot that metals will be melting. Any life that has survived those events and still lives on Earth will surely take a galactic collision in stride. I imagine, though, that most humans will have fled Earth - if not for distant star systems, then at least for planets in our own system that are going to be warming up enough for human habitation. If we are about to collide in next 4 billion year then how long before we should take action for inter-stellar voyage?  As soon as possible. When interstellar voyage becomes possible, we should start sending out ships to colonize other planets and star systems.  This will likely take a long time, but if we are to survive more than a billion years, it is necessary. Keep in mind that the Sun and Andromeda are events we can predict.  We don't know, and can't predict, the next cataclysmic asteroid strike, which is likely to happen in a shorter time than a billion years.  There are lots of reasons to exit the planet, we should be worried about the ones we can't predict or see, not the ones we can predict. Are scientists working on such projects for inter-stellar voyage? Yes, but in small steps.  Manned missions to space, to the moon, and living aboard the ISS have provided significantly valuable information that will be used in such interstellar missions.  As we continue to push the boundaries of our ability to survive in space we eventually will be able to live in space, perhaps whole lifetimes will be spent in space.  As engine technology progresses beyond simply lifting people out of Earth's gravitational well, we will eventually be sending people on long voyages outside our solar system. It's a very, very long way off, but each advance takes us closer to that eventual goal."
What makes protoplanetary disks start rotating? (Initial energy needed to rotate),"Two rocks placed in space with no relative motion are going to be attracted by gravity, and hit. 3 rocks, placed in space with no carefully rigged symmetry, will likely miss each other, as the gravitational attraction of the additional rock changes their course. Those near misses are the beginning of rotation. Multiply that effect by trillions, and you have a protoplanetary disk. Of course, a lot of those molecules, dust and rock won't even start out with zero relative velocity, so near misses are inevitable."
Is the Big Bang a theory or a model?,"Back in the good old days, we used words like theory, model, hypothesis, law and so on, and their meanings arose from how the words were used, and dictionaries organised these senses - just like other words.  Then someone (probably in America) came up with the idea ""We don't teach evolution because it's just a theory.""  And after much shouting, people decided that words like ""theory"" had to have ""scientific"" definitions - the dictionaries weren't good enough, and nobody was to say ""just a theory"". And since then people have had these odd discussions ""Is evolution a theory or hypothesis""... ""Is Newtonian gravity a model or a theory or a law"". So what about ""Big Bang""  - well it's mostly a slogan, initially formed to ridicule the idea of a hot, dense state of the universe.  Later adopted as shorthand for this notion.  As such it isn't a model. It isn't a (usually mathematical) description of some natural phenomenon that can be used to make predictions.  The ΛCDM model of the universe is a model. Models are usually simplified in some way so that one can use them to make predictions.  But sometimes when people talk about the ""big bang"" they are using it as a shorthand for a range of models of cosmology that have an early dense state. It is a theory, it is an explanation for the observation that matter in the universe seems to be moving away from us in all directions.  Sometimes when people talk about the big bang, they are using it as a shorthand in contrast to a theory that matter is constantly created, or theories that the apparent motion is deceptive (etc). Sometimes ""Big Bang"" is just used as a shorthand for scientific cosmology, in contrast to that described in the Hindu Yugas, or the Bible, or other religious or mythological texts. So the answer to this is 1) not very important.  2) Depends on what you understand these words to mean. But of the two words ""theory"" seems to fit better."
Can a planet in our system eclipse the sun as seen from another one?,"In our solar system, it is possible for one planet to partially eclipse the sun, but it is not possible for any planet to cause a full solar eclipse as seen from another planet. The sun is too big and the planets are too small and too far apart.  Transits occur, and can occur for any pair of planets, but they are very rare.  As seen from earth, Mercury only transits a dozen or so times per century, and before 2004, the last time Venus had transited the sun was 1882. http://www.eclipsewise.com/transit/transit.html Orbital periods increase for the planets further away from the sun, so transits across the sun by the outer planets (while possible since no planets are in orbital resonance since Pluto got kicked out) are increasingly rare. Michael Seifert dug up these treasures, documenting transits of the outer planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus.  As expected, the transit of Uranus from Neptune is the rarest, occurring next in October, 38172 CE. Proof that no planets could fully eclipse the sun from another planet:
To rule out the possibility that any eclipses are possible, We only have to verify orbits pairwise in order of increasing distance from the sun. Since, if the $nth$ planet can't fully eclipse the sun from the $n+1_{th}$ planet than it certainly won't be able to do so from any other planet.  For example, if Jupiter can't eclipse the sun from Saturn, it certainly won't be able to from Neptune. As seen from a planet, if the apparent size of the sun in the sky is smaller than the apparent size of the next inner planet, then a full eclipse is possible.  The largest an inner planet can appear from an outer planet is when the inner planet is at aphelion and the outer planet is at perihelion and the pass is directly overhead of the observer. The formula for angular radius of a sphere is $\delta = \arcsin (d/2D)$ where d is the diameter of the sphere and D is the distance between the observer and the center of the sphere. I ran these calculations using matlab and data from NASA. https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/
For my input data, the rows are planets, and the columns are diameter (km), perihelion (e6km), and aphelion (e6km). Here are my results.  Since the values in the second column are smaller than the first for each row, no inter-planetary solar eclipse is possible. As an example of how to read this table, an observer on Venus will see an angular radius of 6.48e-3 radians for the sun in the sky, but an angular radius of only 6.47e-5 radians for the next inner planet, which is Mercury.  Here is my matlab code for posterity:"
Why is the Moon's orbit so complicated?,"The moon is so big that the processes that circularize and reduce the equatorial inclination would take much longer. The moon is big because of how it formed: a huge collision in the early solar system. (Unlike, say the Galilean moons that probably formed along with Jupiter, or Triton, that looks like a captured TNO) The other fact that makes its orbit complex is that the moon is the closest moon to the sun, so solar perturbation is more significant than for other moons.  Solar perturbation is the main cause of the periodic variation in inclination and the various other forms of precession seen in the moon's orbit. The sun also pulls the moon out of a equatorial orbit and into a roughly ecliptic orbit as the perturbations of the sun become more significant than those of the equatorial bulge. As noted elsewhere  at lunar distance, the sun provides more than 50% of the gravitational field. So the reason the moon's orbit is complicated is that it does follow the laws of physics, and with three (or more) bodies, those laws have complex effects."
Can a natural satellite exist in a geostationary orbit?,Yes. Charon is in Pluto synchronous orbit. Pluto and Charon are mutually tide locked.
Is Jupiter a failed star?,"No.  Besides the 13 Jupiter-masses required to ignite deuterium burning, and make Jupiter into a Brown Dwarf, there is a clear difference between the formation pathways of Brown Dwarves and Gas Giants.
Gas Giants are planets, that form via processes in their parent protoplanetary disc. Contrasting this, Brown Dwarves form via direct fragmentaion of the parent giant molecular cloud, possibly as binary fragments of a more massive companion star. The distinction between those two processes is supported by the finding and characterisation of the Brown Dwarf desert in i.e. Grether & Lineweaver (2006). The 'Brown Dwarf' desert is a sharp break in the number distributions between low-mass stars and high-mass planets. This is commonly interpreted as those two classes of object being distinct in origin. Furthermore we understand distinct theoretical pathways to form each of those object classes, as mentioned above. Note that if you're talking about the other elements, or as astronomers would call them, metals, then there is data on those as well: The sun, and any star possesses a certain amount of metals, see i.e. Asplund et al. (2009). For example the ratio of Oxygen to Hydrogen in the solar atmosphere is about $n(O)/n(H)\sim 5\times 10^{-4}$, which is the most abundant 'other' element in the sun.
The values of heavier elements found in the gaseous planets are elevated compared to the solar values. This is thought to represent a contribution of solid material that planets need to form according to current theories. If the giant planets would have formed through direct collapse from the same cloud material as the sun did, the abundances of metals in the giant planets would not be elevated compared to the solar values."
Is our sun in a star cluster?,"No the sun is not part of a cluster. There are several types of clusters that we see in the sky. The most familiar is the ""open cluster"", like the Pleiades. These are a group of stars that formed together and have remained close. As the stars drift apart they can become part of a ""moving group"", a collection of stars that don't appear to be a cluster, but since they share the same age and direction of motion we can tell they used to be a cluster.  Many nearby stars are part of the Ursa Major moving group, but the sun is not one. It just happens to be in the same part of the Milky way. The sun was probably part of a cluster shortly after it formed (4.6 billion years ago) but that cluster has long ago broken up. We don't (yet) know of any other stars that seem to have come from the same cluster. Globular clusters, like M13 and Omega Centauri, are larger and have many more stars tightly packed together. They are all rather distant, and the brightest look like slightly fuzzy stars (in fact Omega Centauri was originally thought to be a star). Of course a galaxy is a group of 100 billion stars. We don't normally think of galaxies as a star cluster, because they are so much bigger and the stars in them don't form at the same time. Then there are clusters of galaxies, the Virgo cluster is a cluster of galaxies, and the local group of galaxies is on the edge of this cluster. But the Virgo cluster is not a star cluster."
Why can't we see distant galaxies with the naked eye?,"Surely if you stared long enough, the light from them would eventually hit your eye? Collecting light over a long span of time is how telescopes can see very dim objects. The human visual system doesn't work that way. For one thing, even when you think you are staring at something, your eyes still dance around a bit. It's a built-in response called ocular microtremors. These microtremors appear to be an essential part of making the vision system functional. For another, your eye does not and cannot collect light for arbitrarily long periods of time (the way a photographic telescope can). There's an immense amount of signal processing that happens in the eye and along the way to the brain. This signal processing depends on light being collected for short spans of time. Our vision system evolved to see food, friends, and dangers under well-lit conditions. We are very good at seeing motion in broad daylight. We're not so good at seeing stationary objects, and we're not good at all at seeing barely visible sources under very dark skies. Naked eye astronomy is limited by the nature of the human vision system. The most remote object we can see is the Triangulum Galaxy, and that's only under conditions of extremely dark and extremely clear skies."
Can the Moon eclipse Venus?,"As @Donald.McLean said in comments, the answer is yes, the Moon can and does occult the other planets in the Solar System. When something apparently big (like the Moon) passes in front of something apparently small (another planet) it's called an occultation. (I say apparently because from our perspective the Moon appears larger than the planets.) The planets lie* in the ecliptic plane whereas the Moon's orbit is inclined at about 5° to the ecliptic plane, so the Moon crosses the ecliptic plane twice each orbit, so it's not as frequent as it would be if the Moon's orbit were in the ecliptic plane. Occultations of the planets by the Moon can be found here. There is also software (Occult) that you can use to generate your own predictions. * Although the planets are said to lie in the ecliptic plane, this is a generalisation - they actually have orbits that are within a few degrees of the ecliptic ""plane""."
Is Jupiter made entirely out of gas?,"Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 crashed into Jupiter a few years back.  As well as these molecules, emission from heavy atoms such as iron, magnesium and silicon was detected, with abundances consistent with what would be found in a cometary nucleus.  Those heavy elements are consistent with the comet being at least being partially composed of rock. So Jupiter is known to contain at least some rock. In fact, gas giants are thought to form around an initial small rocky or metallic core, which has sufficient gravity to draw in hydrogen, helium, water etc. from the protoplanetary nebula. By 'small rocky core' something with the mass of two or more earths is usually implied. The gravity field of such a body makes it difficult for even hydrogen to achieve escape velocity."
Are there lightning bolts on Mars?,"Lightning may have been detected on Mars, although it currently appears to be rare, and attempts to replicate the 2006 results have failed so far. New research found that the low pressure on Mars might be the reason why lightning is uncommon.  The atmospheric pressure on Mars appears to be at a minimum for making lightning, as opposed to just coronal discharge. With less atmospheric pressure than it has now, more static charge would build up on each grain, making a sudden lightning bolt more likely.  More pressure, and there would be more grains flying around, building up charge more quickly and increasing the chance of lightning.  Thus the chance for a lightning bolt to happen, rather than just coronal discharge, is much lower than it is on Earth, and is in fact at a minimum.  This could explain why there has been only one detection so far.  Source"
What detail can Hubble see on Mars?,"Forget about magnification. People who know telescopes don't think in terms of magnification. What matters is the angular resolution, or the resolving power: the angular size of the smallest details that you could see in an instrument. Rule of thumb: the resolving power of a telescope with a diameter of 10 cm is 1 arcsecond when using visible light. The numbers are inversely proportional. A 20 cm telescope resolves details 0.5 arcsec in size. A 1 meter telescope resolves 0.1 arcsec. Hubble has an aperture (diameter) of 2.4 m, so its resolving power is 0.04 arcsec. The minimum distance between Earth and Mars is about 55 million km and it only happens very rarely. The maximum distance is 400 mil km. The ""average"" distance is 225 mil km (but actual distance varies all the time). Let's apply the tangent of 0.04 arcsec at 55 mil km: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=tan(0.04+arcseconds)+*+55000000 It's 10 km. It would only be able to see the major geographic features. To see buildings (down to the scale of 10 m), it would need a 1000x increase in resolution. That means an aperture of 2.4 km. None of the classic telescope designs can provide that. It would have to be some kind of interferometric design - a large, flat field where several mirrors are placed several km apart and are coupled optically to function as a single huge mirror (well, sort of - this is more of an intuitive explanation). It would be similar to the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer near Flagstaff, Arizona.  Some of the wide, flat parts of Valles Marineris might provide a good location for the interferometer. Acidalia Planitia would provide even more space for building huge interferometers, and should be a good place to build structures in general - flat to beyond horizon; it's the place where much of the book/movie The Martian set their story. But any big, reasonably flat field would work. All of the above assumes the distance of closest approach between Earth and Mars. In practice, the distance is greater than that, so aperture must increase. You're contemplating an interferometer with a base of dozens of km if you want to distinguish structures such as buildings. Conceivably, the interferometer could be built in orbit, but you must ensure that the distance between mirrors is maintained with extraordinary precision. On the planetary surface, the ground provides the required rigidity. In space you'd have to... I dunno, use space magic."
"What exactly is the ""paradox"" in Olber's Paradox?","Olber's Paradox was created at a time before the idea of a finite universe was accepted.  (It was thought of in the 1600's).  In order to resolve Olber's Paradox, you have to introduce the idea that either the universe had a beginning or it is of finite size.  (Note: the solution does not require an expanding universe).  So, at the time, it was a paradox.  Pretty much all astronomers considered the universe to be static and infinite.  Therefore, the fact that their observations didn't fit with what they expected made it a paradox."
"Metallicity of Celestial Objects: Why ""Metal = Non-metal""?","To first order, the relative abundances of the heavier elements to iron (for instance) are constant. So the metal content of a star is shorthand for the content of any element heavier than He. We now know this is not true in many circumstances and elements can be grouped by synthesis process - for example we can talk about ""alpha elements"" - O, Mg, Si etc. produced by alpha particle capture; or s-process elements - Ba, Sr etc. produced by the s-process. We know that the ratio of say O/Fe gets larger in more ""metal-poor"" stars, but Ba/Fe gets smaller. So talking about a single ""metallicity"" parameter only gets you so far, and the truth is more complex (and interesting). The next point is why they are referred to as ""metals"" rather than another term like ""heavies"" or something. I would guess this is down to a bit of history and the fact that initial abundance analyses in stars were (and still are on the whole) done in the visible part of the spectrum (e.g. in the early part of the 19th century by Hyde Wollaston and Fraunhofer). The most abundant elements heavier than He are in fact not metals; they are Oxygen, Carbon, Nitrogen and Neon. However, the signatures of these elements are not at all obvious in the visible spectra of (most) stars. Whereas the signatures (absorption lines) of elements like Fe, Na, Mg, Ni etc., which decidedly are metals, are often very prominent. Thus, there is a reason and some history behind the name ""metals"". It is that apart from hydrogen and helium, the metallic elements have the most prominent features in the optical spectra of stars, whereas in most stars the signatures of the more abundant non-metals are hard to see."
"How much larger will the ""observable by us"" universe be when JWST becomes operational?","tl;dr Conservatively 10%, realistically 25%, optimistically 60%. I assume that by the ""observable-by-us Universe"", you mean not the theoretically observable Universe, which is given by the distance light has had the time to travel since the Big Bang, but the part of the Universe where we may practically see galaxies and other objects, not including the cosmic microwave background. The currently most distant, spectroscopically confirmed object is the galaxy GN-z11 (Oesch et al. 2016), which has a redshift of $z=11.1$ and hence a distance of just over $d=32$ billion lightyears (Glyr). The volume inside the sphere with us in the center and GN-z11 on the surface is $V = 4\pi d^3/3 \simeq 140\,000\,\mathrm{Glyr}^3$. Predicting the redshift record for James Webb is not easy, since it depends on the unknown physical conditions of even younger galaxies. The important quantity is their (surface) brightness which depends not only on intrinsic properties such as their star formation rate, dustiness, and compactness, but also on the properties of the intergalactic medium, in particular to which degree it is (re-)ionized and hence able to transmit the light from the galaxies. Moreover, we also don't know how many there, so estimates rely on extrapolating their distributions of luminosities (luminosity functions) from lower redshifts. Rather conservative predictions for Webb's redshift record are around $z\simeq13\text{–}16$
(Mashian et al. 2016;
Williams et al. 2018;
Mahler et al. 2019;
Behroozi et al. 2020), corresponding to an age of the Universe of 250–300 million years after the Big Bang (whereas GN-z11 is seen ~400 Myr after the BB), and a distance of 33–34.5 Glyr. These estimates hence correspond to volumes of $\simeq 150\,000\text{–}170\,000\,\mathrm{Glyr}^3$, i.e. an increase of up to roughly 10–25%. However, sometimes we're lucky and line up with a massive cluster of galaxies acting as a gravitational lens which magnifies the light from distant background sources by factors of tens, hundreds, or even thousands. This may potentially allow James Webb to see some of the very first galaxies, predicted to have formed at $z\sim20\text{–}30$, 100–200 Myr after BB. I don't know of any peer-reviewed papers doing any serious estimates, but NASA routinely cites Webb's predicted record as ""200 (or 250) Myr, possibly even 100 Myr"" af the BB (e.g. here). If we really discover a galaxy 100 Myr after the BB, that would correspond to $z=30$, and a distance of 38 Glyr, i.e. a volume of $225\,000\,\mathrm{Glyr}^3$ which is 60% larger than our current ""observable-by-us Universe"". The extension of our probed volume may not seem like a lot. A better way to understand the significance of this is to think about the age of the Universe at that time: It is likely that we will make the unknown epoch of the Universe half, or maybe even a quarter, of today's value. For comparison, the volume inside the region from which the cosmic microwave background was emitted at $z=1100$ is $390\,000\,\mathrm{Glyr}^3$, while the volume of the (theoretically) observable Universe is $413\,000\,\mathrm{Glyr}^3$. The figure below is pretty much to scale: "
Did the Sun's light always peak in the green wavelengths?,"Nice question! Sun's spectral peak wavelength is currently 483 nm which falls under the category of green. Sun's wavelength changing In it's early days, the Sun was a lot cooler than it is today. So when it was a zero age main sequence or ZAM, it would be more 25 to 30 per cent cooler than it is today, which amounts to 89% of the solar temperature which I solved via the Luminosity-Radius-Temperature Relation. The reason this happens is because as proton-proton chain fusion occurs, due to nucleosynthesis, helium is produced which has more density, so it sinks down to the core (it is possible since the sun is a plasma, since the density is higher), then that helium cannot fuse at such temperature so it shrinks, this gravitational contraction in turn focuses the core more and more until the temperature has increased to sustain thermonuclear fusion and be in hydrostatic equilibrium i.e internal pressure which is fusion = external pressure which is gravity. So we understand that  the Sun was cooler in the past Than it is today Let's consider the Sun as a non-ideal blackbody, if we heat it, the frequency will increase due to Wien's law ($λpeak = b/T$) or Planck's law (for objects with extreme temperature like black holes accretion disk). Since the frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, if the heat would be more, the frequency would be higher. So, it technically means that the Sun had a much longer wavelength in the past, so it would be a slightly redshifted, perhaps slightly more greener or it would be more like chartreuse. Specifically based on the temperature I obtained, using Wien's law, it would be 562 nm The reason plants do not absorb the green wavelength Plants reflect (Little is absorbed too) green light because absorbing  green light would lead to saturation because that's the peak wavelength thus absorbing too much of it would be harmful. While the Sun was slightly redder in the past, I don't believe that this minor shift in wavelength (of just over 79 nm) is the primary reason why chloroplasts absorb red light and reflect green as it still falls under the category of green.. Thank you, Hope it helps you! "
How long between the moment a meteor is first visible and the moment a meteorite hits the ground?,"I'm a researcher at Curtin University working on the Desert Fireball Network. The DFN is the largest fireball observation network in the world, and our primary goal is to recover meteorites with orbital information attached. The traditional rule of thumb for meteorite-dropping events is a final luminous height below 35 km and a final luminous velocity below 10 km s-1 So when I refer to the luminous part of the trajectory, I am referring to the portion in which ablation is occurring and optical light is emitted. As you said, this portion typically lasts a few seconds depending on the initial size, strength, speed, and slope of the meteoroid. After this, if the object still has mass left, the speed continuously decreases. We call this portion of the trajectory the ""dark-flight"" (as opposed to the ""bright-flight"" which is the luminous part) because we can longer observe the meteoroid. During the dark flight, the rock goes from <10 km s-1 to tens to a few hundred m s-1 when it finally impacts the ground as a meteorite. This part of the trajectory can be greatly affected by wind as seen below from the dark flight modeling done for the recovered Dingle Dell meteorite:
 So, in total, from first becoming a meteor to impacting the surface, you should expect about tens of seconds to minutes to pass. Of course, this is dependent on things I have mentioned like mass, speed, and slope notably."
Why are there so few supernovae in M31 (Andromeda)?,"The low supernova rate in M31 can be directly attributed to the fact that the galaxy's star formation rate is much lower than the Milky Way's. Andromeda is currently in a relatively quiet phase in terms of star formation, currently experiencing rates of $\sim0.40M_{\odot}\;\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. The Milky Way, on the other hand, has a star formation rate several times higher; as such, it contains more massive, short-lived stars which are supernova progenitors. This leads to a correspondingly higher supernova rate than Andromeda. Estimates of the supernova rate in M31 vary, but a value of 0.5 to 1.0 per century is reasonable. This in turn matches well with observations."
Why does the sensitivity to GWs drops off inversely proportional to the distance?,"EDIT I'm leaving the original, highly upvoted answer below, but I've had a fundamental rethink about this, prompted by questions from Keith McClary and a helpful clarification from a Physics SE question. The original answer I gave is the reason that we can detect gravitational waves (GWs) at all. Their coherent nature as single oscillators, means that despite their comparatively low powers, they can be detected right across the universe. In comparison, electromagnetic sources are usually the superposed light from countless incoherent emission sources. On average this has a destructive interference effect that reduces the power (intensity) received; and due to the rapidly changing signal, it is usually intensity that is measured. However, the answer to the present question is actually just how ""sensitivity"" is defined. In order to detect a source, we must identify it in a background of noise. This is done by defining a signal-to-noise ratio. The signal is the product of your source strength (more on that in a minute) and how long you observed it for. The noise is a property of your instrument. The sensitivity of the instrument then is something like the minimum (signal $\times$ observation time) that will produce a significant detection. In astronomy it is conventional to express the signal in terms of power received since, due to the arguments given above and in the original answer, power (intensity) is generally what is measured. The sources of noise are therefore also defined in terms of a power and the sensivity has units of something like Watts $\times$ seconds, or more conventionally, W/Hz. In gravitational wave astronomy, because it is the amplitude that is directly detected, GW astronomers express their source signal in terms of amplitude (which is proportional to the square root of detected power) and their sensitivities are expressed in terms of gravitational wave amplitude (which is dimensionless) divided by $\sqrt{Hz}$ as a result.  i.e. we are not comparing like with like. Doubling the sensitivity of a gravitational wave detector is actually like quadrupling the sensivitity of an electromagnetic wave detector. Thus there is no fundamental difference here, the apparent difference in behaviour is merely a result of how sensitivity is defined. The reason for the different definition is as per my original answer below.  Original answer The difference is that usually when we detect sources of electromagnetic waves, we are detecting intensity, which obeys the inverse square law. In contrast, we are detecting the amplitude of gravitational waves, and amplitude only scales as the inverse of distance  Why the difference? Sources of gravitational waves are coherent oscillators. A  merging binary produces a single coherent wave train with an amplitude that can be defined and measured. By contrast, when we look at a distant star or galaxy in electromagnetic waves we are seeing the incoherent contribution from countless accelerating particles and atoms and all we can detect is the resultant summed intensity. There is no coherent electromagnetic wave with an amplitude that can be measured. This difference in behaviour is fundamentally because whilst there are positive and negative electric charges, which require contrived circumstances in which to behave coherently (e.g. in a laser), gravitational waves are produced by accelerating masses, and since there is only one sign of ""gravitational charge"", the individual parts of a gravitational wave source are able to act in concert quite naturally to produce a coherent waveform that has a wavelength larger than the body itself. An excellent discussion of these points can be found on the first page of the review article by Hendry & Woan (2007). In principle, if we were looking at a single coherent source of electromagnetic waves then we can detect the amplitude (for example by the force it exerts on charged particles), and then the sensitivity would just reduce as the inverse of distance. At optical frequencies the electric field varies so rapidly that this cannot be done, but it is possible at radio frequencies. Unfortunately the coherence length and coherence time (the time over which the phase of the wave is predictable) are so short that this is rarely practical in laboratory, let alone astronomical, sources."
Is there a upper limit to the number of planets orbiting a star?,"There do exist somewhat trivial configurations, which are stable in the long term and which include arbitrarily many bodies. Consider, for example, a set of $N$ circularly moving bodies of the same mass $m$, which obeys the constraint $mN\ll M$, where $M$ is the mass of the star. So long as $mN\ll M$, the bodies move dominantly in the gravitational field of the star and are hence moving stably over long term period. However, as $N$ is arbitrary, one concludes that there is no upper limit on the number of planets, provided that their total mass is small. A more physical example would be a protoplanetary disc, or an accretion disc, which is a limit $N\rightarrow \infty$ of an arbitrary planetary system (not not necessarily circular) of a given mass. A yet more physical example is an asteroid belt, consisting of a large number of bodies on, roughly, stable orbits. Finally, during planet formation process the star goes through stages, when it is surrounded by sets of pebbles and asteroids, which keep their structure constant over a large number of orbits (roughly, of order $10^5$). And these all are real physical examples of planetary-like systems. The answer to your question would start to alter, though, if you start imposing additional conditions apart from $N\rightarrow \infty$. For example, if you require that bodies do not collide in the long term, some of the above named systems would not work (for example, accretion disc model), but some other would (sets of concentric particles). If you additionally require that the object should obey the definition of a planet, that is have some range of masses, then interesting things will start happening when the total mass of the planets will start being comparable to the mass of the star. So the limit would certainly exist. Finally, you might be more strict about what do you really mean by stability here, and that could also have a bearing on the answer. To summarize, unless you impose any constraints, there do exist N-body systems orbiting a star in a stable fashion and having arbitrarily large $N$."
Milky Way Galaxy from Earth,"The Milky Way Galaxy is a large spiral galaxy with some characteristic features worth mentioning:  1) The bulge - This refers to the collection of tightly packed stars located in the central region of the galaxy. 2) The spiral arms or the disk - This region extends from the inner region of the galaxy (where it meets the bulge) to outskirts of the galaxy, and contains stars, dust, and lots of gas. It's also very thin. The reason why a disk forms is largely thought to be due to slight asymmetries in the accretion of material early on in the galaxy's history. Over time, and due to conservation of angular momentum, the material collapses down into a disk. Incidentally, this is where the sun lives.   That ribbon is the disk of the Milky Way. It looks cloudy because of the dust and gas which scatters light from the rest of the galaxy. The reason why gas accumulates here is because as things begin to collapse into a disk, the gas collides with itself, and sort of 'sticks' together. In other words, where a bunch of stars may very happily pass through a bunch of other stars without many of them colliding or being disturbed, gas has a much harder time doing this. If you want to learn more about what happens when galaxies and clusters collide, take a look at the Bullet Cluster.    The majority of the other stars you you see which are not part of that structure are much more local. The reason why the rest of the sky looks rather transparent in comparison is because you are looking out of the plane of the galaxy. There is simply much less stuff (namely gas and dust which obscures your sight in optical wavelengths) that you are looking through. Because of this, most optical telescopes look in these directions when studying the rest of the universe.  For more about the classification and structures of galaxies, see the Hubble sequence. "
Can you see man-made lights on the dark side of the Earth from the surface of the moon with the naked eye?,"It's highly doubtful you could see any normal light source on the surface of the earth.
Using $$\text{brightness} = \frac{\text{luminosity}}{4 \pi \times \text{distance}^2}$$
(with brightness in watts, and luminosity in watts per square meter.
and distance to moon of $3.84 \times 10^8$ meters.) Try a hypothetical light source 100 megawatts output, all visible light, no heat. $$\text{brightness} = \frac{100  \times 10^6}{4 \pi \times 1.474 \times 10^{17}}$$ $$\text{brightness} = 5.4 \times 10^{-11} \text{ watts per square meter}$$ at the lunar surface. That's pretty dim. By, contrast sunlight at earth's surface runs about 1300 watts per square meter.
In reality it'd take about a gigawatt to produce 100 megawatts of light in the visible range.
That's about what it takes to power a city of a million homes.
Cities also bounce most of the light they do produce off the ground, which'll have an albedo of somewhere around 0.3. So with ordinary city lights it'll take over 3 gigawatts to reach $5.4 \times 10^{-11}$ watts per square meter on the lunar surface. You might fare better with a big laser. The Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation picks up multi-photon signals from the Apollo retroreflectors using only a 1 gigawatt laser and a 3.5 meter telescope. As the article states, the laser beam only expands to 9.3 miles in diameter on the way to the moon, so you might see it wink at you. At 10 parsecs, the sun has a magnitude of 4.83. It'd be visible on an average night. That magnitude corresponds to a brightness of 3X10e-10 watts per square meter, about 5.6 fold brighter than our hypothetical earth based light source. That puts our light at magnitude 6.5 to 7. Naked eye visibility runs to about 6.0"
Why is the Sun's atmosphere (the corona) so hot?,"It is still an open question, even though it is clear that it is linked to the magnetic field of the Sun. The following hypothesis are the following: Heating waves mechanism: propagation of magnetohydrodynamic waves can heat significantly the corona. These waves can be produced in the solar photosphere and propagate carrying energy through the solar atmosphere; they turn in the end into shock waves that dissipate energy as heat in the corona. Magnetic reconnection mechanism: magnetic field lines are tied to the surface of the Sun and even when the plasma moves, they stay tied to their original position (their ""foot points""); therefore, plasma movements can drag the magnetic field lines and entangled them in geometries such as loops, that can eventually ""reconnect"". ""Reconnection"" corresponds to a modification of the field line topology (see the image that pictures it better than my words). During this process, heat and energy are released quite efficiently. Nanoflares mechanism: the dissipation of a lot of small scale structures (slow convective motions of magnetic foot points could create current sheets, coutinually dissipated and reformed, providing heating through Ohmic dissipation). You can see it as a kind of a lot of magnetic loops reconnecting together, instead of one big loop reconnecting alone.  Black lines represent the magnetic field lines. They are tied to the surface of the Sun (the foot points). One of the magnetic field lines is looping, and it is ""crossing itself"". When it reconnects, it forms, on the top, a magnetic loop and, on the bottom, an magnetic arch. As pointed out by this diagram, magnetic reconnection mechanism is also associated to Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), since the energy released by magnetic reconnection is powerful enough to eject a significant amount of matter.

Why did the Comet Shoemaker-Levy-9 fragments cause such large explosions on Jupiter?,"Shoemaker Levy 9 was estimated to have released kinetic energy equivalent to 300 gigatons of TNT. That is $1.255 \times 10^{21} {\rm J}$. This release through friction and compression was sufficient to heat the atmosphere to 4000K at first. That in turn should probably be enough to break down the molecular hydrogen and methane, releasing further energy. But that's only my guess. The heating from the impact alone should make a huge fireball. Sources: Fragment Size and Mass Estimates Galileo observations"
"How distances are measured in the Solar System, in the Galaxy, and in the Universe?","Stellar parallax uses differences in perspective to determine the distance from an object. When the earth goes around the sun, our perspective of the star, galaxy etc. changes and so the angle from us to the object changes. Because we know how the earth moves around the sun, we know the distance between the points that we take the measurements. From this we can use the Sine Rule to determine the distance from the object. For Example, if the distance between the two points of measurement were 2 units, and the two inside angles (A and B) were (A)80° and (B)75° (and therefore the other angle (C) is 25°) we can say that: $a = \frac{2\sin80}{\sin25}\ $ where ""a"" is the opposite side to angle ""A"". This means that the distance between the object and the second (B) point of measurement is approximately 4.66 units.
Diagram here. By using the known absolute and the measured apparent magnitude (what is seen by instruments etc.) it is possible to determine the distance of the object by using the formula: m-M = 5 log d – 5
where m is the apparent magnitude of the object, M is the absolute magnitude of the object, and d is the distance to the object in parsecs.(same source) One of the most widely used examples of these standard candles is the supernovae type Ia, which was used to discover that the universe is accelerating in its expansion. This led to the awarding of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics to Saul Perlmutter, Brian Schmidt , and Adam Riess. Additionally, RR Lyrae are another form of standard candle used to measure galactic distances (SN Ia are much more luminous and therefore can be used to much higher distances). RR Lyrae are a type of variable star with a relationship between pulsation period and absolute magnitude, which is what makes them good for use as standard candles. Other information here. Redshift is the effect where light from an object is ""stretched"" out so that the wavelength is moved towards the ""red"" end of the spectrum. Distances are calculated by using Hubble's Law, but I'll let others explain it: here, here and here."
How are the compositional components of exoplanet atmospheres differentiated?,"In theory one should just be able to determine the difference between the spectra during the star's eclipse of the exoplanet (starlight alone) and the spectra of the star and exoplanet together, but in reality equipment is not precise enough for this. To remedy this problem, the analysis is integrated over many eclipses. Some other calibrations are made as well which you can read more about in the paper A Spitzer Spectrum of the Exoplanet HD 189733b. This is called occultation spectroscopy. There's another method used as well called transmission spectroscopy, which detects the change in light as the exoplanet passes in front of its star. You can read more about that in this paper: Infrared transmission spectroscopy of the exoplanets HD 209458b and XO-1b using the wide field Camera-3 on the Hubble Space Telescope."
Would a black hole evaporate via Hawking radiation before you fall past the event horizon?,"I've asked this question to a couple of physicists a few days ago. Great minds think alike, huh? First, bear in mind that Hawking radiation is only hypothetical. It is not theory. If we trust that hypothesis, this is what we can get. In general relativity, black holes can be described through a number of approximations. For example, the Schwarzschild solution for a black hole describes it as an eternal object — not something that exists for some times, and doesn't exist for others. According to this solution, the event horizon must have always existed, and must remain existing eternally. Schwarzschild black holes approximate black holes very accurately, but as you can tell, they fail to explain how a black hole can form, and (assuming Hawking radiation is real) they don't explain how one could eventually evaporate. Of course, that solution won't help us. I've kept looking for one that accurately describes an evaporating, creatable black hole, but I've found nothing. The conclusion I've come to, along with those I've asked, is that our question has a major problem: Hawking radiation is explained via quantum field theory. Thus, you can't simply use a GR solution for a black hole; you'd need some unholy mixture of quantum field theory and general relativity (keep in mind that both GR and QFT are incompatible in many situations). In the end, it all comes down to how little we really know about black holes. It's not really possible to determine which solution is the best, and our inability to reconcile QFT with GR poses a big problem. The best answer I could give is ""nobody really knows what would happen if you kept approaching a black hole"". We don't know if we would reach the event horizon, we don't know if the black hole will evaporate. We simply don't understand them well enough to know what solution would work, or how we would put QFT into it. If we somehow managed to find an approximation that properly combines GR and QFT, I assume (but don't quote me on this) the situation you described would be possible. If it is possible, by the way, then we could confidently say that a black hole of any size could rip you apart through tidal forces. Tidal forces become weaker as the black hole's size increases, so one would assume a large enough black hole wouldn't rip you apart. However, if we take Hawking radiation into account, and if your proposed scenario were indeed correct, the black hole would shrink as it evaporates. Since it would get smaller at a faster rate as we approach the event horizon, it would soon be small enough to rip us apart."
Is Io a magic energy machine?,"The energy driving Io's volcanism is derived from its orbital energy and (to a lesser extent by the orbital energy of the other moons and the energy of Jupiter's rotation).  Similar mechanisms power the cryo-volcanism on Enceladus and the other icy moons.  The available orbital energy reservoir is huge compared to that required to drive the volcanic activity. This does imply that the gravitational interactions on all the moons in the system are changing their orbits and rotations, albeit slowly.  Given unlimited time, the orbit of Io might decay to a point where it falls within Jupiter's Roche limit and is torn apart. (Note: the answer to How can tidal heating lower Io's orbit describes this more precisely, and points out that tidal forces are transferring energy from Jupiter's rotation to the orbits of its moons, so Io's orbit in the long term gets larger (to the point of it leaving Jupiter orbit) rather than decaying.)"
"If we replaced the Moon with Ceres, how close would Ceres have to orbit to cause the same tides?","Tidal forces generated are proportional to $m/r^3$, where $m$ is the mass of the Earth satellite and $r$ is the semi-major axis (we assume circular orbits for simplicity).  The derivation of this relationship is performed nicely by Butikov. So $m_m/r_m^3 = m_c/r_c^3$, where $m_m \approx 7.3 \times 10^{22} \rm\, kg$ is the mass of the Moon, $m_c \approx 9.1 \times 10^{20} \rm\, kg$ is the mass of Ceres, and $r_m \approx 385,000 \rm\, km$ is the semi-major axis of the Moon's orbit around the Earth Solve for the Ceres orbit distance $r_c$ to get about $89,000\rm\, km$ to exert the same tidal effects as the Moon. Note: Tidal forces are due to a difference or gradient of gravitational forces across a body instead of simply the magnitude of the gravitational force on the body.  That is why the lunar tides on Earth are more powerful than the solar tides, even though the Sun exerts 177 times more gravitational pull on the Earth than the Moon exerts on the Earth. NOAA has an excellent description of this with the following illuminating graphic:

Is the closest planet to another planet always the innermost planet?,"For a planet with another planet at their Lagrange L4 or L5 point, those would be each others' closest neighbours; as you can see from the simulations, Mercury has an average distance a few % more than the average distance between the Sun and the planet (e.g. 1.04 AU for Earth), and the Lagrange points form equilateral triangles with the largest planet and the Sun, so for Earth that would be at a (constant) distance of 1 AU. Of course, whether the smallest of the two would count as a planet is debatable. They could be quite large, e.g. Jupiter (317.8 Earth masses) could have a Trojan weighing 317.8 / 24.96 = 12.7 Earth masses."
What's the difference between an exoplanetary transit and eclipse? [duplicate],"A star usually is larger than its planet, and that's what they refer to in this instance. Further in the text they explain that they mean the star eclipsing the planet: An eclipse occurs when an exoplanet passes behind its star as seen from Earth, and a transit occurs when a planet passes in front of its star. (emphasis mine) And this of course means that the star blocks any light coming from the planet, not vice versa. The information gained from this measurement where the star eclipses the planet is that it allows us to compare the spectrum of the star compared to the combined spectrum of star and planet, allowing possibly some deduction on the atmospheric or chemical composition of the latter (similar to the transit). HOWEVER: If you consider a hot jupiter (thus a gasous planet very close-in) it is thinkable that it might occur that a planet is bigger in diameter than its host star. This planet would have to orbit its host star, a low-mass red dwarf, very close in. Then radii might be of similar size to an extend that the planet might even be larger (yet still not more massive) than the star itself. A hot jupiter can reach about twice the size of Jupiter - and low mass stars at the lower limit of about 0.08 solar masses have sizes comparable to Jupiter ($0.1r_{Sun} \approx 70.000\mathrm{km} \approx r_{Jup}$). If you consider neutron stars (pulsars), the first dectections of exoplanets were even around one of those (though technically... are they still planets, if the central object does not show fusion anymore?)."
Why can't moon light (reflected sun light) turn the sky blue?,"The simple answer is that it does, but it's not bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Earth's atmosphere scatters the moon light just like sunlight.   The full moon (like the sun) fills about 1/2 of 1 degree of the sky, the entire sky being 180 degrees, give or take, so the full moon fills less than 1 part in 100,000 of the night sky, so there simply isn't enough blue light to be visible over the brighter stars even with the brightest full moon. Our eyes are very good at seeing variations in brightness, but not that good. . . . and, for what it's worth, the night sky has always appeared to have a dark bluish tint to me, but that might just be my brain playing tricks on me because logically I know it's there. I'm not sure whether it's actually visible. With a good sized telescope, moonlight scattering acts as a form of light pollution. Telescope users know that you get better visuals when there's no moon. Source."
Are there non-rotating objects in the universe?,"As with any claim of possibility, it really comes down to whether we are able to measure it or not. Since we're not talking about quantum mechanics, this is not too difficult to speculate. All celestial bodies I can think of rotate. The sun, the planets, the moon, the galaxies, clusters of galaxies, the supermassive black hole at the center if the Milky Way, accretion discs, etc. It would be very strange if they didn't. They couldn't even exist. Indeed! There are lots of reasons to expect any astronomical object in the Universe to be rotating, e.g., because of the angular momentum it will inherit after formation. Are there examples of non-rotating bodies? IT is possible that an object is rotating so slowly that is is not possible for us to measure the rotation rate with empirical certainty, and so we may presume that the object is not rotating, and we'd be fine with assuming it is not rotating in our theoretical models of such an object (within that regime). I do not know of such an example, but one can exist in principle. Here is a list of observed slowly rotating objects, i.e. asteroids and exoplanets. The asteroid with the currently known smallest rotation rate has a period of ~1800 hours, which is about 75 Earth days. As the first figure in that wiki article shows, there is no obvious correlation between diameter and period for exoplanets. With disk galaxies, it is known that they all, regardless of difference in size, have the approximately same rotation rate. Long period radio pulsars are rotating slowly compared to other pulsars, with periods of over 5 seconds, and they are very difficult for astronomers to observe. For example, PSR J0250+5854 has the slowest spin period when compared to any known magnetars and X-ray dim isolated neutron stars. I can find no fundamental reason why such an object can't exist. Maybe a planet or two stars that have had a tangential encounter. A simple answer (perhaps) is conservation of angular momentum: the progenitor's angular momentum before the object forms is not destroyed."
What is a singularity? What is at the center of a black hole? Specifically regarding space-time,"This is more of a question for the Physics stack, but I'll give it a shot, since it's fairly basic. You need to understand something before we begin. The theoretical framework we have to gauge and answer this sort of thing is called General Relativity, which was proposed by Einstein in 1915. It describes things such as gravity, black holes, or just about any phenomena where large densities of mass or energy are involved. There's another chapter in Physics called Quantum Mechanics. This describes, usually, what happens at very small scales - things that are super-tiny. Both GR and QM are fine in their own way. Both are tested against reality and work very well. But they are not compatible with each other. Meaning: you cannot describe a phenomenon from a GR and a QM perspective, both at once. Or meaning: we don't have a coherent set of equations that we could write down, and then ""extract"" out of them either a GR-like view of reality, or a QM-like view. The problem is, the center of a black hole is both very high mass density and very high gravity (and therefore right in the field of GR), and very small (and therefore ""quantum-like""). To properly deal with it, we'd have to reconcile GR and QM and work with both at once. This is not possible with current physics. We pretty much have to stick to GR only for now, when talking about black holes. This basically means that anything we say about the center of a black hole is probably incomplete, and subject to further revision. A star dies, collapses into a black hole, what is at the center? The
  star's mass compacted into the size of the plank length or something
  similarly small? Is there really nothing at the center of a black
  hole?, surely the core collapsed into something, just really small
  right? According to General Relativity, it collapses all the way down to nothing. Not just ""very small"", but smaller and smaller until it's exactly zero in size. Density becomes infinite. You can't say ""Plank length"" because, remember, we can't combine GR and QM, we just don't know how. All we have here is GR, and GR says it goes all the way down. It is quite possible that the singularity is not physical, but just mathematical - in other words, whatever is at the center is not actually zero size. Quantum mechanics in particular would be offended by zero-size things. But we can't say for sure because our knowledge here is incomplete. I'm using words such as ""size"" (which implies space) and ""becomes"" (which implies time). But both space and time in the context of a black hole are very seriously warped. The ""becoming"" of a black hole all the way down to the zero-size dot is a reality only for the unlucky observer that gets caught in it. But for a distant, external observer, this process is slowed and extended all the way to plus infinity (it's only complete after an infinitely long time). Both observers are correct, BTW. EDIT: So, when we are saying ""density is infinite and size is zero at the singularity"", this language applies to the unfortunate observer being dragged down in the middle of the initial collapse of the star. But from the perspective of the distant observer, a black hole is still a chunk of mass (the original star) in a non-zero volume (the event horizon of the BH). To this observer, the density of that object is finite, and its size is definitely not zero. From this perspective, anything falling into the BH never quite finishes falling, but just slows down more and more. Both observers are correct. So, keep in mind, when I talk about ""infinite density"", that's the inside observer point of view. What is a singularity? Is it just the warping of space time that makes
  it this way? You get a singularity whenever there's a division by zero in the equations, or when the equations misbehave somehow at that point. There are many different kinds of singularities in science. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_singularity In the context of a black hole, the center is said to be a gravitational singularity, because density and gravity are suggested to become infinite, according to the GR equations. GR says: when you have a lump of matter that's big enough, it starts to collapse into itself so hard, there's nothing to stop it. It keeps falling and falling into itself, with no limit whatsoever. Extrapolate this process, and it's easy to see that the size of it tends to zero, and density tends to an infinite value. EDIT: Put another way - if density becomes large enough, gravity is so huge, no other force is strong enough to resist it. It just crushes all barriers that matter raises to oppose further crushing. That lump of matter simply crushes itself, its own gravity pulls it together smaller and smaller... and smaller... and so on. According to current theories, there's nothing to stop it (QM might stop it, but we cannot prove it, because we don't have the math). So it just spirals down in a vicious cycle of ever-increasing gravity that increases itself. Space and time are really pathologic inside the event horizon. If you are already inside, there's no way out. This is not because you can't move out fast enough, but because there's really no way out. No matter which way you turn, you're looking towards the central singularity - in both space and time. There is no conceivable trajectory that you could draw, starting from the inside of the event horizon, that leads outside. All trajectories point at the singularity. All your possible futures, if you're inside the event horizon, end at the central singularity. So, why the center of a black hole is called a ""singularity""? Because all sorts of discontinuities and divisions by zero jump out of the equations, when you push math to the limit, trying to describe the very center of a black hole, within a GR frame. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity Speaking in general, physicists don't like singularities. In most cases, this is an indication that the mathematical apparatus has broken down, and some other calculations are necessary at that point. Or it might indicate that new physics are taking place there, superseding the old physics. One last thing: just because we don't have a combined GR/QM theory to fully describe the center of black holes, that doesn't mean a pure GR research in this area is ""wrong"" or ""useless"". It doesn't mean one could imagine some arbitrary fantasy taking place inside a black hole. Astronomers these days are starting to observe cosmic objects that are very much like black holes, and their observed properties are in very close accord with what GR predicts for such things. So research in this field must continue, because it's clearly on the right track, at least in the ways we can verify today in astronomy."
How can I measure the angle between two stars?,"A tool such as Jacob's staff or a cross-staff can be used. This is essentially two pieces of wood in a cross shape, one of which can slide on the other. 
By Original: Fantagu Vector: Majo statt Senf - Own work based on: Jakobsstab3.jpg, CC BY-SA 4.0 By aligning the arms of the cross to the two stars you can find the angle between them. A practical variation of this is the Sky Ruler (from BBC Sky at Night magazine).  This is marked in degrees, so you don't need to do any trigonometry, and is made of card so you don't need carpentry skills."
"Help understanding this unsettling image of Titan, Epimetheus, and Saturn's rings?","This NASA page says this photo was taken on April 28 2006. Using Celestia, I managed to find the picture from Cassini that best lines up with the photo. It doesn't match up precisely, but that's to be expected as the calculated orbital elements of all these moons (and cassini) in the software won't necessarily match up to reality precisely.
 Below is the zoomed out version of this shot. You can see Titan in the centre and Epimetheus as a dot on top.

And here is the top down shot from Cassini to the moons. Circled are Epimetheus and Titan.
 So to answer your question: Titan is really big compared to epimetheus (about 50x), Titan has an atmosphere and so appears fuzzy (It is actually in focus, everything in space is very far away and so is effectively at infinity for focusing purposes), and the rings are highly oblique, so you only see a small slice of them."
When did people first measure that the Earth was closest to the Sun during January?,"Kepler got the conic sections right, and Newton gave us the mechanics.  But the question is about when people knew that the Earth was closer to Sol in one part of the year than others, and Hipparchus knew that, even though he wasn't too hot on the values of the orbital radii.  Hipparchus' version of the eccentric model had Sol's (purported) circular orbit around the Earth not centred upon the Earth, but 1/24th of an AU away.  Therefore Sol (purportedly) orbited at varying distances from Earth.  This was, after all, the whole point of the eccentric model, to explain non-uniform apparent motion through variation in distance. Perigee and apogee were known in the times of Hipparchus and Ptolemy.  Hipparchus even worked out when the furthest point (apogee) was.  Ptolemy furthermore made an error based upon knowing that his placement of the apogee in Gemini was the same as that of Hipparchus 280 years beforehand, declaring that perigee and apogee were fixed. They of course were not.  Hipparchus placed apogee at 5.30° Gemini.  Astronomers in the 9th century in Baghdad applied the same calculations to their measurements and placed it at 20.45° Gemini.   As for how this was observed, it was not done by measuring the Sun's appearance at all (although Hipparchus did do that).  Ptolemy and Hipparchus had a geometric model of a true geocentric circular orbit versus the (purported)  eccentric circular orbit of Sol.  It incorporated the equinoxes and the solstices.  By observing the times of the equinoxes and solstices, the lengths of the periods between them, they were able to determine trigonometrically all of the other orbital parameters, which included placement of perigee and apogee. That points of closest and furthest approach existed was known in the 2nd century BC, as was their angular locations relative to the solstices; they've been in the models from then onwards.  That they moved around took about 11 centuries after that to discover.  The correct conic sections and the idea of both bodies orbiting around a barycentre came somewhat later, but that wasn't the question."
Why is the Hubble Telescope in space?,"As @astromax observed, one of the primary factors that makes a space based telescope better than an equivalent telescope of the same size is scattering. Along with scattering, there is also refraction which can be especially problematic when combined with atmospheric turbulence. In the modern era, this problem can be remedied to a certain extent using adaptive optics, but since the Hubble was designed, built, and launched before AO became practical in the 1990's, a space telescope represented the pinnacle of optical clarity for that time. However, there is another important optical property of the atmosphere, absorption. Although the Hubble is primarily a visible light telescope, it does have instruments that cover both the near UV and near IR, both of which are absorbed by the atmosphere more than visible light. Furthermore, there are practical advantages of space based telescopes. There is neither weather, nor light pollution in space."
What would happen to a polished marble statue left in space for a million years?,"There are three main space weathering processes that will affect the surface of the marble. Cosmic rays, high energy particle from the sun and beyond, will hit the surface. This can change the chemistry of the surface.  Solar wind particles, hydrogen and helium, can become implanted in the surface Micrometeoroids will impact the surface, causing small craters, melting, and the inclusion of other elements such as iron. These processes will tend to change the surface, developing a patina on a timescale of a hundred thousand years. The surface will darken (though as marble is not a typical rock in asteroids, there isn't any direct evidence of what happens with marble. Marble is largely CaCO3, and this is in a equilibrium with CaO and CO2. At  standard temperatures and even the very low partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere, this equilibium favours CaCO3. In our atmosphere one needs a temperature of 550⁰C to decompose Calcite. However in space there is no CO2, and so the Calcite would very slowly decompose to CaO. Calcium in meteorites is mostly in the form of CaO."
What observations can be expected on LIGO if any when Betelgeuse goes supernova?,"Potentially, a short (less than a second) burst of gravitational waves (GWs) would be detected. Much depends on asymmetries in the core collapse, since a spherically symmetric collapse would not produce GWs (e.g. Morozova et al. 2019). However, theoretical models suggest that the GWs start at low frequency (tens of Hz) and are associated with the core bounce at the end of core collapse. After about half a second the frequencies rise to about 1kHz and are associated with oscillations of the proto-neutron star at the centre and then contunue to rise, but weaken in amplitude after that. Since LIGO is sensitive from about 20Hz to a few kHz, then only the initial phase that lasts a few tenths of a second would likely be detectable, but since GWs can travel through the star (and at the speed of light) without much hindrance they will indicate the moment of core collapse quite accurately. The theoretical calculations referenced above suggest GW amplitudes of $h_{+}d \sim 10$, where $h_{+}$ is the dimensionless GW strain and $d$ is the distance to the supernova in cm. Betelgeuse is at a distance of $\sim 6 \times 10^{20}$ cm (600 light years), so the strain at the detector would be $h_{+} \sim 2\times 10^{-20}$. LIGO is sensitive to strains of above $10^{-23}$ in this frequency range, so there should be no problem (according to these models) in detecting such an event. If they were produced with detectable strength, then they should be received at the same time as an anticipated neutrino burst. The difference would be that the neutrino burst should extend over about 10 s. That is because the dense centre of a supernova is opaque even to neutrinos (but not gravitational waves) for that period and so they ""leak out"" over that duration. The electromagnetic signature of the supernova (i.e. a visible light increase) would be seen a few hours after that, since that is how long it takes for energy to be transferred to the envelope of the star. NB: For all practical intents and purposes, over the distance to Betelgeuse, neutrinos, along with light and gravitational waves, travel at the same speed. i.e. The delay of the ($\sim  10$ MeV) neutrino burst due to their non-zero ($\
< 1$ eV) mass would be negligible. If the Lorentz factor is $10^7$, then the neutrino speed is the same as the speed of light to 1 part in $2\times 10^{14}$, which means they take an extra 0.1 ms to arrive from Betelgeuse compared to light speed."
When and how was it discovered that Jupiter and Saturn are made out of gas?,"I'm unsure of the ""history of science"" aspect of this, but an actual deduction that these are gas giants would require Kepler's laws and Newton's law of gravity combined with a modest telescope. It can be deduced from Kepler's laws that the giant planets are much further from the Sun than Earth. If one measures the angular diameter of their visible discs ($\theta_p$) and the angular diameter ($\theta_m$) and periods ($P_m$) of the orbits of their moons then the following analysis was possible. The radii of the planets was $R = d\theta_p$. The semi-major axes of the moon orbits $a_m = d \theta_m$. Newton's gravitational law (published 1687) then allows the mass of the planet to be estimated:
$$ M =\frac{4\pi a_m^3}{GP_m^2} = \frac{4\pi d^3\theta_m^{3}}{GP_m^2}\ .$$ The mass and radius are then combined to give density, $3M/4\pi R^3$ and we see that, even without knowing $d$ we can accurately estimate the density of the giant planets by the late 17th century. Newton did something like this in the third book of Principia (see Cohen 1998) and got the relative densities of the Earth/Jupiter/Saturn/Sun with reasonable accuracy. Absolute values do require a knowledge of $G$ which could come from accurate measurement of the scale of the solar system from the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769. So, assuming we find that these massive objects have an average density of $\sim 1000$ kg/m$^3$ (or about a fifth of the density of the Earth, according to Newton) combined with the observations of gaseous motions at the surface and the much higher mean density of the Earth, I think one could arrive at the conclusion that a large fraction of these bodies must be in the form of a gas/fluid. This would not rule out a solid centre and indeed, Saturn does have some sort of solid core and Jupiter may have one. A similar calculation can be done for the Earth and for Venus (the mass of Venus is estimated from its effects on the orbits of the Earth and Mercury). I am unsure when accurate mass measurements were available but certainly by the mid 19th century when the precession of Mercury was being investigated. This would establish that the density of Venus and the Earth were similar and much higher than that of the gas giants."
Why is Neptune a darker blue than Uranus?,"This is an intriguing question, with a solution suggested by the Irwin et al. (2022; arXiv:2201.04516) paper that inspired the YouTube, NewScientist, ScienceAlert, Phys.org, etc. coverage of the past couple days. Still, I would wait a few years to see if others have alternate ideas before calling this case closed. Also, the paper needs to go through peer review. Here is the top half of Figure 1 from the Irwin et al. paper:
 ""Human eye"" curves are compared with Hubble Space Telescope spectra of the two planets. A couple things to note: Neptune is slightly more reflective where human blue optical cones peak, while Uranus is slightly more reflective where the red cones peak. So this is the color difference that the OP was asking and answering about. These Hubble observations of Uranus and Neptune were already published in 2009 and 2011 based on 2002 and 2003 observations. What is new from the Irwin et al. study is a model, or theoretical description, of the haze and cloud layers present in both Uranus and Neptune. The paper actually argues for a simple structure of 3 haze/cloud layers on Uranus (plus one additional layer on Neptune), mostly similar between the two planets. Earlier papers assumed all the layers were either hazes (like photochemical smog) or ices (of methane or hydrogen sulfide), but this new model has hazes mixed into all the layers (except for that extra methane-cirrus layer on Neptune). The ""Aerosol-2"" layer is the one claimed to account for color differences. In this new model, the Aerosol-2 layer is a little bit absorbing, especially at UV and blue wavelengths, which is a pretty standard assumption for haze layers. But it is located deeper in the atmosphere, where previous studies had called for a methane-ice condensation layer. Other scientists may use different haze/cloud models to describe Uranus and Neptune data. So it would be a good idea to wait and see whether the new Irwin et al. model gets challenged by others. Also it would be great to actually send probes to these planets and see whether any of these models are correct. In the new Irwin et al. model, the main factors affecting the visible color of the two planets---the differences between the pink and black lines above---are more gaseous methane on Neptune (making Neptune less reflective than Uranus at red wavelengths), and more haze particles in one of Uranus' layers (making Uranus less reflective than Neptune at blue wavelengths)."
Why can't observatories just stop capturing for a few seconds when Starlink satellites pass though their field of view?,"Tl;dr, From personal experience, it’s not worth it. It’s a lot easier to throw away bad data than to try to calculate when stop. There’s not a lot of ambiguity as to whether it messes up the data. As of right now, it’s not that big a problem either. Sure, some are particularly unlucky, as seen with a Magellanic cloud observation in early 2020. The concern is more the future: 12,000+ satellites (that are unusually bright compared to similar satellites) could cause problems in the future, for not only observational astronomers, but for the amateur observer’s night sky; just like telephone lines would ruin natural views, the fear is that too many satellites would do the same to our night skies. There are other concerns as well, but what it boils down to is a lack of a way to deal with it. Right now, the occasional satellite coming into view messes up a frame or two of data, you consider it an unlucky break, and you move on with one less data point. There may be some state of the art observatories that consider whether a satellite will cross their observational area at night, but I have never worked at one that does. And that’s because it just isn’t worth it for how frequent a problem it is. Space is big; sometimes the area you’re looking at is really small, and between those two you’re normally OK for the most part. To my knowledge, no (commonly used at least) archive possesses a collection of all satellites from all the different entities (government, businesses) and where they’ll be. Sure this information is accessible, but there’s quite a few entities on the Earth that have satellites in the sky; to have all of their info in the same place is a major undertaking. Now there may be some versions of this for those looking to put new satellites in space, regarding orbits etc, but there is not a tool that I’m aware of that has relevant tools for observational astronomers. And right now we don’t need that. And honestly it’s a lot easier to toss out bad data than to try to weave intermediate stops into your tracking program for your telescope. But maybe some day we’ll have to plan observations so that we don’t waste too much valuable telescope time on bad data. Time will tell."
Is there any practical use for astronomy?,"This question begs the question, does everything need a practical use? The answer is a resounding no. What's the practical use of the Louvre, or of your local neighborhood public park where you enjoy weekend barbecues? There are some things that are very worthwhile that have little or no economical gain. Your local neighborhood public park in fact has negative economic gain. Admission is free, but maintenance is not. Think of how much money your city would make if they sold it to a condominium developer, and how much money it would save by not having to pay to have the park maintained. Despite having no obvious economic gain, some things are nonetheless worth quite a bit. Many of the sciences fall in this category. For example, what is the practical use of archeology? (There are some, but that's not the point.) Astronomy, like archeology, the Louvre, and your local public park, doesn't need a practical economical purpose. The purpose of the science is good enough. That said, there are practical applications of astronomy. The key application has been and still is navigation. Knowing the location of a ship at sea or the orientation of a vehicle in space requires astronomy. A less direct but still very important application of astronomy is in how it informs physics. Kepler was an astronomer, not a physicist. (Those two disciplines were very, very distinct in Kepler's day). Yet Kepler's work informed Newton on how to describe gravitation. More recently, astronomy has informed physics that its standard model was not quite correct. The observed neutrino flux from the Sun (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_neutrino_problem) was a third of what physics at the time said it should be. This resulted in a change to the standard model. Neutrinos have a small but non-zero mass, and they oscillate from one form to another. Astronomy continues to inform physics to this day. Physicists (and astronomers) remain clueless with regard to what constitutes dark matter and dark energy. But whatever they are, they certainly do exist."
What is the minimum mass required so that objects become spherical due to its own gravity?,"Icy objects, such as most in the Kuiper belt can reach an equilibrium if they are about 400km across, whereas the rocky asteroid Pallas, at 572km clearly has an irregular, non-spherical shape. All rocky objects larger than Pallas (and there aren't many) are spherical. Rock tends to be stronger than ice. Rocky objects are able to withstand their own gravity for longer than icy ones. Pallas is a reasonable cut off point. The next smaller asteroids (Vesta, Hygiea etc) are round-ish, but not in hydrostatic equilibrium. On the other hand, small, icy moons such as Miranda and Mimas are in, or close to equilibrium. Mimas has a diameter of just under 400km."
Is it possible that all dark matter is made of rogue planets (free-floating planet)?,"First of all I'll start with a few ideas: Now, how do we know that dark matter is present in the universe?  Astronomers measure the gravitational pull of galaxies and galaxy groups/clusters based on how objects behave when interacting with these objects. Some examples of this include tidal gas/dust stripping, the orbit of stars in a galaxy and gravitational lensing of distant light from a large cluster. Using this they determine the mass of the galaxy (or galaxy group).
We can also determine the mass of a galaxy or group by looking at it and adding up the mass of all the objects (like stars, dust, gas, black holes, and other baryonic matter). While these methods both give us approximations, it is clear that the gravitational mass of galaxies and groups exceeds the baryonic mass by a factor of 10-100. When astrophysicists first found this phenomenon they had to come up with a plausible explanation, so they suggested that there is some new, invisible matter called dark matter. (Aside: some astrophysicists also came up with other explanations like modified gravity, but so far dark matter does the best job at explaining observations). Okay, so now how do we know dark matter is not any sort of baryonic matter? There are a few reasons astrophysicists know that it is extremely unlikely that dark matter is baryonic. First of all if all the stars in a galaxy shine on an object it heats up, this heat causes the release of radiation, called thermal radiation, and every (baryonic) object above zero kelvin (or -273.14 deg celcius) emits this radiation. However, dark matter does not emit any radiation at all (hence the name dark!)  If dark matter were baryonic it would also mean that it could become light emitting. If we got a clump of baryonic matter* and put it in space it would gravitationally contract, and would eventually form a star or black hole** - both of which we would be able to see. So, because of these reasons the dark matter in galaxies and in galaxy groups/clusters cannot be baryonic, and so cannot be planets, dead stars, asteroids, etc. It would definetely not be planets as there is no way 10-100 times the mass of the stars in a galaxy would be planets, as the mechanism for making planets relies on supernovae, and the number of supernovae needed for the that many planets would be far too high to match our observations. I hope that this answered your question! *provided the clump of baryonic matter was large, and the amount there is in galaxies definitely is! ** we don't observe black holes directly, but can see radiation from their accretion disks."
How do we know Milky Way is a 'barred' spiral galaxy?,"There are several different lines of evidence which together form a coherent picture: that of a barred galaxy. Moreover, as most disc galaxies are barred, we should expect the same from the Milky Way. The various evidences are: The observed light distribution (2MASS) shows a left-right asymmetry in brightness and the vertical height. This is explained by the near end of the bar being located on that side. The distribution of magnitudes of red-clump stars (which have very nearly the same luminosity) is split towards the Galactic centre, as expected from a boxy/peanut bulge (which is always associated with a bar). The observed gas velocities show velocities which are ""forbidden"" in an axisymmetric or near-axisymmetric (spiral arms only) galaxy. These velocities occur naturally from the orbits of gas in a barred potential. The velocity distribution of stars in the Solar neighbourhood shows some asymmetries and clumping which is most naturally explained by orbital resonance with the bar rotation. The extent, pattern speed, and orientation of the bar is consistent between all of these."
Why do some planets have rings?,"Rings are made up of tiny (and not so tiny) pieces of rock and ice that are in some way the bits ""left over"" from the formation of the planet. The theory involves the Roche limit - and is that particles that are already within this limit can't accrete into a larger body because of the tidal forces involved. Another theory is that they are formed when a moon comes closer to a planet than the Roche limit, the tidal forces cause it to break up and form a ring. Though the presence of ""shepherd"" moons in the rings of Saturn does hint that this may not be major source of material. Both explanations, to me, imply that you'd only get major ring systems around larger (gas giant) planets, though it doesn't preclude rings around smaller (rocky) planets. This seems to be borne out by our solar system where the gas giants have rings whereas the rocky planets don't. Source As to being able to see them, you should be able to see the rings of Saturn with an amateur telescope which has a 50 - 100 powers of magnification. With binoculars you'll probably see a misshapen blob. Source"
Why is the Oort cloud presumed to be spherical?,The latter.  Long-period comets appear to come from random directions.
Do all the objects in the universe exert force on all other objects?,"Yes - this is the formula: $$F = G\frac{m_1m_2}{d^2}$$ Using this equation, we can say that all atoms in the universe exert force upon eachother. One carbon-12 atom has a mass of $1.660538921(73)\times10^{-27} kg$. That's a crazy small mass. Now let's say that these two atoms are 100,000,000 light years apart. That's $9.461\times10^{23} m$, which is a very long distance. Now, if we plug these values into our equation, we get that the force is: $1.709191430132 \times 10^{-59} N$ That's a very, very small amount of force. But it's still force."
Why does the Moon stablize Earth's axis?,"One way to look at this problem is to consider angular momentum. The Earth spins around its axis, and has therefore some angular momentum by itself. The angular momentum is proportional to the mass of the Earth, to its squared radius, and to its angular velocity. But the Earth is not alone; it has the Moon rotating around it that adds angular momentum to the Earth-Moon system. And, even though the Moon is not as massive as the Earth (it is about 100 times less massive), nor rotates very fast around the Earth (and therefore a lesser angular velocity), it has a large orbit (about 300 000 km) and overall, it adds to the system an amount of angular momentum comparable to that of the Earth itself. Now, think of a spinning-top: the faster it rotates (and thus the larger the angular momentum), the more stable it is. It is the same for the Earth-Moon system: without the Moon, the angular momentum of the Earth itself would be such that gravitational perturbations could be sufficient, in the long run, to significantly perturb its axis (exactly like the spinning-top: if it does not rotate very fast, a small perturbation will rapidly increase and the spinning-top axis will start to oscillate more and more). But with the Moon, the global angular momentum of the system is larger, and it is therefore harder to sufficiently perturb the system to get it to oscillate strongly. Sources: For those who wants the dirty details, you can have a look at Laskar et al. 1993."
Why is Starlink polluting the night sky a big concern if we have space telescopes?,"It's a problem because there are still lots  and lots and lots of ground-based telescopes. Ground-based telescopes are still (by far) the biggest optical telescopes, and the cost of space telescopes is prohibitive for many research projects. It will be a long time before a telescope anywhere close in size to the VLT can be launched. Most space telescopes are specialist devices, observing in a particular part of the spectrum that is blocked by the atmosphere (so there are infra-red, ultraviolet and X-ray telescopes in space) Or doing a specific task (looking for exoplanets, or mapping the positions of stars) Space is getting cheaper, but it will be a long time before it is as cost-effective as ground telescopes in the optical range. And so it will be a long time before all professional telescopes are in space. So it is a problem for professional astronomers."
"Why is the sun not directly overhead at noon on the March equinox at N 0° 0' 0.00"" E 0° 0' 0.00""?","It never is exactly, directly overhead on the vernal equinox at the Greenwich meridian. You know that it happens on different days in different years so it must be happening at different times on those days. March 20 in 2021 was the day the Sun's declination changed from south to north. It happened at about 0937 UTC and its greenwich hour angle was about 322 degrees. The Sun was directly over a spot in Kenya."
Puzzling quotes from astronauts about earth size,"The Earth is 4 times the diameter of the Moon. The Earth viewed from the Moon will therefore appear to have 4 times the angular diameter of the Moon viewed from the Earth. The Moon is easily obscured by a thumb at arm's length (by a factor of 3-4). Now bring your thumb closer (because you can't fully extend your arm in a bulky space suit) and put on the biggest pair of ski gloves you can find. It is not a great stretch of the imagination to think your thumb, in a spacesuit, would easily obscure something 4 times the size of the Moon."
"Why is Uranus called a ""green planet""?","I think your issue is linguistic not astronomical. The way a language cuts up the space of colours into discrete names is varies strongly from one language to another, and even from one dialect to another. Translating colour names is fraught with difficulty. Uranus has a colour that is approximated by an RGB value with approximately equal amounts of green and blue (I've found the value #B2D6DB, but monitors vary, so this isn't absolute). You might describe this as ""light green-blue"" or ""light blue-green"" or ""pale teal"" or ""pale aqua"" or ""duck-egg"", or some form of ""turquoise"". However, the usual contrast in terms of colour is with Neptune, which much closer to an azure or cerulean blue. Uranus may not be ""green"", but it is ""greener than Neptune"". The images below show the RGB value and a colour photo of Uranus by an Earth based observer which shows a turquoise colour "
What ground-based observational evidence is there that the Moon doesn't have an atmosphere?,"The Moon is so close that establishment of an atmosphere would be easy: you take a photo. An atmosphere always is thicker at the surface and gets exponentially thinner outward. This would be visible at the edges of the moon. Just think of the photos of Earth from space with the blue-ish layer the atmosphere shows as.
It would also mean that the edges of the Moon would show in (slightly) different colour due to the presence of an atmosphere. Any atmosphere absorbs and scatters light. Especially the bluer light is scattered more efficiently (that's why the mountains in the distance show blue-ish). This would be visible in colour photography but - depending on the atmosphere's thickness - also with the visible eye. even if you don't resolve the atmosphere: the Moon often passes in front of stars. The light curve of the stars can be captured when the Moon starts to obscure it. The drop is sharp and indicative of an edge. You would not see such diffraction pattern but a smooth transition from visible star to obscured star if the Moon had any significant atmosphere which causes scattering.
Even easier this would be visible during a solar eclips. The edge of the shadow of the Moon would be less clear than it is. Spectroscopy. Any atmosphere consists of atoms. Each atom has its own characteristic properties in absorption but also emission. The spectrum of daylight on Earth is characterized both, by the emission lines on the Sun, but also by the Fraunhofer absorption line in the Earth's atmosphere. No absorption of any kind is observed in the reflected light from the Moon. Neither of these observations needs very advanced equipment and can be made ground-based."
How many light seconds away is the JWST?,"Almost 5.1 seconds, plus or minus around 1 second. Here's a daily plot (at midnight) of the light travel time from the JWST to the centre of the Earth, courtesy of JPL Horizons, using a script derived from the one in this answer. There are more graphics & scripts related to the JWST here. Times are in TDB.  The light travel time to a location on the Earth's surface has a small extra variation due to the Earth's rotation. And of course, you can't get a direct line of sight signal from the JWST when you're on the wrong side of the Earth. ;) Here's an hourly plot for today of the distance from the JWST to its control centre, the  Space Telescope Science Institute, which is located on the Johns Hopkins University campus. I used longitude -76.622987, latitude 39.332887, altitude 0.073 km as the coordinates.  Here's my plotting script, running on the SageMathCell server."
Do we know a star that is similar to the Sun when it would be a red giant?,"Models for the future behaviour of the Sun do vary, mainly as a result of uncertainty of mass loss during the red giant (H shell burning) and asymptotic red giant (H+He shell burning) phases. A highly cited paper by Schroeder & Smith 2008 claims that the Sun will reach its maximum size of about $256 R_{\odot}$ (1.18 au) at the very tip of the red giant branch (and not at the end of the asymptotic giant branch phase, which is suggested by some other models). This maximum size will occur 7.6 billion years in the future (not the 5 billion years of popular literature), when the Sun's mass will be reduced to about $0.7M_{\odot}$ and have a surface temperature of 2600 K (or about 2300 Celsius). This would have a spectral type of M6III, or perhaps even M6I. Do we know of a star similar to this? It depends what you mean by similar, but there are unlikely to be any stars like this in our Galaxy. The reason for this is that star formation began in our Galaxy about 12 billion years ago. But a 1 solar mass star like the Sun requires about 12 billion years (or a bit more) to reach the tip of the red giant branch. Even were this just about possible time-wise and we were to find a red (super)giant star of about $0.7 M_{\odot}$, it would be highly unlikely that the star would have a similar chemical composition to the Sun. That is because stars born early in the life of our Galaxy would have very low concentrations of metals like iron and nickel that are only produced inside stars and only present in the interstellar medium when a generation of stars have lived and died. So my perhaps pedantic answer, is that there aren't any big red giants we can see now that started life as 1 solar-mass stars and have a similar chemical composition to the Sun."
Please check my Mars photo,"(Much of this echoes what antlersoft says in their answer) For a phone photo through the eyepiece that looks about right to me!
The size... the brightness... both are as I expect. What you could try is to use the manual mode of your phone's camera and set the ISO down to minimum (100) and the shutter speed down to something like 1/60s. Take a few shots, pick the best one, and make a zoomed+cropped version. You should be able to see a point of white on the south pole and a hint of dark patches. If the seeing's bad then you'll get awful results no matter what, so wait until the view is nice and crisp. Now, when you look through the eyepiece, how does it look to your eyes? Is it too bright? If so then keep watching the planet and your eyes will adjust and the contrast will improve. Is it too blurry? If so then back off the magnification a bit until it's not blurry any more. A smaller crisp image is much better than a larger blurry image - your eyes will be able to pick out small details in a tiny image with time and practice. Here's a lucky snap I got a few weeks ago:
 And here's a zoomed and cropped version:
 And here's one from one minute beforehand with automatic camera settings:
 These were taken through the eyepiece of a 10"" F/5 Dobsonian - very similar to yours. (I can't remember which eyepiece I had in at the time, I'm afraid! I think it was a 4.5mm but it could have been an 8.8mm with 3x Barlow lens, or even a zoom lens plus the 3x Barlow...all I do remember is that the seeing was exceptionally good that night and I was making the most of it!) The good one was ISO 100 and an exposure time of 1/60s. The bad one was ISO 100 and an exposure time of 1/17s. Hopefully these photos demonstrate that everything has to come together to be able to get a halfway decent photo: the seeing, the collimation, a steady hand, the camera settings... :-)"
Do we know the exact spot where big bang took place?,"You're envisioning the Big Bang as a cosmological ""explosion"" in space where the universe is the resulting material expanding in outward all directions.  The problem is, the universe doesn't work like that.  The universe isn't a region of space that is expanding outward into another thing where you can (even hypothetically) fly out to the border and say, ""Yup, that's about all there is. Let's use these borders to find the center of this expanding sphere."" The Universe is literally everything there is: space, time, and everything it contains and ever will contain. And the word contains is even a bit of a misnomer in that it suggests a container with boundaries. But the universe is simultaneously both unbounded and finite at the same time. ""Finite"" refers to the fixed amount of stuff this universe contains (matter, energy, etc)… and unbounded because this thing we know as ""the universe"" has no borders in a sense that we point to or even experience. So how would you even define a ""center""? There isn't one. There's a famous way to help visualize an expanding universe that is both finite and unbounded without a center or borders; it's called ""The Balloon Analogy."" Imagine our friends in Flatland living in two-dimensional space… where everything they know (their entire universe) exists on the surface of a balloon. If you start to inflate that balloon (the expanding universe),  all the little astronomers on the surface will observe that all the surrounding galaxies are moving away from them — and the farther away those galaxies are, the faster they seem to be moving away.  That's pretty much what most cosmologists believe is happening to us.  Going back to that balloon analogy, picture yourself existing on the surface of that balloon-universe and ask these questions again — In my expanding universe (the surface of the balloon), where is it's center? Everything is expanding outward in all directions, so if we rewind back in time, certainly everything should converge somewhere, right? Can we just find the borders of this outward expansion and calculate the exact center? So basdically… ""Do we know the exact spot where big bang took place?"" Be careful taking the balloon analogy too far, because it starts to break down in many ways. But the answer to where the expansion of the universe emanates from really is that it emanates from everywhere; everything we know is contained within the origin of our own existence, and there is no center and there are no borders by any definition of existence that we can experience."
Does anything orbit the Sun faster than Mercury?,"The recently discovered asteroids 2019 LF6 and 2020 AV2, each taking 151 days to orbit the Sun, have the shortest periods currently listed in the JPL Small Body Database. Vulcanoids are difficult to detect from Earth; none are known yet.
To remain in such an orbit, Evans and Tabachnik 1999 estimate a minimum diameter of 100 m and a semimajor axis between 0.09 and 0.21 au. There are various competing definitions for a planet's neighborhood.
Soter 2006 says: Two bodies share an ""orbital zone"" if their orbits cross a common radial distance from the primary and their periods are nonresonant and differ by less than an order of magnitude. A Sun-grazing asteroid with perihelion 0.01 au and aphelion 0.31 au (Mercury's perihelion) would orbit in 23 days, well above the 9 day minimum for that definition."
Does the Sun belong to a constellation?,"Constellations are human constructs to make sense of the night sky.  When you are trying to find your way around, it helps to ""chunk"" stars into patterns and assign those groupings names.  When I want to point out a particular object in the sky (say Polaris, the North Star), I start by pointing out a familiar constellation (say Ursa Major, the Big Dipper).  From there, I can tell my friend to follow this or that line to get them to look where I'm looking:  With the advent of computerized telescopes and large data sets, constellations are less important for professional astronomers.  However, many stellar databases use Flamsteed or Bayer designations, which assign stars to constellations.  In order to include all stars, the sky is divided into irregular regions that encompass the familiar constellations. So, which constellations is the Sun assigned to?  Well, from the perspective of someone on the Earth, the Sun moves through the constellations throughout the course of the year.  Or rather, Sol moves through the region of the sky where some of the constellations would be seen if its light did not drown out distant stars.  Our moon and the rest of the planets move through those same constellations.  (The Greek phrase which gives us the word ""planet"" means ""wandering star"".) The current position of the sun against the background of distant stars changes over the course of the year.  (This is important for astrology.)  It's a little easier to make sense of with a diagram:  So perhaps a better question is: What constellation does the Sun belong to today? Presumably an observer on an exoplanet would assign Sol to some constellation that is convenient from her perspective.  But from our perspective within the Solar system our sun, moon, and planets are not part of any constellation."
When was it worked out/discovered that our Sun can't go supernova?,"I think the definitive work is that of Hoyle & Fowler (1960). They argued that supernovae were produced by two possible mechanisms - what they called an implosion/explosion or an explosion within degenerate matter. Both of these mechanisms required very high internal temperatures ($>2\times 10^{9}$ K) and they argued that this could only be achieved for both mechanisms if the star is more massive than the Chandrasekhar limit of $5.8M_{\odot}/\mu_e^2$, where $\mu_e$ is the number of mass units per electron (1 for hydrogen, 2 for helium, carbon, oxygen, 2.25 for 56Fe etc.); otherwise it could achieve a degenerate state, supported by electron degeneracy pressure, and cool indefinitely without contracting any further. In addition, they successfully identified these two types of supernovae with Type I and Type II supernovae and argued that very high mass stars accounted for Type II supernovae via the implosion/explosion mechanism, whereas the Type I supernovae arose from the ignition of degenerate material in less massive stars, but still larger than the Chandrasekhar mass, which is $>1.2M_{\odot}$ for all plausible compositions. They even then conclude that stars up to $10M_{\odot}$ may lose enough mass to avoid a Type I supernova and become stable white dwarfs. Though it seems not to be explicitly stated in the paper, it is implicit that the Sun could not explode as either type of supernova. As an aside - I reminded myself of the plot of ""Songs of Distant Earth"" (I read it loooong ago). Clarke's story posits that the ""neutrino problem"" (the lack of detected solar electron-neutrinos), which was a thing back in the 60s, was actually because something odd was going on in the Sun's core. So I don't think that Clarke was suggesting that under normal stellar evolutonary circumstances the Sun would imminently explode. Indeed it was well known at that time that the Sun should continue on its main sequence life for billions of years."
How big would the asteroid belt planet be?,"The largest main belt asteroid is 1 Ceres, which alone contains almost a third of the total mass of the whole main asteroid belt. Ceres is large enough to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, i.e. its own gravity is strong enough to pull it into a roughly spherical shape.  Since the mass of a spherical planet scales as the cube of the diameter (assuming constant density), piling all the other main belt asteroids together onto Ceres would only increase its diameter by a bit under 50%.  It would still be a roughly similar type of body — a small sphere of partially differentiated rock and ice, with no atmosphere to speak of (as it'd be way too small to hold onto one). Thus, to answer your question, a hypothetical planet containing all the matter currently making up the main asteroid belt would look pretty much like Ceres already does, just a bit bigger."
How do we know the expansion of the universe is not centered around our position?,"Taken from my answer to https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/534684/123208, which is a duplicate on Physics SE. We observe that galaxies appear to move away from us, in an isotropic fashion, at a rate that is proportional to their distance from us (Hubble's law). Whilst one could argue that we are at (or near) the centre of a very uniform expansion, one would have to explain why Hubble's law should exist (it wouldn't if it were some sort of explosion-driven event) and why the universe appears isotropic to us, but wouldn't from a different position in the universe. The simplest explanation is that General Relativity applies (as we observe in a number of other cases) and we live in an expanding universe - this then means we do not need to occupy some privileged position in the universe (an erroneous assumption that has proved wrong every other time it has been made). In such a universe, the redshift of distant galaxies is not caused by relative motion, but by the expansion of space. At high redshifts, these phenomena become distinct in that the relationship between ""velocity"" and redshift is different, for instance allowing ""faster than light"" (apparent) speeds. What this means is that in order to explain the observed relationship between distance and redshift (naturally explained by Hubble's law in scenario A) you would have to posit an exact relationship between the recession velocity and distance for scenario B that yielded the observed distance-redshift relationship in just such a manner that it appeared to match Hubble's law and scenario A at high redshift. That seems unlikely. So basically at present, expansion fits the facts (far) better and more simply than any of the alternatives. A further piece of indirect evidence comes from a careful analysis of the physical conditions of gas at high redshifts, illuminated by background quasars (out to $z \sim 3$) and subtle alterations to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum, caused by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, towards galaxy clusters at low redshifts ($z \leq 1$). Both of these methods give the temperature of the CMB at those locations. In the expanding universe model, the temperature should increase as $1+z$, where $z$ is the redshift. If one instead has a non-expanding universe, and explain the CMB as due to some expanding shell of material, then the average temperature ""seen"" by distant galaxies would differ from this unless the shell gas has been uniformly cooling by an amount that just happens to agree with redshift of that galaxy. Avgoustidis et al. (2015) review the evidence for the temperature evolution of the CMB and conclude that it agrees with an adiabatic expansion to better than 1%. Direct evidence for the expansion is on the horizon though. In an expanding universe, the speed at which galaxies move away from us can change slowly with time (and with distance) by of order 10 cm/s per year, despite their being no force on them. This is known as the redshift drift. There are plans to measure this tiny effect with the European Extremely Large Telescope and the Square Kilometre Array over the course of a decade. See fr example https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/53762/2531 ."
Do stars become more metal-rich as they evolve?,"If the star is a solar mass or below it will not produce any metals (anything heavier than helium) within 10 billion years of birth. It will be on the main sequence, fusing hydrogen to helium via the pp chain, which does not change the abundance of metals. There is a tendency for the heavier elements it was born with to sink with age, but this is stymied by the outer convective layer that stops this diffusion from occurring, other than to increase the surface helium abundance a little. If you pick a star that is a little more massive, maybe 1.1 solar masses such that it has reached the asymptotic giant branch after its main sequence and red giant phases, then carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and a variety of much heavier elements are being produced in the interior and mixed to the surface by convection. The heavier elements are produced by ""slow"" neutron capture (aka the s-process). Thus asymptotic giant stars can be observed with all sorts of ""chemical anomalies"". Famously this has included objects where technetium has been detected - this has a short half-life so demonstrates it must have been made inside the star - and also objects like ""barium giants"" - again, rich in heavy elements produced in the s-process. There are also giant stars that show enhanced carbon or oxygen abundances. It is unlikely that [Fe/H] would change, because iron is not produced in such stars. More massive stars do not live for 10 billion years. However, they behave in a more complex way during their shorter lives. Firstly, they burn hydrogen via the CNO catalytic cycle and they have radiative envelopes with little convection. The CNO cycle increases the abundance of nitrogen and this can reveal itself in enhanced surface nitrogen even on the main sequence. Even more massive stars can lose large fractions of their mass towards the ends of their lives revealing the outcome of previous nuclear burning. These include Wolf-Rayet stars that may show extreme carbon, oxygen or nitrogen enhancements. Again though, even in more massive stars, the relative iron abundance is unlikely to change because it isn't made in these stars until the final days of their existence. One metal that does markedly change its abundance during a star's life is lithium. This is ""burned"" at lower temperatures than hydrogen and is thus depleted in the interiors of even low-mass stars. Various mixing processes then gradually deplete the surface lithium with age. For instance, the Sun has a surface lithium abundance about 100 times smaller than at birth (as judged from the lithium content in meteorites)."
How far away are the events that caused the gravitational waves that have been detected?,"Yes, it is possible to calculate (within an error range) the distance of observed gravitational wave events.  It is known that a variety of parameters will affect how the amplitude and frequency of the observed gravitational waves will change over time as recorded in the ""chirp"" event from the interferometers: the parameters include distance of the event, the mass of each of the colliding objects, the angular momentum of each of the colliding objects, the orientation of the objects' angular momentum vectors with respect to each other and with their orbital plane.  With general relativity, you can build a model that calculates the expected ""chirp"" given a value for all these parameters; when a chirp is observed, it is possible to determine the combination of these parameters that result in a chirp that best matches the observation. The effect of a larger distance parameter is to decrease the amplitude of the expected waves from colliding objects of a given mass, as well as to ""slow down"" the entire event due to cosmological red shift. From GWTC-1: A Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog of Compact Binary Mergers Observed by LIGO and Virgo during the First and Second Observing Runs Gravitational waves from compact binaries carry information about the
  properties of the source such as the masses and spins. These can be
  extracted via Bayesian inference by using theoretical models of the GW
  signal that describe the inspiral, merger, and ringdown of the final
  object for BBH [23–30] and the inspiral (and merger) for BNS [31–33].
  Such models are built by combining post-Newtonian calculations
  [34–38], the effective-one-body formalism [39–44], and numerical
  relativity [45–50]."
At what distance from Earth would our Sun be the same apparent magnitude as the next brightest star in the sky?,"One way to answer would be to consider the brightest star in our sky (other than the Sun), which is Sirius.  Then determine how far you would have to be from our Sun for it to be as bright as Sirius is from here. That turns out to be 1.8 light years.  That's not even halfway to the nearest star, so if you're in any other star system, then our Sun is just another star.  If you're anywhere in our solar system, even way out in the Oort cloud, then our Sun is way brighter than anything else."
Does the Earth have another moon?,"Not strictly satellites/moons, but certainly companions are 2010 TK7 with a diameter of ~300 m, an Earth trojan at the L4 point, and the ~5 km 3753 Cruithne in a peculiar orbit locked to the Earth's."
What would an asteroid inside of Mercury's orbit be called?,"The name used for such objects is vulcanoids. This term refers to the hypothetical intra-Mercurian planet Vulcan, which was proposed by Urbain Le Verrier (best known for his successful prediction of the existence of Neptune) to account for the anomalous precession of Mercury's orbit that is now explained by general relativity. Note that the expected number of vulcanoids is low: the Yarkovsky effect should  clear out objects smaller than 1 km on ~gigayear timescales (Vokrouhlický et al., 2000), while the YORP effect would be effective at destroying larger objects by spinning them up until they break apart (Collins, 2020). Observational constraints from NASA's STEREO mission suggest the number of objects larger than 1 km may be no more than 76 (Steffl et al., 2013)."
"From an outsider's perspective, how can a black hole grow if nothing ever crosses the event horizon?","First off, there's no real time dilation effect. In coordinate systems that cover the event horizon (Kruskal-Szekeres, Eddington-Finkelstein, Gullstrand-Painlevé, Kerr-Schild), objects fall through it without so much as a hiccup. The only real slowing-down effect is from redshift (as seen from outside). Suppose you watch from the side as someone lobs a basketball into a black hole, against a background of stars. The basketball has mass, so even when it's far from the black hole, it gravitationally lenses the stars behind it. As it approaches the black hole, that lensing will overlap/merge with the lensing of the black hole, so the shape of the black hole will seem to have a slight bulge in the direction of the basketball. As more time passes, the basketball will appear to flatten against the horizon of the black hole (while redshifting into invisibility), and the bulge will spread around so that the combined system appears spherical again, but with a slightly larger mass. Technically, you never see the object fall through and you never see a ""true"" black hole, but it makes no practical difference, because the difference between what you see and the ideal limit decreases exponentially with time. The time constant is comparable to the light crossing time of the black hole, which is around 1 day for a huge black hole like M87's, and less than a millisecond for a stellar-mass black hole. So after even one year, never mind billions, you'll have no hope of distinguishing the frozen star from a ""true"" black hole."
How does JWST position itself to see and resolve an exact target?,"It's true that James Webb carries fuel, and you're right that it is not used for positioning, at least not directly (see below). Fuel is used for maintaining its orbit around L2, and was also used three times on its journey to L2, as ""corrections burns"". Note that the distance to the target is irrelevant. A nearby exoplanet and a distant galaxy are both ""infinitely far away"" for observing purposes (although of course in general more distant object are fainter). To acquire a target, James Webb (and other space telescopes) uses a number of reaction wheels, one for each ""axis"". At least three are needed, but James Webb has six; more allows for easier control, but are also heavier. These wheels rotate constantly, thus storing a large amount of angular momentum to keep the telescope steady. Changing the angular speed of one of the action wheels causes Webb to change its direction along that wheel's axis. Edit thanks to @KarlKastor: While James Webb observes, the photon pressure of the Sun's light exerts a torque on the telescope. To maintain its position, this is counteracted by adjusting the spin of the reaction wheels. This causes angular momentum to build up, which must occasionally be dumped by firings Webb's thrusters once per week or so (JWST Momentum Management). Additionally, Webb has six gyroscopes which tell the telescope which direction it's currently pointing, and how fast it's turning. Unlike Hubble's gyroscopes, however, which are mechanical, Webb uses Hemispherical Resonator Gyroscopes, which have no moving parts susceptible to wear, instead measuring the precession of vibration patterns in a crystal. Finally, to ensure a perfect pointing, one of Webb's four instruments, NIRISS, is equipped with a ""Fine Guidance Sensor"" which ""locks"" the telescope on a target by observing the exact position of a star in its field of view. Edit thanks to @David Hammen: In addition to the Fine Guidance Sensor, the JWST also has a few regular star trackers. To power its various moving parts, James Webb has its solar array, capable of providing 2 kW, twice the needed amount. You can read more about the positioning system at the NASA FAQ."
"What is the name of meteoroids which hit Moon, Mars, or pretty much anything that isn’t the Earth?","Oxford English Dictionary is an authoritative source, but it's aimed at the general public. I think no astronomer will frown upon you when you're using the terms meteoroid and meteorite to describe a small body impacting another body in the solar system. As an example, Wikipedia doesn't impose the limitation that it must hit Earth: A meteorite is a solid piece of debris from an object, such as a comet, asteroid, or meteoroid, that originates in outer space and survives its passage through the atmosphere to reach the surface of a planet or moon."
Why are wavelengths shorter than visible light neglected by new telescopes?,"There are some technological issues to solve with putting any large telescope into space - and a space telescope is required at UV wavelengths. It is not possible to optimise such an instrument to work at both UV and IR wavelengths because of issues like cooling, mirror coatings and such-like. The simple angular resolution limit of a telescope goes $\lambda/D$, so on the face of it, to get equivalent resolution to an optical telescope, a UV telescope can be smaller. However, you also have to have optics that are good to a small fraction of a wavelength, so much better than the visible/IR. At even shorter wavelengths then conventional ""optics"" doesn't work because photons get absorbed and you move to the grazing incidence technologies of X-ray telescopes, which is a whole different game and much harder to achieve a given angular resolution. Given all that, back in the 80s/90s I would guess that a decision was taken about the wavelength range to be covered by the successor to HST (ie JWST at a cost of approximately 10 billion USD) The real reason that no major UV successor to HST or IUE is ready to go now is simply that it is considered that the most important science priorities are achievable at near and mid-IR wavelengths. These are: observing the high redshift universe (essentially no UV light is detected from galaxies beyond a redshift of 3), observing star and planet formation (mostly in dusty environments where UV light cannot emerge and protoplanetary discs emit mostly at IR wavelengths) and doing exoplanetary science (planets are cooler than stars and emit mostly in the IR). Thus, I don't think there are any technological showstoppers to a big UV telescope (at least the equivalent of JWST), it just comes down to science prorities."
How would the night sky look from inside a globular cluster?,"Globular clusters occupy an interesting place in the spectrum of composite stellar systems. As you point out, they are highly concentrated populations of stars, and seem to lack any dark matter component, unlike more massive dwarf galaxies. Binary interactions become very important in simulating globular clusters, and interestingly enough (maybe unsurprisingly), the one example of a discovery of a planet found in a globular cluster has been around a binary star system (see: PSR B1620-26 b; this circumbinary planet was found orbiting a pulsar and a white dwarf.). This is not to say there are not other examples, however, this was the easiest for me to come across. I would be interested to know how common this situation is, and in addition, how stable it is given the potentially highly chaotic environment it lives in. These speculations don't answer your question, but I thought it interesting enough to bring up as evidence in favor of your question not being an unreasonable one to ask. From the wiki page: Globular clusters can contain a high density of stars; on average about 0.4 stars per cubic parsec, increasing to 100 or 1000 stars per cubic parsec in the core of the cluster.[26] The typical distance between stars in a globular cluster is about 1 light year,[27] but at its core, the separation is comparable to the size of the Solar System (100 to 1000 times closer than stars near the Solar System).[28] This seems to indicate to me that location within the globular cluster would matter quite a bit. If at the core the average distance between stars is about three thousand times closer than our nearest neighbor is to our sun (my estimate to give some perspective: a few lightyears to Proxima Centauri divided by 100 is about 3000AU (about 100 times further than Pluto from the sun)), then stable orbits may be shifted inward, or simply may not exist due to two-body interactions. However, if life were to exist (an assumption we're going to make for the purposes of your question), one would see a very different night sky. According to this paper, the number density profile of stars within the globular cluster M92 follows a Wilson Profile fairly well, which has the form: $$ f_{W} = A\{ e^{-aE} - e^{-aE_{0}} [1 - a(E-E_{0}) ] \} $$
where $E \le E_{0}$. E is the specific energy of the star: $$ E = v^{2}/2 + \Phi(r) $$ and where $\Phi(r)$ is the mean-field gravitational potential, determined from the Poisson equation. For each family of models, the constants A, $E_{0}$, and a in the above distribution function define two dimensional scales (a typical radius and a typical mass or velocity) and one dimensionless parameter, the central depth of the potential well (related to the concentration parameter) (all of the information is taken from the paper I've linked). It seems to be the case that globular clusters are not ""simple stellar populations"", in that they are usually made of multiple generations (sources: 1,2). However, globular clusters generally consist of population II stars and are older stellar systems when compared to other star clusters. I bring all of this up because in addition to the number density of stars, the stellar distribution of stellar types would certainly be an important factor in how the night sky would look. If you lived a thousandth of a lightyear from a blue supergiant, you could imagine that that would make a huge difference in what you would see on a day to day basis. At the same distance, a supergiant star is on the order of $10^{5}$ times the luminosity of our sun (and therefore is $10^{5}$ the flux, since $L \propto f$ holding $D_{L}$ constant). At the same distance as our sun, the magnitude of a star with $10^{5}$ times the flux would have an apparent magnitude of about -38 (I used Rigel as my test case; this produces a star in our sky which is 12 magnitudes brighter than our sun). Moving this to the average distance between stars at the center of a globular cluster we would get an apparent magnitude of: In other words, a blue supergiant at an average distance between stars within a globular cluster would appear to be as bright as our sun is to us! This is absolutely crazy. Depending on where it is in relation to the sun, it could effective cause two days, or potentially one day which is greater than half the time it takes your planet to rotate once. I would image that this would certainly interfere with observing in optical (and shorter wavelengths)."
"Where do we define the ""surface"" of a gas planet?","There are two common definitions in use for the surface of gas planets: There is no hard relation between those two surfaces, but in general their altitude will not be different by more than a scale height, as at around 0.1-1 bar the gaseous atomic and molecular bands become enormously pressure broadened, which makes the atmosphere quickly opaque at most wavelengths, for the usual gas giant components."
What's the brightness of Alpha Centauri from Proxima Centauri?,"Not close to being able to read by. Proxima Centauri is about 13,000 AU from the two binary Centari stars.   Together they have about twice the luminosity of the sun but at 13,000 AU, that's roughly 2/169,000,000 the visible light that the Earth gets from the Sun. The brightness variation of the full moon to the Sun is about 1 to 440,000, so, some rough math, the two stars would shine about 1/190th as bright as the full moon.   That would make those 2 stars by far the brightest stars in the Proxima Centauri sky, but far short of reading light.   Together, the two stars would be about 10 times as bright as Venus at Venus' peak.  (Venus is about 1/2000th as bright as the moon, -4.4 apparent magnitude to -12.6 for the moon). That would, I think, be bright enough to be visible during the day under an earth like sky a lot of the time. The two stars would be quite close to each other too, maximum visible distance between them would be roughly 1/4 the diameter of the full moon, where they would still be visible separate stars when far apart, but they would pass close to each other too, perhaps appearing to touch to the naked eye.    The two stars complete a full orbit around each other in 79.9 years, so the variation would be noticeable over a human lifetime.     "
"So, what exactly is an 'ultra-cool' dwarf star?","Breaking the phrase down:  Ultra-cool, as called2voyage already discussed, means that the star has an effective temperatures of less than 2,700 kelvin. This is about half of the Sun's surface temperature. Spectroscopically, it means that these stars are of class M7-L8, i.e. really, really cool stars that just barely reach the threshold for nuclear fusion. Actually, some L dwarfs will never fuse hydrogen as normal stars do, and will become brown dwarfs. Therefore, ""ultra-cool dwarf"" doesn't necessarily refer to just main sequence stars. Other characteristics in some cases (from Cruz et al.): TRAPPIST-1 actually appears to be a rather massive ultra-cool dwarf, then, in comparison to some of these other objects. Here's an annotated Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, with a box for ultra-cool dwarfs and a circle for where TRAPPIST-1 is, approximately:

Why are galaxies disk shaped?,"Spiral galaxies may be the most commonly depicted probably because we find ourselves in one, however, galaxies come in many sizes and shapes. Wikipedia's page on Galaxy morphological classification explains the most common classifications.  Answering the question on the title: The basic answer to your question is Conservation of Angular Momentum.
  Astronomers have been interested in this question for a long time and
  are still writing papers on the subject.   Even if you assume that at
  the time of the big bang there was no net angular momentum in the
  universe, one would expect that there were local fluctuations.  When
  galaxies initially formed by gravitational attraction these net local
  amounts remained.  Now angular momentum is conserved so when the
  initial collection of stars and gas in one galactic volume start to
  collapse the net angular momentum has to stay the same.  Since angular
  momentum $\vec{L} =m\vec{v}\times\vec{r}$,  for a given $v$ its easier to conserve $L$ if the $r$ is
  large.   In the orthogonal direction (along the axis of the accidental
  angular momentum) there is no such hindrance to collapse and so the
  collection turns out to be disk shaped.   By the way there has been
  several studies on the net angular momentum of a large collection of
  galaxies coming from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the answer is
  pretty close to but not quite zero.  Stay tuned. Extracted from an University of Phoenix Department of Physics article"
"What causes the sharp if irregular boundary line in the ""Cosmic Cliffs"" JWST Carina image?","The ""cliff"" marks the boundary between the lower, dusty, neutral gas, and the upper ionized region. The ionization is caused by the O and B stars, i.e. the most massive, hottest ones of the stars seen in the top. The ionized region basically forms a so-called Strömgren sphere, which was calculated analytically by Strömgren (1939) for the spherical region around a single star surrounded by neutral gas. The ionizing radiation carves its way through the neutral gas. Because the cross section $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ of neutral hydrogen — the main constituent of the gas — is rather high, in dense gas the UV radiation cannot travel very far before encountering a hydrogen atom and ionization it, i.e. splitting it into a proton and an electron. On the other hand, if the gas is dense, it doesn't take long for a proton to meet an electron and recombine. Hence, the gas around the hot stars will in general be fully ionized out to a certain distance — in the spherical case called the Strömgren radius $R_\mathrm{S}$ — after which it will be neutral. At this distance, you run out of UV photons, so to speak. The size of the ionized region is given by the balance between the amount of ionizing photons emitted per unit time $\color{red}{Q(H^0)}$, and the rate at which the protons and electrons recombine. This latter rate is, in turn, given by their densities $\color{blue}{n_\mathrm{p}}$ and $\color{blue}{n_\mathrm{e}}$, where in a fully ionized region  $\color{blue}{n_\mathrm{p} \simeq n_\mathrm{e}}$, and a quantum mechanical, temperature-dependent factor $\color{green}{\alpha_B(T)}$, where $T$ is the temperature of the gas:
$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
[\mathrm{volume}] & = & \frac{[\mathrm{ionization\,rate}]}{[\mathrm{recombination\,rate}]} \\
\frac{4\pi}{3}R_\mathrm{S}^3 & = & \frac{\color{red}{Q(H^0)}}{\color{blue}{n_\mathrm{p}n_\mathrm{e}} \color{green}{\alpha_B}}\\
R_\mathrm{S} & = & \left( \frac{3}{4\pi} \frac{\color{red}{Q(H^0)}}{\color{blue}{n_\mathrm{H}^2} \color{green}{\alpha_B}} \right)^{1/3},
\end{array}
$$
where in the last step I've called the densities ""the number density of hydrogen"", $\color{blue}{n_\mathrm{H}}$. For instance, an O6.5V star emits $\color{red}{Q(H^0)}=6.6\times10^{48}$ photons per second (Panagia 1973). Typical densities of molecular clouds are $\color{blue}{n_\mathrm{H}}=10^{2\text{–}3}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. The temperatures needed for star formation are $T\sim10^2\,\mathrm{K}$, but once a star has formed, the surroundings will be heated to some $8000\text{–}20\,000\,\mathrm{K}$. With the approximation from Dijkstra (2017)
$$
\color{green}{\alpha_B(T)} = 2.3\times10^{-13}\left(\frac{T}{10^4\mathrm{K}}\right)^{-0.7}\,\mathrm{cm}^3\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}
$$
we can write the characteristic size of the ionized bubble as
$$
R_\mathrm{S} \simeq 10\,\mathrm{lightyears} \times\color{red}{\left(\frac{Q(\mathrm{H}^0)}{10^{50}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}}\right)^{1/3}}
\color{blue}{\left(\frac{n_\mathrm{H}}{300\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}\right)^{-2/3}}
\color{green}{\left(\frac{T}{10^4\,\mathrm{K}}\right)^{0.23}}.
$$ On the other hand, the mean free path $\ell$ of a UV photon is very small:
$$
\ell = \frac{1}{\color{blue}{n_\mathrm{H}}\langle \color{magenta}{\sigma_\mathrm{H}} \rangle},
$$
where $\langle\color{magenta}{\sigma_\mathrm{H}}\rangle$ is the average cross section for photons in the UV range. The cross section has a strong wavelength-dependence:
$$
\color{magenta}{\sigma_\mathrm{H}}(\lambda) = 6.33\times10^{-18}\left(\frac{\lambda}{912\,\mathrm{{Å}}}\right)^3,
$$
and its average hence depends somewhat on how many photons you have at each wavelength (i.e. the spectrum), but e.g. for a $T=4\times10^4\,\mathrm{K}$, you have $\langle\color{magenta}{\sigma_\mathrm{H}}\rangle\simeq3\times10^{-19}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$. With the same typical densities as above, we can write the the transition boundary layer as
$$
\ell \sim 0.01\,\mathrm{lightyears} \, \color{blue}{\left(\frac{n_\mathrm{H}}{300\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}\right)^{-1}}.
$$ In other words, the reason for the sharp transition is that the typical size of the ionized, bluish region is of the order of 1000 times larger than the transition to the neutral, brownish region. Farther away from the ionizing source, the gas is ""self-shielded"". If you have a small region of enhanced density, this will be more efficient at withstanding the ionizing radiation and shielding the neutral gas. In this case you get a ""finger"" of neutral gas extending into the ionized region, as seen in the upper left part of the image. This answer on the Pillars Of Creation discusses the irregular shape in more detail. Note that the above calculations ignore dust and metals, which also absorb light. In the ionized region, dust is exposed to the UV and may be destroyed through sputtering due to collisions with ions, sublimation or evaporation, or even explosions due to the UV radiation. In the image below, I edited in Webb's image in an larger (2º×2º) view of the full Carina Nebula where you can better see how the rather spherical HII region has carved its way out to the surrounding interstellar medium.

"Does the recent news of ""ten times more galaxies"" imply that there is correspondingly less dark matter?","All Conselice et al. (2016) appear to suggest is that when you look at something like the Hubble deep field, there are many faint (and presumably low mass) galaxies that are not seen. This has absolutely no effect on the need for dark matter. The main results are: (i) as you look back in time, the overall (co-moving) density of galaxies (more massive than a million times that of the Sun) increases. (ii) But the density of more massive galaxies actually decreases. This is consistent with hierarchical merger picture where small galaxies merge to become larger galaxies.
This really doesn't have any influence on the need for dark matter. First, the presence of dark matter is inferred from many different observations. Some of these (e.g. galaxy rotation curves) are not influenced at all if there are lots of extra galaxies. Second, the ""missing"" galaxies are at high redshift, not (or not all) in the present day universe, so they cannot significantly affect a calculation of how much normal matter there is in the universe today. Presumably, many of these small galaxies then merge to become larger galaxies and the total mass is conserved. Third, just because there are lots of them does not mean they contain much mass anyway. The ""mass function"" (number density as a function of mass) of galaxies goes roughly as $\phi(M) \propto M^{-1}$ at low masses. This means the mass contained in any interval is
 $$M_{\text{tot}}\propto \int^{M_2}_{M_1} M\phi \ \mathrm{d}M \ = M_2 - M_1$$
So although, low mass galaxies may be ten times more frequent, they are ten times less massive and so don't change the total mass very much. I will need to read the paper more carefully to see if the authors are suggesting that low mass galaxies are much more common in the early universe than was already supposed. Fourth, primordial nucleosynthesis calculations tell us that only 4 per cent (as a fraction of the critical density) of the energy density of the universe is in the form of baryonic mass. Observations of gravitational lensing, cluster dynamics and the cosmic microwave background tell us that the mass density is actually around 30 per cent of the critical density. Thus most of the dark matter is non-baryonic and cannot be in the form of missing faint galaxies, or any other form of normal baryonic matter. "
Was the Milky Way ever a quasar?,"A quasar is simply an active galactic nucleus (AGN) that is viewed from a particular angle; see the picture below, in which quasars are labeled ""QSO"". This is really a remarkable figure because historically all of the names in the figure were thought to correspond to different types of objects, when really they all refer to the same thing!  Your question really shouldn't be ""Was there ever a quasar in the Milky Way?"", since the dotted line in the figure would correspond to the Galactic plane and we would not see Sagittarius A* (the Milky Way's super-massive black hole) from the correct angle. A better question might be, ""Has Sagittarius (Sgr) A* ever been active?"" The answer to that question is yes; according to this page it was probably active (very bright with a jet) about 10,000 years ago. However, at the moment, it isn't really doing anything, since it isn't currently accreting anything (to put it plainly, it isn't eating anything, so it doesn't have enough energy to be active). However, many astronomers (myself included!) are anxiously waiting for a cloud of gas called G2 to fall into Sgr A*. We are hoping that Sgr A* will burp or do something interesting."
Are stars expected to become dimmer before a supernova?,"The connection between the dimming and a putative supernova relies on the interpretation that the decrease in luminosity may be due to circumstellar material, ejected in the years/decades/centuries immediately preceding a supernova. There are several mechanisms that could lead to this sort of mass loss (see slides 24-25), including These then lead to Type IIn supernovae, with narrow lines arising from interactions with the previously ejected circumstellar material. If the dimming is due to extinction by circumstellar dust from eruptions due to any of these mechanisms, it could mean that a supernova is imminent on a timescale of days to years."
Explaining Dark Matter and Dark Energy to layman,"Dark Matter
Your understanding of dark matter isn't bad, but here's a few clarifying details.
Orbits: The speed of an object's orbit is related to 2 things: the radius of its orbit and the mass inside of it. In the solar system, over 99% of the mass is concentrated at the centre, so radius is the dominant effect on orbital speed. As we look at planets further away from the sun, their orbital speed decreases. In the galaxy, it's a similar story, but with increasing orbital radius, you're also getting more and more mass inside of your orbit since the galaxy is full of other stars. Even so, we would expect orbital speeds to drop as you look at objects toward the edge of the galaxy, since the stars get more diffuse as you move out and not enough mass is inside the orbit to compensate for the increasing radius. Instead, we see that after a certain point, the orbital speeds stay the same, suggesting that there is more mass there than we can account for with stars and other visible objects. Here is an example of a so-called rotation curve of the spiral galaxy NGC 3198:
 Without dark matter, we would expect the speed of objects as a function of radius (from the center of mass) to follow the curve labeled 'disk'. However, what we see appears to be the sum of the two contributions (the disk and the 'dark matter halo' which surrounds this disk), which is overplotted with actual data. We also have evidence of this extra mass from gravitational lenses. As light passes by a large object like a galaxy cluster, its path can get bent by that object's gravity. We can see this effect when a galaxy cluster is in front of an even more distant galaxy, the light from the background object gets magnified and distorted. We can calculate the path the light must have taken to appear as we see it, and the mass needed to bend it that way can't be accounted for with just the stars and gas we see in the lensing cluster. This again suggests that there is extra mass that we can't see.   Dark Energy
You're not too far off with this one, with one major distinction: Dark energy is the 'force' that's causing the universe to accelerate its expansion. We expect the universe to be expanding from the Big Bang cosmology model, but we'd expect it to be slowing down as the mutual gravity of everything in the universe acted upon each other. Dark energy appears to be a ""pressure"" on every part of space to expand, but it's very weak and has been dominated by gravity and other factors throughout most of the universe's history. It's only in the past few billion years it's started to take over. It works something like this. Imagine you have a 1-D region of spacetime 1 unit long (just for convenience's sake). Here it is: |--------|
Now this region has this dark energy 'expansion pressure' acting on it. Let's say it's 0.07 units per year per unit. This means that every year, this region of spacetime gets bigger by 7%. In 10 years, the length will be double:
|--------|--------|
Now the thing is, each of these regions has the same expansion pressure as the original one! So both will double in 10 years, and then those will double, and so on. So what happens is you get a small expansion locally, but the further away something gets the faster it's accelerating away from you. The real effect of dark energy is orders of magnitude smaller, something like 67.15 ± 1.2 (km/s)/Mpc (Wikipedia), but it still means that any galaxies more than 4.5 Gigaparsecs away from us are currently being carried away from us faster than the speed of light. (We can still see them right now because the light we see was emitted long before the expansion rate got that high.) The expansion adds up over the huge distances we see in the universe. Dark energy doesn't affect things like planets, solar systems, and galaxies because the effect is so weak on small scales that gravity more than counteracts it. It's effect can mostly be seen over the vast empty stretches of space between galaxy clusters. Hope that helps!"
Escaping a black hole,"One of the clearest way to see what's going on is to look at a Penrose diagram of a Schwarzschild black hole. A Penrose diagram is like a map of the spacetime drawn in such a way as to preserve angles and put the light rays diagonally at $45^\circ$ angles, forming the light cones. Since we're mapping all of an infinite space(time) into a finite drawing, distances are necessarily distorted, but that's a small price to pay.  Time goes up on the diagram, and a typical infalling trajectory is in blue. Because every massive object must be locally slower than light, it must stay within those light cones. Hence, no matter how you accelerate, at every point of your trajectory you must go in a direction that stays within those $45^\circ$ diagonals at that point. But once you're inside the horizon, every direction that stays within the light cones leads to the singularity. Accelerating this way or that just means that you get to choose where you hit the singularity--a little on the left on the diagram or a little to the right. Trying to escape using high acceleration brings you closer to the light's $45^\circ$ lines, which because of time dilation will actually shorten your lifespan. You'll actually get to the singularity sooner if you struggle in that manner. This particular image came from Prof. Andrew Hamilton. Note that it pictures an eternal Schwarzschild black hole, i.e. one that has always and will exist. An actual black hole is formed by stellar collapse and will eventually evaporate, so its diagram will be slightly different (in particular, there will be no ""antihorizon""). However, in all respects relevant here, it's the same situation."
Is the moon moving further away from Earth and closer to the Sun? Why?,"Yes, the moon is moving away from Earth at around 1.48"" per year. According to the BBC: The Moon is kept in orbit by the gravitational force that the Earth exerts on it, but the Moon also exerts a gravitational force on our planet and this causes the movement of the Earth's oceans to form a tidal bulge. Due to the rotation of the Earth, this tidal bulge actually sits slightly ahead of the Moon. Some of the energy of the spinning Earth gets transferred to the tidal bulge via friction. This drives the bulge forward, keeping it ahead of the Moon. The tidal bulge feeds a small amount of energy into the Moon, pushing it into a higher orbit like the faster, outside lanes of a test track. So, tidal forces are ultimately what causes this to happen. Also, there is a Wikipedia article on tidal forces: Tidal acceleration is an effect of the tidal forces between an orbiting natural satellite (e.g. the Moon), and the primary planet that it orbits (e.g. the Earth). The acceleration causes a gradual recession of a satellite in a prograde orbit away from the primary, and a corresponding slowdown of the primary's rotation. The process eventually leads to tidal locking of first the smaller, and later the larger body. The Earth–Moon system is the best studied case."
Black Hole / Hawking Radiation: Why only capture anti-particle?,"I thought that the anti-particle was annihilating with ""normal"" mass inside the black hole? No? No. First, both particles and anti-particles have ""normal"" mass (should they have mass in the first place) and ""normal"" (positive) energy. The distinction between them is either a matter of convention or a question of which type is more common in the universe. Furthermore, for typical-massed blacked holes, the bulk of Hawking radiation would be made of photons, which properly speaking do not even have anti-particles, though one could also say that they are their own anti-particle. Shouldn't both particle and anti-particle have equal chance to be the one to fall in, or just manage to escape? Yes, and uncharged ones do. A smaller black hole would radiate both neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, assuming all neutrinos are massive (otherwise, all black holes would do it already), and a sufficiently small (and thus sufficiently hot) one would radiate both electrons and positrons. Very roughly, a black hole will radiate non-negligible amounts of massive particles when the temperature of the black hole is on the order of the particle mass or greater, in natural units. It seems that there should be an equal chance of either the particle, or the anti-particle, would be captured while the other ""ejected."" Correct, with a minor exception that if a hot black hole has electric charge, it is more likely to radiate particles of the same sign of charge. So it seems that the black hole should be somewhat steady-state as far as mass change with respect to virtual particles. If either a particle or an anti-particle falls into a black hole, its mass will go up. It doesn't matter. Fundamentally, the ""reason"" for Hawking radiation is that the vacuum state in quantum field theory is a state of lowest energy, but different observers can disagree about which state is the vacuum. Thus, since particles are fluctuation on top of the vacuum, they can disagree about whether or not there are particles. I don't think there is a good way to repair the ""antiparticle falls in"" story except some roundabout appeal to energy conservation: if the escaping particle is real and have positive energy, the one that fell in must have negative energy, and would therefore decrease the mass of the black hole. Unfortunately, that only shows what must happen for the situation to be consistent, not that it does actually happen. Although with some knowledge of general relativity, one can motivate this slightly further--e.g., for the Schwarzschild black hole, there is energy conservation given by a Killing vector field, which goes from timelike to spacelike at the horizon--so what an external observer considers time/energy would be space/momentum inside the black hole, and momentum is allowed to be negative."
How long do planetary rings last?,"It appears (and I am no expert) that Saturn's ring evolution is governed mainly by ""viscous spreading"" - collisions between ring particles; and also by interactions with Saturn's moons (resonances); and bombardment with meteoritic material. There appears to be no consensus on how old the ring system is. Most theories of their formation have this taking place early in the life of the solar system, but there are observations that suggest little contamination by meteoritic material and hence that the rings are young. According to Salmon et al. (2010)  the viscosity in the ring is critical to its evolution and therefore estimates of ages and lifetimes. As the disc spreads due to viscosity, the viscosity itself will reduce, slowing the evolution and thus the ring system may not empty for many billions of years. On the other hand, comparing viscous spreading models with the current density profile of Saturn's rings suggests they are much less than a billion years old. However, it should be noted that other authors have used similar models to argue that Saturn's rings did indeed form 4.5 billion years ago and were much more massive (by a factor $>100$) then they are today! (Charnoz et al. 2011)"
"Where does the energy of light go, when it red-shifts?","The problem is that conservation of energy is a slippery concept in General Relativity. There are arguments back and forth but most people accept that conservation of energy is only a local law - it applies only to a local inertial frame and cannot be applied to the universe as a whole. However in an expanding universe it is very difficult to identify any inertial frames and certainly not ones that encompass a cosmologically significant volume. What this means is that if you make a local ""box"" small enough that it is not affected by the expansion of the universe, then energy conservation will apply. But of course in such a box, a photon would enter and leave with the same energy because the box is unaffected by the expansion of the universe and so there would be no redshifting of the photon."
How can I collimate a dobsonian telescope with a laser collimator?,"Note to future answerers: We have been working in the Astronomy.SE main chat room with OP to solve this problem and established it's actually a matter of focusing that resulted in problems described (telescope was either too intrafocal or extrafocal), not collimation itself. This is a video on YouTube that OP said was exactly how the problems looked like. Granted, focusing can be technically called collimation too, and indeed that demonstration video calls it as such (albeit misspelled), since it's still about adjusting positions of primary and secondary mirror in dobsonian or newtonian telescopes (dobsonian is a type of newtonian), but the former is a lot simpler to solve by turning focusing knobs and achieve optimal illumination. Now, let's answer the actual question. Preparing our laser collimation setup First thing to know is that any laser collimator will likely have the beam strong enough to cause damage to your eyes if pointed directly in them, or damage strong light sensitive equipment, like for example digital cameras, so be careful with it and take precautions. Carefully read instructions on how to handle and use it, before you do so. This is how a laser collimator might look like:     Next thing to do is make it functional by inserting batteries or plugging its power adapter and testing it actually works by turning it on with the switch, if it has it (probably does). Once you'll establish your laser collimator is turned on and functioning by observing (usually ruby red) light beam spot it makes on any neutral surface, turn it back off and attach any adapters on it you might need to help you attach it to your telescope's focuser. This is how your telescope's OTA (Optical Tube Assembly) might look like:     Now remove the barlov and eyepiece from your telescope's focuser if you're using a direct focuser adapter for your telescope model, tighten the laser collimator's compression ring by rotating its rubber ring and attach the collimator into the focuser. Rotate collimator's compression rings to tighten it in place. If you're not using an adapter, your laser collimator might attach directly to your eyepiece. Consult your collimator's user manual, if unsure. Rotate your collimator's targeting faceplate towards your telescope's primary mirror (on the telescope's bottom) and turn on the laser. Angular alignment of the secondary mirror By looking into the telescope top down from the secondary (top) mirror into the telescope, we will adjust the angular alignment of the secondary mirror by referencing the laser dot projecting on the primary (bottom) mirror. The secondary mirror's support has a center ring, the collimating cap, with three bolts on the top of the secondary mirror holder. Use Allen wrench or Phillip's screwdriver to rotate them individually to bring the laser dot into the center of the doughnut ring of the primary mirror, like so:     Try to bring the dot more directly into the doughnut center than on the photograph above, though. I intentionally didn't select a photograph from when it was in its dead center, because of the light reflection covering the doughnut ring completely, rendering it nearly invisible. Primary mirror collimation Unlock the primary mirror plate locking screws, position yourself towards the panel side of the primary mirror tube so you can observe the laser's center spot on the targeting faceplate on the collimator and start adjusting collimation screws by turning them gently until the laser dot is in the center of the targeting faceplate:     Another way to check your collimation progress when adjusting collimation screws is by checking the projection laser dots on the secondary (top) mirror and making sure both laser dots are overlapping into one single spot, but that might make your adjustments of the primary mirror somewhat harder, so using the targeting faceplate of the laser collimator would be my suggestion and perhaps check alignment of the secondary mirrors laser dots projection for the last finishing touches to collimate your mirrors as precise as possible. Now you're done collimating your dobsonian or newtonian telescope, so it's time to remove the laser collimator by first switching it off, then untightening its compression ring and taking it out of the focuser. Once you've removed the laser collimator, insert in the focuser barlov and the eyepiece, and tighten them back in place. Additionally, and as requested, here is the Youtube video of the Newtonian Collimation using SCA Laser Collimator that are also the source of the last two example photographs and inspiration to write the collimation procedure, courtesy of HoTechUSA YouTube channel. Make sure to browse through other similar videos on telescope collimation in this same channel. Collimation of a dobsonian without a laser collimator Standard collimation technique for the exact dobsonian telescope make OP mentioned has can be read in this Instruction Manual for Sky-Watcher dobsonians (PDF): Collimation is the process of aligning the mirrors of your  telescope
  so that they work in concert with each other to  deliver properly
  focused light to your eyepiece. By observing  out-of-focus star
  images, you can test whether your  telescope's optics are aligned.
  Place a star in the centre of  the field of view and move the focuser
  so that the image is  slightly out of focus. If the seeing conditions
  are good, you  will see a central circle of light (the Airy disc)
  surrounded by a  number of diffraction rings. If the rings are
  symmetrical about  the Airy disc, the telescope's optics are correctly
  collimated  (Fig.g). If you do not have a collimating tool, we suggest that you  make a
  ""collimating cap"" out of a plastic 35mm film canister  (black with
  gray lid). Drill or punch a small pinhole in the exact  center of the
  lid and cut off the bottom of the canister. This  device will keep
  your eye centered of the focuser tube. Insert  the collimating cap
  into the focuser in place of a regular  eyepiece.  Collimation is a painless process and works like this: Pull off the lens cap which covers the front of the telescope  and
  look down the optical tube. At the bottom you will see the  primary
  mirror held in place by three clips 120º apart, and at  the top the
  small oval secondary mirror held in a support and  tilted 45º toward
  the focuser outside the tube wall (Fig.h). The secondary mirror is
  aligned by adjusting the central bolt  behind it, (which moves the
  mirror up and down the tube),  and the three smaller screws
  surrounding the bolt, (which  adjust the angle of the mirror). The
  primary mirror is adjusted  by the three adjusting screws at the back
  of your scope. The  three locking screws beside them serve to hold the
  mirror in  place after collimation. (Fig.i) Aligning the Secondary Mirror Point the telescope at a lit wall and insert the  collimating cap into
  the focuser in place of a regular  eyepiece. Look into the focuser
  through your collimating  cap. You may have to twist the focus knob a
  few turns  until the reflected image of the focuser is out of your 
  view. Note: keep your eye against the back of the focus  tube if
  collimating without a collimating cap. Ignore the  reflected image of
  the collimating cap or your eye for  now, instead look for the three
  clips holding the primary  mirror in place. If you can't see them
  (Fig.j), it means  that you will have to adjust the three bolts on the
  top of  the secondary mirror holder, with possibly an Allen  wrench or
  Phillip's screwdriver. You will have to  alternately loosen one and
  then compensate for the  slack by tightening the other two. Stop when
  you see all  three mirror clips (Fig.k). Make sure that all three
  small  alignment screws are tightened to secure the  secondary mirror
  in place. Aligning the Primary Mirror There are 3 hex bolts and 3 Phillip's head screws  at the back of your
  telescope, the hex bolts are the  locking screws and the
  Phillip's-head screws are  the adjusting screws (Fig.l). Use an Allen
  wrench  to loosen the hex bolts by a few turns. Now run  your hand
  around the front of your telescope  keeping your eye to the focuser,
  you will see the  reflected image of your hand. The idea here being 
  to see which way the primary mirror is defected,  you do this by
  stopping at the point where the  reflected image of the secondary
  mirror is closest  to the primary mirrors' edge (Fig.m).  When you get
  to that point, stop and keep your  hand there while looking at the
  back end of your  telescope, is there a adjusting screw there? If
  there  is you will want to loosen it (turn the screw to the  left) to
  bring the mirror away from that point. If  there isn't a adjusting
  screw there, then go across  to the other side and tighten the

Why does a planet rotate and revolve?,"As the planets evolve during their protoplanetary stage and accrete materials from the protoplanetary disks, which are gravitationally collapsing interstellar dust and gases, these accreted particles retain some of the angular momentum from the materials they form from and being in constant motion.            Generated image (virtual fly-by) from a simulation of the accretion period of the protoplanetary disk, showing preservation of      angular momentum in the orbit around a Jupiter-size planet, as it clears its neighborhood. (Source: Frédéric Masset) One nice description for this angular momentum preservation, and why the planets appear to rotate faster than their surrounding protoplanetary disk goes like this: Conservation of angular momentum explains why an ice skater spins more
  rapidly as she pulls her arms in. As her arms come closer to her axis
  of rotation, her [rotation] speed increases and her angular momentum remains the
  same. Similarly, her rotation slows when she extends her arms at the
  conclusion of the spin. Source: Scientific American article on Why and how do planets rotate? (George Spagna) So it could be described as this axial rotation of planets resulting in conservation of the angular momentum of the materials in the protoplanetary disk, forming during the accretion period of the planetary system as the protoplanets gain in weight, and preserve this angular momentum due to inertia of their radial velocity."
Why won't the Sun set for days at N66.2 which is below the arctic circle?,"From the PyEphem Quick Reference Guide: Rising and setting are sensitive to atmospheric refraction at the
horizon, and therefore to the observer’s temp and pressure; set the
pressure to zero to turn off refraction. It seems likely that, if you're using the default settings, the result returned is including atmospheric refraction, giving the results you would expect to see at the location, where the sun is visible even though a direct line to the disc of the sun would put it below the horizon.

Where in space would the Earth and Moon appear to be the same size?,"When viewing a sphere of radius $r$ at a distance $d$ from the centre of the sphere, you don't see a circle of radius $r$. The extreme lines of sight are tangents to the sphere, as this diagram illustrates.  A tangent to a sphere or circle makes a right angle to the radius at the point of tangency, so we have 4 similar right triangles. Let the radii of the circles be $r_1, r_2$ and the respective distances from their centres to the origin be $d_1, d_2$, so the (centre to centre) distance between the two circles is $d=d_1+d_2$. Then $$d_1 = \frac{d\cdot r_1}{r_1+r_2}$$
$$d_2 = \frac{d\cdot r_2}{r_1+r_2}$$ and the angular diameter $\theta$ is given by $$\sin\left(\frac\theta2\right) = \frac{r_1}{d_1} = \frac{r_2}{d_2} = \frac{r_1+r_2}{d_1+d_2}$$ Using values from Wikipedia for the radii of the Earth and Moon, and their mean distance, we get with the angular diameter $\theta\approx 2.41734°\approx2°25'$ or $145$ arc-minutes, which is almost $4.6$ times larger than the Moon's mean angular diameter as seen from Earth's surface, which is $31.7'$, although it ranges from $29.3'$ to $34.1'$. The Earth is approximately an ellipsoid, and there are several ways to define the radius of the Earth. In this answer, I'm using the arithmetic mean radius. Another option that makes sense in this context (but not mentioned on that page) is to use a geometric mean radius $\approx6367$ km. A circle of that radius has the same area as a cross-section of the the Earth, in a plane containing the poles, perpendicular to the equator. There's another viewing point behind the Moon, where the Moon just eclipses the Earth. Once again, we get similar right triangles.  Let $s$ be the distance from the viewing point to the Moon's centre, and once again $d$ is the distance from the Earth to the Moon. We have $$\sin\left(\frac\theta2\right) = \frac{r_1}s = \frac{r_2}{d+s}$$
So
$$r_1\cdot d + r_1\cdot s = r_2\cdot s$$
Hence
$$s = \frac{d\cdot r_1}{r_2-r_1}$$ Plugging in the values for the Earth and Moon, we get $s=144133.0$ km, and $\theta\approx1.38134°\approx1°23'$ Those two viewpoints are on the diameter of a circle (actually a sphere) of radius $$q=\frac{d_1\cdot d_2}{d_2-d_1}$$ I'll add a derivation for that below. At all points on that circle the Moon and Earth have equal angular size.  As in the previous diagrams, the Moon & Earth circles are blue. The radii are approximately in their correct ratio in this diagram, but the distance between them is (of course) radically reduced, which magnifies the angular size. The large purple circle is the circle of radius $q$, the small pale purple circle makes it a bit easier to see that the angles are equal. Let $M=(-d_1, 0)$ be the centre of the Moon and $E=(d_2, 0)$ be the centre of the Earth, as in the top diagram. We want to find points $P=(x,y)$ such that
$$\sin(\theta/2)=r_1/PM=r_2/PE$$ That is,
$$d_2^2((x+d_1)^2+y^2)=d_1^2((x-d_2)^2+y^2)$$
$$d_2^2(x^2+2d_1x+d_1^2+y^2)=d_1^2(x^2-2d_2x+d_2^2+y^2)$$
$$d_2^2x^2+2d_1d_2^2x+d_1^2d_2^2+d_2^2y^2=d_1^2x^2-2d_1^2d_2x+d_1^2d_2^2+d_1^2y^2$$
$$(d_2^2-d_1^2)x^2+2d_1d_2(d_1+d_2)x+(d_2^2-d_1^2)y^2=0$$
$$x^2+2\left(\frac{d_1d_2}{d_2-d_1}\right)x+y^2=0$$
$$\left(x+\frac{d_1d_2}{d_2-d_1}\right)^2+y^2=\left(\frac{d_1d_2}{d_2-d_1}\right)^2$$
Let
$$q=\frac{d_1d_2}{d_2-d_1}$$
Thus
$$(x+q)^2+y^2=q^2$$
which is a circle centred at $(-q, 0)$ with radius $q$. Note that
$$\frac1q = \frac1{d_1}-\frac1{d_2}$$
If $d_1=d_2$ then $q$ goes to infinity, and the circle degenerates to the vertical line $x=0$, i.e., the Y axis. Using the previous values of $d_1$ & $d_2$, $q\approx113249.4$ km. I should mention that these calculations assume the the Earth and Moon are perfect spheres, separated by a constant distance. In reality, none of those things are true, so the true angular sizes of the Earth and Moon are a little different to what I've calculated above. As ProfRob says, the Earth isn't a perfect sphere. It's slightly flattened at the poles, with a flattening factor of $f\approx 1/298.25642$. The Moon is also flattened, but much less than the Earth ($f\approx 1/830$), due to its much slower rate of axial rotation. Also, the orbit of the Moon & Earth about their barycentre is moderately eccentric, with a mean value of $\varepsilon\approx 0.0549$, and the eccentricity changes depending on the distance to the Sun. Here's a daily plot of the Earth-Moon distance for 2020, produced using Horizons. "
Does this smartphone photo show Mars just below the Sun?,"That is a camera artefact caused by the bright sunlight reflecting within the lens on your phone. It’s more pronounced than on a large camera because of the small lens size. This is a secondary image of the sun, as the brightness of the source allows for the reflection to be still intense enough to be detected.  Here is a photo I took with the same artefact. It appears for me as a cyan dot with a magenta outside, but other photos I’ve taken have one with the same colour as the sun.  Notice if you zoom in on yours, there’s a halo around the artefact as well. Also notice that the artefact is directly below the sun in my image, whereas in yours it’s slightly to the left. However, this is because in your image the sun is slightly to the right, and hitting the lens at an angle. As uhoh says, you can see that the sun is the same distance from the centre of the image as the lens flare (or very close to):  It should be possible to take a photo with the artefact wherever you want, by re-angling the phone - including inside the sun, where it will be drowned out. I actually took my phone into an Apple Store to find out what this was, where they explained the lens flair effect. Unfortunately I don’t have a source for this, as it was in person. Hopefully the above is convincing enough."
Where is it possible to observe the Moon for 24 hours?,"Estimate at what latitudes it is possible to observe the Moon for at
least 24 hours. This will depend on the Moon's maximum declination, which varies with a period of 18.6 years (see lunar standstill). During a minor lunar standstill, the declination is 18.134° at most, during a major lunar standstill, it's 28.725° at most. I wrote a small program to plot the position of the moon every half hour, during a year. Here's the polar diagram (azimuth + elevation) for 2015, as seen from the Equator. It was during the last minor standstill, so the moon was close to the celestial equator:  and the same diagram, for 2025. It will be the next major standstill, so the moon will have a much wider range:  This diagram is convenient, because you can directly see the required latitude if you want to see the moon for a whole day: it's the lowest elevation when the moon crosses the meridian. In 2015, you'd need to be at least at 72° latitude (90° - minor lunar standstill):  And in 2025, you could be lower, at about 62° (90° - major lunar standstill):  In 2025, at 72°, you'd have many days during which the moon is visible for 24h:  But in 2015, at 62°, you'd have none:  The diagrams would have the exact same shape in the southern hemisphere, but flipped vertically. For reference, the program was written in INSEL, which is similar to Simulink:  The diagram was created with Gnuplot: On the morning of 4th of April 2025, at 62°N, the moon will be visible due north, ready for a complete rotation above the horizon.  As on the 3rd of October 2015, at 72.5°N: "
Would an object shot from earth fall into the sun?,"Assume that a spacecraft is instantaneously accelerated at the Earth's surface (disregarding the atmosphere for simplicity). We'll consider this from the Sun's reference frame; in other words, the Sun is stationary and the Earth is moving around it. The spacecraft is accelerated to a velocity which is precisely equal and opposite to the orbital velocity of the Earth around the Sun, making it completely stationary in the instant after the acceleration. What happens next? Well, we can consider the forces acting on the spacecraft: The stationary spacecraft is therefore going to accelerate towards the Earth and towards the Sun. Since the Earth is moving away quickly on its orbital path, the gravitational force is not enough to pull the spacecraft back into an Earth orbit; however, it will nudge the spacecraft into an elliptical orbit. To demonstrate the situation, I have created a small simulation which can be viewed in a desktop browser. Click here to try the simulation. (You can click ""View this program"" to check the code, and refresh the page to restart the simulation.) The simulation is physically accurate (ignoring the effects of other planets), but the spheres have been enlarged for easy interpretation. The Earth is represented as green, while the Sun is orange and the spacecraft is white. Note that, while the spheres representing the spacecraft and Sun intersect, the distance between the two physical objects is always larger than 3.35 solar radii. This screenshot shows how the spacecraft has been pulled into an elliptical orbit by the Earth:  Finally, we could consider a more realistic scenario where the spacecraft is accelerated until it reaches zero velocity (again, in the Sun's reference frame) at a certain distance from the Earth. At the instant it reaches zero velocity, the engine is stopped.  In this case, the result is essentially the same: there are still forces exerted by the Earth and the Sun, so an elliptical orbit will result. The further the rocket is from the Earth when it reaches zero velocity, the more elliptical the orbit. If the Earth is so far away that its gravity is negligible, the spacecraft will fall directly towards the Sun."
"Why doesn't the IAU definition of ""Planet"" disqualify Mercury and Venus as planets?","You are citing a paper that has been cited only six times in the peer reviewed scientific literature since it was published in 1984, which was almost 40 years ago. One of those six citations was a self-citation. Papers that are as resoundingly under-cited as that are not definitive. With that, the ""hydrostatic equilibrium"" aspect of what makes a planet a ""planet"" simply is not well-defined. The cited paper definitely is not definitive. The bottom line from the cited paper should not be that Mercury and Venus are far from hydrostatic equilibrium. The bottom line one should deduce from that paper is that the metric used in that paper is not a good metric for hydrostatic equilibrium, and hence the low citation rate. It is hard to find any paper that is definitively accepted as defining a good parameter regarding hydrostatic equilibrium. Mercury and Venus are very slow rotators and are close to the Sun, and hence subject to tidal forces. These get in the way of establishing a good metric. The Earth is still recovering from the glaciation that ended about 12000 years ago. Moreover, there are signs that parts of former tectonic plates have dived almost to the core mantle boundary. The Earth is not in hydrostatic equilibrium. The Moon and Mars also are not in hydrostatic equilibrium. There are fast rotators such as Haumea that are triaxial in shape. This makes little sense from a naive hydrostatic equilibrium point of view. As an aside, Mike Brown, the discoverer of Haumea, was one of the key killers of Pluto as a planet. Mike Brown proudly uses @plutokiller as his Twitter username. ""Hydrostatic equilibrium"" is not a good metric unless one uses ""approximately in hydrostatic equilibrium"" as a rather fuzzy qualifier. Regarding the other two attributes: Orbiting the Sun is well-defined, okay, but wow. That means there are eight planets in the entire universe. All of the exoplanets that have been discovered to date are not ""planets."" However, this part of the definition completely bypasses several potential problems: The ""clearing the neighboring"" concept also is well-defined; there are multiple metrics that agree that the gap between the eight planets and the myriad non-planets is a huge multiple order of magnitude gap. We don't know whether this applies outside the solar system. It probably doesn't apply for newly formed star systems, but it probably does apply for star systems more than a few hundred million years old. Almost all of the exoplanets orbiting stars other than the Sun would most likely qualify as planets were it not for the ""planets orbit the Sun"" clause. One of the chief proponents of the ""clearing the neighborhood"" qualification, Mike Brown (mentioned above) used as evidence for the proposed demotion of Pluto's status a previously written paper by one of the key opponents of the ""clearing the neighborhood"" qualification, Alan Stern, who is the chief scientist for the New Horizons spacecraft that flew by Pluto and is continuing to this day. Two other papers were also used, all showing a huge gap between Mars and Pluto. That paper by Stern found a parameter with a vast six order magnitude gap between Mars and Pluto. In that paper, Stern proposed that the eight objects in the solar system that have ""cleared their neighborhood"" using his own parameter be called überplanets while the lesser objects that still appear to be round-ish be called unterplanets. The IAU decided to call them planets and dwarf planets, with the exception that moons did not qualify as either a planet or dwarf planet. Dwarf planets must be objects that orbit the Sun as opposed to orbiting a planet or dwarf planet. Stern's proposal would have designated some of the larger moons as unterplanets."
How was Trappist-1 discovered?,"The star at the center of TRAPPIST-1 is called 2MASS J23062928-0502285.  It was discovered by the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS), which imaged the whole sky in the infrared between 1997 and 2001.  This resulted in a catalog of over 300 million objects.  TRAPPIST-1 itself was cataloged in 1999.  The name is actually its coordinates in right ascension and declination. The planets of the TRAPPIST-1 were discovered by the method of transit photometry.  The way this works is a telescope watches a star for a period of time and records the amount of light coming from the star.  They chart how much light is coming from the star as a function of time, creating a light curve.  If they see periodic dips in the intensity from the star, there is a high likelihood that that star has a planet in orbit around it.  The planet blocks the light from the star every time it passes between us and the star.  This causes the dips in the light curve.  One advantage to this method is that you can scan multiple stars in the same field of view, analyzing them all for planets. By measuring how long it takes planets to pass in front of the star, how much light it blocks, and how often they orbit, scientists can calculate the masses of these planets and how far away from the star they are by using Kepler's laws of motion.   TRAPPIST-1 was initially determined to have planets orbiting it by the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope - South team.  From their data they determined that it had at least 3 planets.  One of these planets was in the habitable zone of the star.  They published their results in the journal Nature in May 2016. Once TRAPPIST had determined that the system had planets around it, NASA trained the Spitzer Space Telescope on it.  Ground-based observations of Trappist-1 are difficult because it is so dim.  Spitzer, an infrared telescope, made more precise measurements of the light curves and determined that there were at least 7 planets in orbit around it, 3 of which were in the habitable zone.  Additional observations were made by numerous other telescopes including the Very Large Telescope, UKIRT, the Liverpool Telescope, and the William Herschel Telescope.  The results were also published in Nature. 
Here's an image showing the light curve of the TRAPPIST-1 system as measured by Spitzer."
"How do we know that a comet passed by earth 50,000 years ago?","50000 years is the comet's estimated orbital period. That does not necessarily mean that the comet was naked-eye visible from Earth 50000 years ago. That also does not necessarily mean that the comet last came close to the Earth's orbit (as opposed to the Earth) 50000 years ago. The 50000 years is an estimate based on nine months or so of observation time. In addition, the comet's orbit might have been perturbed in the time between its last perihelion passage and the current one. This might even be the comet's first visit to the inner solar system. From NPR's A bright green comet may be visible with the naked eye starting later this month (admittedly yet another pop-sci article), ""If C/2022 E3 has ever passed through the solar system before, it would have last been seen in the sky more than 10,000 years ago,"" says Jon Giorgini, a senior analyst at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Note well: This admittedly is yet another pop-sci article. However, NPR has a JPL expert who says it is it least 10000 years ago (if ever) that the comet last visited the inner solar system rather than 50000 years ago. This article is fairly recent. NPR did their research well; they went to an expert from JPL. Determining the orbit of a long-period comet is highly non-trivial. We have nine months worth of partial observations (mostly azimuth and elevation, which have significant measurement errors, even from the best observatories) of a comet with a suppose 50000 year period. If true, that 9 month interval is 15 millionths of the comet's orbit. That simply is not a long enough of an arc to perform precise orbit determination. To make matters worse, those long-period comets necessarily travel well beyond Pluto's orbit. At those distances, the entire inner solar system out to Neptune gravitationally act essentially as a single body located at the solar system barycenter. Inside Neptune's orbit, it's better (from an orbital element perspective) to look at objects as orbiting the Sun with the planets as perturbations. There are now articles saying the comet will never return. That's because using JPL's Horizons to provide osculating orbital elements yields an eccentricity slightly greater than one -- in heliocentric coordinates. Osculating elements can be deceiving, particularly so for long-period comets. Bottom line: There is no telling if the 50000 year value is anywhere close to correct. Take popular science articles with a grain of salt."
"In a planetary system close to the galactic core, would it be possible to see the supermassive black hole?","If the black hole is active, meaning it is still capturing matter from its surrounding, it will have a large accretion disk all around, which is the only way to dissipate angular momentum for the matter falling into it.  As a result of this dissipation all the matter will warm up and emit radiation. This disc will be fairly large and thus clearly visible as a bright object in the sky. This page shows an image captured by Hubble of such a disk:
 Strictly speaking then, one cannot see directly the black hole, as its view will be covered by the bright emission of the disk. However, the presence of the disk will allow to observe the black hole thanks to its gravitational effect."
Why does electron degeneracy pressure not stop massive star collapse?,"You have the wrong idea about degeneracy pressure. There is no limit in principle on how closely together you can squeeze electrons (or other fermions) and at no point is the Pauli Exclusion Principle violated. All that happens is that their RMS momentum must increase - in accordance with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Thus, the more densely you pack the electrons, the higher becomes their average momentum and it is this momentum that leads to ""degeneracy pressure"". Why then are ""neutron stars"" not held up by electron degeneracy pressure? The answer is because they are (mostly) made of neutrons! The composition of a compact object will itself be density dependent. The reason for this is that the matter will attempt to convert itself into whatever form has the minimum energy density, where energy in this case includes the rest mass of the constituents and their kinetic energy. In the cases of white dwarfs and the cores of massive stars that are supported by electron degeneracy pressure, once the density reaches a threshold, the most energetic electrons are capable of ""neutronising"" the protons in the gas (there must be an equal number of protons for charge neutrality). The electrons combine with the protons to form neutrons. In both cases, the removal of free electrons means that electron degeneracy pressure does not increase as the star becomes denser - an unstable situation that can lead to collapse or possibly to a thermonuclear explosion (in the case of a white dwarf when the density becomes high enough to trigger pycnonuclear reactions). Note that it is possible for a white dwarf to collapse to a neutron star (see https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/25907/2531 ); the fate of massive white dwarfs and whether they collapse or blow-up is a complex problem (see https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/14747/2531). During the collapse, temperatures become so hot that photons have enough energy t break up any nuclei and produce a gas that is mostly neutrons with about 1% protons and electrons. The collapse may be arrested by the combined effects of neutron degeneracy pressure (those occurs at higher densities than for electrons, because neutrons are much more massive) and strong nuclear force repulsion once the neutrons are separated by $\sim 10^{-15}$m. The electrons (and protons) are also degenerate, but because of their low densities (still much denser than in a white dwarf!) compared with the neutrons, they are a minor contributor to the pressure."
Are there any old/ancient star maps that we can compare to today’s and see drastic differences?,"In practice, you're probably not going to get anything useful from ancient star maps, for several reasons: What you can potentially use are ancient catalogs with numerical coordinates of stars. This is what Edmund Halley did in the early 1700s, when he compared modern measurements of the positions of stars against their coordinates from the catalogs of Hipparchus, Timocharus, and Ptolemy, and argued that Sirius, Aldebaran, and Arcturus were all shifted by various offsets (15 to 31 arc minutes) compared to their positions 1800 years ago or so. (He also pointed out that in Tycho Brahe's catalog, finished in 1598, Sirius was about 2 arc minutes north of where it was now, indicating the stellar motion had been continuous.) See Aitken 1942 for a reproduction of Halley's 1718 publication. The cumulative proper motions of Sirius, Arcturus, and Aldebaran over the last 2000 years amount to something like half to a full diameter of the moon, so if you had an accurate map from 2000 years ago, you could probably notice the difference (though it would be relatively subtle). But, again, I don't think such a map exists."
Can you see something active in the sky apart from satellites? Can there be amateur time-domain astronomy?,"If it moves or flashes it isn't astronomy, it is meteorology or technology. There are only a few exceptions to this:  Meteors are an atmospheric phenomenon, and a meteor will appear to move rapidly across the sky. But because they ""come from space"" and occur well above the clouds they are often considered to be part of astronomy. As you note, eclipses and occultations happen quickly enough for the changes to be visible. The moons of Jupiter do move notably during the night, and when one moves into or out of shadow, it can appear or disappear over the course of a couple of minutes: easily noticeable. A supernova could brighten quickly enough for the variation to be visible over a night's observation:  You wouldn't see it suddenly appear, but over the course of a night it could appear brighter at the end of the night than at the beginning. Similarly, Algol will fade from magnitude 2 to 3.5 over a few hours. It isn't quick enough to notice the change in the moment, but it is quite clear if you are observing over a few hours. Pulsars are too dim to be seen with normal equipment even the bright nearby crab pulsar has a magnitude of 16.5 (and at one flash in 33 milliseconds, it is too quick to see by eye) GRB 080319B was an exceptional object. It was a gamma-ray burst. It gave a flash of gamma rays that lasted a little over a minute.  If you had happened to know exactly where to look you could, (marginally with the naked eye, but easily with binoculars) have seen the optical counterpart to the gamma-ray burst.  This was created by the formation as a massive early star collapsed to a black hole producing a jet of energy that happened to point our way. The sun is changing and on a small scale it does change on the scale of minutes, but it is hard to see any movement at that scale with basic equipment.  If you can get your hands on a Hydrogen-alpha solar telescope you will, be able to see prominances that change over a period of hours. Rarely an asteroid will pass so close so as to be visible.  Apopsis will have a close approach in 2029 and will appear as a slowly moving star. Jupiter is active at radio frequencies.  You can tune in to Jupiter with the right equipment and hear it changing at rates from a few fractions of a second to a few seconds, see e.g. radiosky.com > Jupiter Central These are exceptions.  In general, it is rare for anything so big and powerful that it can be seen over a distance of many light-years to be able to change fast enough that those changes can be noticed by our eyes."
Was this an astronomical phenomenon observed in 1689?,"This is a really interesting question!  One thing to note is that since it appeared in the northeast at sunset, it is nowhere near the sun - in fact, it is pretty much in the opposite direction as the setting sun.  In the winter in the north, the sun would set in the southwest.  And regarding your comment about the text describing the event as ""around sunset"" when it would have been 45 minutes later, I think that's not surprising - at northern latitudes in the winter, around the winter solstice, the path of the sun is at a very oblique angle to the horizon, so twilight lasts quite a long time.  So it could easily feel like ""sunset"" for an hour or more.  Though the sun set at 3:15 PM as you note, at 4:00 PM the sun would still only be 5.3 degrees below the horizon, so civil twilight had not yet ended. Plus, no one in those days was wearing a wristwatch, so a given observer's estimate of time of a particular event may have been less precise than we would be accustomed to now. So, my best guess is that this might have been related to anticrepuscular rays.  Pros and cons for this hypothesis: Pros: Cons: Another thought I had, which looks very similar in appearance, but is in completely the wrong direction, is a sun pillar, combined with a stratus cloud, like this (from here):  The appearance is striking, but (a) it would have to be in the sunset direction, and (b) there would have to be clouds.  So it doesn't seem to quite work. I also thought of the moon, and whether that could give something similar, e.g. if it was just below the horizon.  But that doesn't quite work, either.  I did some calculations, and the moon was 38% full that day (waxing crescent, one day short of first quarter).  At 4:00 PM (assuming that the location is UTC+1 hour), the moon would have been 23 degrees above the horizon, at an azimuth of 161 degrees, i.e. low in the south-southeast.  So that doesn't seem like it would contribute much to something in the northeast. So clearly I don't have a definitive answer, but maybe something here will be helpful or give others some ideas."
Could light be dark matter?,"Dark matter, is just a name for something we know nothing of. It was named to account for an extra gravity source for which there have been indirect observations, but yet we cannot explain. The force of gravity exerted by light is negligibly small yet we have measured the gravitational pull of Dark Matter to be big enough to affect whole galaxies; it is what binds galaxies together.  Furthermore, we have included everything we can observe (all ordinary matter including photons) when we do the calculations for the amount of gravity there should be. So light is already there. 'Dark matter' is that extra gravity which we cannot account for."
Why would it be very light out at 3 AM?,"I come from a similar latitude and enjoyed the night skies and two things that can add to ""the amount of light in the sky"" that I can think of. The first is the near-full moon as mentioned above, and the second is unusually low clouds. Being near Toronto and outlying communities, there is a great deal of light produced, and some goes up. On nights when the clouds or even semi-transparent haze are present and unusually low, they can reflect light pollution more often than normal. Add to that the light from the Moon and it should be enough. The reason I mention latitude is that when the ground is covered in white, reflective snow, the light pollution is even worse; lights projected preferentially downward are more strongly reflected back upwards. I don't know if there's any snow on the ground still there; I haven't seen snow in way too many years. Since you didn't mention that your brother noted the full Moon, I'm guessing it was cloudy and so they didn't see it. So I'm guessing that instead they saw clouds or haze lit by it and/or by local light pollution."
How bright would the sun appear from the hypothetical Planet Nine proposed by Caltech?,"Between $1/40,000$ and $1/8,000,000$ of the brightness as seen from Earth, depending on what the actual orbit would turn out to be, and where the planet is in its $15,000$ year orbit period. Brightness drops as $\dfrac{1}{r^2}$ with distance from the light source. Earth is at $1~\textrm{AU}.$ The theoretical planet is at $200~\textrm{AU}$ when it's closest to the sun, and up to $2800~\textrm{AU}$ at the point furthest from the sun at the upper end of the estimated orbit. So e.g. $1/200^2 = 1/40,000$ of the brightness (luminance) as seen from Earth. For how a human would experience it, we can convert to exposure value as used in photography: The difference in exposure value (photographic 'stops') is $\log 2$ of the luminance ratio, so we would have $15$ to $23$ stops less light than on Earth. 
Sunny noon on Earth is $15~\textrm{EV}.$  So the brightness at noon on the planet surface would be: At $200~\textrm{AU},$ planet orbit is closest to the sun: About $0~\textrm{EV},$ roughly the same as a dimly lit interior $400~\textrm{AU},$ lower bound on semi-major axis: $-2 ~\textrm{EV},$ similar to a landscape lit by the full moon $1500~\textrm{AU},$ upper bound on semi-major axis: $-6~\textrm{EV},$ similar to landscape lit by a quarter moon $2800~\textrm{AU},$ upper bound on aphelion (the point on orbit most distant from the sun): $-8~\textrm{EV}.$ This would be dark, but you would probably still see enough to avoid running into things."
Could there be dark matter black holes?,"The problem with trying to form a black hole with dark matter is that dark matter can only weakly interact (if at all) with normal matter and itself, other than by gravity. This poses a problem. To get dark matter concentrated enough to form a black hole requires it to increase its (negative) gravitational binding energy without at the same time increasing its internal kinetic energy by the same amount. This requires some sort of dissipative interaction between dark matter and normal matter (or itself). The following scenario should make this clear. Suppose we have a lump of dark matter that gravitationally attracts another lump of dark matter. As the two approach each other, they accelerate and gain kinetic energy. The kinetic energy gained will be exactly enough to then separate them to a similar degree to which they started, unless some dissipative process takes place. An example is to suppose that dark matter is weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). WIMPs are gravitationally drawn towards the centres of stars. If the weak interactions happen sufficiently frequently then it might be possible for them to accumulate in stars, rather than shoot through and out the other side. It has been hypothesised that black holes could be made like this near the centre of a Galaxy, seeded by dense neutron stars. The density of neutron star matter, combined with the enhanced density of dark matter near galaxy centres could result in dark matter accumulation in the neutron stars, leading to the formation of black holes. Once a black hole is formed then any dark matter that enters the event horizon cannot emerge regardless of what kinetic energy it gains in the process. However, there is still a problem. Material in orbit around a black hole has less angular momentum the closer it orbits. To pass inside the event horizon requires the dark matter to lose angular momentum. Normal matter does this via an accretion disc that can transport angular momentum outwards by viscous torques, allowing matter to accrete. Dark matter has almost zero viscosity so this can't happen. So building a supermassive black hole from a smaller seed would be difficult, but forming small black holes out of neutron stars might be easier. It has been proposed that a relative lack of pulsars observed towards our own Galactic centre could be due to this process. "
Why is Venus's atmospheric pressure 75 times that of earth when carbon dioxide is only 1.5 times heavier than air?,"Venus's atmosphere is very dense at the surface because Venus's atmosphere is very massive. The composition is nearly irrelevant. The pressure at Venus's surface is proportional to the mass of Venus's atmosphere and inversely proportional to Venus's surface area. The constant of proportionality is Venus's surface gravitational acceleration: $P \approx g_\text{Venus} \frac{m}{A}$. (I used $\approx$ rather than = because corrections are needed for Venus's uneven surface and to account for Venus being more or less spherical as opposed to a flat plane.) That said, $P \approx g_\text{Venus} \frac{m}{A}$, or $m \approx \frac {PA}{g_\text{Venus}}$ is a very good approximation. What this means based on observations of Venus's surface pressure, surface area, and surface gravity is that Venus's atmosphere is very massive compared to that of the Earth. Regarding the Venera and Vega landers not being crushed, it was the high surface temperature rather than the high surface pressure that did them in. People have built vessels that have descended to the bottom of the Challenger Deep, where the pressure is 1000 atmospheres. Compare that with the 93 atmospheres Venus's surface. Nuclear submarines operate at one atmosphere so as to be able to rise to the surface quickly, which means they can indeed be crushed by pressure at a sufficient depth. The Venera and Vega landers didn't operate under those constraints."
Was Earth closer to Europa on 1983-11-25 or 1985-07-22?,"tl;dr Miki Sudo Using JPL's SPICE toolkit, I computed the positions of Earth and Europa for the times in question.    On 1983-Nov-25, Earth and Europa are 935.2 million km apart, while 1985-Jul-22, they are 612.5 million km apart. Miki Sudo wins by 323 million km, given the assumed date for her birthday. If we don't trust famousbirthdays.com for Sudo's birthday, but assume it was still sometime in 1985, she still wins.
 In fact, it turns out Joey Chesnut was born at a time when Earth was close to its farthest point from Europa, so he's fairly unlikely to ever win in this tiebreaker:

Will Saturn's rings become a moon?,"The answer to the headline question is: No. Most of Saturn's rings are below the Roche limit of about 2.5 Saturn radii. Hence tidal forces will prevent that part of the rings to form a (large) moon. Actually, part of the rings may be caused by loss of material from some of Saturn's moons, as suspected from observations of Enceladus. Accretion of Earth is still going on. So any number between millions of years and billions of years of accretion time for a planet can be justified.
Half of Earth's mass should have accreted within 10 million years, see this paper."
What equation tells you how far in space you can go from a point and return?,"Let $a(t)$ be the cosmic expansion factor. Let $x$ be a comoving coordinate, so two objects (like galaxies) that are separating solely due to the expansion of the universe have a constant separation in $x$. Since comoving distances are $a$ times physical distances, light covers comoving distance $x$ at the rate $\mathrm{d}x/\mathrm{d}t=c/a(t)$, where $c$ is the speed of light. So between times $t_1$ and $t_2$, light covers comoving distance
$$
\Delta x = c\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\frac{\mathrm{d}t}{a(t)}.
\tag{1}\label{eq1}
$$
Note that this is essentially the same as the calculation of the particle horizon, just for arbitrary starting and ending times. We can also rewrite this expression as
$$
\Delta x = c\int_{a_1}^{a_2}\frac{\mathrm{d}a}{a^2 H(a)},
\tag{2}\label{eq2}
$$
where $a_1=a(t_1)$ and $a_2=a(t_2)$. This form is usually more convenient because according to the concordance model of cosmology,
$$
H(a) = H_0\sqrt{\Omega_m a^{-3}+\Omega_r a^{-4}+\Omega_\Lambda},
\tag{3}\label{eq3}
$$
where $H_0\simeq 68~\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, $\Omega_m\simeq 0.31$, $\Omega_r\simeq 9.1\times 10^{-5}$, and $\Omega_\Lambda\simeq 0.69$ (e.g. Planck 2018). Here we adopt the convention that $a=1$ today. To convert between expansion factors $a$ and times $t$, you simply use
$$
t = \int_0^a \frac{\mathrm{d}a^\prime}{a^\prime H(a^\prime)}.
\tag{4}\label{eq4}
$$ We now have all the necessary tools to carry out the calculation you seek. You want to travel to a distant point that is receding with the Hubble flow of the expanding universe and return. This means you are traveling to and from an object that lies at a constant comoving distance. Let's say that distance is $d$. Assuming your journey starts today ($a=1$), you will arrive at the target when $a=a_d$, where
$$
d = c\int_{1}^{a_d}\frac{\mathrm{d}a}{a^2 H(a)}.
\tag{5}\label{eq5}
$$
Here we assume you travel at essentially light speed. To make the round trip, just double the distance $d$. The corresponding time is straightforwardly evaluated using equation \eqref{eq4}. Note that you will need to integrate and solve these expressions numerically. For sufficiently large $d$, you will find that equation \eqref{eq5} has no solution. That means the target is so far that the journey is impossible. You can safely neglect radiation ($\Omega_r=0$) when considering the present time and the future. This lets you integrate equations \eqref{eq2} and \eqref{eq4} analytically in terms of known special functions (e.g. hypergeometric functions). However, you still have to solve them numerically. To do things fully analytically, you want to also neglect matter ($\Omega_m=0$). Then $H(a)=\sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda}H_0\simeq (17~\text{billion years})^{-1}$, so equations \eqref{eq2} and \eqref{eq4} become
$$
\Delta x = \frac{c}{H_0\sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda}}
\left(\frac{1}{a_1}-\frac{1}{a_2}\right)
\tag{7}\label{eq7}
$$
and
$$
t = t_0 + \frac{\log a}{H_0\sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda}},
\tag{8}\label{eq8}
$$
respectively, where $t_0$ is the time today. It then takes time
$$
\Delta t(d) = \frac{1}{H_0\sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda}}\log\left(\frac{1}{1-H_0\sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda}d/c}\right)
\tag{9}\label{eq9}
$$
to cover the comoving distance $d$. Notice how this time diverges as $d$ approaches $c/(H_0\sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda})\simeq 17$ billion light years. If $d\geq c/(H_0\sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda})$, then the trip is impossible. As an example, suppose you want to travel to a galaxy 5 billion light years away. To get there, we set $d=5$ billion light years, which implies $H_0\sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda}d/c \simeq 5/17$. Thus the trip takes
$$
\Delta t\simeq (17~\text{billion years})\log\left(\frac{1}{1-5/17}\right)\simeq 6~\text{billion years}.
$$
To get there and return, we instead set $d=10$ billion light years, which implies $H_0\sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda}d/c \simeq 10/17$. Then the round trip takes
$$
\Delta t\simeq (17~\text{billion years})\log\left(\frac{1}{1-10/17}\right)\simeq 15~\text{billion years},
$$
meaning the return trip alone takes $15-6=9$ billion years. These are times in the frame of a comoving observer, like (approximately) the Earth or the target. In the frame of the traveler, arbitrarily little time can pass if they travel arbitrarily close to light speed. Also, if the traveler always moves at some fixed slower-than-light speed with respect to their immediate surroundings, then just replace $c$ with that speed. Note that this kind of motion is accelerated, since the motion of the immediate surroundings changes as you move (due to cosmic expansion). The acceleration required is typically tiny, though. To maintain a speed of $0.99c$, only about $10^{-8}~\mathrm{m/s^2}$ of acceleration is needed. Uniform $9.8~\mathrm{m/s^2}$ acceleration would maintain a speed that is slower than $c$ by about one part in $10^{21}$."
Maximum spin rate of a black hole?,"Since I like math, let's throw some math into this. I'll try to keep it as simple as possible though. A rotating black hole is known as a Kerr Black Hole (named after Roy Kerr who found the numerical solution to GR equations for rotating black holes). In the case of a rotating black hole, there are two important parameters used to describe the black hole. The first is of course the mass of the black hole $M$. The second is the spin $a$. Really $a$ isn't the spin itself $-$ it's defined by $a=J/M$ (see footnote) where $J$ is the angular momentum of the black hole $-$ but it's a good proxy for spin so often you'll see scientists get lazy and just call it the spin of the black hole. The mathematics will tell you that Kerr black holes have the limitation that $$0 \le a/M \le 1$$ Black Hole Event Horizon The important parameter we want to calculate is the black hole's radius. If you run through the math, you find that this radius is given by $$r_e = M+(M^2-a^2)^{1/2}$$ In the case when $a/M=0$ (and thus $a=0$), this reduces to just $r_e=2M$, or in regular units (instead of geometrized units) $r_e=2GM/c^2$. Hopefully you can see that this just reduces to the normal Schwarzchild radius for a non-rotating black hole and thus the equation above is a generalization to account for spin. Let's look at the other limit when $a/M=1$ (and thus $a=M$). In this case, you find that the radius is $r_e=M$. When $a/M=1$, you have a maximally rotating black hole, and your radius is half the normal Schwarzchild radius of a non-rotating black hole. This equation defines the radius of the Event Horizon, the point after which there is no returning from the black hole. Ergosphere As it turns out, when you define your equation to calculate the radius of the black hole, there are actually multiple solutions! The section above shows one such solution, but there's another important solution as well. This radius, sometimes called the static limit is given by the equation $$r_{s} = M+\left(M-a^2\cos^2(\theta)\right)^{1/2}$$ Notice that this is almost exactly the same as above, except for that extra $\cos^2(\theta)$. This defines a different, slightly larger and somewhat ""pumpkin-shaped"" horizon which encompasses the inner Event Horizon defined above. The region between this outer horizon and the inner horizon is known as the Ergosphere. Without getting into the nitty gritty details, I'll just say that one important point about the Ergosphere is that anything inside it (that is, $r_e<r<r_s$) must rotate exactly with the black hole - it is physically impossible to stay still here! They stopped short of saying that the tangential velocity of this spin rate is ""c"" (and how can a singularity have a ""tangential velocity""?) When you talk about the tangential velocity, there are multiple components of this black hole you/they may be talking about. One such tangential velocity is the tangential velocity of the event horizon (defined by $r_e$ above). We can take a look at the case of a maximally rotating black hole and say that the angular momentum, based on the equations above, of such a black hole is given by $$J_{max} = a_{max}Mc = M^2c$$ Note that I've dropped the geometrized units just to be completely explicit. This has introduced an extra $c$ now. Remember that $a_{max}$ is achieved when $a/M=1$. We can also define the angular momentum using the standard equation from physics 101, $J=rMv_\perp$, where of course $r$ is the radius of your object, and $v_\perp$ is the perpendicular, or else tangential, velocity of your spinning object. Recall from above that for a maximally rotating black hole, $r_e=M$ so we also have that $$J_{max} = r_eMv_{\perp} = M^2v_\perp$$ You can see that these two equations for $J_{max}$ only equal each other if the tangential velocity $v_\perp$ is equal to the speed of light $c$. So yes, you are correct to presume that at the fastest possible rotations, the black hole's event horizon is rotating at the speed of light! I said though that there are multiple components you could talk about when discussing rotating black holes. The other, as you allude to, is the rotating singularity. You correctly point out - ""how can a singularity have a tangential velocity""? As it turns out, Kerr black holes don't have point singularities, they have ring singularities. These are ""rings"" of mass with zero width but some finite radius. Almost like a disk of no height. These rings of course can then have a tangential velocity. You were correct to be suspicious of a point singularity having tangential velocity though. That is not possible. They did say that the event horizon at maximum spin of a stellar black hole is about 1-1/2 km. and that if a black hole were to spin faster then the result would be a ""naked black hole"" that would defy the laws of physics (GR). We know the equation exactly, since I defined it above. The radius of a stellar black hole (that is a black hole with mass exactly equal to the mass of the Sun, $M_\odot$) is given by $$r=\frac{GM_{\odot}}{c}=1.48\:km$$ So yes, they were correct on their radius. They also state that spinning any faster results in a naked singularity. This is entirely true. To see this, go back to the equation for the event horizon. Remember that our upper spin limit is that $a=M$. What happens to our event horizon radius when $a>M$ (and thus $a/M>1$)? For arguments say, lets say $a=2M$. Then our event horizon radius becomes $$r_e=M-(M^2-a^2)^{1/2}=M-(M^2-4M^2)^{1/2}=M-(-3M^2)^{1/2}=M-i\sqrt{3}M$$ Suddenly our radius is complex and has an imaginary component! That means it is not physical and thus cannot exist. Now that we don't have an event horizon, our singularity can't hide behind it and is ""naked"", exposed to the universe for anyone to see. GR tells us such an event shouldn't be allowed to happen because it results in all sorts of violations of physics. So somehow, something has to prevent black holes from spinning faster than a maximal black hole. Shouldn't all black holes spin extremely fast (conservation of angular momentum) or would a retrograde accretion disk slow it down. Yes, that is true in general. All black holes should spin extremely fast, simply because of conservation of angular momentum. In fact, I don't think I can come up with a case where a black hole was found to be not spinning. Shown below is a plot from this Nature paper which shows the measured spin of 19 supermassive black holes. They're all spinning pretty fast with some of them almost at the speed of light. None of them are even close to not spinning.  Footnote: In GR, to make the math easier, often scientists adopt special units known as geometrized units. These are units chosen in just such a way that the gravitational constant, $G$, and the speed of light, $c$, are equal to one. There's infinitely many units which allow this. Essentially this means no GR equations have $G$ or $c$ in them, but they're implicitly there, they're just equal to one and so not shown."
"Why doesn't dark matter clump strongly in the center of galaxies, since it doesn't feel either radiation pressure or the Pauli exclusion effect?","The reason is the fact that dark matter is non collisional. The dark matter particles interact only gravitationally, they feel no pressure, right, but they also feel no drag! No drag, no friction, means that they can't dissipate energy. Imagine a cloud of dark matter that starts very large and diffuse. Initially it has a very small kinetic energy $K$ and small negative potential energy $U$. If you let it evolve, initially gravity will make it collapse, but the virial theorem tells us that it will reach an equilibrium where $U=-2K$. This equation, plus the conservation of energy $U+K=const$ uniquely determines $U$ and $K$, as well as the radius of the cloud, that will be of the order of $R \approx GM^2/U$. If dark matter could dissipate energy, the total energy would change and the cloud would shrink further, but since it can't, it is locked in viral equilibrium for the time being (or until it evaporates, but this is out of the scope of the question) Regarding the actual density profile of the dark matter halo, which you suspect has been fitted to the data, the profile is often inferred from N-body simulations of dark matter. One famous example is the Navarro-Frenk-White profile $$ \rho(r)={\rho_0 \over {r \over R_s} \left(1+ {r\over R_s}\right)^2}$$ So, the shape is determined from simulation, while the two free parameters $\rho_0$ and $R_s$ must be instead fitted, because they vary for each halo. Mind that this is no ""cheating"", it is akin to fitting a law to the experimental data, which is done in every field of physics."
"How hard is it to find the Sun's ""sisters?""","Here are the problems/issues: Most stars are born in clusters/associations but a cursory investigation of cluster demographics with age reveals that the vast majority of clusters do not survive to old age. The majority either are never gravitationally bound to begin with or become unbound in the first 10 Myr. The Sun was likely born in a cluster of $10^3-10^4$ stars (Adams 2010). If it dispersed more than 4 billion years ago, then its members would have had time to spread all around the galaxy by now. That is because although the members would be kinematically coherent to begin with, the velocity distribution of stars in the Galactic disc becomes ""heated"" as stars scatter in the potential of giant molecular clouds and pass through spiral arms (Wielen 1977). They attain a significant velocity dispersion which means they could now occupy positions over a broad swathe of the Galactic disc and be displaced above/below the disc by $\sim 200$ pc. If we argue that the Sun's siblings could be in an annulus, with width $\pm 1$ kpc and thickness 400 pc, then if the solar cluster was $10^4$ stars, then the nearest sibling is expected to be at a distance of 160 pc. Another way of looking at this: The density of stars in the Galactic disc is around 0.1 per cubic parsec compared to the expected density of solar siblings of $2.4\times 10^{-7}$ per cubic parsec.
Thus only about 1 in 400,000 of the local stars might be a solar sibling. How could they be found?
Cluster members would have a similar age and a similar chemical composition. We know the age of the Sun precisely and accurately. We don't have that information for any other star. Age estimates of field stars are imprecise, model-dependent and are of indeterminate accuracy. In the best cases - solar type stars and a little more massive - asteroseismology and the HR diagram position might give an age to about $\pm 0.5$ Gyr. But you need good data to do that and we don't have asteroseismology for the nearest 400,000 solar-type stars (in order to find ONE solar sibling). Even if we did, it would only narrow the candidates down by a factor of 10. What about chemical abundances? There are now big spectroscopic surveys that have observed large-ish numbers of stars. Again, the most robust data comes for stars like the Sun, so that a differential abundance analysis can be done. The more numerous cooler stars have spectra which are more difficult to deal with and there may be systematic abundance errors when comparing with the Sun. Giant stars are bright, with narrow spectral lines, which is good, but their abundances may have been modified during their evolution. Thus we are limited to looking at solar-type field stars. No spectroscopic surveys (yet) have detailed spectra of 400,000 potential solar siblings. Chemical abundance may also not be that discriminatory. In the solar neighbourhood, stars have an abundance dispersion of about a factor of two , centered quite close (a bit below) the solar metallicity. Good quality spectroscopic analysis can give the metallicity to 10%, so enough to resolve the distribution, but it would only whittle down the candidates by factors of a few. Very high quality spectra could look at the detailed abundance mixture, but is only available perhaps for a few thousand stars. The majority also have an abundance mixture that is not very different to the Sun. Thus whilst the evidence is that the detailed abundance dispersion in a cluster is much smaller than the dispersion in field stars (Paulson et al. 2003), it does not look like the Sun is that unusual or has any unique chemical ""markers"" (Bensby et al. 2014). Some hope may be offered by the detailed mix of s- and r- process elements; the former may be age sensitive (e.g. Jofre et al. 2020), while the latter might reveal some peculiarity associated with contamination by nearby supernovae in the Sun's natal environment. At the moment, although candidate solar twins can be found, it is unclear by how much that narrows down the one in 400,000 figure, especially when you consider that abundance peculiarities may also be imprinted by later accretion events or some process associated with planet formation (e.g. Melendez et al. 2012) or that the abundance dispersion in a cluster may not be exactly zero (e.g. Liu et al. 2016). In summary, the space density of solar siblings is likely to be very low compared with unassociated field stars. The properties of those siblings are not that unusual compared with typical field stars and we lack precise enough measurements of age and chemical composition to have anything more than a  list of candidate solar twins at the moment. It's like looking for a needle in a huge pile of other needles."
Why are there no gamma-ray bursts detected in our galaxy?,"All models of gamma-ray bursts involve extremely energetic phenomena: particular types of supernovae, the coalescence of binary compact objects, strong magnetar flares, or tidal disruption events. It turns out that these events are quite rare - so rare, in fact, that GRBs would be expected to occur in a low-redshift Milky Way-like galaxy at a rate of only one every few million or tens of millions of years (Zhang & Meszaros 2003). If the Milky Way was undergoing a period of intense star formation, yielding more massive stars and therefore more supernovae, then this rate would go up, but still not significantly. Bear in mind that the Galactic supernova rate, for example, is believed to be only several supernovae per century, and the vast majority of supernovae don't lead to gamma-ray bursts. We know of many extragalactic GRBs for several reasons. It helps that we can observe large numbers of galaxies (thanks to how bright the bursts are), and if we could look at millions of Milky Way-like galaxies, it wouldn't be surprising if we could detect $\sim$1 event per year. (There's also the advantage that star formation peaked at a redshift $z\sim2$, and so high-redshift objects would be more likely to produce more GRBs!)"
How does Titan maintain its atmosphere?,"You are right that it's surprising that Titan, being just a moon, has a thick atmosphere. Usually, the answer includes magnetism: Earth has an atmosphere because the liquid iron in the outer core produces a magnetic field. This magnetic field changes the paths of the particles in the solar wind, thus preserving the volatile gases intact. Mars did use to have an atmosphere, just like Earth, but it being farther away from the Sun, the magma froze and lost its magnetic properties. Titan itself doesn't have a magnetic field, but Saturn does. Saturn's magnetosphere is produced by the motion of the super-compressed hydrogen gas inside the planet (metallic fluid). The field is so strong it encompasses the satellites, including Titan. Saturn doesn't have the same magma as Earth. Earth is a rocky planet. This means that it was formed so close to the sun that light gases (such as hydrogen) could not coalesce due to the high temperature and the solar wind. Therefore, the inner planets (Mercury to Mars) are composed mostly of rock and metal. It's the liquid iron in the outer core that makes Earth magnetic. Gaseous planets instead have a small solid metal/rocky core (therefore, no magnetic field from there), and a huge layer of light gases (hydrogen and helium). The gases are not usually magnetic, but under such an enormous pressure they take a ""metallic"" structure, which means they can conduct electricity like a metal. This same property allows them to generate a magnetic field."
Space expansion in layman terms,"Basically, if two particles are placed with no other interaction between them, the distance between them will increase. Imagine living on the surface of a balloon which is being blown up. Your size stays fixed, because you're more or less rigid, but items not attached to you will move further away. Your ruler, another rigid body, stays fixed in size (though it may bend to accommodate the new curvature — this isn't so important). But two rulers (which are not attached to each other) move further away.  ...also, if everything, including all our measurement devices expands at the same speed, how can we determine the fact it's expanding? :D  On the outset this seems true, however there are other forces at play here. Our measurement devices are held together by electromagnetic interactions, and the strength of these will not change. So the measurement device will hold itself together. Imagine two faraway atoms. When space expands, the distance between the two atoms increases. However, the size1 of the atom does not — this is determined by electrostatic equilibrium (and quantum mechanical considerations), and this remains unaffected. Even if the atom was stretched, it would rebound. This scales up to measurement devices, so they don't get distorted either. Indeed, the expansion of space only really makes sense when you look at galaxies — these are pretty far away (when not in the same supercluster) and they don't have any interactions maintaining an equilibrium distance between them. 1. Whatever closest analog we have to ""size"" for atoms; eg the area which contains 99% of the charge density; or the nth Bohr radius."
Are there any galaxies which fell out of sight horizon due to cosmic expansion?,"No. In fact the opposite is the case. (See the last paragraph for an intuitive explanation.) It is a common misbelief that galaxies receding faster than the speed of light are not visible to us. This is not the case; we easily see galaxies moving at superluminal velocities. This does not — as I think most people would think — contradict the theory of relativity, which says that nothing can travel through space faster than $c$. Galaxies do not travel through space (except with small velocities of 100-1000 km/s); rather, space itself is expanding, causing distances between the galaxies to increase. The recession velocity $v_\mathrm{rec}$ of a galaxy is given by Hubble's Law:
$$
v_\mathrm{rec} = H_0 \, d,
$$
where $H_0 \simeq 67.8\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ is the Hubble constant (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016). This law implies that galaxies farther away than
$$
r_\mathrm{HS} \equiv \frac{c}{H_0} \simeq 4400\,\mathrm{Mpc} \simeq 14.4 \, \mathrm{Gly}\,\,\mathrm{(""\!\!Giga\mbox{-}lightyears\!\!"")}
$$
recede faster than $c$. Here, the subscript ""HS"" is chosen because the ragion within which galaxies recede slower than $c$ is called the ""Hubble sphere"". Objects at a distance of $r_\mathrm{HS}$ have a redshift of $z\simeq1.6$. Consider a photon emitted from a distant galaxy (say, GN-z11 at redshift $z=11.1$) in the past, in the direction of the Milky Way (MW). What special relativity tells us is that locally, the photon always travels through space at $v=c$. Initially, the photon thus increases it distance from GN-z11 at velocity $c$. However, even though the photon travels toward us, its distance to MW increases, due to the expansion of the Universe. As the photon increases its distance to GN-z11, the same expansion causes it to recede from GN-z11 at an ever-increasing velocity. Moreover, as it travels toward MW, it will slowly ""overcome"" the expansion until it reaches the point where $v_\mathrm{rec} = c$. For an infinitesimally small period, it will stand will wrt. MW, after which it will begin to travel faster and faster as measured from MW. Eventually, its velocity — still in MW's reference frame — will reach $c$, at which point it will have reached MW. Thus, even though GN-z11 and MW recede from each other at $v_\mathrm{rec} = 2.2c$, we are still able to see it. What is perhaps even more counterintuitive is that when GN-z11 emitted the light we see today, it receded even faster, at $v_\mathrm{rec} \sim 4c$. There is, however, a limit to how fast a galaxy visible to us can recede, given by the distance $r_\mathrm{PH}$ that light has had the time to travel since the Universe was created. Light comes to us from all directions, so we're situated in the center of a sphere of radius $r_\mathrm{PH}$. This sphere is called ""the observable Universe"", and its surface (which is not a physical thing) is called the particle horizon (hence the subscript ""PH""). Galaxies at the particle horizon are receding at $v_\mathrm{rec}\simeq3.3c$. As time goes by, light from ever-more-distant galaxies$^\dagger$ will reach us; that is $r_\mathrm{PH}$ increases. In other words, the observable Universe always increases in size, and no galaxy visible today will ever leave the observable Universe, no matter its speed.  However, since future observable galaxies will be more and more redshifted, their light will eventually shift out of the visible range and into longer and longer radiowaves. Furthermore, the time between each detected photon will increase, so they will be dimmer and dimmer, and thus in practice, they will disappear. A good analogy for better understanding why light can reach us from a galaxy that recedes faster than light, is the ""worm on a rubber band"": Attach an (infinite stretchable) rubber band (of length, say, 10 cm) to a wall and walk away at any constant speed you choose, e.g. 1 m/s. Before you start, put your pet worm at the end near the wall. It wants to get back to you, and starts crawling at 1 cm/s, i.e. 100× slower than you. Will it ever reach you? If you look at it from the perspective of the wall, both you and the worm move away, but whereas you recede at a constant speed, the worm, although slower in the beginning, accelerates because it moves on the rubber band, but the part of the rubber band between the worm and the wall increases in size. The rest of the rubber band of course also increases in size, but that doesn't matter — as long as you have a constant speed, and the worm accelerates, it will reach you (although in this example, it will take the worm $10^{26}$ billion years, at which point it may have lost its patience. But if you walk at only 10 cm/s, it will take just 6 hours). In this analogy, you're the MW, the wall is GN-z11, and the worm is a photon. Now if you don't walk at a constant speed, but also accelerate (this is an analogy of the effect of dark energy), the worm may or may not reach you, depending on your speeds. Just like there is a limit to how distant galaxies we will ever be able to see. $^\dagger$Note that since large distances also means looking back in time (since the light has spent a long time traveling), we actually don't see galaxies this far away, as they hadn't formed this early in history. We do however see the gas from which the galaxies were born, as far back as 380,000 years after Big Bang."
Do the axes of rotation of most stars in the Milky Way align reasonably closely with the axis of galactic rotation?,"There is very likely to be a random scatter. Unlike planets orbiting the Sun in the Solar System, most of the stars in the Galaxy did not form at the same time as the Galaxy itself. There is therefore no strong reason to suspect that the angular momentum vectors would be aligned for similar reasons. On the other hand, the Galactic gravitational potential does depart from spherical symmetry in its inner regions, because the visible matter, which becomes dominant in the inner regions, is concentrated into a disc - so presumably this, or perhaps the tidal forces exerted by this on molecular clouds, could imprint some angular momentum preference. The evidence is sketchy but suggests random orientations, at least in the solar neighbourhood. I refer you to Detection of exo-planets , where I discuss this in the context of detecting transiting exoplanets. In a series of papers, myself and colleagues have investigated the distribution of spin-axes in clusters of stars. The idea here, which is not far-fetched, is that large clouds from which clusters form will have some angular momentum. The question is how much of that angular momentum is inherited by the stars it forms, or to what degree can turbulence in the collapsing gas essentially randomise the spin vectors of collapsing fragments. Our technique was to combine rotation periods (latterly from Kepler observations) with careful measurements of projected equatorial velocities ($v \sin i$, where $i$ is the spin inclination to the line of sight) to get projected radii ($R \sin i$) and then to model the distribution of $R \sin i$ with various assumptions about the spin-axis distribution. In all three of the clusters we have studied (Pleiades, Alpha Per, Praesepe), the distribution was consistent with a random distribution, with quite strong limits on the amount of alignment that was possible (Jackson & Jeffries 2011; Jackson, Deliyannis & Jeffries 2018; Jackson et al. 2019). The technique has been replicated in a fourth cluster, NGC 2516, by Healy & McCullough (2020), with the same conclusion. Other authors have claimed alignments in some cases. Notably, using Kepler asteroseismology of red giants in two clusters in the Kepler main field, Corsaro et al. (2017) claimed a quite tight alignment of spin axes, pointing almost towards us in each case. Since the Kepler field is not far from the Galactic plane and these were distant clusters, then the spin axes would be almost in the Galactic plane (a bit like Uranus and the Sun). However, the likelihood of finding such a result if individual clusters had random average angular momentum vectors raised question marks - the probability of seeing that vector pointing towards you is very low. Work by Kamiaka et al. (2018) shows that the asteroseismological estimates may be systematically biased towards low inclinations. A further piece of evidence for some alignment was in the orientations of bi-polar planetary nebulae towards the Galactic bulge. Rees & Zijlstra (2013) found a non-random distribution that suggested that the orbital angular momenta of binary systems, responsible for the bipolar shape of the nebulae, were oriented aligned with the Galactic plane (again, like Uranus around the Sun). The result is highly statistically significant but as far as I know has not been followed up despite its obvious implications for estimations of transit yields from exoplanetary surveys. I think the biggest argument that there is no significant effect for average stars in the field of the Galaxy, is that the exoplanet people working on the TESS survey (which covers the whole sky), would have found a drastic spatial dependence on their yield of transiting planets as a function of Galactic latitude. The majority of transiting planets (or at least hot Jupiters) have orbital axes coincident with the spin axis of the star (like planets in the Solar System). If these orbital axes were aligned with Galactic north (or any other direction) it would mean you would see far fewer transiting planets when looking towards those directions. I have heard no reports of such a spatial dependence."
Why was there a gap in the number of asteroid detections between 1807 and 1845?,"Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta were all discovered between 1801 and 1807. After that, astronomers looked in vain for 38 years until the 5th, Astraea was spotted on December 8, 1845 by German amateur astronomer Karl L. Hencke by accident. He stumbled on Astraea while looking for Vesta one night. So, what took so long to discover Astrea? There is a paper1 which discusses 4 possibilities: The paper concluded that points (1) and (2) are more important and relevant and points (3) and (4) were met with speculation/contradictions. Refer to the paper for more details. Reference:"
Why are orbits elliptical instead of circular?,"Assume the planet has a negligible mass compared to the star, that both are spherically symmetric (so Newton's law of gravitation holds, but this normally happens to a very good approximation anyway), and that there aren't any forces besides the gravity between them. If the first condition does not hold, then the acceleration of each is going to be towards the barycenter of the system, as if barycenter was attracting them a gravitational force with a certain reduced mass, so the problem is mathematically equivalent. Take the star to be at the origin. By Newton's law of gravitation, the force is $\mathbf{F} = -\frac{m\mu}{r^3}\mathbf{r}$, where $\mathbf{r}$ is the vector to the planet, $m$ is its mass, and $\mu = GM$ is the standard gravitational parameter of the star. Because the force is purely radial $(\mathbf{F}\parallel\mathbf{r})$, angular momentum $\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}$ is conserved:
$$\dot{\mathbf{L}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}\right) = m(\dot{\mathbf{r}}\times \dot{\mathbf{r}}) + \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{0}\text{.}$$
If the initial velocity is nonzero and the star is at the origin, then in terms of the initial position and velocity, the orbit must be confined to the plane of all points with vectors $\mathbf{x}$ from the origin that satisify $\mathbf{L}\cdot\mathbf{x} = 0$. If the initial velocity is zero, then the motion is purely radial, and we can take any one of infinitely many planes that contain the barycenter and initial position. The total orbital energy is given by
$$\mathcal{E} = \frac{p^2}{2m} - \frac{m\mu}{r}\text{,}$$
where the first term part is the kinetic energy and the second term is the gravitational potential energy of the planet. Its conservation, as well as the fact that it invokes the correct potential energy, can be proven by the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals. Define the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector to be
$$\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{p}\times\mathbf{L} - \frac{m^2\mu}{r}\mathbf{r}\text{.}$$
It is also conserved:
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
\dot{\mathbf{A}} &=& \mathbf{F}\times\mathbf{L} + \mathbf{p}\times\dot{\mathbf{L}} - \frac{m\mu}{r}\mathbf{p} + \frac{m\mu}{r^3}(\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r})\mathbf{r}\\
&=& -\frac{m\mu}{r^3}\underbrace{\left(\mathbf{r}\times(\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p})\right)}_{(\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{p})\mathbf{r} - r^2\mathbf{p}} - \frac{m\mu}{r}\mathbf{p} + \frac{m\mu}{r^3}(\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r})\mathbf{r}\\
&=& \mathbf{0}\text{.}
\end{eqnarray*}$$ Finally, let's also take $\mathbf{f} = \mathbf{A}/(m\mathcal{E})$, which has the same units as $\mathbf{r}$, and since $\mathbf{L}\cdot\mathbf{f} = 0$, it lies along the orbital plane. As it's a conserved vector scaled by a conserved scalar, it's easy to show that $\mathbf{f}$ is conserved as well, as long as $\mathcal{E}\neq 0$. By employing the vector triple product, we can write
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{1}{m}\mathbf{A} &=& \frac{1}{m}\left[p^2\mathbf{r}-(\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r})\mathbf{p}\right] -\frac{m\mu}{r}\mathbf{r}\\
&=& \left(\mathcal{E}+\frac{p^2}{2m}\right)\mathbf{r} - \frac{1}{m}\left(\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}\right)\mathbf{p}\\
\mathcal{E}(\mathbf{f}-\mathbf{r}) &=& \left(\frac{p^2}{2m}\right)\mathbf{r} - \frac{1}{m}\left(\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}\right)\mathbf{p}\text{,}
\end{eqnarray*}$$
the norm-squared of which is easy to crank out:
$$\mathcal{E}^2|\mathbf{f}-\mathbf{r}|^2 = \left(\mathcal{E} + \frac{m\mu}{r}\right)^2r^2\text{,}$$
where $\mathcal{E}$ was used throughout to switch between kinetic and potential terms. Since $\mathcal{E}$ is energy relative to infinity, to have a bound orbit we need $\mathcal{E}<0$. Thus, from the previous section, $|\mathbf{f}-\mathbf{r}| = -\mathcal{E}^{-1}\left(\mathcal{E}r + m\mu\right)$ and therefore
$$|\mathbf{f}-\mathbf{r}| + |\mathbf{r}| = -\frac{m\mu}{\mathcal{E}}\text{,}$$
which defines an ellipse with foci $\mathbf{0},\,\mathbf{f}$ and major axis $2a=-m\mu/\mathcal{E}$. The circle is a special case where the foci are the same point, $\mathbf{f} = \mathbf{0}$, which can be restated as
$$\mathcal{E} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{m\mu}{r} = -\frac{p^2}{2m}\text{.}$$
In other words, circular orbits require the orbital energy to be the negative of the kinetic energy. This is possible, but almost certain not to hold exactly. Since any values of $\mathcal{E}<0$ are allowed for bound orbits, there are many more ways to have elliptic orbits. (Although some of them would actually crash because the star and planet have positive size.) Note that hyperbolic orbits have $\mathcal{E}>0$, and we can still find the foci using the above method, though being careful with the signs. For $\mathcal{E}=0$, the second focus $\mathbf{f}$ is undefined because this is a parabolic orbit, and parabolas only have one focus within a finite distance from the center. Additionally, the eccentricity vector $\mathbf{e} = \mathbf{A}/(m^2\mu)$ is an alternative choice for the LRL vector; as the name suggests, its magnitude is the orbital eccentricity."
What is the probability of a photon from one of these galaxies hitting the James Webb detector?,"The probability of any one photon of an ensemble of isotropically emitted photons is indeed proportional to ratio between the area of the detector, and the area of the ""surface"" of a sphere centered on the source. Note, however, that a galaxy seen 13 billion years (Gyr) back in time does not lie 13 billion lightyears (Glyr) away, because the Universe has expanded while the photon was traveling. When NASA says ""13 Glyr away"", it is an (in my opinion misunderstood) attempt not to confuse people. The correct distance requires a model of the expansion. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume a galaxy seen 13 Gyr back in time. Such a galaxy has been redshifted by $z\simeq6.8$, and its current distance is $d=28.5\,\mathrm{Glyr}$ (!). If the galaxy weren't gravitationally lensed, the probability would then be
$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
P_\mathrm{no\,lens} & = & \frac{A_\mathrm{JWST}}{4\pi d^2} \\
  & \simeq & \frac{25.4\,\mathrm{m}^2}{9\times10^{53}\,\mathrm{m}^2} \\
  & \simeq & 3\times10^{-53}.
\end{array}
$$ The probability for a lensed galaxy is equal to the ""normal"" probability, multiplied by the magnification factor $\mu$ which is the factor by which the measured flux is increased. This factor is typically of order a few, or a few tens. Large magnifications are of the order 100, and in the case of Earendel, the magnification is up to 100,000 (depending on which model you trust most). So, if you consider a galaxy that has been lensed by a factor $\mu=10$, then the probability of any of the photons emitted by that galaxy hitting JWST is of the order of
$$
P_\mathrm{lens} = \mu P_\mathrm{no\,lens}\simeq 3\times10^{-52}.
$$ That's a very small number, but luckily galaxies emit many, many photons every second. A bright galaxy in these epochs would have a luminosity of, say, $L_\mathrm{gal} = 10^{10}$ times that of our Sun, or $4\times10^{36}\,\mathrm{W}$. For an order-of-magnitude estimate, let's assume that most is emitted in the optical, with an average wavelength of $\lambda=600\,\mathrm{nm}$, corresponding to an energy of $E_\mathrm{ph}=h\nu=hc/\lambda\simeq3\times10^{-19}\,\mathrm{J}$. Hence, each second the galaxy emits
$$
\dot{n}_\mathrm{ph} = \frac{L_\mathrm{gal}}{E_\mathrm{ph}} \simeq 10^{55}\,\mathrm{photons\,per\,second}.
$$ Because of the expansion of the Universe, the rate at which we receive individual photons here is a factor of $(1+z)$ smaller than the rate at which they're emitted (thanks @jawheele for catching this). Hence, in this case with $\mu=10$, $z=6.8$, and $L_\mathrm{gal}=10^{10}\,L_\odot$, JWST would catch
$$
n_\mathrm{ph} = \frac{\dot{n}_\mathrm{ph}}{1+z} P_\mathrm{lens} \sim 400\,\mathrm{photons\,per\,second}.
$$ Note that galaxies do not in general emit photons isotropically. In the case of dusty disk galaxies, they may emit quite a lot more in the face-on direction than in the edge-on direction."
Near-Earth supernova,"None of those stars can go supernova, so the question is rather moot.  If you look at the classifications, the most luminous is Sirius A (an A sequence star even) you can get an idea of its mass. If you look at your source page, and link to the explanation you see that A stars range from 1.4 to 2.1 stellar masses. In order to go supernova though, you need about nine solar masses.  The nearest supernova candidate is IK Pegasi (HR 8210), located at a distance of 150 light-years (and that's a Type Ia). The closest Type II candidate that I can think of is Spica, which is 260 light years away. Although this list doesn't include Spica, and has the closest Type II as Betelgeuse, at 640 light years away. In his book, Death From The Skies, Dr. Phil Plait (a professional astronomer, writer, lecturer, etc.) covers exactly what would happen to earth if a star nearby did go supernova, and it isn't pretty. Basically, it would strip us of our ozone layer and turn the upper layer of our atmosphere into a dirty brown smog layer, let in a lot of UV radiation that would devastate plankton and plant life, and be very bad for all life down on the surface. However, for a Type II, they need to be around 25 light years or closer to affect us.  Dr Plait's writing style is very much geared for a layman reader, and explains things in a very conversational tone, so I highly suggest that you get the book and read it. It will tell you exactly what to expect, and also tell you exactly why it's nothing to worry about. All that said, there are two things in his book that you may want to consider as more likely than a supernova. A GRB from Eta Carinae, or an asteroid impact. The latter we may actually have the technology to eliminate as a concern though, so we're not doing too badly!"
How will Starlink affect observational astronomy?,"tldr; some modelling has been done with a lot more to do, but generally the impact of these constellations is fairly negative, but potentially manageable. Ok, there's a lot to unpack here. First things first, while people have been aware of Starlink and have thought of it, modelling the impacts to observatories hasn't happened as of yet in quite a few places. The main observatory which has had modelling done, LSST, released this statement; LSST is particularly sensitive to bright trails of these satellites, due to LSST’s unprecedented product of field-of-view and light collecting area.  Most LSST images will contain such a trail if plans for multiple LEOsat constellations materialize. The first group of Starlink satellites are sufficiently bright during dawn and dusk (when LSST would be surveying) that the trail would exceed sensor saturation, generating uncorrectable artifacts in the data
  LSST Statement AURA (the owners of LSST) provided some additional information; The LSST Project Science Team has been simulating the potential impacts to LSST observations. Their latest update of preliminary results from November 2019 indicates that (assuming the full deployment of planned satellites) nearly every exposure within two hours of sunset or sunrise would have a satellite streak. During summer months there could be a 40% impact on twilight observing time (less in winter) and saturation of sensors by the satellites can continue well past astronomical twilight. Because of scattered light in the optics by the bright satellites, the scientific usefulness of an entire exposure can sometimes be negated. Detection of near-Earth asteroids, normally surveyed for during twilight, would be particularly impacted. Dark energy surveys are also sensitive to the satellites because of streaks caused in the images. Avoiding saturation of streaks is vital. The LSST team notes that “For the full Starlink constellation, at any one time during the night over 200 Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites will be visible. This will increase by the mid-2020s with additional planned constellations of LEO satellites.”
  AURA Statement I've found some other astronomy authorities that have released statements relating to the problem at hand, but they don't have that much information as to potential impacts of these constellations. As of June 2019, the IAU stated that  We do not yet understand the impact of thousands of these visible satellites scattered across the night sky
  IAU Statement In regards to this lack of information the AAS created this survey is to gather as much information as possible about the impacts to various observatories so that they can be better informed:
AAS Survey
From what I can tell, the results of the survey aren't out yet and of course when released it will provide a lot of insight into the potential impacts and how to manage them. These are the properties which the AAS expect of a constellation of 1,584 Starlink satellites.  In regards to radio astronomy, the NRAO were happy enough with SpaceX Starlink, though there might be concerns with other constellations such as Oneweb.
NRAO Statement
Oneweb concerns In reference to the previous point, all of this comes with the caveat that Starlink is potentially only one of perhaps 4 or 5 LEO constellations. Even if SpaceX acts responsibly you still have to convince all of the others to do so as well, which might be difficult.  SpaceX and AAS are working together on ways of reducing the impact of Starlink to astronomy. AAS on mitigating Satellites Constellations impact"
Hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets orbiting the Sun,"The recent possible discovery of Planet Nine by Batygin & Brown (2016) has caused quite a stir, in the astronomy community, Astronomy Stack Exchange, and the rest of the world. This is, of course, in part because any mention of such a discovery will cause a stir, but it is also in part because of the claimed probability if the movements of the Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) being purely by chance: 0.007%, or 1 in 14,000, which corresponds to a probability of ~ 3.8$\sigma$. That said, the actual probability that this planet exists is a bit lower - 90%, according to Brown, and 68.3%, according to Greg Laughlin, an astronomy at UC-Santa Cruz who knew of the results prior to the paper's publication. The difference between these odds and the odds mentioned in the paper is due to the fact that perhaps there are other contributing factors that could have caused the movements of the TNOs - and also that these informal numbers are more like guesses than estimates. The answers to Why hasn't the ""9th Planet"" been detected already? have already given a variety of methods that won't work in the case of Planet Nine, and why they haven't worked. Besides the obvious possibility that Planet Nine just doesn't exist, here are some of them: I bring all this up because, surprisingly, the case of Planet Nine is very relevant to the detection of these other planets that you mentioned in your question. HD 106906 b There are several similarities here between this planet and Planet Nine. One difference is that HD 106906 b may have formed where it is at the moment. Scattering, like Planet Nine experienced, appears to be unlikely. This means that the two could have different compositions - although I would think that both might be ice giants or the remains thereof, given where they formed. In short, HD 106906 b may be very similar to Planet Nine, and while we do not know much about either property, it seems safe to say that detection methods and problems would be similar. Fomalhaut b Fomalhaut b is a bit different. Its semi-major axis is ~177 AU - much smaller than these other two planets - and may be anywhere from 10 Earth masses to several hundred Earth masses. Interestingly enough, Fomalhaut b was also indirectly detected, just like Planet Nine. A gap was found in Fomalhaut's dust disk, which could only have been caused by a massive planet. Later, it was directly imaged. Direct detection might be possible if Fomalhaut b was in the Solar System, especially given its greater size and mass. Additionally, it would have an enormous impact on TNOs. However, it would be a gas giant, not an ice giant, so it would be difficult to explain how it moved out so far. I discussed those planets to take a slight detour and talk about what might (and might not) be beyond Neptune. I'll be more explicit here. What could be beyond Neptune An ice giant, like Planet Nine, or the remains of one. This would have been formed closer in, near Jupiter and Saturn, which existed in a period resonance with Saturn. Other giant planet resonances would have also existed. Then a instability broke the resonances, bringing the ice giant inwards towards Saturn and then Jupiter, where it was flung outwards. This changed the orbits of the other four gas giants. I talked about this is another answer of mine, which I seem to be continuously referencing. That said, the initial answer was incorrect, which I have since noted, and was revised. Batygin's estimates found that Planet Nine would have been ejected many, many, millions of years before the resonances were supposedly broken (according to evidence from the Late Heavy Bombardment). However, this does not mean that there could not have been a sixth giant. The simulations Nesvorný  & Morbidelli (2012) that explored the evolution of a Solar System with four, five, and six giant planets found some good results with five and six giant planets. What cannot be beyond Neptune A gas giant.2 The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer found no Saturn-mass objects up to 10,000 AU, and no Jupiter-mass objects up to 26,000 AU.  This is, of course, besides many other planets that cannot exist. Anyway, this is we would most likely have detected Fomalhaut b by now, if it was in the Solar System. So, assuming that there is something beyond Neptune, how can we fine it? Well, now that its existence has been hypothesized and we know where it should be, astronomers can turn telescopes towards that location and use direct imaging. There's been some excitement because the Subaru Telescope will be used. Other optical (and possibly infrared and other wavelengths) telescopes will most likely be used as well. Answers to What wavelength to best detect the ""9th planet""? (especially Rob Jeffries' answer) indicate that optical and infrared/near-infrared wavelengths will be the best choice. As of today (1/24/2016), we can only speculate on what other instruments will be used, and what their chances are of finding this planet - if it exists. Who knows? Maybe something else unexpected will turn up. 1 Now we get into the different things Planet Nine could be. My answer to What type of planetary-mass object would Planet Nine be? covers this, but there are better answers to Ninth planet - what else could it be? than mine.

2 Be careful of the difference between an ice giant and a gas giant."
How has the Earth's orbit changed over hundreds of millions or billion of years?,"What governs the Earth's orbital period is its orbital angular momentum and the mass of the Sun. Two events have certainly changed the Earth's orbital period (a) whatever collision formed the Moon and (b) the continuous process of mass loss from the Sun. Further possibilities are: (c) Tidal torques from the Sun have increased the angular momentum of the Earth; (d) Radiation pressure from the Sun changes the orbit; (e) drag from the interplanetary medium slows the Earth. Of these I think only (a) (in the early lifetime of the Earth) and (b) (again, mainly in the first hundred million years or so, but with some effect afterwards) are important. Early Collisions Given that (a) probably happened sometime in the first tens of millions of years and likely did not alter the Earth's angular momentum greatly  - it depends on the speed, mass and direction of the impactor and the amount of mass lost from the Earth-Moon system - I will ignore it. Solar Mass Loss It seems, from observations of younger solar analogues, that the mass loss from the early Sun was much greater than the modest rate at which it loses mass now via the solar wind (or by solar radiation). A review by Guedel (2007) suggests a mass loss rate over the last 4.5 billion years that increases as $t^{-2.3}$ (with considerable uncertainty on the power law index), where $t$ is time since birth, and suggests an initial solar mass between 1% and 7% larger than it is now. Conservation of angular momentum a
means that $a \propto M^{-1}$ and Kepler's third law leads to $P \propto M^{-2}$. Therefore the Earth's orbital period was 2-14% shorter in the distant past due to solar mass loss, but has been close to its current value for the last few billion years. If the solar wind power law time dependence is very steep, then most of the mass loss occurred early, but the total mass loss would have been greater. On the other hand, a lower total mass loss implies a shallower mass loss and the earth spending a longer time in a smaller orbit. Tidal Torques The tidal torque exerted by the Sun on the Earth-Sun orbit increases the orbital separation, because the Sun's rotation period is shorter than the Earth's orbital period. The Sun's tidal ""bulge"" induced by the Earth applies a torque that increases the orbital angular momentum, much like the effect of the Earth on the Moon. Quantifying this is difficult. The tidal torque on a planet from a the Sun is
$$ T = \frac{3}{2} \frac{k_E}{Q} \frac{GM_{\odot}^{2} R_{E}^{5}}{a^6},$$
where $R_E$ is an Earth radius and $k_E/Q$ is the ratio of the tidal Love number and $Q$ a tidal dissipation factor (see Sasaki et al. (2012). These lecture notes suggest values of $k_E/Q\sim 0.1$ for the Earth and therefore a tidal torque of $4\times 10^{16}$ Nm. Given that the orbital angular momentum of the Earth is $\sim 3\times 10^{40}$ kgm$^2$s$^{-1}$, then the timescale to change the Earth's angular momentum (and therefore $a$ and $P$) is $>10^{16}$ years and thus this effect is negligible. Edit: Further effects that can be ignored are a changing radiation pressure from the Sun and drag from the interplanetary medium. Radiation Pressure The outward force on the Earth is roughly the solar flux at the Earth multiplied by $\pi R^2$ and divided by the speed of light. However, since the radiation flux is, like gravity, obeying an inverse square law, this simply reduces the effective strength of the solar gravity. Because the Sun is getting more luminous with time, by about 30% since it's early youth, then this should result in a weaker effective gravity and the Earth's orbit behaving like it orbits a correspondingly less massive star. This is a 1 part in $10^{16}$ effect so can safely be neglected. Drag from the Interplanetary Medium The density at the Earth is of order 5 protons per cubic centimetre (though I can't immediately locate a reference for this much quote figure) and thus a mass density $\rho \simeq 10^{-20}$ kg/m$^{3}$. The drag force is about $0.5 \rho v^2 \pi R^2$, where $v$ is the velocity of Earth's orbit and $\pi R^2$ is the cross-sectional area presented by the Earth. The torque is then this multipled by $a$ and if assumed constant over billions of years would decrease the angular momentum of the Earth's orbit by 1 part in a billion - so this can safely be neglected."
How Would a Neutron Star Actually Appear?,"Your question is too general, you need to get to specific examples. First, very few neutron stars are pulsars. Pulsars are either a brief phase during a pulsar's spin-down at the start of a neutron star's life, or they are the product of the spin-up of a neutron star in a binary system. Most neutron stars fall in neither of these categories. A standard neutron star will look like any other star at a similar temperature. Most of them will be very hot indeed - 100,000 K or more, though the cooling histories of neutron stars are still uncertain and depend on some exotic physics. Such an object is ""white hot"" - it emits black body radiation at all frequencies visible to the eye (as well as lots more at UV wavelengths). How close would you have to get for it's apparent luminosity/magnitude to match the Sun? Well that depends on the size and temperature of the neutron star. Most are thought to have a diameter of 20 km. The way you would do the calculation is equate the blackbody radiative flux per unit area at a given distance to the solar radiation constant of about 1300 W per square metre. However, there are two wrinkles for a neutron star: First, the radiation is gravitationally redshifted, so the temperature we measure is lower than the temperature at the surface. Second, General Relativity tells us that we can see more than just a hemisphere of the neutron star - i.e. we can see around the back - and this increases the flux we observe. These are roughly factor of two effects, so just to get an order of magnitude estimate, ignore GR and assume a 10 km radius NS with $T=10^{5}$ K. Using Stefan's law for a blackbody, then at a distance $d$, we have that
$$\frac{4 \pi r^2}{4\pi d^2} \sigma T^4 = 1300\ W\ m^{-2},$$
where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. For $r=10$ km, then $d=7 \times 10^{8}$ m, which is coincidentally about a solar radius. Of course this distance depends on the square of the temperature, so a younger NS with $T=10^6$ K, then $d \sim 1$ au.  These are the distances where the total flux at all wavelengths would be similar to that from the Sun. To do the calculation just for the visible range we need to account for the bolometric correction, which converts a visual magnitude to a bolometric magnitude. The bolometric correction for the Sun is $\sim 0$, whereas the bolometric correction for a very hot star could be -5 mag. This means that only 1% as much flux from the hot neutron star emerges in the visible band compared with sunlight. This means that the distances calculated above, if we require the visual brightness of the neutron star be similar to the Sun, must be reduced by a factor of 10. To turn to pulsars. Note that the pulsed radiation does have an optical component and pulsed optical radiation has been seen from a number of pulsars. Optical synchrotron emission would just appear to be a periodic, intense brightening of the pulsar, as the beam sweeps across the line of sight. If you were not in the line of sight, then you would not see the pulsed optical emission. If you could observe the beam passing through nebulosity or some other medium around the pulsar then yes there may well be some effects you could see in terms of ionisation or scattered light coming from along the beam path. Lastly, the gravitational lensing effect. Yes, this should be strong close to a neutron star. The deflection angle (in radians) is given by
$$ \alpha  = \frac{4GM}{c^2 b},$$
where $b$ is how close the light passes to the neutron star and $M$ is the neutron star mass. Expressing $b$ in terms of the 10km radius of the neutron star:
$$ \alpha \simeq 0.83 \left(\frac{M}{1.4M_{\odot}}\right) \left(\frac{b}{10 km}\right)^{-1},$$
where strictly speaking this formula is only valid for $\alpha \ll 1$. So consider a planet directly behind the neutron star at a distance of 1 au. The light from this would only need to be bent through an angle of $\sim 2 \times 10\ km/1\ au \sim 10^{-7}$ radians in order to be seen from a planet diametrically opposite at a distance of 1 au. So this is easily possible. However, the image would likely be highly distorted, especially if the neutron star was spinning. It would not look dissimilar to this simulated black hole image, but with a bright neutron star in the middle rather than a black disc. "
How did Mars come to have a 24 hour 39 minute day?,"""It's believed that the Earth was rotating about once every 5 hours
  before the theorized collision with a Mars sized coorbiting object
  referred to as Theia."" Almost. Theia did not have to be co-orbiting, just an intersecting orbit. We have no idea what the Earth's spin was before the collision, but it is theorized that the Earth rotation had a 5 hour period after the collision with Theia, at the time of the Moon's formation from the debris.  The fact that Mars and Earth have such a similar period is a coincidence, perhaps you are asking why Mars is spinning so fast? Well actually Mars is not the odd man out, Mercury and Venus are. Most planets spin fast. exactly which spin orientation is somewhat arbitrarily determined by the vagaries of the ways the planetesimals collided to form them. The fact that Venus and Uranus have unusual spin orientations is just the way things turned out. Both Mercury and Venus used to spin much faster. Mercury's spin was tidally slowed down by the Sun and Mercury's orbit was (and still is being) driven further away by the Sun (just like the Moon and Earth: Why is the Moon receding from the Earth due to tides? Is this typical for other moons?). Eventually Mercury was held in that 2:3 resonance. Which, by the way had a certain amount of luck involved (see: Mercury’s capture into the 3:2 spin-orbit resonance as a result of its chaotic dynamics ). Venus, we are not so sure of. The tidal force from the sun is much much less for Venus than for Mercury, but much more than for Earth. However Venus has a dense hot massive atmosphere, which can be forced into both gravitational bi-modal (two peaks) tides and thermal uni-modal (one peak) tides. The bulge lags behind the tidal forcing peak, which creates a torque by the sun to slow it down. This is fiendishly complex (See: Long term evolution of the spin of Venus - I. Theory ) P.S. Actually Phobos, and probably Deimos, are thought to be constructed fairly recently (millions of years) from debris from a collision of Mars with a large asteroid. There is no way to capture a whole asteroid into orbits that close."
Parking a telescope at a Lagrange point: is this a good idea from a debris point of view?,"Hmmm no, it wouldn't be cluttered with debris, and yes, it's a good idea to park the JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) at the Sun-Earth L2 point. The five Lagrange points are unstable, for one because of the gravitational anomalies of the two massive bodies of the Lagrange system, eccentric orbits, and there are many other factors to their instability. At the same time, they are least gravitationally attractive points around two massive bodies. Think of L-points as parking your car on a flat space at the top of the hill. You'll have to approach with some control and then try to balance at your parking spot, if you don't plan using your handbrake and also remain there stationary:
          Visualisation of the relationship between two massive bodies and their five Lagrange points (Source: Wikipedia) There wouldn't be any debris clutter there, or any other matter like smaller particles, at least not any more likely than elsewhere around them, only transient in nature and possibly even less likely than elsewhere since all the other mass particles would gravitate towards the more massive bodies of two Lagrange system centers in their vicinity. No body with rest mass would stay there on its own accord, not unless it has active attitude control to position itself there and constantly adjust for changes in gravitational attraction vector as the two mass bodies rotate around their axes, change distance while orbiting each other, or L points being influenced by other mass bodies of the same planetary system. At the same time, JWST will be shielded by the Earth from any Solar activities and also Sun's interference with JWST's sensitive equipment as it starts observing the Universe in the infrared spectrum. Most of the orbital debris from our own space exploration missions is cluttered in the LEO (Low Earth Orbit) belt at roughly an altitude of 500-1500 km above the Earth's surface:                    Source: Active Debris Removal: EDDE, the ElectroDynamic Debris Eliminator, Jerome Pearson et al. (PDF) Now, the JWST will be deployed to a very large 800,000 kilometres (500,000 mi) radius halo orbit around the Sun-Earth L2 point, that is 1,500,000 kilometers (930,000 mi) from the Earth, around 4 times farther than the distance between the Earth to the Moon. So not exactly in Earth's shadow and it will still use large deployable sunshield, but that's a long way away from where we're littering our LEO or even GEO/GSO (Geostationary/Geosynchronous orbits) with GEO being the farthest of these frequently used orbits, at 35,786 kilometres (22,236 mi) above the Earth's equator (and its graveyard orbit a bit farther than that). JWST will be placed in halo orbit nearly 40 times as distant from the Earth as you'd expect any space debris cluttering our planet's orbits at. Yes, it is a very good idea to place JWST around the Sun-Earth L2 point."
Have we ever observed a large meteor hit the Moon?,"Yes, we have, and the impacts occur very frequently according to ""Bright explosion on the moon"" (NASA): For the past 8 years, NASA astronomers have been monitoring the Moon for signs of explosions caused by meteoroids hitting the lunar surface. ""Lunar meteor showers"" have turned out to be more common than anyone expected, with hundreds of detectable impacts occurring every year. On March 17, 2013 a significant impact occurred that could have been observed from the Earth. Updated information about lunar impacts is found at the Marshall Space Flight Centre's Lunar Impacts page.  Below is a map of the impacts that occurred on the lunar surface between 2005-2008, all of which, according to the article ""Amateur Astronomers see Perseids hit the Moon, could have been seen from the Earth (with a telescope):  There have been instances throughout our history when, so is believed, people on the ground have witnessed lunar impacts. One of the more famous ones was in 1178 AD, when monks witnessed fire coming from the moon; However, according to the article ""Historic lunar impact questioned"", the accuracy of this historical account is questionable."
"I live in an area with a lot of light pollution, how can I view the stars without building an observatory?","telescope.com has a quick paragraph on astronomy. Below I summarise the important points with a few of my own suggestions thrown in. Dark & dirty places Set up on grass or dirt, pavements and buildings radiate the heat again at night and the air flow created by this can distort your image. If possible you might be able to make use of a public park. Failing the above you might be better off going to the outskirts of the city and finding a nice dark hill and avoid as much of the light pollution as possible, but obviously this depends on your situation.   Telescope This doesn't require a special telescope, you should be able to manage just fine with what your budget allows for.  Though a computerised mount can aid you plenty in locating objects, as you have fewer stars to use as way-points in light polluted areas.  Here is an example I found earlier - yes they are quite pricey.   Note: This picture and the mount in the link are NOT the same mount.  Try to set up out of direct view of a source of light, i.e street-light or porch light. This is because you will suffer from a lack of contrast, making it harder to view the objects. So dark spots are good! Light Filters A good, fairly cheap method*, for negating light pollution that I have found is to use a light filter, these usually just screw on over the telescope and filter out light of that wavelength. However, a very important point to note is that light filters will also filter out light from stars, galaxies and star clusters, making them appear duller.  Light filters actually decrease 'sky glow' which is, in part, due to the upper atmosphere.  What these filters are best for is looking at nebulas Nebulas emit light of a different wavelength that are not dulled by the filter and they pass straight through.   If you are not hoping to look for nebulas then I do not suggest a light filter, as this will also dull the stars.  Examples of which can be found here  *cheap relative to buying a go-to mount that is"
What are the main differences between solar flares and coronal mass ejections?,"The following definitions are according to NASA. ""Solar Flares"" are gigantic explosions from the surface of the Sun, occurring near sunspots along the dividing/neutral line between opposite magnetic field areas. ""Coronal Mass Ejections"" (CME's) are: huge bubbles of gas threaded with magnetic field lines that are ejected from the Sun over the course of several hours. Although the Earth's magnetic field protects the biosphere from the worst of these forms of 'space weather', according to the website ""Space Weather: What impact do solar flares have on human activities?"", the effects that do affect us are: Disturbance of the ionosphere, disrupting radio communications. heating, hence expansion of the atmosphere would cause drag on satellites, degrading their orbits, also affecting the accuracy of GPS. From the Solar Weather site, an important distinction between CME's and solar flares in how they affect the Earth: Coronal mass ejections are more likely to have a significant effect on our activities than flares because they carry more material into a larger volume of interplanetary space, increasing the likelihood that they will interact with the Earth. While a flare alone produces high-energy particles near the Sun, some of which escape into interplanetary space, a CME drives a shock wave which can continuously produce energetic particles as it propagates through interplanetary space. When a CME reaches the Earth, its impact disturbs the Earth's magnetosphere, setting off a geomagnetic storm.  Very severe CME's can also potentially disrupt power grids and communications."
Dark Matter Particle Candidates,"When you say ""particle"" candidates, I assume you're excluding MACHOs and RAMBOs. MACHOs are ""dark"" objects at the stellar scale like black holes, neutron stars, brown dwarfs, etc. RAMBOs are clusters of similar dark objects. MACHOs and RAMBOs are made of primarily baryonic matter (everyday stuff like protons and neutrons — electrons are not baryons but they can be a part of this too).  This leaves us with the WIMPs and possible other particle candidates. I don't know the details of any experiments looking for these offhand (I'll see if I can find it out and update the answer in a few days), but the major particle candidates are:"
"Can we detect pulsars that aren't ""pointed"" towards us?","They don't need to be pointed exactly at us, since the angular beam radius is a few degrees (Pulsar Astronomy, P. 212) but there is a portion that we can't detect, described by a beaming factor (P. 211):     The larger beamwidth at higher energies can be seen in these graphs: 
R. N. Manchester  We mostly can't see ""ordinary neutron stars"". ""neutron stars can only be easily detected in certain instances, such as if they are a pulsar or part of a binary system"" - Wikipedia If the pulsar is radiating gamma rays more isotropically (but still varying with phase as in the Manchester charts), then these could be detected."
Multi-messenger astronomy: what is the potential of simultaneous detection of gravitational waves and neutrinos from a supernova?,"This article basically seems to answer the question. They quote from an earlier study: ""Although no CCSNe have currently been detected by gravitational-wave detectors, previous studies indicate that an advanced detector network may be sensitive to these sources out to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). A CCSN would be an ideal multi-messenger source for aLIGO and AdV, as neutrino and electromagnetic counterparts to the signal would be expected. The gravitational waves are emitted from deep inside the core of CCSNe, which may allow astrophysical parameters, such as the equation of state (EOS), to be measured from the reconstruction of the gravitational-wave signal."" Since we know from SN1987A that neutrinos from a supernova can be detected at that range, that seems to be a ""yes"". The biggest uncertainty seems to be how much gravitational wave energy would be emitted by the supernova, and at what frequencies, which depends on a relatively detailed understanding of exactly how the matter moves around in the explosion, one simulation of which is illustrated in the (rather awesome) video in the article. "
Is there enough matter orbiting the sun to make a second sun?,"The vast majority of the stuff in the solar system other than the Sun itself  is contained in one body, Jupiter. The total mass of the solar system is estimated to be about 1.0014 solar masses, or about one solar mass plus 1.4 Jupiter masses. (Jupiter's mass is a bit less than 0.001 solar masses.) Using the highest estimates on the mass of the Oort cloud, the total mass of the solar system, excluding the Sun itself, is about 30 Jupiter masses. These early estimates have been shown to be wrong. Current estimates are that the mass of the Oort cloud is one or two Earth masses. Even if the hypothesized planet IX does exist and is as large as some hypothesize (about five Earth masses), that will only budge the estimated 1.0014 solar masses by a tiny, tiny bit. The smallest possible star, defined as something capable of fusing hydrogen, is about 65 to 80 Jupiter masses. The answer is no."
How can telescopes see anything at all?,"Yes, space is very empty. There is not nothing between us an the Eagle nebula, but little enough that we can still get a reasonable view of it. The pillars are ephemeral, they are evolving on timescales that, whilst slow on human timescales, are quite rapid on the timescales of galactic evolution. There probably won't be much evidence of them in a few million years. The pillars do ""hide"" a portion of space behind them (and inside them). This is why you often see observations taken at infrared wavelengths because light at this wavelength can penetrate the gas and (mainly) dust making up the pillars more easily than visible wavelengths and we can see into them and behind them. See here for example."
Is it suspicious that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light?,"It is very suspicious!  It points to the fact that the speed of light isn't just some random speed that light happens to travel at, but is a fundamental property of the universe. In fact, any massless particle will move at the speed of light. This is a consequence of relativity. Energy, mass and momentum($p$) are related by $$E^2 = m^2c^4 +p^2c^2$$ for a particle moving at velocity $v$ less than $c$,
$$p = mv\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{1-(v/c)^2}\right)}$$ if a massless particle ($m=0$) is moving at velocity less than $c$, then it would have zero momentum and zero energy.  Such a particle could never be detected (since to be detected a particle has to transfer some of its energy and momentum to the detector). Is it possible for a fundamentally undetectable object to exist?  That is a matter for philosophers.  For the sake of developing models of reality, such particles don't exist."
"Why doesn't the Moon, like the Sun, turn bright red when it's close to the horizon?","The moon does significantly redden when it's close to the horizon, especially if you can see it over the ocean or from very flat ground, where you have a clear view all the way to the horizon. A clear view is very important; even 10 degrees up, such as looking over a distant mountain range, will produce a much less red moon.  But, arguably, it's still less red than a sunset. Why is the moon's reddening less obvious than the sun's? I think it's important to think about what 'reddening' means. You said ""the spectrum of moonlight is more redshifted than that of the sun, which should contribute to an even more intense reddening"" -- but that's actually the opposite of the case. (I would not use the term ""red shift"" in this context; that term has a specific astronomical meaning related to relativistic speeds.) The sun at the horizon turns red because the blue light is being scattered by the atmosphere (contributing to blue skies for the day side of the world), and the red passes straight through. Consider if the sun produced only red light -- then you would see no additional reddening near the horizon because there's no blue light to remove from it. So if the moon's spectrum is already redder than the sun's, then we would expect its reddening to be less intense than the sun's, not more -- there's not as much blue light to remove, so the change is smaller. The moon may be as red or redder than the sun from an objective ""I am measuring light frequencies"" perspective, but if you take two moon photos, one at the horizon and one high in the sky, and lay them side by side, the difference will be less impressive. In your question you state that the sun ""turn[s] bright red when it's close to the horizon"", but I don't think that's true. Not every sunset features a really red sun; a middling orange is far more common. The deep crimson is usually something you usually only see when there's a lot of particulate in the atmosphere, such as from a volcanic eruption or large fire. So I don't think the sun's color shift is as dramatic as you think, and thus the moon's less dramatic color shift matches it more closely than you're expecting. The moon does indeed turn a deep blood red when the atmospheric conditions are right for it. But also, photos are tricky things, because photographers almost always adjust the color of a picture, and the display unit you're viewing it on will alter the perceived colors. Moon photos don't typically try to enhance the moon's redness -- for example, the photo you posted is clearly meant to retain some realistic green color in the trees, which can't be compared to a sunset photo that's been tweaked for maximum intensity. Another contributing factor is that the moon is much less bright than the sun, and seen against a generally dark sky. Under those conditions your eyes do a worse job of color discrimination, especially as the more sensitive rod cells in your eye take over for the color-vision cone cells. However, the blue-sensitive cone cells retain their responsiveness better than your red and green cones do under low-light conditions, which means colors under lower light levels tend to look bluer. This is called the Purkinje effect. That means even in person, it's likely that your eyes will perceive the moon as being less red than it truly is."
Was the Geocentric Model correct at all?,"Ptolemy's epicyclic, geocentric model, in use until the Renaissance, was very accurate in terms of predicting the positions of planets and the times of eclipses. What it couldn't account for were things like the correlations between apparent size and phase of Venus, or to properly account for the variation in brightness of the planets. Thus the reason for discarding the geocentric model was not really because it lacked precision, but that it failed to explain various other observational facts, especially after the development of telescopes. No doubt you could tune the Ptolemaic system even further (more epicycles?) to iron out some of the small errors that were revealed by Tycho's positional measurements at the turn of the 16th century, which had a precision unavailable to Ptolemy. However, the advent of Kepler's laws and subsequent explanation by Newton, rendered the geocentric model obsolete. As you can judge from (well written) articles like this one, geocentrism is actually quite hard to kill-off observationally, if you are prepared to accept that the universe is arranged ""just so""."
Can an object from a natural process escape earth gravitation?,"Yes, it is not only possible, but has almost certainly happened on Earth. The asteroid that killed the dinosaurs is thought to have produced these high velocity fragments on the order of one-thousandth of the mass of the impactor according to Poveda and Cordero [2008].  In fact, they estimate the volume of escape velocity ejecta from the Chicxulub event as quite substantial in that: the number of fragments with sizes larger than 10 cm and 2 cm is
about 4x10^10 and 2x10^12, respectively The authors of the above paper call these ""Chicxulubites"" and speculate on the possibility of finding them on the Moon and Mars. The larger the impactor radius and velocity, the higher a percentage of its overall mass will reach escape velocity.  In an asteroid impact, the fastest moving ejecta comes from near the center of the crater.  The ejecta closer to the edge of the crater has much lower velocity:  The equation governing the velocity of the ejecta $V_{ej}$ is therefore partly a function of $r$, the distance from the center of the crater. $$V_{ej} = \frac{2\sqrt{Rg}}{1+\epsilon }\left(\frac{r}{R}\right)^{-\epsilon}$$ Where $\epsilon$ is a material coefficient of 1.8 for hardpack soil, $g$ is the surface gravitational acceleration, $R$ is the total radius of the equator, and $r$ is the radius at which the ejecta was ejected. Notes:"
Can a magnetic field of an object be stronger than its gravity?,"It depends on what object it's acting on.  There are many objects, including stars, that have magnetic fields where Lorentz forces on charged particles like electrons and protons are stronger than the gravitational force on them.  Also remember that the strength of the Lorentz force depends on the speed of the particle moving through it, so a fast enough moving electron even here on Earth will receive a larger magnetic force than a force of gravity. This is how the Earth's magnetic field is able to contain charged particles in the Van Allen belts that its gravity could not contain."
"If suddenly ""knocked"" or perturbed from its orbit, would gravity eventually return the Earth to its original orbit?","There's a few parts to this question so there's more than one answer. Earth gets knocked a little bit out of its orbit all the time by gravitational influence of other planets in our solar system. Jupiter and Venus are the primary two, but all the planets have some effect.  These are called orbital perturbations and they tend to alternate, not add up.  They're the causes of Earth's Milankovich cycles and the effect isn't negligible.  These variations in Earth's orbit, which take thousands of years to move back and forth can cause the formation and recession of glaciation, sometimes called ice ages. These orbital perturbations, in addition to being cyclical, as a rule, don't effect Earth's semi-major axis which is very consistent, and may only change slightly as the Sun loses mass. Orbital perturbations can to lead to much greater variations of eccentricity and axial tilt.   Mars, for example, undergoes much bigger variations than Earth, but it still undergoes a cyclical back and forth that leads to general stability within a range.   All eight known planets in our solar system are thought to be relatively long term stable. The exception to this cyclical back and forth is if there's a resonance where the effect can grow over time.   The closest example of this in our current solar system is Jupiter and Mercury, where they're not in, but they're close to resonance and it's possible that Mercury will be tossed out of its orbit in a few billion years.  It's the most unstable planet in our solar system. This article isn't published, but I still think it's a good summary of both the stability of orbits in our solar system and the possible (but perhaps unlikely) destabilization of Mercury in a few billion years. Planetary migration is another means for tossing a smaller planet out of its orbit.  This is thought to be fairly common, based on observations of other solar systems and some uncertainty that gas giant planets could form close to their suns.  (there may be room for debate on that), but migrating planets is thought to be fairly common, if somewhat slow. It's never been observed but it can be modeled.  It's been suggested that when our solar system was young, Jupiter moved inwards, perhaps tossing Uranus and Neptune outwards and reducing the material available that would eventually become Mars and when migrating back outwards, leading to the late heavy bombardment which brought water to Earth. This is called the grand tack hypothesis. An inwardly migrating Jupiter could certainly toss Earth about easily into a completely different orbit, but there's no evidence that suggests Jupiter is likely to migrate that much in the future. A massive enough object from beyond the solar system could toss Earth into a different orbit and in doing so, not only change Earth's eccentricity and orbital plane, but change Earth's semi-major axis as well and that change would effectively be permanent. A gravity assist of that kind could give Earth both a new eccentricity, a new orbital plane and a new semi major axis and perhaps a new set of Milankovich cycles, though I suspect over time, the orbit could re-circularize and the Milankovich cycles, largely reset to where they were, so there could be some correction not by the sun, but by the other planets orbiting the sun, but not everything would go back to where it was.   The Semi-major axis change would likely be permanent and there would also be the question of whether the new orbit was in near resonance with other planets which would lead to further changes over time. A higher eccentricity could create stronger seasonal variations and perhaps trigger a new ice age, or maybe fix man made global warming.  :-) The effects of a change in semi-major axis would change the length of a year, so, we'd need new calendars, and could warm or cool if it was big enough. There would also be tidal concerns if a massive object passed close enough to significantly change Earth's orbit and perhaps even, pulling the Moon out of its stable orbit. The good news is, space is big and quite empty and an object massive enough to change Earth's orbit passing close enough to do so is extremely unlikely."
Approximately what percent of the sky has nothing in it?,"It is really quite hard to answer the question as posed because as you observe deeper and deeper (e.g. using a larger telescope or observing for longer) then more and more (fainter) objects become apparent. Every telescope that you use (and indeed your eye) has a finite angular resolution - the smallest angle between two objects that can be resolved. i.e. The closest two objects can be where there might still be some perceived ""gap"" between them. Since every telescope has a finite resolution, but you could in principle just observe deeper and deeper, then eventually you reach the stage where the whole sky is almost full of very faint objects with few discernable gaps between them (at least for the telescopes in use today). As a rough idea, there are often said to be at least $10^{11}$ galaxies in the observable universe and at leat $10^{11}$ stars in our own galaxy. If we were to spread these evenly over the sky (probably ok for galaxies), then the separation between adjacent galaxies or stars is about 2 arcseconds. For the stars, most big telescopes at good observing sites would be able to resolve these (though the stars are unevenly distributed and telescopes are incapable of resolving all the stars towards the plane of the Milky Way for example because the density is much higher). Galaxies though have a finite size - e.g. a galaxy of diameter 10 kpc seen at a distance of 1 Gpc has an angular size of 2 arcseconds. Thus with the best telescopes and the deepest exposures, if you look very closely there is a galaxy (or at least the blurred image of a galaxy) intercepting almost every line of sight. However, if you were to define some brightness limit to your pictures and ignore the likelihood that there were fainter objects in the ""gaps"" then you could attempt to put some percentage figure on it. e.g. Here is an image from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.  You might estimate (by eye) that about 20% of the pixels are filled with a galaxy of some sort. There are about 10,000 identified galaxies in this 3.1x3.1 arcmin$^2$ image, so each galaxy is actually only separated by about 2 arcsec (see the calculation above) and you would be hard pressed to count those 10,000 galaxies by eye since most of them are extremely faint blurs that occupy what you might perceive initially as gaps. Finally, the answer you get will depend not only on the depth of your image but the resolution of the instrument taking it. To quote your own comment: For a given resolution, driving the depth to infinity sends the proportion of ""nothing"" to 0, but for a given depth (i.e. exposure time), increasing the resolution increases the proportion of sky that has nothing? That is an accurate summary, at least with current instrumentation. Edit (for the dedicated reader) To further explain a few things. The answer above considers an ""object"" to be a resolved thing in the sky. Clearly galaxies, consisting of unresolved stars, are mostly empty space and so the vast majority of sightlines will not intercept the surface of a star or anything else. However, that does not mean that sightline is ""dark"" because all instrumentation we have has a finite resolution that blurs the light from these stars into an image of a galaxy. Some have commented on the finite age of the universe, Olber's paradox and possibly misunderstood what is meant by ""depth"" in the quote above. Galaxies and stars have a vast range of luminosities and the least luminous things are much more common than the more luminous. Even if you can only observe to a set distance (e.g. set by the finite time since stars and galaxies were first formed), then increasing the exposure time, or ""depth"" of your image will still reveal more and more of the less luminous objects. If there were a lower limit to the luminosity of a galaxy, then in principle yes, there might come a time when instrumentation was so good that increasing exposure time would not reveal more objects, but we aren't there yet. Even if that were the case, there is no guarantee at all, even with excellent angular resolution, that sightlines will not intercept any galaxies, because they have a finite angular size - and angular size actually increases with large redshifts in the currently accepted cosmological model. Finally we should talk about wavelength. It is far easier to find ""empty sky"" in the optical (e.g. the Hubble Deep Field), because the light from distant galaxies gets redshifted out of the visible range. It will be interesting to see how crowded JWST deep fields will be in the infrared at an equivalent depth. They will certainly be more crowded, but whether they present an ""infrared wall"" will depend on the uncertain details of the formation timescale, size scale and star formation history of early galaxies and the shape of the bottom end of the galaxy luminosity function with redshift."
Solar Analemma - but with a star instead,"An analemma shows the position of the Sun in the sky from a fixed location on Earth at the same mean solar time. It gets its north-south shape because of the tilt of Earth's axis makes the declination of the sun change across the year, and the sideways shape due to the orbit nonuniformity. The star analemma would get a point at the same time every sidereal day (slightly different from the solar day). To a first approximation that fixes the star's right ascension: it will not move along the celestial equator. The celestrial equator of course rotates one turn per year as seen from the ground, so in one sense the analemma is just a circle around the pole of the sky. But if you look at it in the coordinate system of the celestial sphere the star is fixed. ...Except that there will be some stellar parallax due to Earth's different locations along its orbit during the year. The star will seem to move along a tiny ellipse when compared to distant stars in the background. I think the parallax ellipse is the closest counterpart to the sun analemma."
Why is there so little nitrogen in the Martian and Venusian atmospheres?,"Nitrogen, with a molecular mass of 28 atomic mass units, is too light to have remained in Mars's atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, with a molecular mass of 44 amu, could (and does) exist on Mars, but it is rather sparse. Venus's atmosphere appears to contain a small amount of nitrogen when viewed on a percentage basis. ""Only"" 3.5% of all of the gases in Venus's atmosphere is nitrogen. But that's not a particularly good metric. Venus has so very, very much carbon dioxide in its atmosphere that the CO2 dwarfs every other constituent. When viewed in terms of mass, Venus has a good deal of nitrogen in its atmosphere, four times more nitrogen than the Earth has in its atmosphere."
"Is the center of our galaxy, the Sagittarius A* black hole a former star?","We don't know. It's a supermassive black hole and there are several theories about their formation: The origin of supermassive black holes remains an open field of research. Astrophysicists agree that black holes can grow by accretion of matter and by merging with other black holes. There are several hypotheses for the formation mechanisms and initial masses of the progenitors, or ""seeds"", of supermassive black holes. Independently of the specific formation channel for the black hole seed, given sufficient mass nearby, it could accrete to become an intermediate-mass black hole and possibly a SMBH if the accretion rate persists. The early progenitor seeds may be black holes of tens or perhaps hundreds of solar masses that are left behind by the explosions of massive stars and grow by accretion of matter. Another model involves a dense stellar cluster undergoing core collapse as the negative heat capacity of the system drives the velocity dispersion in the core to relativistic speeds. As far as I know, nothing extra is known about the black hole in the center of our own galaxy."
Apparent Ring of Craters on the Moon,"Actually, most of the surface of the Moon is covered with craters like that. The exception are the large dark 'seas', which are in fact basaltic plains. The seas are mostly present on this side of the moon; the far side of the moon is almost entirely composed of craters. The reason you see a ring near the terminator (the boundary between the illuminated and dark part) is that the shadows make the craters much more visible. Due to the angle at which sunlight strikes this portion of the Moon, shadows cast by craters and other geological features are elongated, thereby making such features more apparent to the observer. This phenomenon is similar to the lengthening of shadows on Earth when the Sun is low in the sky."
How can we focus radio telescopes on a star when the earth is spinning?,"Part of the answer that I suspect the original questioner needs is that although the Earth is indeed spinning very fast, the amount the surface of the Earth moves relative to an astronomical object is tiny. So you put motors in the base of the telescope so that it slowly turns to look at the same patch of sky.   You don't need to refocus because telescopes are looking at objects so far away that focus doesn't matter.  You don't need to do anything else because the Earth's movement is smooth and continuous, and it's not about how fast you're moving, it's about how quickly you're turning.  In our case, one complete circle every 24 hours which is pretty slow. Focus at infinity just means that you set the focus of the telescope so that an object which is infinitely far away would be in perfect focus.  It depends on the quality of the telescope, but the practical difference between focus at infinity and focus at the actual distance disappears after a few miles or so.  At the distance of stars, there is essentially no difference at all."
How many pixels could an image of Proxima b taken by James Webb have?,"The JWST will have an angular resolution of about 0.1 arcseconds, which is similar to Hubble. The star, Proxima, has an angular size of 0.001 arcseconds, and the planet Proxima b (a super-earth) would be an order of magnitude smaller than that. You could fit 10000 Proxima b planets into one pixel of a JWST image. Indeed at 7.5 million km from the star, both the planet and the star would fit into a single pixel, as they have an angular separation of 0.04 arcseconds. To illustrate here are the star ""C"" and the planet  ""b"" simulated in a single 0.1 arcsecond pixel (the brown square).  And, zooming in to resolve as disks, here are the star and planet. You can see that resolving details on exoplanets is well beyond current technology.  It is possible that the JWST can do spectrographic analysis of the Proxima system, which could reveal properties of the planet. One of the main science goals is to learn about the physical and chemical properties of planetary systems, and investigate the potential for the origins of life in those systems."
Why are most discovered exoplanets heavier than Earth?,"There are a number of methods of detecting exoplanets, but all of them favour detection of larger planets over smaller ones, albeit for slightly different definitions of large: Radial velocity measurement — this detects the small movement of the star towards and away from us as the planet and the star orbit their mutual barycenter. This movement is fastest when the planet is massive (so the barycenter is further from the center of the star) and close to the star (so the orbital velocity is highest). I also needs the planet's orbit not to be ""face-on"" to the Earth. This method produces measurements for the $mass\times \sin(i)$ since a more massive planet in a less inclined orbit produces the same motion as a less massive planet in a more inclined orbit Transverse displacement — this detects the small movement of the star from side to side (against the background of distant stars) as the planet and the star orbit their mutual barycenter. The displacement is largest when the planet is massive and far from the star (although distant planet require observation over a long period of time).  It works best on stars close to us. Transit — this detects the tiny reduction in the brightness of the star when the planet moves between us. It is more likely to detect large planets, and more likely to notice if the orbital period of the planet is fairly small."
How can a supermassive black hole cause so much energy to enlighten its matter when its massive gravity prevents light to escape?,"It is quite correct that a black hole has so much mass that light cannot escape from a region around the black hole. The edge of this region is called the event horizon. If you cross an event horizon you are never coming back. That applies equally to light, and matter. Around the black hole there may be matter in orbit. Since the Black hole has such strong gravity, the speed of the orbiting matter will be very fast. In fact it will be close to the speed of light. This high speed gives it lots of energy. The matter will form a disc, called an accretion disc, around the black hole, and collisions in this disc will cause the matter to heat up, to millions of degrees. At these temperatures, the disc will glow with X-rays. On the part of the disc closest to the black hole, matter will be falling in from the disc, but before it reaches the black hole it can get enough energy to be ejected out, at very high speed, close to the speed of light. It gets ejected at right angles to the disc, at the poles of the black hole. These are the ""jets"". Intense radiation is produced along these jets. Blazars are distant supermassive black holes with jets that are pointed right at us. So the black hole itself is ""black"", but the matter orbiting around it may be very bright."
Could someone explain RA/dec in simple terms?,"A system projected into the sky Pretend all the stars are painted on the inside of a large ball, and you are at the center of the ball. The imagined ball is called the Celestial Sphere. If the Earth wasn't blocking the lower half of your view, and the Sun wasn't making the blue sky so bright, you would be able to look at the stars in any direction. First, the rotation of the Earth causes the imagined ball of stars to appear to move around the sky. If you lay on your back, (in the norther hemisphere,) with your head to the north, the stars slowly slide by from left to right. There are two points however, where the stars don't appear to move: These two points are directly above the Earth's north and south poles. These two points, projected out into the sky are labeled the North, and South, Celestial Poles. Next, the Earth's equator is projected out into the sky and labeled the Celestial Equator. Finally, sorting out the east-west positioning, (ie left-right if you lay on your back, head to the north), requires an arbitrary selection: There are an infinite number of circles one can imagine drawing on the sky. (For example, small circles the size of the moon, and also many much bigger circles.) The largest circle you can draw is called a ""great circle"", from geometry. Point at the North Celestial Pole, (way above and behind your head if you face south in the northern hemisphere,) and draw a line straight south to the horizon, then down below your feet through the South celestial pole and back up to the North Celestial Pole. You have just drawn one Great Circle, through the Celestial Poles, all the way around the Celestial Sphere. But that Great Circle is just one of an infinite number of similar ones. One could start at the North Celestial Pole and draw a Great Circle a little to the left or the right. So astronomers have chosen one specific Great Circle and labeled one side of that circle as ""zero degrees"" -- or, ""we will start measuring angles from here."" So how do we use this system? ""right ascension"" is measured rightward, (from your left to your right if you face south in the northern hemisphere,) from the zero-degrees half of that chosen great circle. So given a right ascension, one can find the corresponding half of a great circle. For a given right ascension, you have half of circle selected from the North Celestial Pole, to the South Celestial Pole. (This is called a line of equal longitude.) ""declination"" is measured from the Celestial Equator. The Celestial Equator cuts through the middle of your line of longitude. From the Celestial Equator it is 90° northward(+) to the North Celestial Pole, and 90° southward(-) to the South Celestial Pole. So we can measure from +90° (northward) to -90° (southward) along that line of longitude, from the Celestial Equator. (Don't be confused by ""positive declinations""; 45° of declination is northward from the Celestial Equator.) Notice that the system does not depend on where you are standing on Earth, nor on the time of day. If you have a Right Ascension and a Declination, you have an unambiguous spot specified on the Celestial Sphere. The system is actually very simple, but the rotation (time of day) of the Earth, and where you are geographically located needs to also be figured in. What's over my head right now? Face south, (if you're in the northern hemisphere.) What is your latitude -- geographically, how far north are you from the Earth's equator? If you are 40° north, then Celestial declination of 40° north is directly over your head. Declination of 50° is 10° further northward from directly over your head, etc. But for each declination, you have a circle of points in the sky that all have that same declination.  The circle is centered around the celestial poles.  As the earth turns it appears to slowly rotate overhead. Note: If you are at the equator, this circle is just the celestial equator, and it is a great circle.  As you approach either pole, the circle will get smaller.  The poles, this circle collapses to a point.   Right ascension you simply have to look up. That arbitrarily chosen, zero-degree line, appears to spin around the sky every day at the Earth rotates. Also, over the course of a year, the Earth's orbit about the sun makes an extra apparent turn of the sky. (What is overhead mid-winter, is directly under your feet mid-summer!) So there's an offset -- what right ascension is overhead on this date at midnight, and how far (in hours) are we from midnight right now? Combining those two you can figure out what Right Ascension is over head at any time, on any date. (potential editors: I've intentionally not used acronyms for NCP, RA, etc as that makes it more complicated for people learning this material.)"
Speed of light in a black hole,"It doesn't work like that. An observer at the light source (and indeed any observers anywhere else) will always see light travelling (in vacuum) at the speed of light locally. There is also a major problem with your thought experiment. It is not possible for you to have a stationary light source within the event horizon of a black hole. It, and everything else in its vicinity, must be moving inwards. This is as inexorable and unavoidable as is the passage of time for an observer outside the event horizon. In my opinion, the best ""visual"" way of thinking about the situation inside the event horizon is to imagine your photons of light like salmon trying to swimming upstream, whilst you are on a boat flowing with the stream and releasing the salmon into the water. You will always see the salmon swimming at some speed with respect to your boat. Unfortunately if the stream flows fast enough then the salmon will make no progress and you will both be swept over a waterfall (the singularity) a little further downstream. Likewise, your common-sense fails with the situation of firing light towards a black hole. Light is always measured to have a speed of $c$ locally. It is following through with the consequences of this principle that leads to all the weird behaviour that black holes exhibit."
What would the effects be on Earth if Jupiter was turned into a star?,"Before I start, I'll admit that I've criticized the question based on its improbability; however, I've been persuaded otherwise. I'm going to try to do the calculations based on completely different formulas than I think have been used; I hope you'll stay with me as I work it out. Let's imagine that Lucifer becomes a main-sequence star - in fact, let's call it a low-mass red dwarf. Main-sequence stars follow the mass-luminosity relation: $$\frac{L}{L_\odot} = \left(\frac{M}{M_\odot}\right)^a$$ Where $L$ and $M$ are the star's luminosity and mass, and $L_\odot$ and $M_\odot$ and the luminosity and mass of the Sun. For stars with $M < 0.43M_\odot$, $a$ takes the value of 2.3. Now we can plug in Jupiter's mass ($1.8986 \times 10 ^{27}$ kg) into the formula, as well as the Sun's mass ($1.98855 \times 10 ^ {30}$ kg) and luminosity ($3.846 \times 10 ^ {26}$ watts), and we get  $$\frac{L}{3.846 \times 10 ^ {26}} = \left(\frac{1.8986 \times 10 ^ {27}}{1.98855 \times 10 ^ {30}}\right)^{2.3}$$ This becomes $$L = \left(\frac{1.8986 \times 10 ^ {27}}{1.98855 \times 10 ^ {30}}\right)^{2.3} \times 3.846 \times 10 ^ {26}$$ which then becomes $$L = 4.35 \times 10 ^ {19}$$ watts. Now we can work out the apparent brightness of Lucifer, as seen from Earth. For that, we need the formula $$m = m_\odot - 2.5 \log \left(\frac {L}{L_\odot}\left(\frac {d_\odot}{d}\right) ^ 2\right)$$ where $m$ is the apparent magnitude of the star, $m_\odot$ is the apparent magnitude of the Sun, $d_\odot$ is the distance to the Sun, and $d$ is the distance to the star. Now, $m = -26.73$ and $d(s)$ is 1 (in astronomical units). $d$ varies. Jupiter is about 5.2 AU from the Sun, so at its closest distance to Earth, it would be ~4.2 AU away. We plug these numbers into the formula, and find $$m = -6.25$$ which is a lot less brighter than the Sun. Now, when Jupiter is farthest away from the Sun, it is ~6.2 AU away. We plug that into the formula, and find $$m = -5.40$$ which is dimmer still - although, of course, Jupiter would be completely blocked by the Sun. Still, for finding the apparent magnitude of Jupiter at some distance from Earth, we can change the above formula to  $$m = -26.73 - 2.5 \log \left(\frac {4.35 \times 10 ^ {19}}{3.846 \times 10 6 {26}}\left(\frac {1}{d}\right) ^ 2\right)$$ By comparison, the Moon can have an average apparent magnitude of -12.74 at full moon - much brighter than Lucifer. The apparent magnitude of both bodies can, of course, change - Jupiter by transits of its moon, for example - but these are the optimal values. While the above calculations really don't answer most parts of your question, I hope it helps a bit. And please, correct me if I made a mistake somewhere. LaTeX is by no means my native language, and I could have gotten something wrong. I hope this helps. Edit The combined brightness of Lucifer and the Sun would depend on the angle of the Sun's rays and Lucifer's rays. Remember how we have different seasons because of the tilt of the Earth's axis? Well, the added heat would have to do with the tilt of Earth's and Lucifer's axes relative to one another. I can't give you a numerical result, but I can add that I hope it wouldn't be too much hotter than it is now, as I'm writing this! Second Edit Like I said in a comment somewhere on this page, the mass-luminosity relation really only works for main-sequence stars. If Lucifer was not on the main sequence. . . Well, then none of my calculations would be right."
Are heavy elements equally distributed throughout the Solar System?,"Initially, in the protostellar disc, the heavy chemical elements would have been uniformly distributed with radial distance from the Sun, with a mean abundance that is similar to that present in the Sun today (with one or two exceptions like lithium). But after that there are various processes that act to concentrate or deplete heavier elements, or materials that incorporate those heavy elements. The net outcome is that planets in the inner Solar System have a much higher fraction of heavy elements than the outer bodies in the Solar System. The gas giants Jupiter and Saturn have the lowest fraction of heavy elements. The most important of segregation mechanism is that in the inner Solar System, the only solids that can form would be those that involve heavier elements like iron, silicon and magnesium. These would combine with oxygen (a quite abundant heavy element) to form silicates, and other minerals. ""Lighter"" and more volatile solids such as ices (water, carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane) could only form in the cooler conditions further out beyond what is called the snowline (or frost line) at around 3 au from the Sun. In the inner Solar System, the planets form from the coagulation of this solid material and conditions were too hot for those solid bodies to retain hydrogen and helium gas and thus they are depleted of these elements. In the outer Solar System, bodies could incorporate both rocky and icy solid bodies and then they could also rapidly capture and retain the abundant hydrogen and helium gas that was around them and this would form the bulk of their mass. Thus the giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn have an overall abundance that is quite similar to the original solar nebula (and the Sun itself). The less massive ""ice giants"" (Uranus and Neptune) likely formed in an environment where they were unable to capture very much gas before the primordial disk was dissipated, so they still retain an ""icy"" abundance pattern. The same is true for a lot of the smaller outer Solar System bodies - they are  a mixture of rock and ice and were never large enough to capture a significant amount of hydrogen/helium gas. Note though, that because Jupiter and Saturn likely have solid cores that incorporate 10-20 Earth-masses worth of solid rocky/icy material, that even though the overall fraction of heavy elements is low, the absolute mass of heavy elements  in the cores of the giant planets is probably greater than the sum of what is in the inner Solar System."
"By putting a mirror in space, would we be able to see into the past?","I think the question is referring to situating a very large mirror in space facing earth.  If we were to put it several light minutes away, then events occurring opposite the mirror could be reviewed de novo with more preparation upon the warning we received upon the first light of the event arriving at earth. For example, a supernova going off in M31 might not be under observation at the moment its light first arrives, and so the initial observations might be lost.  However, with a mirror facing M31, we would be able to observe that mirror as the event unfolded, having been warned that there was something worth watching, in advance. Nice idea!  But it would likely be much less expensive to simply have multiple telescopes always watching ""prime"" starscape for unexpected events."
What does forward modeling mean?,"There are different ways to model something. From what you're asking, there are two main types of modeling: forward modeling and inverse modeling. Forward Modeling In this type of modeling, you have a specific model that defines the ""current"" state of your system. In the case of exoplanet atmospheres, it'd likely be something that defines the molecular content, ionization level, density, etc. of your exoplanet atmosphere. Then, you use the known physics/math of your system to decide how it will behave. In this setup, what you've created is a system for predicting system states from a predetermined physics model. Such an example would be someone creating their own atmosphere of an exoplanet in a model and then saying, okay what happens when I shine light through this atmosphere. What observations might I record? Inverse Modeling In some sense this is the opposite of forward modeling, albeit it doesn't really mean you're running a model to see into the past. Instead, what happens with this setup is you know a particular state or result, and you want to construct a model of your system which can produce said state. Essentially, you want your model to arrive at a certain state when it is done calculating. If it does, you have a reasonable confidence that your model was some indication of what your system is actually like. In this situation, you'd measure components of the atmosphere, e.g. the radius of the planet as a function of wavelength, and then create a model of the atmosphere which can hopefully reproduce your observations. If you can, then the hope is that the model accurately represents what your system is."
Is S2 still the fastest known star in the galaxy?,"S0-2 (I assume you mean the star orbiting the Milky Way central black hole) actually reaches speeds of 7650 km/s at periapsis. However, if you read further down the wikipedia article you will see that there are stars S0-102 and S62 which have shorter orbital periods than S0-2 (11.5 and 9.2 years vs 16.05 years). Star S62 is also in a highly elliptical orbit ($e=0.976$, Peißker et al. 2020) and has a periapsis distance that is even closer to the black hole than S0-2, where it has a speed clocking in at about 30,000 km/s$^{1}$. No actual value or error bar is given in the paper. The plot shows its orbit (in red) compared with other stars in the region. STOP PRESS A telegram issued by Peißker et al. 2020 claims detection of a new winner - S4714. They appear to have revised downwards their estimate of the peri-centre speed of S62 to 20,000 km/s and say that this new, very faint object, has a peri-centre speed of 24,000 km/s.  $^1$ Of course that is the speed as seen by a distant observer. If you were to go there and put a speed gun on it as it went past, then it would be a touch larger."
What is the difference between gas and dust in astronomy?,"Yes, metals and other elements and molecules can exist in gaseous form under the right conditions of temperature and pressure. A ""gas"" is simply one of the fundamental states of matter, as in solid, liquid, or gas (and a few other states outside the scope of this question). But as a gas, these substances exist entirely as either individual atoms, individual elemental molecules, or individual compound molecules of multiple atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). Dust, on the other hand, is comprised of tiny particulate matter that has undergone the stronger intermolecular bonds to create substances like ice, silicates, and carbon compounds that float around in varying densities between the stars and between the galaxies. Since these particles are still extremely small (typically a fraction of a micron across), they can appear to be a gas, but these tiny, irregularly-shaped objects still exist individually in a solid or liquid state."
Doesn't gravity attract objects in space until they collide?,"When an object is in orbit, there are two factors at play, not just one. The first, as you mention, is the force of gravity pulling the objects together. However, each object also has a momentum component which is generally (in the case of circular orbits) perpendicular to the direction of the gravity. If we look at the common situation of a small-mass object orbiting a large (massive) object, then we can ignore the perpendicular velocity (momentum) component of the larger object and reach a simplification: The smaller object is continually pulled towards the primary but perpetually 'misses' due to its own perpendicular momentum."
Why did the distribution of asteroids discovered in 2010 have a radial modulation?,"I'm pretty sure that the radial pattern found in the data is a result of WISE's approximately 90 minute sampling cadence (dictated by the satellite's orbit), astrometric precision (about 0.2 arcseconds in the stacked images around launch, see Wright et al. 2010), and the number of free parameters in fitting the asteroid orbits based on that data. See, in the actual images the asteroids appear as points of light that shift appreciably between frames. IIRC, they expected 7 to 12 observations per asteroid. So you have 10-ish observations spanning 15 hours or so to fix the asteroid's orbital parameters around the sun. As you can imagine, there will be more parameters than can be perfectly fit with a single pass in this data set alone. At a guess: it's related to quantization in uncertainty estimates and how that feeds forward into the orbit fitting algorithm. I don't know the details behind the striping, but I'd bet it's related to the numerical precision used in the early processing of the data. They've either refined the orbits since using observations from passes separated by ~6 months, or modified how they're handling the numerical precision in their astrometric measurements since. More likely the former, but I'm sure if you asked Amy Mainzer (PI of NEOWISE, and head of the asteroid hunting part of the mission), Roc Cutri (head of the database creation and data processing part of the team), or any of the people on Mainzer's team, they could tell you more. Relevant background: I was Ned Wright's grad student (original PI of WISE), and he had me design and test an asteroid hunting algorithm in the run-up to launch (we ultimately didn't use it - it scaled like $N^2$, IIRC, and existing efforts in the literature scaled like $\log(N)$ or $N\log(N)$). I ended up working with the extragalctic part of the team, hence my uncertainty on the precise details of what the solar system team did. I think I asked them about the striping during a presentation, but I don't recall the answer, so I'm pretty sure the answer was mundane and unavoidable. "
Is there an upper limit on the mass of black hole mergers we can detect?,"It is quite likely there is an astrophysical upper limit to the mass of a black hole that can be produced during the core collapse of a massive star, caused by the pair instability supernova phenomenon. There isn't an observational bias against detecting more massive black holes in the range of 100 to a few hundred $M_{\odot}$. Details: The frequency of the gravitational waves is twice the orbital frequency of the binary system. The general scenario is that early in their evolution, a mrging binary system will be orbiting at relatively long periods (seconds !), but as gravitational waves take energy out of the orbit, the system becomes more compact, the orbital period gets smaller and the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves goes up. This continues until the black holes get so close together that their event horizons merge. Very roughly, we can derive (from Kepler's third law, not going into detail), using Keplerian orbits
$$ f_{\rm max} \sim \left( \frac{GM}{\pi^2 a_{\rm merge}^3} \right)^{1/2}\ ,$$
where $f_{\rm max}$ is the peak frequency at merger (when the gravitational wave signal is also maximised), $a_{\rm merge}$ is the separation of the masses at merger and $M$ is the total mass of both black holes. If we let $a_{\rm merge} \sim 2GM/c^2$, the sum of the two Schwarzschild radii of the black holes, then
$$f_{\rm max} \sim \frac{c^3}{GM} \left( \frac{1}{8\pi^2}\right)^{1/2} \sim 2\times 10^4 \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^{-1}\ {\rm Hz}$$ Now, LIGO is limited to observing frequencies above about 20 Hz. The sensitivity drops off rapidly below that because of seismic noise and other factors. If the mass of the merging black holes exceeds some critical value then the frequencies of the gravitational waves they produce never get into the sensitivity wndow of LIGO. Using the expression above, we can estimate that this happens only if the total mass exceeds $1000 M_{\odot}$. Observing the mergers of more massive black holes would require a detector that is sensitive to lower frequencies, probably beyond the surface of the Earth (e.g. LISA). This calculation is only good to a factor of 2 or so, but we can check it. GW150914 had a total mass of around $65 M_{\odot}$ and merged at frequencies of about 120 Hz. Since $f_{\rm max}$ scales as $M^{-1}$ this suggests 360 solar mass mergers should be just about detectable, but clearly demonstrates that LIGO could detect black holes of 100-200 solar masses. What's more, at a given distance and frequency, the signals from such mergers would be more powerful than for less massive black holes -- something like $h \propto M^{5/3}$, which means the volume in which the mergers would be visible goes as $M^5$. Thus more massive black hole binaries would have to be extremely rare in order to have evaded detection. The astrophyscal reason for an upper limit is the pehenomenon of  pair instability supernovae (e.g. Farmer et al. 2019), which blows the star apart rather than leaving a black hole (or any other kind) of remnant. This likely happens for stars with initial masses of $130+\ M_{\odot}$, and means that leaving behind black holes with $M > 50M_{\odot}$ is very difficult, with even lower mass limits for stars with a metallicity more similar to the Sun, since they lose more mass in stellar winds during their lives. For initial masses of $250+ M_{\odot}$ it is possible that the pair instability supernova mechanism ceases and direct collapse to a black hole becomes possible. In which case their might be a population of $300+ M_{\odot}$ mergers that are just below LIGO's sensitivity window. New Earth-based gravitational wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer aim to push their low frequency response down to a few Hz and might be capable of detecting mergers in the 300-1000$M_{\odot}$ range. This means you could not get a merger pair between about $100 M_{\odot}$ and $300 M_{\odot}$ (unless they themselves were the products of a merger)."
Existence of gravitons?,"Gravity is a fictitious force, actually, much like centrifugal force.  In a free falling frame of reference it disappears.  In general relativity (GR) gravity is just a result of (differential) geometry: space-time curvature.  The inverse square law is just the low energy approximation, but the actual equation for gravity derived from GR is more complex than that.  The massive success of Newtonian gravity tells us that any model of gravity must be approximated by the classical inverse square law at low energies. Whether GR does that by (Einstein's) design or something else is a matter of personal opinion.  Einstein definitely knew he had to get approximately Newtonian gravity at low energies, so he would have discarded or modified any ideas that failed this criterion.  However, there are standard arguments for why gravity must obey an inverse square law, at least in low energy situations. Now in GR a lot more than just mass contributes to the gravitational field.  Spin and electric charge, for example, and quite importantly: energy (the famous $E=mc^2$ tells us how to express a mass as energy, so we can treat these things on a common footing).  So, yes, all forces and particles contribute to gravity.  Even photons. GR itself makes no predictions (or requirements) for the existence of any new particles outside of the standard model, such as gravitons.  GR and quantum mechanics (QM) are famously incompatible: in extreme situations where both GR and QM are relevant (neutron stars and black hole formation, for example), they stop making sense rather quickly.  Especially GR.  ""Gravitons"" and assorted variations are hypothetical particles that are proposed to resolve this issue by creating a quantum theory of gravity.  The only ""evidence"" we have for them at this stage is that our two most massively successful theories about the workings of the universe, GR and QM, are so painfully incompatible.  So we know these theories are flawed (aka wrong) and that some other theory is necessary that can handle these situations, while also incorporating all of the successes of QM and GR—they're amazingly accurate when only one of them is particularly relevant, after all. Exactly what that theory is is an ongoing and substantial research area."
Do Schwarzschild black holes exist in reality?,"No, Schwarzschild black holes probably do not exist. We expect astrophysical black holes to be Kerr black holes, and we expect that most of them have a lot of spin. As the diagram at the end of this answer shows, supermassive black holes generally spin at relativistic speeds. Stellar mass black holes are formed in core-collapse supernovae. They can also form when a neutron star collides with its companion (which could be another neutron star or a normal star); neutron stars are also formed in core-collapse supernova events. Collapses and collisions (of course) conserve angular momentum, and many young neutron stars are pulsars, spinning many times per second. However, some of that angular momentum may be carried away by the ejecta of the supernova explosion. It appears that core collapse can be highly asymmetric, which can give the remnant considerable proper motion, a phenomenon known as a pulsar kick: A pulsar kick is the name of the phenomenon that often causes a neutron star to move with a different, usually substantially greater, velocity than its progenitor star. The cause of pulsar kicks is unknown, but many astrophysicists believe that it must be due to an asymmetry in the way a supernova explodes. If true, this would give information about the supernova mechanism. It's not easy to detect an isolated inactive black hole, or to determine its angular momentum. And if the black hole is active, the accretion disk will have high angular momentum simply due to its orbital speed, even if the spin of the black hole itself is relatively slow. So why do we study Schwarzschild black holes? For the same reason we study Special Relativity even though spacetime is generally not flat. You need to thoroughly understand flat spacetime before you try to learn General Relativity. And you need to understand the Schwarzschild metric before you add the extra complexity that spin brings to the picture. Besides, the Schwarzschild solution is a useful model for any spherical body with relatively low spin, it doesn't only apply to black holes. Thus you can use it (for example) to calculate the gravitational time dilation on the surface of the Earth. As jawheele mentions in the comments, real black holes aren't exactly Kerr black holes either. The Kerr solution, like the Schwarzschild solution, is an eternal vacuum solution to the Einstein Field Equations. And we don't expect real black holes that formed through astrophysical processes to be the multi-universe gateways that the Penrose diagram indicates. Bear in mind that we need a quantum gravity theory to properly talk about what happens at the core of a black hole, and even with such a theory we cannot empirically validate its predictions directly because we cannot extract information from the other side of the event horizon(s)."
What causes fast moving pulsars to move so fast?,"The most likely scenario is that an asymmetry in the supernova explosion  imparts momentum to the proto neutron star at its core. The issue is not settled. A recent study by Verbunt et al. (2017) models the 
speed distribution of young pulsars as the sum of two Maxwellian distributions, one with an average speed of $\sim 130$ km/s and the other with an average speed $\sim 520$ km/s. About 30% of the population are in the low speed  population and only a few percent have speeds below 60 km/s.. A plot of the (model) distribution is shown in Fig.9 of that paper. Why do some pulsars move so fast? Conservation of momentum. Pulsars are neutron stars with mass about $1.5 M_{\odot}$, born at the heart of core-collapse supernovae. A 500 km/s speed corresponds to a kinetic energy of about $4\times 10^{41}$ J and a linear momentum of $1.5\times 10^{36}$ kg m/s, but during the supernova, approximately $10^{46}$ J is made available when the core collapses from about the size of the Earth to a ball of neutrons 20 km across. Thus only a tiny fraction of this energy needs to be given to the neutron star to accelerate it to high speeds. Most of the energy in a supernova is released as almost massless neutrinos from the core. In order of magnitude terms, the neutrinos carry away a linear momentum of $\sim E/c = 3.3\times 10^{37}$ kg m/s. If there were a small asymmetry in how these neutrinos escaped - i.e. more in one direction than another, then conservation of momentum would demand that the core moves in the opposite direction. To match the observed linear momentum of fast moving neutron stars would demand
a directional asymmetry of neutrino emission of $\sim 5$%, (which seems unlikely and may require magnetic fields of $10^{12}$ T -  Nardi & Zuluaga 2001 ). A better idea might be that in the initial stages of the collapse, the core material is opaque to neutrinos and it could be that there is an asymmetry in the way the neutrinos break out of the absorbing material (e.g. Nordhaus et al. 2012). Alternatives are that there are instabilities in the final phases of nuclear burning, just prior to the core collapse. These instabilities cause the core to wobble back and forth and when the supernova happens, the core just happens to be travelling one way or another. There have also been suggestions that asymmetric radiation from the pulsar itself could gradually accelerate it to the speeds observed."
Why is the Moon receding from the Earth due to tides? Is this typical for other moons?,"It's pretty simple, actually.  The Moon creates tides. Due to tides, the water bulges out towards the Moon (and also on the opposite side). But the Earth also rotates pretty fast (once a day), faster than the Moon orbits the Earth (once a month). There's friction between the rotating Earth, and the watery bulge created by tides. The rotation of the Earth ""wants"" to rotate the bulge faster. In effect, the rotation of the Earth drags the tidal bulge forward - the bulge is always a bit ahead of the Moon. When the Moon is at meridian, the tide is already decreasing. So there's a bit of extra watery mass on Earth, a little bit ahead of the Moon. This watery bulge interacts gravitationally with the Moon. This has two effects: When you dump energy of motion into an orbiting body, it settles into a higher orbit - higher orbit means more energy. Therefore, the transfer of energy from Earth' spin to Moon's orbit gradually makes Moon's orbit larger and larger. This only happens because the Earth is spinning faster than the Moon orbits it. If the Earth was tidally locked to the Moon (spinning exactly as fast as the Moon orbits it), then no transfer would happen. If the Earth was spinning slower than the Moon's orbit, then the transfer would be opposite (from Moon's orbital motion to Earth's spin). Note: Counterintuitively, a satellite with more energy actually moves slower, but in a higher orbit. The extra energy goes into raising the orbit, not into making its speed faster. Why this happens exactly is a whole 'nother discussion."
Why will HD 84406 be chosen as the first target for testing JWST?,"The most important selection criterion is that the star should be available for observation for a prolonged time. Because James Webb observes in the infrared, it must hide the Sun (and Earth and the Moon) behind its sunshield, and can hence only observe some 39% of the sky at any given time (source: NASA). Webb needs around three months for its optical alignment, so we need a star that has just entered its field of view$^\dagger$. In addition to this, we also don't want a star in a field that is too crowded, and HD 84406 is located in a rather isolated region in the NW part of Ursa Major: 
Credit: IAU/S&T/Roger Sinnott/Rick Fienberg with my own annotations. The star should be bright, but probably not too bright (like Betelgeuse), since we don't want to burn MIRI off from the beginning. EDIT: After discussing with several colleagues, damaging MIRI permanently is probably not going to be an issue. Bright sources can however damage the detector temporarily, showing a ""ghost image"" of the star in subsequent exposures. I've done that myself on a 1.5 m Earth-based telescope, and JWST has a ~20 times larger area, and ~10 times higher resolution, meaning several 1000 times more photons per pixel. Anyway, as you see there are some important constraints, but many other stars would fit as well; there are quite a lot to choose from. And the best part: HD 84406 is a magnitude 6.9 star, so while you can't see it with your naked eye, it should be visible in a pair of regular binoculars. $\dagger$Stars too close to the ecliptic are only available for a more limited time, so a star that is close to the poles is preferred."
Is Sun a part of a binary system?,"There is no observational evidence that the sun is a member of a binary (trinary, or more) star system, where ""star"" means an object that is at least ~80 times the mass of jupiter and emits energy/light via standard hydrogen fusion. Some evidence that people point to is that the majority of stars in the Galaxy (perhaps 60% or so) are binary.  However, that does not mean that we are a binary system, just that we are among those which are not. There is the Nemesis star idea which was a hypothetical binary companion to the sun to account for periodic mass extinctions roughy every 26 million years (as in, the two stars would therefore be on a 26 million year period, so the companion is a few light-years away).  There are two problems with that:  First, that a 2010 reanalysis of the data showed that it was too periodic over the past 500 million years, during which time we've gone around the galaxy twice, and so our hypothetical binary orbits should have been perturbed and not be perfect (though others say that the precision of the geologic timescale isn't good enough to say this).  But, second, we can see stars out to a few light years -- we can see small, faint stars out to thousands of light years.  We have all-sky infrared surveys that should be able to pick up the faintest even star-like objects to at least a few light-years, and yet ... nothing. The other problem is what LDC3 pointed out in their answer: We should see some systematic motion of our own star in orbit around the common center of mass of the hypothetical binary.  This would not be a yearly wobble, but rather it would be a slow motion of the entire sky on top of the other >1 year motions that we see.  We now have very accurate astronomical records dating back at least a century of star positions, especially close stars.  Even if we were on a 26 million year orbit - and especially one much shorter as some people claim - we should see effectively that our star is making a small arc, a part of a circle as it orbits the center of mass of it and the binary.  We don't.  There does not seem to be any systematic signal in the motions of stars that require the binary star model. So, to summarize: A binary companion simply lacks any observational data; if it existed, we should not only have been able to see it by now, but we should also observe not only the stars in our sky show a systematic motion due to our orbit around it, but we should again see THAT binary star also move very quickly, relative to other stars, as it orbits the common center of mass."
Should I focus more on Aperture or Focal Length for a telescope?,"There is one rule that is generally true for all deep sky objects (nebulae, stars, galaxies,...): Aperture matters! For solar system objects, aperture is not that important.  The second most important thing is: What size are the objects you want to look at: Small objects need long focal lengths and high magnifications, large objects need short aperture for low magnifications. With 400mm you could watch objects like: With 900mm you could watch objects like Note that 60 and 70mm aperture are still very small for telescopes! The aperture influences two things: The magnification is created by the eyepiece. E.g. when you have a 400mm focal length telescope and use a 10mm eyepiece, you get 400mm/10mm = 40x magnification. Note: the shorter the eyepiece focal length, the more difficult it is to build. Good 5mm eyepieces can cost 100 USD and up. I personally started with a 750mm Newtonian with 150mm aperture and 25mm and 10mm eyepieces. That's a good allrounder, even though planets will appear rather small with the 10mm eyepiece. But you can later invest more money in good eyepieces, which you can re-use on better telescopes which you may buy later on. Edit: One more thing -- the telescope mount is equally important as are the eyepieces and the telescope itself. A mount that fits the telescope easily is as expensive as the optical tube assembly itself. Hence many beginners start out with a Dobson telescope, which uses a very, very simple yet sturdy mount."
Why can't supermassive black holes merge? (or can they?),"The main problem is angular momentum. In order for two gravitationally bound objects to merge (whether black holes, supermassive black holes, planets, stars, etc.), they must shed enough angular momentum for their orbital separation to become small enough.  Average orbital separation (semi-major axis) is determined entirely from the angular momentum of the orbit (at least in classical mechanics; I don't know if that is true for relativistic situations such as merging black holes when they get close together).  Removal of angular momentum requires interactions with other objects. When two galaxies merge, their supermassive black holes both have angular momentum.  Through a phenomenon known as ""dynamical friction,"" gravitational interactions with other stars sap the black holes of much of their angular momentum, until they are brought within a few parsecs or so of each other.  At this point, the black holes have flung out all of the stars that were in the region and there is (presumably) nothing left for dynamical friction to sap their angular momentum.  Once the black holes are close enough (I don't know off the top of my head how close), emission of gravitational waves will sap the orbiting pair of their remaining angular momentum and a merger becomes inevitable. So to answer your question, the reason for supermassive black holes to be unable to merge is that they are too close together for there to be any remaining material (stars, gas, etc.) in the center of the galaxy to remove angular momentum from the orbiting pair, having already removed the material themselves, but are not close enough for emission of gravitational waves to remove angular momentum fast enough for their merger to occur any time soon (in an astronomical sense)."
Why is Jupiter's Great Red Spot reddish?,"It's red because it's a 'sunburn'. The clouds in the red spot reach to higher altitudes than the surrounding ones and are more exposed to solar UV radiation, which in turn changes the structure of some of the organic molecules etc. This is at least the explanation suggested by recent data from NASA's Cassini mission, see this 5-day-old press release."
Is there any point on earth where the moon stays below the horizon for an extended period of time?,"Depends on the interpretation of your question...
The best places not to observe the moon are the north and south pole. On the north pole you will only be able to see objects above the celestial equator. As the moon orbits the Earth in one month its orbit is inclined from the celestial equator. This inclination is almost the same as the inclination of the ecliptic (path of the Sun) with the celestial equator. The ecliptic crosses the equator at two opposite points on the celestial sphere. This means that for about half its orbit, the Sun, and as the moon's orbit is near the ecliptic, also the Moon, will be above the ecliptic and therefore visible from the north pole. That being said, the Moon does not follow the ecliptic precisely as the moon's orbit is inclined from the ecliptic by about 5°. The inclination of the ecliptic is 23°, so during very special circumstances the maximum altitude of the Moon above the horizon on the North pole will be 18° during one month. The duration that the Moon will be above the horizon on the north pole will be about 10 days (a guess) about 13.6 days (edit:see comments below). So if we interpret your question as: Is there a place where the Moon will be below the horizon for a long period of time (> 1 month), then the answer is NO. But if this happens near June, then the Sun will also be above the horizon at the north pole (for six months), and as the Moon will be close to the Sun (as it follows more or less the ecliptic), it will be very hard to see the Moon during that time. So if you specifically ask whether the Moon will not be visible for an extended period of time, then the answer is YES. And there are of course also places with perpetual cloud cover ;-)"
What is the distance that the Moon travels during one orbit around the Earth?,"The Moon has an orbital eccentricity of 0.0549, so its path around the Earth is not perfectly circular and the distance between the Earth and the Moon will vary from the Earth's frame of reference (Perigee at 363,295 km and apogee at 405,503 km), see for example second animation explaining Lunar librations in this answer. But its orbit can be said, in an oversimplified manner, to be periodic, with no significant apsidal precession (not really true, but somewhat irrelevant for my following musings here to be still close enough), so we can calculate its orbital length based on its quoted average orbital speed of 1.022 km/s and orbital period of 27.321582 days. So, plugging our numbers in a calculator, $l = v * t$, we get the Moon's orbital length of 2,412,517.5 km (or 1,499,070 miles). Should be close enough. Source of all orbital elements of the Moon is Wikipedia on Moon."
"""Next Generation Arecibo Telescope (NGAT)... would combine a 314-metre-wide platform with a swarm of 9-metre dishes on top"" What would that look like?","There are a few diagrams in the original white paper (Anish Roshi et al. 2021; see Fig. 11) and the revised NGAT-130 proposal (Anish Roshi et al. 2023; see Fig. 3), depicting the basic arrangement. Here's Fig. 11 from the first paper, showing the telescope as viewed from the top (left image) and side (right image, shown with only a few dishes installed). The plate looks more like an oval than a circle, but I believe a circular plate would be more representative of the actual design.  Here's an artist's impression from a talk by some of the scientists behind the idea (see 54:30 for a broader set of designs and 55:05 for the then-final design). The blue dome isn't meant to be real, but rather to represent radio frequency interference mitigation techniques:  Some variations (like the one shown above) had the small dishes embedded in the plate, while others had them mounted firmly above it, but the basic principles are the same. Versions of this configuration are already in use on smaller scales; both AMiBA and Pluton have been using it for decades. Both of these depict the original design of the NGAT: a 314-meter-wide plate with 1,112 9-meter dishes. However, this subsequently evolved into the NGAT-130, a 146-meter-wide plate with 102 13-meter dishes. While smaller, it would be more cost-effective and would still satisfy most of the scientific and technical requirements put forth in the white paper. It could also, potentially, be used as a precursor to a larger instrument like the original NGAT design. One reason for the array-on-a-plate idea instead of a single dish is that it provides better sky coverage. For atmospheric studies, the NGAT would need to cover zenith angles as large as 45$^{\circ}$, which is very hard to do with a single dish, even with a deformable secondary reflector. There were also issues of limited transmitting power for radar studies. The coverage issue could be circumvented by a tight array of small dishes, but changing orientations of dishes relative to one another in such an arrangement would make it difficult to predict the radiation pattern due to interactions between antennas. It turns out that small dishes mounted on a steerable plate and oriented in the same direction allow for larger zenith angles (up to 80$^{\circ}$ with the NGAT-130!) without the pattern issues. The NGAT site could be in a variety of places and the design doesn't necessitate that it be built at Arecibo; however, natural RFI shielding from the karst hills around the site and the fact that it is located in a special RFI coordination zone mean that it has a leg up on other options."
When was the martian dichotomy first observed?,"It looks like the Mariner 9 era. Based on a review paper by Watters et al. (""Hemispheres Apart: The Crustal Dichotomy on Mars""):  ""The north-south asymmetry ... was clear from the first global image mosaics of Mars returned in the 1970s by Mariner 9 (Mutch et al., 1976) and the Viking Orbiters.""  Other papers cite a 1973 paper by Hartmann (""Martian cratering 4, Mariner 9 initial analysis of cratering chronology"") as one of the first papers to describe it, but it’s still based on Mariner 9 images. I suppose in hindsight one could look at earlier flyby imagery and see that there is a dichotomy, but with 23 images from the first flyby, that's hardly representative of the surface and not enough to draw such conclusions.  Similarly, one could probably look at Earth-based telescopic observations from before the Space Age and retrofit observations into a north-south dichotomy paradigm, but I don't think one could legitimately claim earlier discovery of it. So, 1971-1972 (Mariner 9 entered orbit in late 1971)."
Explosions of black holes,"What this video is talking about is Hawking Radiation, as you've linked. Hawking Radiation is a proposed hypothetical (by no means verified or proven) way for a black hole to radiate its energy into space. The basic idea is that a black hole is nothing but mass/energy compressed to an infinitesimal point, which is radiating its energy into space over time. For large black holes (such as solar mass or bigger), this radiation process is tiny and the time taken to leak all the black hole's energy into space (and thus for the black hole to ""evaporate"") is exceedingly long. For tiny black holes however, the time to radiate all the black hole's energy is exceedingly short. You can calculate how long it will take for a black hole of mass $m$ to evaporate (and release all its mass/energy) with the equation $$t_{\text{ev}} = \frac{5120\pi G^2 m^3}{\hbar c^4} = (8.41\times 10^{-17}\:\mathrm{s}\:\mathrm{kg}^{-3})\:m^3$$ For $m = 5\:\mathrm{g}=0.005\:\mathrm{kg}$, you get $t_{\text{ev}} \simeq 4\times10^{-19}\:\mathrm{s}$. Now that means in this tiny amount of time, the black hole will radiate all of its mass/energy away and completely evaporate. But the output of all the energy in 5 g of mass is a huge output. Putting out 450 Terajoules of energy in $10^{-19}\:\mathrm{s}$ is basically just an explosion. You can determine the total energy output from the famous equation $$E=mc^2$$ Just plug in $m = 0.005\:\mathrm{kg}$ and $c = 3\times 10^8\:\mathrm{m/s}$ and you'll get $E=4.5\times 10^{14}\:\mathrm{J} = 450\:\mathrm{Terajoules}$. So in short, hypothetical calculations (not even theory at this point) suggest that a tiny black hole with the mass of a nickel would immediately explode out in a huge amount of energy. Whether such a black hole can form, or if such an evaporation would/could occur is still highly debated and ultimately unknown at this point."
What is behind the Great Red Spot's longevity?,"Standard answers, as found  here, (partial quote) Unlike Jupiter, the Earth has land masses that cause major storms to
lose energy due to friction with a solid surface. Without this
feature, Jupiter’s storms are more long-lasting. However, the Great
Red Spot is long-lived, even by Jupiter standards. Researchers don’t
quite understand why, but we do know that Jupiter’s storms that are
located in cloud bands with the same direction of rotation tend to be
longer lasting. So, we know some of the probable reasons, and don't know the full story yet.  Keep in mind that the current RedSpot might be a 3-sigma event, even for Jupiter."
Why did this meteor appear cyan?,"The colour of a meteor depends mostly on its chemical composition emission spectrum. To simplify magnesium meteors are noted to have an emission spectrum which results in blue to green colour. Changing factors like adding additional metals and the speed of the meteor could results in a cyan meteor compared to a blue one. Source:

Will new stars stop forming at some point of time?,"Cosmic GDP has already crashed, as Peak Star was ~11 billion years ago.
 According to Sobral et al's prediction, the future star production by mass will give only 5% of the stars in the universe today, ""even if we wait forever."" More theoretical predictions, such as this one, suggest that nebulae will run out of hydrogen on the order of $10^{13}$ years, while star formation will occasionally happen due to collision of brown dwarfs until somewhere on the order of $10^{14}$ years. Of course, hydrogen itself may have a finite lifetime. The half-life of a proton is experimentally known to be longer than $10^{34}$ years, but it may still be quite finite."
How many sun-like stars are there in the universe?,"This is a question that concerns the initial mass function (IMF) - an empirical (that is, defined by observations rather than theory) function that describes the statistical distribution of stellar masses. Edwin Salpeter (1955) was the first to describe the IMF, though if you read Chabrier (2003) there are some reasonably comprehensive explanations of the theory and history. However, these lecture notes are a fair bit more accessible. From the approximations in the UCSC lecture notes I linked above, I get that around 4% of stars are between 0.7 and 1.3 solar masses (92% are between 0.1 and 0.7 solar masses!). There are perhaps 100 billion stars in a galaxy and 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe, giving something on the order of $4\times 10^{20}$ (400 billion billion) stars that are about ($\pm 30\%$) one solar mass."
What earth organisms might survive if they arrived on Mars?,"On the surface of Mars probably none, since it's too dry or too cold, or both, to stay active. Spores or other dormant forms probably could survive for centuries, until radiation will gradually destroy the organic molecules necessary to get back into an active state. But there are ""Mars Special Regions"", where either Earth microbes or potential Martian microbes - if some exist - cannot be ruled out to be able to spread. Things might look quite different in the underground, especially in warm and wet zones, which may exist by geothermal heat and ground water.
There, at least lithotrophic bacteria/""chemolithoautotrophs"" could survive and spread.
Those could then form a basis for a food chain of other organisms. Plants dependent on sunlight, or animals dependent on oxygen would hardly survive. For a list of species, see table 2 on page 895 of the above reference paper. The following species and genera are mentioned in the table:
Psychromonas ingrahamii, Planococcus halocryophilus strain Or1, Paenisporoarcina sp. and Chryseobacterium, Rhodotorula glutinis (yeast), Colwellia psychroerythraea, Nitrosomonas cryotolerans, (lichen) Pleopsidium chlorophanum."
How often do comets survive passage by the Sun?,Key factors: And of course some comets hit large objects - Shoemaker-Levy hit Jupiter and was destroyed.
On what scale does the universe expand?,"The short answer is: gravitationally bound system will not be ripped by the accelerated expansion.  A longer answer: The current standard model ($\Lambda$CDM model) says that everything started with the big bang. It released a lot of energy that pushed the Universe and is since then expanding. While it's expanding, gravitational attraction has been working to create the structures that we see today (planets, stars, galaxies, cluster of galaxies).  As the Universe expands, the density of matter and radiation within the Universe decreases. At about 5 billions years after the big bang, these densities became smaller than the density of Dark Energy (Dark-energy-dominated era). The strange things about Dark Energy are that, 1) its  density remains a constant regardless of the expansion of the universe, and 2) it has anti-gravitational properties - it pushes rather than pulls. Once Dark Energy came to dominate the density of the universe it began to dominate its overall dynamics, and has caused the expansion of the universe to accelerate. But in structures which have already formed, gravity is much stronger than dark energy and so they don't feel it. "
Why does a mirror bent 'like a potato chip' allow space telescopes to be smaller and have a wider field of view?,"Freeform optics are a response to the specific challenge of cramming a telescope in a very limited space. A traditional instrument would have all optics symmetrical and aligned on the same axis. It would waste a lot of space within the cubesat. Also, traditional designs tend to be much longer than they are wider; they don't fit well in a cube; it is very hard to make classic instruments that are as short as they are wide. But with freeform optics you could bounce light in a few directions within the cube. You'd still achieve a decent focal length, and you would use all the volume available to you.  Since light is reflected from mirrors at angles different from normal, you cannot use the traditional symmetric shapes such as parabolic, spherical, etc. You need to basically take a paraboloid and squish it in one direction so that it works about the same like a parabolic mirror (I'm simplifying), but at an angle of reflection of, say, 45 degrees. In such an instrument you could have multiple ""potato chip"" mirrors, as in the diagram above. You have to design the instrument as a whole; computer simulations will adjust the shape of each mirror until the performance of the whole instrument is close to a classic straight design. As far as I can tell, the manufacturing precision is such that freeform optics are only usable at long wavelengths such as infrared, where less precise optics can be used. But technology improves all the time. It also depends on how much aberration you can tolerate in your image. For usage from ground level this is less useful, unless you absolutely need a telescope in a very small form factor for some reason. Classic optics are still preferred when space and shape are not restricted."
Did atoms in human body indeed come from stars?,"The chemical elements in our bodies are inherited from the Earth. The Earth was formed in a disc of gas and dust swirling around the protosun 4.5 billion years ago. The material that formed the Earth was a selection of the material from that protostellar nebula that was itself once part of a larger molecular cloud. So the atoms in our body were once part of this molecular cloud, so we need to understand how they got there. After the first ten minutes or so, the universe contained mainly hydrogen, helium and some traces of lithium, deuterium and tritium - and that's all. No oxygen, iron, carbon etc. Almost all of the heavier chemical elements are made inside stars. We could stop there - the atoms of carbon, oxygen, calcium etc. in our bodies must have been made in stars, and since these atoms/nuclei are stable, they must survive unchanged (you could argue about whether their electrons get swapped about in chemical reactions etc., but since electrons are indistinguishable this hardly matters). But how do they get into a molecular cloud and what sort of stars make these elements? A couple of answers correctly identify massive stars that explode as supernovae as important. But they are by no means the only contributor, or even the most important contributor for some elements. If we take carbon and nitrogen, these are manufactured in nuclear reactions inside stars of even a bit less than a solar mass during the horizontal branch and asymptotic giant branch stages. These stars may be less massive and produce less C and N than massive stars, but there are many more of them. The central material is mixed to the surface during thermal pulses and the outer envelope, enriched in a variety of chemical elements, is gradually lost into space via a slow wind. This is a major source of carbon, nitrogen, fluorine, lithium and a number of heavy elements - Ba, La, Zr, Sr, Pb and many others - produced in the s-process. About 50% of the elements heavier than iron are made in the s-process, which can occur in both massive stars that explode (mainly isotopes with $A<90$) and the less massive AGB stars with slow, massive winds (elements up to lead and bismuth). Iron, nickel and many other elements such as sulphur and silicon are also produced during type Ia supernovae. This is the detonation of a white dwarf, the end stage of a low-mass star, after mass transfer or merger. Milder novae explosions caused by the ignition of material accreted onto a white dwarf also enrich the interstellar medium.  All these different processes produce distinctive patterns of element abundances. The enriched material is swept up by neighbouring supernova explosions, by interactions with spiral arms and other molecular clouds. It cools, condenses and collapses to form a new generation of stars. Analysis of ""presolar grains"" found inside meteorites tells us what our solar system formed from. These analyses tell us that all of the above processes were important in making the chemical elements that made up the Earth and hence those in our bodies. [Further details on the production of elements heavier than iron (including supernovae, low-mass AGB stars, colliding neutron stars etc.) can be found in my Physics SE answer to this question. ]"
"Can I see ""my own hand"" in the void space?","Yes, and no. You will be able to see your hand's silhouette as it blocks incoming light from other sources, but you won't be able to see any features on it. For example, illuminance of starlight overcast moonless night sky is quoted at $0.0001\ lux$ which means that in absence of a brighter light source, human eye simply isn't that sensitive to such low illuminance, even if your hand reflected all of the incoming light (it doesn't). What is the minimum lux rating that a human eye can resolve is not as straightforward to answer though, as it varies greatly by specific wavelengths. This is explained in more detail for example in this Human eye sensitivity and photometric quantities (PDF) document, or perhaps Wikipedia on Scotopic vision. But in a nutshell, no, you wouldn't be able to see any features on your hand in outer space, unless closer to a brighter visible wavelength light source. You'll still be able to infer that it's still there and all fingers on it accounted for, though."
What are Kepler's laws (as he wrote them)?,"Short Answer: Kepler expressed his laws with the sun at a foci rather than a barycenter. Long Answer: In Astronomia Nova (pub. 1609) Kepler presents the first version of something we can recognize as Kepler’s first law: On page 285 of Astronomia Nova: CAPVT  LIX.   Demonftratio, quod orbita MARTIS, librati in diametro
epicycli, fiat perfecta ellipfis: Et quod area circuli metiatur fummam
diftantiarum, ellipticae circumferentiae punctorum. The translation by William H. Donahue New Astronomy is: Chapter 59 Demonstration that when Mars reciprocates on the diameter
of the epicycle, its orbit becomes a perfect ellipse; and that the
area of the circle measures the sum of the distances of points on the
circumference of the ellipse. It isn’t immediately clear from Kepler’s own statement of his first law if the sun or the barycenter is the occupied focus.  Indeed, I couldn’t even find a mention of a focus in Astronomia Nova.  The closest I could find is when Kepler says, “a planet is moved less vigorously when it recedes from the point whence the eccentricity is computed.”  Here, it appears that Kepler is referring to the fastest speed of a planet at Perihelion, and the slowest speed at Aphelion.  The point from ""whence the eccentricity is computed"" is also clearly the focus of the ellipse.  Here is one of Kepler's original woodcuts, and it can be seen that the sun is at the focus. Kepler used the metaphor of a row boat for the planet's motion, and his drawings of oars in the water complement this cutting.
 Kepler believes the sun is the center of this system from “Chapter 33 – The power that moves the planets resides in the body of the sun.”  On page 280 of Donahue’s translation, Kepler says that: Therefore, with the sun belonging in the center of the system, the
source of the motive power, from what has now been demonstrated,
belongs in the sun, since it too has now been found to be in the
center of the world. Summary: Kepler believed the sun was the center of the solar system, and provided the motive power for the planets.  He used the location of the sun to calculate the eccentricity of Mars's orbit and later extended his findings to the rest of the planets.  While we can't rule out the possibility that Kepler speculated about a barycenter, he certainly didn't express any such speculations in his original formulations of his laws. Notes: Lack of explanation of Kepler’s stated 1st law: Kepler’s 1st law as stated in Astronomia Nova isn’t very recognizable as our modern Kepler’s 1st law.  Explaining how they are equivalent gets complicated due to the ancient math and breadth of terminology.  I do not attempt to bridge that gap in this answer, though I would be happy to provide insight, information, and resources on request.  At the end of Chapter 59, in a conclusion of the book, Kepler himself acknowledges the difficulty of reading his book: “If anyone thinks that the obscurity of this presentation arises from the perplexity of my mind, I shall myself only thus acknowledge to him my guilt, that I was unwilling to leave anything untested, no matter how utterly obscure”…  “He will see that there are some matters which no mind, however gifted, can present in such a way as to be understood in a cursory reading.  There is need of meditation, and a close thinking through of what is said.” If you want to understand what Kepler is talking about, you should buy a copy of Donahue's English translation and pack a lunch. I also found this guide quite helpful in my own journey: Tutorial. Keplers 2nd and 3rd laws: Kepler’s 2nd law is also articulated in Astronomia Nova in 1609, but I didn’t choose to treat it in this response. I think it needlessly distracts from the deep point of the original question, which is whether or not Kepler included barycenters in his laws.  The 3rd law was published in Harmonices Mundi in 1618.  Though all three laws were asked for in the question, I don’t provide them in this answer, making it somewhat incomplete. First mention of the barycenter:  The first mention of something like a barycenter that I could find is in a translation of Newton’s Principia, published in 1687, proposition 12, theorem 12: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Mathematical_Principles_of_Natural_Philosophy_(1846)/BookIII-Prop2.  This includes the quote that: “the common centre of gravity of Jupiter and the sun will fall upon a point a little without the surface of the sun” which to me demonstrates a clear understanding and articulation of the idea of a barycenter.  Does anyone know an earlier clear reference to a barycenter? Implications:  The fact that Kepler’s laws didn’t include a barycenter is not just a historical curiosity, but also informs our modern conventions.  A Kepler orbit assumes that a less massive body orbits around a more massive one in an ellipse, with the more massive body at one of the foci of that ellipse.  Though Kepler’s laws can be generalized to replace the sun with the barycenter, they are no longer recognizable as Kepler’s laws and will no longer conform to convention. All the orbital elements would be different.  For example, the periapsis and apoapsis are always measured from the central body, rather than the barycenter.  Here is a diagram from wikipedia: "
How stable are Lissajous orbits?,"Gaia's original science and technology report (see page 221, see also the summary) gives an analysis of the Lissajous orbit. From what I understand Gaia will be placed in a small amplitude Lissajous orbit, giving it an orbital radius of $\sim400000$ km away from $\sim100000$ km along the Sun-Earth axis. In addition to the fact that this orbit is intrinsically unstable, variable radiation pressure from the sun causes stochastic destabilization of the orbit. The prediction is that once in orbit, a small velocity correction of $\sim1$ m/s is needed about once a month in order to maintain the orbit. From a summary on Planck's orbit it seems that this applies to Planck as well. That the SEL2 point is being 'crowded' doesn't seem like such a big problem to me. Once the satellites are turned off (both Planck and Herschel are no longer active) their orbit will rapidly destabilize, effectively removing then from the region. But more importantly, the orbital radius is comparable to the distance to the moon, this really is a tremendously large amount of space. Since these satellites are only a few metres across, the probability of a collision is likely negligible.  "
Supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies,"This is a very well posed question, thanks!
The problem is, we still don't know.
What we suppose, is that dark matter came first. Primordial fluctuations of dark matter made the right conditions to accrete enough mass to build SMBHs, and then the surrounding galaxy. But still we don't know if, the SMBH comes from merging, of other SMBHs or galaxies, or from high massive BH that are called seed (of the order of $100\,M_{Sun}$).
Perhaps, there are very recent developments, which could be known by the experts, but until few years ago, this was the scenario. About the mass issue, we could have a better reasoning if we think to the influence spheres. We discovered a relation between the SMBH mass and many bulge properties (i.e., the luminosity, the velocity dispersion, and others). This means that an object of the order of $\sim1$ pc, influences an object of the order of $\sim1$ kpc (maybe $\sim3$). Plus, the bulge structure is essential to the formation and characterization and classification of the host galaxy."
How small can a spiral galaxy be?,"The first Google-hits suggest that Segue 2 is the smallest spiral galaxy, but that is actually incorrect since it is the smallest spherical galaxy yet discovered. It has a radius of roughly 34 parsec or 110 light years. The original publication on that topic dates back to 2013, but it was again in the news in April 2020. Then, there are lecture notes on a course Astronomy 626 Galaxies which shows the following diagram:  Also, the lecture notes claim: Typical values for the scale length [of spiral glaxies] are: $1 {\rm kpc} < h_R < 10 {\rm kpc}$ I agree that this does not answer your question fully, but I got the impression that the lower bound should be around $1 {\rm kpc}$."
Could we detect the light of cities at night in other solar systems?,"No.  There are very few exoplanets that can even be imaged as ""dots"".  There are none that can be resolved as discs and it would be well beyond current technology to see lights on the surface of an Earth-like planet. Most exoplanets are only known from periodic dimming of a star as the planet passes in front of its star, or wobbles in a star's motion, as the planet's gravity causes the star to move forward and back. We could see lights on Mars, if they existed as they do on Earth,  but they don't."
Why do small mirror imperfections matter with modern computers,"correct for the distortion An imperfect mirror does not produce a distorted image - it produces a blurry image. With light-field sensors and phase imaging, one could possibly correct for the blur, but it is much more challenging problem than normal lens distortion correction. Distortion refers to a systematic change in how shapes are projected in an image. It results from a lens or mirror with good, accurate geometry that just does not produce a rectilinear projection. Random imperfections in a mirror do not cause distortion. Every point in the surface of a mirror contributes to every pixel in the result image. If a single part of the mirror is at slightly wrong angle, it does not cause a distortion in one point of the image. Instead, it projects the same image at a slightly different alignment on the same sensor. (1) In the case of a starfield, this would cause ghost images of very dim stars to appear next to the real stars. Repeat this for a thousand imperfections, and the result is just blurry dots. Deconvolution is a process that can be used to remove blurriness, but noise and other uncertainties limit its effectiveness. (1) This may be a bit unintuitive if you think about funhouse mirrors where the image is distorted. Those work differently because they act the part of a planar mirror, where indeed each part of image is reflected by a single part of a mirror. But planar mirrors cannot form an image by themselves, instead the lens in your eye is the critical component of the image accuracy."
Can Newton's gravity equation explain why black holes are so strong?,"No you can't and the behaviour of bodies with mass and of light is completely different near a compact, massive object if you use Newtonian physics rather than General Relativity. In no particular order; features that GR predicts (and which in some cases have now been observationally confirmed) but which Newtonian physics cannot: An event horizon. In Newtonian physics there is a misleading numerical coincidence that the escape velocity reaches the speed of light at the Schwarzschild radius. But in Newtonian physics you could still escape by applying a constant thrust. GR predicts that no escape is possible in any circumstances. Further; this numerical coincidence only applies to light travelling radially. In Newtonian physics the escape ""speed"" is independent of which direction you fire a body, but in GR light cannot escape from (just above) the Schwarzschild unless it if fired radially outwards. For other directions, the radius at which light can escape is larger. GR predicts an innermost stable circular orbit. A stable circular orbit is possible at any radius in Newtonian physics. In GR a particle with some angular momentum and lots of kinetic energy will end up falling into the black hole. In Newtonian physics it will scatter to infinity. Newtonian physics predicts no precession of a two-body elliptical orbit. GR predicts orbital precession. Newtonian physics predicts that light travelling close to a massive body has a trajectory that is curved by about half the amount predicted by GR. Even stranger effects are predicted close to the black hole including that light can orbit at 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius. The GR approach to gravity is fundamentally and philosophically different to Newtonian gravity. For Newton, gravity is a universal force. In GR, gravity is not a force at all. Freefalling bodies are said to be ""inertial"". They accelerate, not because a force acts upon them, but because spacetime is curved by the presence of mass (and energy). In most cases, where Newtonian gravitational fields are weak, the consequences of this difference are small (but measureable - e.g. the orbit precession of Mercury or gravitational time dilation in GPS clocks), but near large, compact masses, like black holes and neutron stars, the differences become stark and unavoidable."
"Why is time referred to as ""The"" capital T 4th dimension?","This is because time is the fourth dimension in the theory of General Relativity which describes gravity. It turns out that a good way to describe the paths that objects or light take when in a gravitational field is to describe a curved four-dimensional space with coordinates x,y,z,t. A particle in space becomes a curve in this four dimensional space, and we can use general relativity to find the shape of this line, and so the position of the particle at any given time. If the force of gravity is weak and the velocity of the particle is small then x, y, z correspond to the ordinary position of the particle in 3d space at time t, in the usual Newtonian way. If the gravity is strong, or the velocity is high, then only the General Relativity description matches observations. Now you can, of course describe your (x,y,z,H) position (where H is hunger) however this doesn't lead to much interesting physics.  It doesn't help develop a theory of hunger. So time is the fourth dimension, because that helps us to describe reality."
"Serious alternate form of the Drake Equation, or graffiti?","Given the font, it's xkcd 384, The Drake Equation. The two $X$'s are the other $f$ terms from the original Drake equation, while the $B_S$ is ""amount of bullshit you're willing to buy from Frank Drake"""
"Counting from the 21st century forward, what place on Earth will be last to experience a total solar eclipse?","Here is a combination of the maps available from NASA SEAtlas. They cover time span from year 2001 to 3000. Made with a custom Python script and some editing in GIMP.  The yellow to blue colors mark the time of the next total solar eclipse by location. A red or light blue color marks the areas that do not experience a total eclipse by year 3000. There are many such areas without eclipse, so based on this data it is not possible to say which will be the last one. There is no clear pattern so it is likely that computational accuracy and the definition of total vs. annular vs. 99% eclipse would affect the answer also. Here is a map on the number of total eclipses per area in the whole 5000 year dataset:  There are three tiny areas with no eclipses. One is near the border of Brazil and Bolivia, one in north Zimbabwe and one in south Kongo.  I have hilighted them in red. For some reason the southern hemisphere seems to have less total eclipses on average. An explanation may be in this answer."
"Is it possible to have satellites (natural or not) orbit the same celestial object in different directions ? (clockwise, counterclockwise)","It is absolutely possible. Moons that formed with their planet will be in prograde orbits, but moons that are captured bodies (such as the outer satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune (Triton's a huge example here)) can wind up in basically any orbital inclination initially. The Apollo orbits over the Moon were retrograde. A large number of satellites in low Earth orbit are retrograde.  The prototypical periodic comet, 1P/Halley, is in a retrograde orbit. Over the very long term, under significant tidal interactions,  retrograde orbits tend to be cranked inward (And Triton will tear away or tear apart all of Neptune's interior moons before Neptune shreds it in the far distant future), but for more distant object,  or shorter timescales, they're fine."
Why isn't the asteroid belt affected by Jupiter's gravitational field?,"The asteroid belt is affected by Jupiter's gravity. There are stable orbits inside of Jupiter's orbit. Jupiter's Hill Sphere has a radius of 53 million km. If you are more than 53 million km from Jupiter, then the Sun's gravity dominates and you can orbit the sun. But Jupiter orbits 780 million km from the Sun, so there is plenty of space between Mars and Jupiter for asteroids to have stable orbits.   As they pass Jupiter on their orbit they will get first a pull forward, and then a pull back but as these pulls happen at different locations on each orbit they tend to cancel out and result in effects like precession of the asteroid's perehelion or periodic variations in eccentricity. These effect act on the Earth and other planets too. However if the time the asteroid takes to orbit the sun happens to be an exact fraction of the time that Jupiter takes, then it might receive the same pull at the same location. Resonant orbits like this tend to be unstable. The asteroid will be nudged out of the resonant orbit and into one that doesn't match up with Jupiter.  This creates the Kirkwood Gaps in the asteroid belt.  Source"
Why can space telescopes see through a planetary nebula?,"Let's say we have a spherical shell of some material emitting light, much bigger than the star it surrounds. If we look right down the center of the shell, our line of sight takes us through only a small amount of gas - not enough for there to be significant emission. On the other hand, if we look at the nebula near the outer edge, our line of sight takes us through substantially more material: 

Inspired in part by an image in this piece by Phil Plait. If you look through more light-emitting material, you'll see stronger emission than if you look through less material, so in this toy model, we would perceive the edges to have strong emission. So a spherical nebula wouldn't lead to uniform emission throughout our cross-sectional view of it. This simple spherical model holds for some cases, but certainly not all, particularly because many nebulae aren't spherical (Wikipedia makes the claim that only ~20% are truly spherical, which I haven't been able to verify.) For example, we know that the Ring Nebula isn't actually a sphere because the central surface brightness is much lower than the projection effect I described above would predict. Something else clearly must be going on. In this case, the discrepancy is solved by the fact that the Ring Nebula is a bipolar nebula, with its axis along our line of sight, with a dense ring of gas around its equator. Therefore, there's more material near its edges than its center from our perspective, and so we see more emission."
Moon's unusual gravity,"As you said, the mass of the Moon is 1.2 percent that of the Earth. 
Now, if you mean the gravitational acceleration at the surface, it is calculated like this $G\frac{M}{R^2}$, where $M$ is the mass, and $R$ is the radius of the celestial body. The moon's mass is a hundred times smaller, but the radius is four times smaller, meaning its surface gravity will be $100/16 \approx 6$ times smaller. Considering the factor is mass over radius to the power of two here, density alone does not help you determine the ratio of surface accelerations. On a side note, the moon's density is around 60 per cent that of the Earth."
"Are the stars distributed in uniform distribution, on the celestial dome, with respect to brightness?","Naked eye stars are not distributed uniformly in the sky. That is because the median naked eye star is at a distance of 440 light years, and this is far enough away that some of the details of Galactic structure start to become apparent. Most importantly, the density of stars increase towards the Galactic midplane and has a scale height of a few hundred light years and thus there is an over-density of stars towards the Galactic plane. I did an analysis of this in https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/10260/2531 , but the important plot is repeated below. It shows the normalised density of stars (per square degree) as a function of Galactic latitude. (Note that I have correctly handled the changing area of the latitude strips). You can see the peak at low Galactic latitude and even work out that our viewing point is probably slightly above the Galactic plane, given that the peak is at about $-10^{\circ}$. The peak is still there in 3rd magnitude stars. You could repeat for a sample limited to even brighter stars, but you run into number statistics trouble. The distribution of bright stars with Galactic latitude. The y-axis is the normalised number of stars per square degree. i.e. The integral sums to 1.  Below I show the Hipparcos data, divided into 4 apparent magnitude bins. Points are plotted on a RA vs Dec Aitoff projection. Superimposed in red is a Galactic coordinate grid. There are too few stars with $V<2$ to form much of an opinion, but for fainter stars, a ring-like structure, coincident with the Galactic coordinates equator (i.e. Galactic latitude of zero, or just below, as I showed in the 1D projection above) is clearly seen. "
What's the difference between minutes and arcminutes?,"This can get a bit confusing, because ""arcminute"" and ""minute"" are both sometimes used in celestial coordinate systems but mean two different things. An arcminute is 1/60th of a degree, and an arcsecond is 1/60th of an arcminute. That's simple enough, and when talking about small angular distances, it's often much handier to refer to something as being, say, 140 arcseconds across, rather than 0.0389 degrees. So you're likely to see angular sizes or scales quoted in degrees, arcminutes and arcseconds. If you're trying to state the position of an object on the sky, things get a little more complicated, thanks to the commonly-used equatorial coordinate system, which states an object's position on the celestial sphere in terms of its declination and its right ascension. The declination of an object is usually given in degrees, arcminutes and arcseconds. Its right ascension, on the other hand, is usually given in hours, minutes and seconds. Here, one ""hour"" corresponds to 1/24th of a circle, or 15 degrees. One minute is then 1/60th of an hour, and one second is 1/60th of a minute. So as units of angular separation in this context, an arcminute is different from a minute, and an arcsecond is different from a second."
Is the power output at the core of the sun about the same as a compost pile (about 300 watts)?,"Yes, the power output of the solar core is about 276.5 watts per cubic metre. However, if we average that power over the whole volume of the Sun it drops to 0.27 watts per cubic metre. (Thanks, ProfRob). Energy is measured in joules, power is measured in watts. One watt is one joule per second. So (in general) the power tells you how much energy is produced or consumed per second. A cubic metre of solar core contains a lot of energy, as indicated by its temperature and density, but the rate that it ""generates"" new energy is rather small. Of course, energy is conserved, so the Sun isn't actually producing new energy, it's  merely converting mass (which is a form of energy) into kinetic energy. Some of that kinetic energy is in the form of photons, and some of it is the kinetic energy of the other fusion reaction products. The primary fusion reactions operating in the Sun are called the proton-proton chain (or p-p chain). Unlike the processes in a hydrogen bomb (which uses deuterium & tritium, not plain hydrogen), the start of the p-p chain is quite slow. When two protons fuse, the resulting diproton is very unstable, and it usually splits apart again. However, in the brief time before the diproton splits there's a tiny probability, on the order of $10^{-26}$, that one of the protons in the diproton converts to a neutron, creating a deuteron (a deuterium nucleus). The probability is low because the conversion relies on the weak nuclear force, which is much slower than the strong nuclear force involved in binding the nucleons together. A typical solar core proton has a half-life of around 10 billion years. The Sun will last a long time because its main reaction process is so slow. That's good news for star longevity, but bad news for anyone who wants to build a fusion reactor running on plain hydrogen."
Can lightning occur in stars like the Sun?,"Stars are not actually gaseous, they are plasmas, i.e., highly ionized. Hence, the entire star is highly conductive and does not easily develop the voltage difference via friction needed for lightning like that in our atmosphere. On the other hand, stellar atmospheres have strong magnetic fields which reconnect, and that causes strong voltage spikes that generate high energy electrons. On the Earth we would call streams of high energy electrons lightning, but on the sun we call them flares."
Can I sense a bright star pointing an eight foot antenna towards it?,"Stars are too dim for amateur radio equipment. There are two possible radio sources that you can detect: the sun and Jupiter. Jupiter is particularly interesting as interactions between Io and its magnetic field produce beams of radio waves that sweep past earth every 10 hours.  These are detectable in the amateur range, at about 20 MHz. Nasa make a kit for detecting these radio signals, or it is possible to use a ham antenna, but of course it must be cut for the frequency of operation. The Nasa kit uses a phased dipole antenna which must be set up in a field or similar as the antenna is about 7m long. Stars are not very good radio sources. Supernovae remnants such as Cassiopeia A or the Crab nebula are much brighter at radio wavelengths. Most supernovae are too distant to be powerful radio sources; radio supernovae are rare. A local supernova would be a radio source but we haven't observed a supernova in the milky way for several hundred years."
"During an eclipse, how big is the shadow of the moon on the earth?","But how big is this shadow? How many kilometers is its diameter? That's a photo of the umbra and penumbra on the surface of the Earth taken from Space. It's a little distorted because it's not directly under the ISS but far off near the terminator. It's hard to pin down the size of the penumbra because it's fuzzy and fades near the edges, but if you could see the very edges then it would be twice† the diameter of the moon or very roughly 6900 kilometers total. †Actually this is only true by coincidence because the angular diameter of the Sun happens to be the same as that of the Moon. @Flaffo's answer does a good job of explaining how to calculate the diameter of the umbra, and that math could probably be extended to calculate the diameter of the penumbra as well. The umbra has a well defined diameter but the size varies a lot due to variation in the distance from the Moon to the Earth since it's orbit is not circular. Sometimes the Moon is so far away that it can't fill the Sun and there is no umbra at all, that's called an annular eclipse.  Wikipedia says: Typically, the umbra is 100–160 km wide, while the penumbral diameter is in excess of 6400 km.  Source: Geometry of a Total Solar Eclipse You can see an example of a very detailed simulation of just the umbra moving across the Earth's surface in the NASA Goddard video Tracing the 2017 Solar Eclipse The precise 3D shape of the Moon generates the shadow and it then moves over the contour of the Earth's topography. If you think the shape is weird I agree! See answers to The Moon's shadow could not possibly look like this — could it?

What would the night sky look like if the Milky Way were the only galaxy in the universe?,"I feel sure this is a repeat, but couldn't immediately find it. The only things in the night sky we can see (with the naked eye) that are not part of our own Galaxy are (on a good night) the Andromeda galaxy and the Large and small Magellanic clouds. Every individual star brighter than $V=6$ and visible to the naked eye is in the Milky Way. So it would hardly look any different."
What will the PRECISE time of the Summer Solstice 2020 be?,"TL;DR: In a couple of weeks it might be possible to say precisely (within a second, perhaps a fraction of a second) when the summer solstice did occur. But until then, sub-minute estimates should be treated as fraudulent. The reason you are seeing different times for when the summer solstice will occur is that different websites use different models of the orbits of the bodies that comprise the solar system and different models of the Earth's orientation in space. It's very important to remember that ""all models are wrong, but some are useful"". There are several issues with finding the exact time of when solstices occur. One is that the solstices are extrema of the Sun's declination. Without a model of derivatives, finding extrema (e.g., the solstices) mathematically is a much harder problem than is finding zero crossings (e.g., the equinoxes). More importantly, a very precise prediction would require multiple very precise models. While many models of the orbits of the bodies in the solar system are very, very good, none are good enough to get the timing of the solstices down to the millisecond. Even more importantly, the tilt of the Earth's orientation in space with respect to its orbit about the Sun needs to be modeled. The best model, the IAU 2006/2000A precession-nutation model has over a thousand terms (1365 terms, to be precise). And even then, ""all models are wrong."" The people at the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) know this very well. The IERS is the organization that is responsible for modeling time as measured by the Earth's rotation and for modeling how the Earth is oriented in space. There are some aspects of the Earth's orientation in space that are not quite predictable. The US Naval Observatory, one of the key members of the IERS, publishes daily updates of observed deviations from model predictions. It take a couple of weeks to fully digest measurements made by astronomers worldwide."
How many planets have we discovered that can support human life?,"There is currently only one planet known to be capable of supporting human life, and you're on it. Several planets have been found in the region in which we expect water to be liquid on much of the planet. Of these, only one fits the criteria of being Earth-sized and well placed in the habitable zone: Kepler 186-f However we know nothing about it's atmosphere (or lack of one). The star is a red dwarf, so it could be subject to dramatic solar flares. The planet is rather colder than earth, so could be in a perpetual ""snowball world"" state, depending on the composition of the atmosphere and the strength of the greenhouse effect. The atmosphere would be very unlikely to be even close to breathable, and it is nearly 500 light-years from Earth, so could not be reached in a reasonable amount of time, even with much more advanced propulsion. At the moment we can't usually detect most Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of brighter stars like the sun, though the probably do exist and may be common."
What's the percentage of strange matter inside a star at any time?,"Zero. Normal stars are not dense enough to produce strange matter. They have regular matter only (neutrons and protons). Strange matter has been hypothesized to form inside neutron stars, but this is highly speculative. Presently, nobody really knows what's in the nucleus of neutrons stars.

Why doesn't Earth's axis change during the year?,"My understanding is that the Earth's axis points in the same direction in space during its entire orbit around the sun. And this is what causes our seasons. The second statement is correct. The axial tilt is the primary driver of the seasons. The first statement is not exactly correct. There is a small but persistent change in the orientation of the Earth's axis. The change over the course of a year is small. The change over the course of 13,000 years is large. In 13,000 years the Earth's axis will be tilted by about 47 degrees compared to the current orientation. In yet another 13,000 years the Earth will be oriented very similarly to how it is oriented now. I'll write more about this later. My question is why doesn't the axis follow the orbital path (kind of like a car driving around a circle)? That is not a good mental model. The only contact between your car and the ground are the bottoms of the four wheels on your car. The forces at these four small contact areas are what change your car's orientation and change your car's velocity vector. This means that the torque on your car as you turn the steering wheel and the centripetal force on your car that makes your care negotiate a turn are intimately connected. Turn the steering wheel gently and the heavy front end of your car follows suit. Assuming a gentle turn, the light rear end of you car soon follows suit. If you turn too hard, your car starts to skid instead of turn. Turn even harder yet and you risk having your car flip and roll. The motion of your car depends on that intimate coupling between force and torque. Gravitation doesn't work like that. It instead acts on each and every bit of the Earth, all together, all at once, all the time. There is a slight variation in the gravitationally-induced acceleration across the Earth due to variations in distance to the Moon (or Sun), but these variations are small. The net gravitational force on the Earth is very much decoupled from the small net gravity gradient torque on the Earth. The principal result of the gravity gradient torque exerted by the Moon and the Sun on the Earth is a very slow but large precession of the Earth's rotation axis (for more, read this wikipedia article on axial precession). This precession makes the Earth's rotation axis rotate about the normal to the ecliptic at a rate of one revolution per 25772 years. There are lesser effects collectively called nutations and polar motion that result from gravity gradient torque. These lesser effects are much, much smaller in magnitude but have much, much shorter periods. The largest of these lesser effects results from the 18.61 year cyclical variations in the lunar node. Even this largest component of nutation is small, two orders of magnitude smaller than the large but slow precession."
JPL Horizons sending too many emails,"It turns out the ""more robust"" mail queue manager implemented April 21 has a condition where it can rediscover itself. That condition occurred in the middle of the night local time with your query. The good news is it was fixed yesterday. The bad news is 49K emails were already sent before someone else entered the mail queue and it let go and moved on normally. The ""four per minute"" is just your local system gradually leaking yesterday's pathology in. Recommend purging the accumulation from your delivery queue if you have the level of control. If not, redirect duplicate emails from Horizons to trash until it clears. If consolation, about 150K messages were received here from your system explaining it can't deliver X for the last four hours, but it will keep trying for the next five days, each with a copy of the as-yet undelivered email."
How do you call it when two celestial bodies come as close to each other as they will in their current orbits?,"This is a syzygy.  ""A syzygy of the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn."" In general a syzygy is when three bodies are in a line.  In your case the three bodies are the sun, and the two planets. You can also talk about ""Saturn is at opposition as seen from Jupiter. Not every syzygy is ""proximity event"" but many are.  I know of no word or phrase for the ""approaching phase"" or the ""departing phase"".  I don't think that there is a specific term for ""closest approach"". Establishing absolute distance is generally difficult, compared with finding the direction. And the closest approach doesn't happen exactly at opposition (due to orbital tilt and eccentricity). Terms like ""opposition"" or ""syzygy"" are about the direction rather than distance."
Why aren't globular clusters disk shaped,"In order to result in a disk-like stellar system there are two conditions that need to be satisfied. (a) The initial gas from which the stars form must have a significant ratio of rotational to gravitational energy. (b) The star formation would have to occur slowly enough, that the gas collapses to a disk before star formation is complete. The formation of a disk from a spherically symmetric state requires a reduction (more negative) gravitational potential energy, whilst conserving angular momentum. This can only happen if there is some means to lose energy from the system in the form of dissipative interactions.  A pure stellar system is almost collisionless and there is no means to dissipate energy. That means once a spherical system of stars has formed, there is no way for it to become more disk-like. Thus if star formation takes place in a spherical way, then those stars will end up in a spherical system. Only in cases where the gas collapses to a disk before star formation occurs do we end up with disk-like systems. This is true of the disk of our Galaxy (and of the solar system). In the case of globular clusters (and other types of star cluster in the Galaxy) it appears the star formation is rapid enough that the gas cannot have collapsed to a disk before most star formation is complete. NB. Many globular clusters do have measurable rotation."
Is it possible to have a stable 3 body system that orbits in a perfect circle?,"Yes and No.  — It depends on what you mean by ""stable"". To be precise, ""stable"" means immune to small perturbations.  ""Equilibrium"" can be either ""stable"" or ""unstable,"" as shown in any first-year Calculus text. Can you balance a pencil on its point? If you have three ideal spherical bodies (and an otherwise empty universe), moving according to Newtonian gravity (or perhaps even Einstein's relativity), and each body is moving exactly at the right velocity, then this system could exist. However if you perturbed it by even the smallest amount, then it would gradually deviate from this orbit and probably end up with either a collision, or an ejection of one of the planets.  In this sense it is not stable. It is like balancing a pencil on the point.  It is possible in theory, but in practice the pencil will always fall down. Similarly, this is possible in theory (or in a computer model) but could not exist in practice. The best known stable solutions to the three-body problem are hierarchical. Either a ""sun"" is orbited by a ""planet"" which is orbited by a ""moon"",  or two ""suns"" are in a tight orbit, which is orbited by a ""planet"".  In these configurations there is a clear structure, and the orbits of each level can be approximated by Keplerian ellipses. This solution was found by Lagrange, and it is a special case of the L4 and L5 orbits, in which the three bodies move in an equilateral triangle. Other solutions of the three-body problem are known However non-hierarchical solutions that are not only periodic, but resistant to small perturbations, don't exist when then the three bodies have equal mass."
"What are ""non-Keplerian"" orbits? What are some familiar examples in our solar system, and can some still be closed?","Strictly speaking, no orbits are in perfect accordance with Kepler’s laws.  Kepler’s laws aren’t really “laws” in terms of physical laws, but are instead trends that Kepler noticed and calculated using astronomical observations of the planets.  Kepler’s laws are very accurate for planetary orbits since he used very accurate (for the time) planetary observations.  I think Wikipedia states Kepler’s laws quite nicely: Newton proved that Kepler’s laws would perfectly describe planetary motion using an inverse r-squared law for gravitational force if the planet’s mass was negligible with respect to the sun’s mass, if the only gravity the planet was subjected to was the sun, and if the planet hadn’t achieved escape velocity. Does that mean we should stop using Kepler’s laws? Heck no! They are super useful for all kinds of things.  As an example, I give the only rigorous answer to this question using Kepler’s 2nd and 3rd laws (in the paragraph just before my notes): If the Moon were impacted by a suitably sized meteor, how long would it take to impact the Earth? .  This question was around for over a year, and many people had taken a crack at answering and failed (in my opinion).  My solution is much less complicated than another clever physics answer that assumes gravitational force is constant only to get a lower bound! A ""non-Keplerian"" orbit is an orbit in which Kepler's laws lack predictive and descriptive power. If a question about an orbit requiring a specified accuracy can’t be answered with the required accuracy using Kepler’s laws, the orbit is ‘Non-Keplerian’ in the context of that question.  This is probably not a very satisfying answer, especially since the same orbit could be considered Keplerian for one question, but not for another. Unfortunately, this is typically how engineering gets done.  We may make some assumptions to get to an answer and then refine that answer by reversing those assumptions or using a more sophisticated model.  When Kepler’s laws fail to give us required accuracy, we can move to orbit propagation simulations. Kepler’s laws were written specifically for the motion of planets around the sun!  So one could argue that a moon orbit around a planet is not a Kepler orbit, even though Kepler’s laws may still be very accurate if you replace “planet” with “moon” and then replace “sun” with “planet”.  I would rather argue that any orbital system is “Keplerian” if Kepler’s laws still accurately describe the objects’ motions. Kepler’s laws don’t include the concept of a barycenter (system center of mass).  So they degrade for 2-body orbits when there isn’t very much difference between their mass.  A comment below says that a binary star system is an ‘almost perfect example of Keplerian behavior’, but I disagree.  One has to generalize Kepler’s laws to accurately describe binary star motion: a)       Orbiting bodies move in elliptical orbits around the system barycenter. b)      A line segment between the barycenter and a body sweeps out equal areas in equal time. c)       The square of a body’s orbital period is proportional to the cube of its mean distance from the barycenter. Here is a table I made to accompany my definition of non-Keplerian orbits: I think the easiest example of a mostly non-Keplerian orbit is the James Webb telescope soon to be at Earth's L2 point: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point . Kepler's 3rd law states that the ratio of the cube of the orbit SMA (semi-major axis) to the square of the orbital period is constant for everything orbiting the same massive body.  But something in Earth's L2 point has the same orbital period as Earth, but a way larger SMA. Kepler's 3rd law is violated, hence the James Webb telescope will be in a non-Keplerian orbit.  If you want a more exotic orbit and a naturally mostly non-Keplerian orbit, take a look at this weird orbit for a retrograde Jupiter coorbital asteroid: http://www.astro.uwo.ca/~wiegert/2015BZ509/ This is an example of a 3-body problem orbit. A closed orbit is one that repeats itself in an inertial coordinate system with the origin at the center of mass of the most massive body. If you don't specify a coordinate system, I can say that the orbit of any object is closed by specifying a coordinate system with that object always at the origin. Yes, the two orbit examples given above are closed enough. Oumuamua is an example of a ""non-closed"" ""non-Keplerian"" solar orbit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBOumuamua"
Questions about spiral galaxy arms,"Actually, the stars and nebulae that make up the spiral arm are only temporarily part of that spiral arm. Spiral arms are more like sound waves where individual particles move around a more or less stationary position. (Look for instance at the animation of longitudinal waves from Dan Russel, the red dots move a bit to the left and to the right around a stationary position). Dust, gas and stars move towards or away from another just as longitudinal waves. Where the dust, gas and stars come close together (and where, therefore, the density increases), spiral arms can be seen as more stars are close together increasing the brightness at that position in the galaxy.  This effect is, furthermore, much increased because the increased density of dust and gas in the spiral arm causes protostars to form. The brightest stars burn up their energy so fast that they will cease to exist even before the longitudinal wave (the spiral arm) has passed. These very bright stars only exist for a small portion of their orbital period around the galaxy's centre, and only while they are in the spiral arm. The large majority of stars exist much longer, but are also much dimmer and contribute only little to the overal brightness of the galaxy.  This causes the spiral arms to be so much brighter than the rest of the disk, where also a lot of stars exist. But these can hardly be seen as they are much dimmer. Of course, the stars do not revolve around a stable position in the galaxy (as the red dots in the wave animation) but follow their own orbits around the centre of the galaxy. Sometimes a bit faster, and sometimes a bit slower depending on the position relative to the spiral arms. Because the spiral arms are waves, it does not matter that stars near the centre move faster than the stars at the edge. It just means that they will be part of the spiral arm for a shorter period of time."
Exoplanet dip in transit light curve when the planet passes behind the star,"Just before the planet goes behind the star, we see the light directly from the star as well as the light reflected from the planet's surface.  When the planet is behind the star, we no longer see the reflected light. Note that the top of the line also curves to reflect how much of the planet's surface is illuminated from the star.  The most illumination is when it is almost ""full"" just before it passes behind the star.  The least illumination is when it is ""new"" just before it passes in front of the star. Edit (to address Fraxinus's comment below): Here is an example from Zhang et. al: Phase Curves of WASP-33b and HD 149026b and a New Correlation between Phase Curve Offset and Irradiation Temperature.  The above graphic shows processed data from the Spitzer space telescope.  From the paper: Observations were timed to begin before a secondary eclipse and end
after the following secondary eclipse, These light curves help aid in estimates of planetary albedo, day/night temperature, and atmospheric composition."
Why does the Earth have a z-component at the start of the J2000 epoch?,"You made the same fundamental mistake that Anton Gromov made in his question on the sister Space Exploration StackExchange network site: You used the solar system barycenter rather than the Sun as the frame origin. Had you used the Sun, the apparent discrepancy would have dropped by almost two orders of magnitude. A much lesser flaw is that you apparently used midnight rather than noon. The J2000.0 epoch is 12 noon Terrestrial Time on 1 January 2000. This doesn't change things by much, but it is nonetheless important. That half day offset has bitten me more than once. The z coordinate of the Earth's position would not have dropped to zero had you made the above corrections (Sun-centered rather than solar system barycenter, and 12 noon rather than midnight). It would not have dropped to zero even if you had used the Earth-Moon barycenter rather than the center of the Earth. One reason it would not have dropped to zero is that the Earth's orbit about the Sun is not an ellipse. The Earth's orbit doesn't even lie on a plane! The key cause of this non-planar motion is that the Moon's orbit about the Earth is inclined by about 5.15° with respect to the ecliptic, making the Earth bob up and down with respect to the ecliptic1. Because the Earth's orbit is not truly elliptical or even planar, the ecliptic plane at some epoch is a time-averaged plane centered about the epoch time that makes the Earth's position with respect to the Sun (or the Sun's position with respect to the Earth) average to zero. A lesser reason is that the J2000.0 mean ecliptic and mean equinox frame was defined over 36 years ago. HORIZONS uses DE431, which was released 6 years ago. JPL's ability to model the solar system improved significantly in the intervening three decades. 
1 Strictly speaking, it makes the Sun appear to bob up and down with respect to the ecliptic. The concept of the ecliptic plane dates back to the ancient Greeks, and it retains a vestige of this definition to this day."
Is the Earth going to evolve towards Mars' fate or Venus' fate?,"If you are asking about short-term effects related to human's effect on the climate, the answer is (obviously) unclear. But in the very long term, Earth is likely to evolve to a more Venus-like state. Over the next billion years or so, the Sun's luminosity will slowly increase, which will heat Earth's surface. As a result, more water vapor will evaporate into the atmosphere. Since water vapor is a greenhouse gas, this will compound the heating. It's not entirely clear what the new equilibrium temperature will be after this runaway greenhouse effect runs its course. But it will clearly be more Venus-like than Mars-like."
How many undiscovered planets might be in our solar system?,"Let's take a look at the 2006 IAU planet definition A celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit. a) This does not make much of a limit. While we can rule out any extra planets in the relative proximity to the Sun (out to the Kuiper belt or so), there's a vast amount of space out to about a light year were objects would still be orbiting the Sun, but be very difficult for us to observe. b) Objects large enough to gravitationally round themselves are discovered with regularity. While it's hard to observe the exact shape of objects farther away than Pluto, we have many solar system examples showing a radius of a few hundred kilometres is sufficient to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium. c) This is what gives new planets the most trouble. Far from the Sun, the region an object needs to gravitationally dominate far too great, and even large objects will have to share space with millions of rocks and ice fragments. So there being more planets is unlikely due to candidates being far enough away to not having been discovered yet also being so far out that they have difficulty clearing their orbit. That said, the planetary definition is arbitrary, and if we discover planet-sized objects on the very rim of the solar system (something we can not rule out due to insufficient observation capabilities), the definition will again come into question. In that case we could gain quite a large number of new planets."
How was the core temperature of the Sun estimated?,"Hydrodynamic models of the Sun allow one method of estimating its internal properties. To do this, the Mass, radius, surface temperature, and total luminosity (radiative energy emitted)/s of the Sun must be known (determined observationally). Making several assumptions, e.g., that the Sun behaves as a fluid and that local thermodynamic equilibrium applies, the stellar equations of state can be used. Numerical methods are applied to these equations to determine the internal properties of the Sun, such as its central temperature.  A great example for how to work this problem your self can be found in the undergraduate text, 'An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics' by Carroll and Ostlie (Section 10.5). The FORTRAN code to run your own stellar model is included in Appendix H.  A comprehensive review paper on how stars of different masses evolve internally (e.g., with respect to T, P, etc.) that is worth reading is: 
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1967ARA%26A...5..571I A very interesting historical overview of the development of the Standard Solar Model:

"Could we (Earth, Humanity, Solar System) be falling into a black hole?","No. There are two ways of understanding your question.  One is ""could there be a nearby, relatively small black hole (say, a few million times the mass of the sun) into which we are falling. No, there isn't, we would see it. The gravitational effects are localised about a the black hole, matter falling into it would heat up and emit X-rays, it would disrupt the motion of other nearby stars.  It wouldn't create an ""expanding universe"" effect, since it's gravity is only local, it would have no measurable effect on distant galaxies.  It would be strongly asymetric: we would be falling in one direction, which would not cause more distant galaxies to appear to be moving faster than more local ones. Alternatively you could be asking ""is there a universal black hole into which the observable universe will collapse. Again the answer is no, but this comes with a slight caveat.  If the universe is falling into a black hole then it would appear to be contracting.  That is the opposite of what we see.  It is possible that the universe could expand and then contract, if the mass in the universe is sufficient.  It seems that that isn't the case.  The mass (including dark energy) is not sufficient to cause the universe to collapse, so it will go on expanding forever, and there is no singularity in our future."
How far do we have to go to leave the galaxy?,"The sun is within a few parsec (15-25 pc) of the galactic plane, slightly above. The thin disk of the milky way (containing ~85% of the stars and gas) has a density going roughly like $\rho_0 \exp(-|z|/300 pc)$, while the thick disk (older stars, a few percent) has a scale height of 1000 pc instead. So if we want to move up (galactic north) above 90% of the star density we would have to move ~680 parsec, and going down 720 parsec. At this point at least the view would be splendid, but there would still be a fair number of thick disk and halo stars above and below.  The disk has a scale length of 2.5–4.5 kiloparsec (kpc) and the sun is about 8 kpc away from the core, so we are already outside nearly 90% of the stars (not even counting the bulge). The radius is commonly given as 15.5-27.5 kpc, so we are 7.5-19.5 kpc from the nearest edge and 15.5-27.5 kpc from the far edge.  If we count the dark matter halo the distances get even fuzzier. The virial radius (a rough measure of where most mass is inside most of the time) is 200 kpc, so we are basically 200 kpc away from that distance in most directions."
Is there a gas giant orbiting TRAPPIST-1?,"No such planet has been announced as having been discovered. The paper only shows evidence for the 7 (really 6 because the 7th can't be officially confirmed with only 1 observation) terrestrial planets and does not make the case for any other planets. The paper doesn't indicate that more planets could exist, but does remark that there are large error bars on some of their data, leaving room for uncertainty. Ultimately, I think we can cross off a gas giant existing in this system for a few reasons. Of course, only continued observation will really be able to convince us that a gas giant doesn't exist. On these planets could exist life without a comet protector like Jupiter does for the Earth? This is a great question. I think the answer is, we can't be sure. Jupiter does do a great job shepherding comets and protecting the Earth. Possibly this system is rife with comets that constantly bombard the planets. However, that's just one small part of the puzzle. Our Moon does a phenomenal job in protecting us as well. I think, when it comes to these planets, your primary concern for whether life can exist or not is the central star. It is a low-mass, ultra-cool dwarf star. These stars tend to be very volatile, much more so than our generally quiescent Sun. This means these planets are likely to receive much more radiation and be hit by many more solar storms than we are. Furthermore, these planets are so close to TRAPPIST-1 that they're all tidally locked - one face is always towards the star and one is always away. This could make one side inhospitably hot and the other inhospitably cold. The climate/weather on such a planet would likely be unsuitable for life (but who knows for sure). The tidal locking could potentially be good though as it means only the outward-facing side would generally be hit by comets, thus protecting any life on the Sun facing side (assuming its not too hot on that side)."
Do other planets in our solar system experience eclipses or is this unique to Earth?,"Eclipses are common, but solar eclipses like the ones our moon causes would be unusual since it takes a combination of factors, the angular size of the moon and sun are nearly the same from the viewpoint of Earth so that the moon (depending on where it is in its slightly ellipitcal path around the Earth) can cover the sun nearly exactly.   NASA has a nice picture of an eclipse as seen from the Mars Curiosity rover showing an eclipse by a moon with an angular size less than that of the Sun. Phobos eclipsing the Sun"
Has the small meteorite that hit Webb done a lot of damage?,"Has the small meteorite that hit Webb done a lot of damage? The TL;DR answer is an emphatic no. Details follow. How seriously must we take this? The TL;DR answer is an emphatic not at all, at least not for now. Details follow. Details The four detected micrometeoroid impacts have done negligible damage. The article to which you linked answers the question. Quoting and commenting on quotes from the article, Between May 23 and 25, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope sustained an impact to one of its primary mirror segments. After initial assessments, the team found the telescope is still performing at a level that exceeds all mission requirements despite a marginally detectable effect in the data. Thorough analysis and measurements are ongoing. A ""marginally detectable effect in the data"" does not amount to ""lots of damage"". The quote in the question that the impact knocked ""one of its gold-plated mirrors out of alignment"" does not appear in the NASA statement. That appears to be an interpretation of the NASA statement by Reuters. That the telescope ""is still performing at a level that exceeds all mission requirements"" also does not amount to ""lots of damage"". The damage was minimal, and if all that it did was to knock a mirror segment out of alignment, that is completely recoverable. Every spacecraft suffers glitches, most of which are minor but some of which are major. ""Lots of damage"" would correspond to a major glitch. This was not. This micrometeoroid impact was a minor glitch, and most likely a rather minor and fully recoverable glitch. That ""thorough analysis and measurements are ongoing"" is not a cause for alarm. It's what spacecraft operators do when confronted with any glitch in the spacecraft, even rather minor ones. Micrometeoroid strikes are an unavoidable aspect of operating any spacecraft, which routinely sustain many impacts over the course of long and productive science missions in space. Below is an image showing micrometeoroid / orbital debris (MMOD) damage to the Hubble during the second Hubble repair mission in 1997. The micrometeoroid or orbital debris that caused that damage passed completely through the mirror. The primary mirror was never replaced during subsequent Hubble repair missions. Despite this damage, the Hubble has continued to deliver very high quality in the 25 years (and probably more) that followed this impact. One MMOD impact is not something to worry about.  The Hubble telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) was installed in 1993 during the first Hubble repair mission. This was the camera that saved the Hubble. The WFPC2 was replaced with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 3 (WFPC3) during the fourth Hubble repair mission because camera technology had improved immensely during the intervening 15.5 years. The WFPC2 was brought back to Earth for studies. What is shown in the photo below is the WFPC2 radiator after the numerous MMOD impacts were drilled out for study. The size of the holes greatly magnifies the magnitude of the impacts. It's the number of holes that is relevant in the image.  Any spacecraft that is intended to spend years in space and that does not explicitly address the MMOD problem is a spacecraft that is not worth flying. The design review processes will ding the spacecraft designers a lot harder than a micrometeoroid will ding the spacecraft if the designers have not addressed MMOD in the spacecraft design. The review processes that follow design review will similarly ding the spacecraft build and test reviews a lot harder than a micrometeoroid will ding the spacecraft if the builders and testers have not addressed MMOD in the spacecraft design. Impacts will continue to occur throughout the entirety of Webb’s lifetime in space; such events were anticipated when building and testing the mirror on the ground. Fortunately, the JWST designers did address the MMOD problem, throughout the design, build, and test processes. “With Webb’s mirrors exposed to space, we expected that occasional micrometeoroid impacts would gracefully degrade telescope performance over time,” said Lee Feinberg, Webb optical telescope element manager at NASA Goddard. “Since launch, we have had four smaller measurable micrometeoroid strikes that were consistent with expectations and this one more recently that is larger than our degradation predictions assumed. We will use this flight data to update our analysis of performance over time and also develop operational approaches to assure we maximize the imaging performance of Webb to the best extent possible for many years to come.” This recent impact caused no change to Webb’s operations schedule, as the team continues to check out the science instruments’ observing modes and prepares for the release of Webb’s first images and the start of science operations. The cumulative damage from MMOD will eventually and inevitably result in severe degradation of the telescope. This is unlikely to happen for a decade or two. Space is not easy. However, the vehicle was designed well and these first impacts caused very little damage. Regarding the last quote, a commenter thought that this means the team is continuing to assess the impact of the micrometeoroid. That is not the case. Reiterating from the block quote, ""This recent impact caused no change to Webb’s operations schedule."" The JWST is not quite ready for prime time. There always has been a planned long delay between arrival in the halo orbit about Sun-Earth L1 point and becoming operational. The alignment and checkout processes are very detailed and very time-consuming, about six months long. The JWST team is proceeding with the checkout procedures that need to be performed prior to attaining operational status. Those checkout procedures have nothing to do with the micrometeoroid collisions. The image below shows very precisely what checkout procedures still needed to be done as of 8 June 2022. Each of the four instruments on the JWST has multiple modes of operation. Each of those operational modes must be checked out and signed off before the instrument is deemed to be operational. As of 8 June 2022, only 2 of the 17 instrument modes had been fully confirmed and signed off. The final commissioning checkout procedures of those remaining 15 modes is what the article was referring to. The goal is to have all of this commissioning work (and signed off) completed by 12 July 2022. This checkout has absolutely nothing to do with the micrometeoroid impacts. "
"If Venus and Mars changed places, would we then have 3 habitable planets?","This is a very interesting question. Of course, as you noted, you have simplified things quite a bit; there are other factors besides temperature that affect habitability. Regarding Venus, you probably know that Venus is extremely hot at its surface not just because it is closer to the Sun, but because it has a thick CO2 atmosphere and is warmed by the greenhouse effect. There are, in fact, two things about Venus that would prevent it from being habitable wherever you put it. One is the lack of a magnetosphere, which is necessary to prevent ionizing radiation (particularly from the solar wind) from reaching the planet's surface. The lack of a magnetosphere appears to be due to the lack of a geodynamo on Venus, which has to do with the structure of its core. Second, Venus appears to lack tectonic plates, which you may know are responsible for earthquakes here on Earth. Interestingly, tectonic plates play a major role in controlling the buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere (see here for details). Lacking tectonic plates, Venus is doomed to have a large CO2 atmosphere wherever you put it, which would not make it a nice place to live. Mars, on the other hand, is a very different matter. It has both a magnetosphere (albeit it is very weak) and it likely has tectonic plates (although last I heard it is thought to only have two). One of the reasons that NASA has sent so many probes to Mars is that it was thought to be habitable at one point. It is thought that Mars's growth was stunted because of gravitation effects from Jupiter and Saturn. So, in another universe, Mars could have ended up very much like another Earth."

The stars you asked about are Deneb (center) and Vega (bottom).
The constellation in the center and below is Cygnus; we also see Cepheus at upper right and part of Draco at lower right.
 The stars appear as blobs 10-12 arcminutes wide due to several factors:"
Why do stars become red giants?,"(This is somewhat simplified but I hope it gets the idea across.) The reactions stop in the core because it runs out of fuel. During the main sequence, the star is supported by the fusion of hydrogen into helium. Eventually, the hydrogen runs out at the centre, so hydrogen fusion is no longer possible there. Why doesn't it start fusing helium into carbon right away? That's because the core isn't hot or dense enough yet. Different reactions broadly rely on the presence of different resonant states in the nuclei and, in the case of helium, such a state cannot be reached often enough until the core temperature is about $10^8$ kelvin. In order to get that hot, the core has to contract and heat up. It eventually does (if the star is massive enough) but it doesn't happen instantaneously. Remember that the gas is still hot and at high pressure, which it exerts on itself and its surroundings. Meanwhile, at the edge of the core, the star (partly as a result of said contraction) is hot enough to turn hydrogen into helium, so it does so. This is exactly the nuclear-burning shell that distinguishes the internal structure of a red giant. So maybe think of it this way. Imagine a star at the end of the main sequence. Where is it hot enough to fuse hydrogen into helium? Everywhere up to the edge of the core! Does it fuse in the core? No, because it's out of fuel. So where does it fuse? At the edge of the core, which we recognize as the shell."
Affordable night sky photography,"For long exposure pictures you need to have a motorized mount for your camera. The earth's rotation will lead to streaks otherwise. An affordable way to do this is to use a standard tripod with a star tracker on top. There is a variety of products like: They cost around 400-500 USD and are fairly small. You need to align them to the sky's north pole (using the star Polaris in Ursa Minor), and then they will rotate your camera as the earth rotates during the night. Also, you may want to start with your 50mm lens first. The greater the focal length, the higher the magnification, and also the more visible the tracking errors and misalignments of the sky tracker and camera system will be. Be prepared to spend quite some time trying to get good results!"
Why are asteroids with zero orbital inclination rare?,"Short answer: The scarcity of asteroids with an inclination near zero is an expected result of normally distributed inclinations in 3-dimensions about the normal vector to the reference plane, rather than selection bias or an orbit ""clearing"" around zero degree inclination. Long answer: Orbital inclination is typically defined as the angle between a reference plane and the orbital plane:  An equivalent definition is the angle between a reference plane normal and the axis of revolution of the orbiting body overlay-ed here:  Notice that the axis of revolution can be mapped to a point on the Celestial Sphere. We can generate a Gaussian distribution of points on the unit sphere centered with mean at the reference normal using the von-Mises Fisher distribution.  The specific algorithm for generating sampling points is given on Stack Overflow. Here is a group of 20 revolution axis intercept points with their corresponding circular orbits:  We can generate and plot a thousand points on a unit sphere (that I rotate to show the structure):
 Note that only the very top points of this distribution correspond to inclination angles of nearly zero. As the inclination increases, the points get less dense, but the areas on the unit sphere are larger. The below plot is looking down from above the North Pole, with the orbits with inclination less than 2 degrees colored red, and the orbits with inclinations between 2 and 4 degrees colored green.  Note that even though the points are the most dense at the pole, the area covered is the smallest, so 13 points are red, while 50 points are green.  This is the explanation for why we see very few asteroid orbits with inclinations of less than 1/2 a degree from the original question.  Below is a plot with the y-axis as inclination and x-axis as longitude compared with the OP's post. I chose a standard deviation that was much too large, but the 1000 point Monte Carlo demonstrates the same statistical effect asked about by the OP.  Notes: The above example is for circular ellipses all with the same SMA for convenience, but I don't think we lose any generality. I assume the reference plane in the picture used by the OP is the Earth's ecliptic, but the above answer works for the Sun's equatorial plane, or Jupiter's orbital plane, or any other close reference plane.  We can assume that the asteroid inclination distribution 2D mean is actually going to be a bit offset from any choice of reference plane normal. Orbital Mechanics can be very non-intuitive.  Inclination is a 1D value, but its representative underlying probability distribution is best modeled on a 2D spherical surface in 3D. It's somewhat ironic that I claim this is strictly a math problem, but there are no equations in the above post.  The power of the Monte Carlo approach is in its simplicity and resultant appeal to mathematical intuition. Statisticians/Probabilists should immediately recognize the distribution of orbit inclinations as a variant of the Rayleigh distribution which should lend a hint that a compression from 2D variables to 1D has occurred.

Did we discover 10 or 12 new moons of Jupiter?,"Per the Carnegie Science article that Magic Octopus Urn linked from NASA in the comments, a Carnegie Science team led by Scott S. Sheppard noticed something new in spring of 2017 (though some observations occurred as early as 2016). It took a year to confirm the discovery of the new moons. Ten of the moons orbit in the outer swarm of moons, which is one of the ways to divide the groups of moons. Nine of these follow the pattern of the other moons which orbit Jupiter in retrograde (the opposite direction of the planet's rotation). One they call ""oddball"" because it orbits prograde (the same direction as the planet's rotation) and has a more inclined orbit than the inner prograde moons. Two of the moons orbit in the inner group, which is what brings the total number of discoveries up to twelve, as referenced in the first set of articles in your post. Like the other inner moons, these orbit prograde. One of the retrograde moons and the ""oddball"" were first noticed in 2016. One of the inner group and the rest of the retrograde moons were discovered in 2017. The second inner group moon was discovered in 2018, then most were announced together on July 17, 2018. (Dates collected from Wikipedia.) The retrograde moon discovered in 2016 and one of the retrograde moons discovered in 2017 were announced in 2017, this means only ten moons were announced on July 17, 2018, which is why the Nature article refers to ten new moons. The EarthSky article talks some about the ten and the twelve, and it does clarify both groups (divided by inner/outer and year of announcement)."
How can the 13.8 billion years old universe have a radius of 46 billion light years? [duplicate],"You assumption is wrong. Universe can( and is ) expand faster than the speed of light. The photon emitted towards our planet in the early universe, had to traverse a universe that is expanding. That photon experienced redshift, that means his wavelenght increased and frequency decreased. We measure that photon's wavelength, compare it to a photon that was not redshifted and calculate the scale, which is then applied to the radius of the observable universe. Reading this Wikipedia page should give you more complete understanding of the problem. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe"
How do we know Nemesis is not a black hole (or neutron star)?,"If the Sun had been born in a relatively wide binary system with a star that was to become a black hole or neutron star via a supernova, then (a) it is quite likely that such a system would be disrupted by that supernova and we would not be in a binary system now; (b) there should be evidence of the supernova in the form of very high abundances of the daughters of certain short-lived radionuclides incorporated into solar system material. There is some evidence of the latter, but not I think enough for the Sun to have been in a binary system with such a star (though I might be checking this). An alternative argument is that the Sun is captured in orbit by the stellar remnant at a later date. This avoids the supernova problems, but the capture process is inherently unlikely in our Galaxy once stars have left their birth environments, especially capture which is tuned rather precisely to yield just less than zero for the resultant system potential energy of a very wide binary. Capture by a ""normal"" star would in any case be much more likely than capture by a relatively rare compact object."
How many stars can stay close to each other without collapsing?,"Well, if they have an angular momentum with respect to their center of mass, or in other words , if they are in orbit, gravitational collapse is not the issue. This is what happens when three bodies are in orbit around each other. Don't get disappointed so soon. There is indeed a way to avoid this. If the three bodies are of comparable mass, and one of the bodies is situated at L4 or L5, tuning the orbital parameters may work just fine, but then you gotta worry about tidal forces.   So, if the size of our third star exceeds the area given to it at L4/L5, it will experience tidal forces and will start ejecting mass to either of the two other stars, or both. But as Zolan commented above, astronomy with an infinite universe has a possibility for everything. What are listed above are the most common problems which arise, that is the reasons which are mainly responsible for making such systems highly unlikely of existence. But here's a system which works the way you described :  A binary system exists, and the third star is far enough that it experiences the gravity as that of a single star. And the nearest planet(as you want it to be a ""solar system""), is so far that it experiences the gravity of the three stars as that of one. Now, since ""close"" is a relative term, for the planet, the three stars are appreciably close. So, the answer to your question, YES and NO"
Whats the probability of a hazardous impact for human life on Mars?,"We actually have a very good idea of this because the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has been orbiting Mars for over a decade. The MRO is, basically, a spy satellite around Mars and is continually taking high-resolution photos of the surface. It has revisted much of the surface, taking pictures multiple times over the years. As a consequence, we have a very good idea of the rate of formation of craters on Mars. We have seen numerous craters that have formed between visits to a spot, but none are very large. The key thing is that we now have a very solid measurement of the flux of smaller objects onto Mars and can say with certainty, that that sort of impact is way down on the list of perils. (It's probably less than the odds of being killed by a tornado in the Midwest.) Larger impacts are a bit harder since we haven't seen any, but we have two lines of evidence. First, space debris follows a distribution in size vs. frequency that we've measured, and it's not much different around Mars' orbit than it is around Earth's. Second, the extensive photography we have of Mars' surface (which we now have mapped better than Earth's!) allows us to count craters and to make estimates of their age. We know that small craters a few yards to tens of yards across are much more common and we know the rate at which they hit, so astronomers count the number of small craters on the floors of larger craters and can make a very good estimate of the age of the larger crater.  From this we have developed measurements of the rate of cratering at all sizes, and, again, the hazard isn't that great. I'd note that the risk of what on Earth would be civilization-killers is actually lower on Mars because of its lack of an atmosphere. The Chicxulub impact that killed the dinosaurs killed most of them through the superheated steam and air shockwave that went around the Earth followed by the years of Asteroid Winter that followed.  Mars' atmosphere isn't heavy enough to support either, so ""all"" you'd have to do is hunker down and wait out the fall of rock fragments... (Still, it's an event better watched from orbit than from the ground.)"
"Conventional matter to dark matter ratio, outside of galaxies","Let me see if I can answer at least some of this. Yes, there is dark matter between galaxies. This is demonstrated by the fact that in galaxy groups and clusters, you need more dark matter than is found in the galaxies themselves to explain what's going on: in terms of why the groups or clusters are gravitationally bound in spite of the extreme velocities of the galaxies within the groups/clusters; why the X-ray-emitting gas in clusters is so hot and high-pressure and yet still confined to the cluster; and in order to explain the gravitational lensing of background galaxies by clusters. (Also supported by observations of things like the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect in clusters.) (In fact, the oldest evidence for dark matter was the extremely high velocities of galaxies within clusters as measured by Fritz Zwicky back in the 1930s. This is also one of the failure modes of Modified Newtonian Dynamics as an alternative to dark matter: even if you think you can get rid of dark matter within galaxies, you still end up needing dark matter within galaxy clusters, in addition to the galaxies themselves.) And, of course, cosmological models indicate that dark matter accounts for about 25% of the critical density of the universe. In order to have that much dark matter, you have to have more dark matter than what's inside individual galaxies. ""If there is dark matter between galaxies. Do we know or believe: what is the ratio of dark matter out there?"" I think the simplest way to answer this would be to take the dark-matter/baryonic-matter ratio for the universe as a whole, as determined by current cosmological observations and models. This gives a ratio of about 5:1. ""Galaxies exist in filaments and walls. Does dark matter do this? or is it evenly-spread?"" Yes, dark matter does this. The reason we see galaxies in filaments, clusters, and walls is because the dark matter has gravitationally clumped into those structures; on this scale, the galaxies are basically along for the ride, following the gravitational pull of what the dark matter is doing. The reason for galaxies existing in filaments is because of the uneven distribution of the density of both regular and dark matter throughout the universe. An overdensity leads to the matter collapsing to form (for instance) a galaxy, but the overdensity can be asymmetric. This leads to the collapse happening faster in one particular direction, causing galaxies to form in filaments (see e.g. this summary paper for an overview). This page has images from a large-scale cosmological simulation (the Millennium Simulation). Most of the images showing filamentary structure on different scales are showing the dark matter only."
"What physical features determine if a planet is a major, minor or dwarf planet?","Planets For a body to be classified as a planet it must have a few physical characteristics: Mass It must have enough mass to have a strong enough gravity to overcome electrostatic forces to bring it to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium.  Hydrostatic equilibrium is important because early in a planets life it is nearly entirely fluid, crust and all Internal Differentiation The life cycle of a planet essentially leads to denser heavier metals being at the centre of a planet, surrounded by a mantle which must at some point have been fluid (it can still be solid and called a planet as long as it used to be fluid.) Atmosphere  This is usually driven by its mass but a planet should have an atmosphere. This means it should be massive enough to have a strong enough gravity to hold some gasses to its surface.  More massive planets are capable of keeping lighter gasses, such as hydrogen, bound to them too. I.e Jupiter.  Magnetosphere A magnetosphere suggests that the body is still geologically active. This means they have flows of elements that conduct electricity in their interiors.  As specified by the IAU:  A celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit. Minor Planets Minor planets  are things such as asteroids, they are usually small mass, rocky bodies. This is different from small mass bodies that might be predominantly ice or water.  Dwarf Planets Size and Mass The IAU have not specified an upper or lower limit for mass to be considered a Dwarf Planet, therefore it is predominantly determined by one other feature called: Orbital Dominance Orbital dominance is achieved when a body has cleared it's orbit of all other bodies. For example planets are able to remove small bodies out of their area through impact, capture, or gravitational disturbance.  Any body that is incapable of doing so is therefore classified as a dwarf planet. So if Jupiter was incapable of clearing its neighbourhood of bodies then it too would be a Dwarf planet. "
What practical considerations are there for amateur observations of transiting exoplanets?,"This is actually quite straightforward with digital CCD's (it used to be quite tricky with film cameras as you'd have to carefully develop film that moved past the lens and assess the width of the trail) Get yourself a good telescope - a 12"" Dobsonian or above if you want to give yourself a good chance of picking out the fluctuations against the noise background. Then select a decent CCD. Five hundered pounds gets a reasonable one, but expect to pay a couple of thousand pounds for a cooled CCD, which will also help to reduce noise. (Buying in US dollars? A reasonable CCD runs about $1000. A cooled CCD will cost you at least $1500.) You'll want a good quality equatorial mount, with computer controlled servos to track the target smoothly over long periods of time. Ideally you will also slave a second telescope and CCD, pointed along the same path but slightly off - this will help you cancel out cloud and other fluctuations from our own atmosphere. Oh, and get as far away from a city as possible - up into the mountains can be a good plan :-) Then arrange your viewing for a series of full nights. The more data points you can get, the better the noise reduction. Imagine the exoplanet is orbiting every 100 days, in order to get any useful data, you will need to track it over some multiple of 100 days. So assume you set up to track your target star for 2 years, plan for 3 or 4 star shots per night to give you a range of data points. These 600+ days of 4 data points per night gives you a reasonable stack of data - the challenge now is to work out whether there are any cyclic variations. Various data analysis tools can do this for you. As a first step, if you find a cycle around 365 days, it probably isn't the target, so try and normalise for this (of course this will make it very difficult to discover exoplanets with a period of exactly 1 year)"
How hot can a planet be?,"The temperature of an exoplanet is dependent on a number of factors, including: The distance between the exoplanet and the parent star. The type (energy output) of the parent star. The ability of the exoplanet's atmosphere to distribute the heat energy. Recent discoveries, such as reported in the article ""Sizzling Planet Makes Some Stars Look Cool"" (Than, 2007), have found that some exoplanets are hotter than some types of stars. For example, the exoplanet  HD 149026b  has a star-facing side of over 2000C (3700F), this planet reflects so little light that it would appear like a ""glowing piece of charcoal"". It is believed (from the article) that the planet is tidally locked and the 'dark side' of the planet is believed to be substantially cooler."
How do/did we figure out that planets move in orbits?,"I've also heard that people in the past knew about orbits even when they thought that Earth was at the center of the solar system. How did they figure this out in their times with their technology? The same celestial objects (stars, planets, the Moon) could be seen every year. So, people figured out there was a pattern to it. At first, geocentrism was prevalent due to prejudice and the  stars ""orbiting"" the Earth in a clean manner (no strange effects). If you stare up at night, stars move in a circle with the center approximately at the Pole Star. This can be mistaken for the Star moving around the Earth. Objects like visible planets (with retrograde motions) were relatively small in number — we have the inner solar system plus Jupiter and Saturn, so people gave plausible explanations for these. Ptolemy theorized that the planet orbits around a ""ghost point"", for example:  (This is called the epicycle theory) how we know for certain today that planets really move in orbits around the Sun (i.e., rather than moving but not around the Sun or moving around the Sun in a shape that is not a regular path). The heliocentric model came up because of various smaller discoveries: With all this in mind, the simple solution of heliocentrism explains everything in a much cleaner fashion, without leaving much doubt in mind. Kepler's laws make much cleaner predictions. Remember that people had catalogs of astronomical data to verify things with. Later on, once Newton came up with his theory of gravitation, Kepler's laws made even more sense (though I believe that Newton formulated his theory with some inspiration from Kepler's laws). I'm pretty sure that there were on-Earth experiments to verify the inverse-square as well. Nowadays, sending probes to space and getting a different perspective has confirmed this with 100% certainity for us. More or less."
"Is Earth's orbital eccentricity enough to cause even minor seasons, without axial tilt?","Very cool question. I want to get into a little bit of detail here because otherwise there would be a one-paragraph answer, and I don't think that would cut it. So here goes. The planets in the solar systems have orbits with pretty low eccentricities (see this for more eccentricity values). At the upper end is Mercury, with an eccentricity of 0.2056. At the lower end is Venus, at 0.00677. Earth is in between but moderately low, at 0.0167. The distance between perihelion and aphelion is 5 million kilometers - in an orbit with an average radius of about 150 million kilometers. Note, though, that eccentricities are always changing. We would certainly have ""seasons"" if there was no axial tilt, but they most likely would not be dramatic. As Wikipedia says Because of the increased distance at aphelion, only 93.55% of the solar radiation from the Sun falls on a given area of land as does at perihelion.  But on this page, it says Orbital eccentricity can influence temperatures, but on Earth, this effect is small and is more than counteracted by other factors; research shows that the Earth as a whole is actually slightly warmer when farther from the sun. This is because the northern hemisphere has more land than the southern, and land warms more readily than sea. So more land means that the planet can absorb heat better, which counteracts the change in distance. But I think that's pretty boring. Don't you? So let's calculate how eccentric Earth's orbit would have to be for it to have seasons without axial tilt. From the chart here we can see that the highest average hemispherical temperature is 22 degrees Celsius, while the lowest is 8 degrees Celsius.   What about other planets? There's a steady downward trend as we get further away from the Sun (Venus is an exception because of its runaway greenhouse effect). For Earth, the average surface temperature is 287 K (15 degrees C). So our maximum would be 295 K and our minimum would be about 281 K (Kelvin = Celsius + 273). Compare that to the other planets. I made a graph, which unfortunately I cannot paste here, that shows that to have a surface temperature of 295 K, the planet would have to be - well, not much closer than we are. Relatively, that is. Roughly 0.975 AU from the star. To have a surface temperature of 281 K, it would have to be at 1.05 AU from the star. This neglects, by the way, the different levels of land/sea absorption. So, actually, if the Earth's orbit had an eccentricity of about 0.35, it could have some moderate seasons. I hope this helps. Note: I used this eccentricity calculator for the sake of accuracy and time. I would still be obliged if anyone could check my overall calculations for this answer."
What does it mean for a star to go nova or supernova? Can I safely observe these?,"It's a matter of size and stellar evolution.  There are many, many types of stellar explosions.  The University of Arizona has one page that describes these types. Generally, a Nova is not what we think of (i.e. a star exploding). That's actually a Type II Supernova. According to that site: Novae are frequently (perhaps always) members of binary systems where the more massive star evolves more quickly and becomes a white dwarf. The less massive star loses some of its hydrogen-rich outer atmosphere to the white dwarf where it collects.  The high gravity and intense heat of the white dwarf make conditions suitable for hydrogen fusion into helium. When enough hydrogen collects, it explodes in a fusion reaction, causing a nova. The gas ejected in the explosion moves outwards at 1000-2000 km/sec. There are (at least) two distinct types of supernovae: The ""Type I"" supernovae arise when the white dwarf star member of a binary system accretes so much matter from its companion that it is tipped over the 1.4M Chandrasekar limit. The white dwarf collapses very rapidly (just a few seconds) until the infalling layers hit the very hard surface of the neutron star. The resulting shock goes back through the collapsing layers, and they explode by hydrogen fusion. And the one we are more familiar with from popular media: The ""Type II"" supernovae are the result of a massive star consuming all of its nuclear fuel and then exploding. The black line traces the evolution of a massive star schematically, until it reaches the supernova stage. Portland Community College actually lists a lot of the variations that happen in the different types of supernovas out there. Type I: supernovae WITHOUT hydrogen absorption lines in their spectrum
Type II: supernovae WITH hydrogen absorption lines in their spectrum. Type II
The type II supernovae are massive stars whose iron cores collapse and then rebound, shock heating the outer layers of the star, which then explode outward. Type I
The type I supernovae are subdivided into three subclasses, called (boringly enough), Type Ia, Type Ib, and Type Ic.
Type Ia: no hydrogen lines, no helium lines, strong silicon lines
Type Ib: no hydrogen lines, strong helium lines
Type Ic: no hydrogen lines, no helium lines, no silicon lines Type Ib and type Ic supernovae are massive stars which lost their outer layers in a stellar wind before core collapse.
Type Ib supernovae lost their hydrogen-rich outer layer, revealing the helium-rich layer immediately below.
Type Ic supernovae suffered more mass loss as supergiants, losing both the hydrogen-rich layer and the helium-rich layer (revealing the carbon-rich layer below).
Type Ib and type Ic supernovae are essentially the same as type II supernovae. As for observing them, since none of them are expected to be close to us (i.e. no stars near us able to go supernova), it should be safe. The problem is predicting when one will happen.  For instance, Betelgeuse is expected to go supernova ""soon"", but in stellar terms, that could be well over 100,000 years from now. The list of candidates in the Milky Way doesn't bode well for one in your lifetime. Although astronomers are often seeing them in other galaxies, and some are observable by amateur astronomers.  In fact, just this past August (2013) an amateur discovered a nova."
Which stars did the Sun form with?,"Most stars form in clusters, so it is very likely that the Sun was part of a star cluster when it formed.  But in On the Dynamics of Open Clusters, the relaxation time of a cluster is calculated to be in the order of $\tau=4\times10^7 \textrm{yr}$. During that time, about one hundredth of the stars will escape from the cluster (i.e. reach escape velocity). The dissipation time of a star cluster is therefore in the order of a few billion years. These figures were calculated for an idealised star cluster containing stars of equal mass. For more realistic clusters the dissipation time may be much shorter. Especially dwarf stars seem to dissipate faster. It is, therefore, likely that after 4.5 billion years, the Sun has escaped from its star cluster. It would be very difficult to identify the stars with which it was formed, unless you can trace back the position of the Sun and other stars before dissipation, which is impracticable. As far as I am aware, no sibling stars have been positively identified. The sibling stars should be similar in composition (element abundances), although they do not have to be solar twins as the masses of these stars may vary widely. EDIT: @adrianmcmenamin mentions an article in Sky & Telescope, where a sibling has been proposed. This refers to an article on arXiv by Ramirex et al. in which the element abundances have been analysed of stars that were earlier identified as possible siblings using galactic dynamics (i.e. tracing back the movement of these stars). Of the 30 stars identified as possible solar siblings using dynamical methods, only 2 stars had similar element abundances, which in itself says something about the accuracy of these dynamical methods..."
Planning to revisit Arthur Eddington's experiment from 1919,"In light of the Apr, 8th, 2024 Eclipse in the US coming up, let me provide an answer, of how I would prepare for it: This way you have all the clear sky nights at your location to come up with the right exposure parameters and observation program. Given that the sun will be moving through the field of view quite fast, I would use 5s or 10s just as the Eddington expeditions did. I would adjust ISO to deal with that and get down to a photographic limiting magnitude of similar depth as the expeditions, which astrometry.net can tell you. Be prepared to change the ISO setting on the spot. Practice that well beforehand, so that you can do it with a blindfold on. Using this approach, you will get photos of the same region of the sky with and with-out a big mass (the sun) present. This way you should also be able to take care of any distortions present in your instrument (aim at having the same orientation on both occasions). Using the usual deep sky imaging stacking programs, you should be able to align the two pictures (i.e. on average) up to a tenth of a pixel and you should be able to measure differences in star positions using an astrometry program like Astrometrica. Using the pixel pitch of 3.9 um of the Sony camera and the diameter of your scope, using the astronomy.tools ccd calculators the expected shift is roughly 3 pixels, so upping the diameter of your scope (increasing the angular resolution) and using a camera with corresponding smaller pixels will give you a larger signal, thus upping your odds of success. BE CAREFUL:
You will need to have a white-light solar filter for your scope for setting up your equipment before eclipse and during partial eclipse. Have fun"
What are practical considerations for backyard radio-astronomy detection of black holes?,"The resolution/error box. Radioastronomy has always been hindered by the resolution, because it is inversely proportional to the size of the telescope and making larger telescopes (even with interferometry) is not always easy. No amount of modern technology can substitute for a large effective diameter.  (When I say effective I'm including interferometry here; either way one needs a large area to build on). Let's take a look at Reber's initial paper1 where he first mapped the sky:  In the diagram on the left, from top down, the three peaks in the contour map are Cas A, Cyg A, and finally Sgr A. The latter two have black hole origins, the former is a supernova remnant. The resolving power of Reber's telescope here seems to have been 6 degrees, and it was 31.4 feet in diameter (and he focused on a 1.9m wavelength). Now, by the Rayleigh criterion, the angular resolution is proportional to the wavelength divided by the diameter. As mentioned before, this is the major limiting factor for radioastronomers, and will be what holds amateur radioastronomers from making great telescopes — amateurs usually don't have acres or land in which to build a good interferometer (let alone the precision), and single-dish telescopes can't be made too large by an amateur. One may notice that I'm citing rather old observations here, on old telescopes; however given that radioastronomy technology has not changed nearly as much as size has, it should be OK to compare amateur telescopes with the smaller telescopes of the past. Now, Cyg A was the first to be identified as a black hole, even though the radio-brightness of Sgr A was discovered at the same time. I'm focusing the rest of my analysis on Cyg A for this reason, as it stands to reason that the first confirmed BH out of the brighter radio sources would have more prominent indicators that it is a black hole. Let's have a look at Cyg A with a better resolution:  (From this paper2, using the 5km array) Note that the black blob in the center is the actual galaxy (probably an optical photograph superimposed on the contour map). We can see that the lobes are less than a minute wide. (The actual galaxy is around 50 arcseconds wide) To me, the most interesting thing that one would like to see here are the gas jets coming from the central galaxy. As mentioned in my answer here, these radio-emitting gas jets are in a steady line over thousands of light years, indicating that they come from some sort of cosmic gyroscope which has been steady for very long. However, even with the Ryle telescope the 1969 people could not get a picture of them; just a slight hint of their existence from the shape of the lobes. Alright, so no gas jets. What else can indicate a black hole? They could try to look at the lobes themselves. They do not directly indicate the existence of a black hole, but their shape hints towards them being formed from jets (this is pretty much in retrospect). However, with lobe dimensions of less than an arc minute, there's not much an amateur can get here, either. It's possible that a really good amateur telescope would just manage to notice that there are two lobes, but not much else as far as I can tell. The other interesting bits would be the central galaxy itself, but it's too small. In the optical region one may have a chance of seeing Baade's ""colliding galaxies"" (it only looks like a pair of colliding galaxies). The gravitational effects (lensing, etc) are really only visible in the optical and beyond, for it to be visible in the radio we would need to be very lucky and have a huge radio source pass behind Cyg A — not happening anytime soon. I'm pretty sure that a similar analysis would work for Sgr A or any other black hole candidate; the gas jets would be too small for an amateur radiofrequency resolution, and the gravitational effects of the black hole would only work well in the optical and X ray frequencies. 1.

"Is it ""weird"" that all disc galaxies rotate once every billion years?","It is not weird. The comment is about a certain class of galaxy, and not just a class but a stage of galaxy formation and development within that class. We start with a fairly constant distribution of matter within the universe. Stars for when this matter clumps together. This clumping is going to have a fairly even distribution. Stars then clump together to form structures that we identify as galaxies. The distribution of this clumping is also going to have a fairly constant distribution. This carries on up the chain to clusters of galaxies, and clusters of cluster and so on. Going back to stars, we identify main sequence stars. These are stars that start of with a mass and composition that is very common and then have common life cycles. They take so long to burn up certain percentages of their hydrogen, so long burning combinations of hydrogen and helium and then so long going up the periodic table forming lighter elements and in the process becoming the different types of stars we define as being on the main sequence. For galaxies it is similar. Spiral galaxies need to be of a certain size and angular momentum to generate their signature spiral structure. They did not start out as spiral galaxies. And they will not remain spiral galaxies. They are simply how galaxies of a certain size and angular moments appear at certain stages in their development. This means that the outer edge angular velocities of these types of galaxies (for a specific definition of their outer edge) are going to be similar.

"If all stars rotate, why was there a theory developed that requires non-rotating stars?","In a similar way, we could ask... No beams can be exactly 1 meter long. No beams can be exactly
  straight. The material making up a beam cannot be truly isotropic.
  So why should we bother calculating the stress in a 1 meter straight
  beam having isotropic material? Because knowing how to perform this calculation is a building block for doing more complex calculations. The non-rotating black hole calculation also provides a limiting solution.  The solution for a spinning star's collapse will approach this solution as the spin approaches zero.   Similarly, Newton told us that as external forces approach zero, the path of a moving object will approach a straight line.  This is useful to know even though there is no place in our universe that doesn't have gravitational influence."
How are constellations intact if the stars are rotating around galactic nuclei?,"Yes, the shape of the constellation does and will change over time. All the stars have their own peculiar velocities and have some random motion which over time will ruin all the constellations. However, Even though the stars are moving at rapid speeds, to us, in our sky, due to their enormous distance from us, they appear to move extremely slowly and the constellations can stay the way they are for another few hundred/thousand years until we notice any visible change (Naked eyes observations). Those slow relative changes in position give each star in our sky a particular ""proper motion""—a change in angular position. The proper motion of most stars is extremely small, measured in milli-arcseconds per year, where an arcsecond is 1/3600 of a degree, and of course milli means a thousandth of that. Hold up your pinky finger at arm's length: the width of your pinky, expressed as an angle, is about one degree, give or take. One degree is 3,600 arcseconds, or 3,600,000 milli-arcseconds. Proper motion, in astronomy, the apparent motion of a star across the celestial sphere at right angles to the observer’s line of sight; any radial motion (toward or away from the Sun) is not included. The fastest star in our current sky is Barnard's Star, which is moving radially at 110km/s towards us, has a proper motion of only 10.3 arc-seconds (which is the fastest proper motion in our sky). This means, in another 350 years, it would only move around 1 pinky finger-width. Here is the source if you want to read more."
Are there places in the Universe without gravity?,"In two dimensions I think I can infer in a lame, unconvincing and rigorless numerical way that there are likely to be zeros in gravity from a random distribution of objects there can be points of zero gravity. I create a space with 20 randomly distributed point sources, calculate and plot the force field on a 2000 x 2000 grid then choose the smallest grid point and through a minimization routine find a point with arbitrarily small scalar force. I've done everything on a log10 scale, the max, min values are of order +8 and -1 but I can easily find log10(force_magnitude) around -14 by specifying that tolerance in the minimization routine. I can't prove this extends to 3 dimensions nor arbitrarily large space and numbers, but I have a hunch this can be addressed mathematically, so I have just asked in Math SE: What is the relative density and dimensionality of zeros in inverse square force fields to density of sources in (at least) 1, 2 and 3 dimensions? Here are six cases for flavor: "
Do planets lose energy while rotating?,"The energy a rotating planet has is derived from the rotation the initial interstellar cloud of gas and dust had prior to it flattening into a protostellar disk. The rotation of a planet is bound by the laws of angular momentum. Alone, without any other influences, the rate of rotation will remain constant for ever. However, some planets have moons & these will affect the planet's rate of rotation. Earth's rotation rate is slowing due to the Moon, particularly through the action of tides. During the era of the dinosaurs a day of Earth was went from 19 21 hours (620 Ma ago) to 23 hours (65 Ma ago), now its 24 hours. I'll let others who are more knowledgeable about this than me comment on how a star might affect the rotation of planets orbiting it."
