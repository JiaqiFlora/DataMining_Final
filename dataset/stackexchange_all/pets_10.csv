Why does my cat keep patting my face?,"This is one way cats show affection or try to get your attention. Not all cats do this, however, but they might show this in other ways such as as kneading, gentle scratching and gifting etc. Cats also show affection to other animals by rubbing against them ""When your cat puts its scent on you, it's saying something like, 'You and I belong together because I smell you on me and you smell me on you.' It's a scent complement."" Some cats periodically approach a relaxed owner and stretch out their paws to softly touch the owner's face. The cat repeats this gentle reaching in the hope that the owner will pet it, brush it or show some affection. Alternatively, some cats paw their owner's face to wake them from sleep; in this case the cat probably wants affection or play."
How should I discipline my cat for bad behavior?,"Punishment rarely works because cats don't have a social structure that recognizes you as the dominant being in the home, they only understand that you're doing something to them that they don't want (squirting them with water, for example). Therefore, it's much more effective to figure out why your cat is exhibiting the undesireable behavior and meet those needs in a way that is acceptable to both of you rather than punishing the cat for the undesireable behavior.  Usually, cats climb on countertops because they have instincts telling them to climb (better view, hiding from predators/prey, etc).  To keep them from the kitchen countertops, you should install cat wall shelves and/or cat trees to give them that height advantage that they are looking for. Sometimes it's hard to find space for these things in the kitchen, but even devoting a corner to a set of shelves so they can watch you cook can be helpful! (They also may be climbing on the countertops if you leave dirty dishes out that they can scrounge for food from, so housekeeping is important!). I'm not familiar with dog/cat interactions, so it's difficult for me to give advice there. We do have a cat who's much younger than the other cats and often would harass them because he had a lot of energy and wanted to play. I started making SURE that I spent 30-60 minutes a day playing with him with wand toys to tire him out, and he is now much less bothersome to the older cats.  "
How can I fix my relationship with my 7 month old cat after I've constantly abused her the past month?,"As in human cases of abuse, if you genuinely want to repair the relationship, the first and most essential thing to accept is you may not be able to. Especially with a young kitten, it's entirely possible you've scarred her for life. Even if she can recover in general, she may never be able to respond to you without fear.  The second most essential thing is the need for accountability. You know now that you are a person capable of abusing a kitten. You don't have the luxury anymore of assuming you will just not do those things. You need to involve at least one person that can hold you to account. I would honestly recommend that you give her to someone else who does not live with you. Give her a clean break and allow her to re-establish trust with an uninvolved human being. If this person reports to you that she's stabilized emotionally and acting like a normal cat towards them, then you can attempt a supervised visit with her. Do not push interaction on her - you should treat her like a feral cat, at maximum extend a hand and invite her towards you. Do not approach her or take any action that could conceivably be considered threatening. Accept that it could take numerous repeats of this before she is willing to approach. If after several tries of this you see no improvement, or if the person caring for her reports that she backslides significantly after your visits, refer to point 1: it may be a hopeless case where you are concerned. Accept this and let her go. If she begins to warm back up to you, however, you could consider taking her back only if the following conditions are met: Recovering from being an abuser is possible (especially as you're still young), but it is a very serious matter and you cannot treat any part of this lightly. It is vitally important that you address the original abuse and commit to changing anything and everything that contributed to your behaviour. Do not accept responsibility for any animal until point 2 has been satisfactorily achieved, and even then, tread with caution. People criminally charged with animal abuse can be legally barred from owning animals again in the future; in the end this may be the sentence you have to impose on yourself."
How much purring is too much purring?,"Cats purr, as well as meow to communicate. Purring doesn't always mean the cat is happy. It's a type of language for the cat. There has been research into the way cats communicate with their owners and how the different types of meows and purrs evoke reactions in their owners, ultimately helping the cat to communicate her needs and wants and getting them met. The pitch of the sound will evoke certain emotional responses within cat owners to express whether the cat's needs are urgent or a signal of being contented. (1)(2) Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) is also known as the purring disease; is an illness that can be fatal to cats and one of the features is that the cat will continue to purr up until the moment of death or last consciousness before death. The purring may also be more noticeable due to chronic airway congestion. (3)(4) I don't believe that there would be an upper limit in a healthy cat. Some cats will be more inclined to purr more than others, for more reasons than are practical to list here. If your cat is not drooling when she purrs, has bad breath, difficulty breathing or sounds congested, does not have any erratic behavior, it would most likely be safe to say your cat is healthy. Interestingly, there is some research into cat's purring and links to the purrs increasing the pet owners health due to the frequency of a cat's purr resonating with the human body. It suggests a form of entrainment that is similar to the effects of soothing music on the body that is discussed here  Does music affect heart-rate?.

"What is this street cat asking for, with continuous meowing?","If she's not satisfied with food/drink it may be that she is actually seeking nothing more than attention. Adult cats don't meow to each other (in cat-world it's only used to communicate between mothers and kittens) so she's definitely trying to say something to you. As to what, well that's a bit harder to be sure on (sadly there's no cat-translator yet) as a rough meow-vocabulary usually develops between a cat and it's slave-human. In general terms though you can get a rough idea from the pitch and duration of the meow: One or two short meows = A standard ""greeting"" meow, the cat equivalent of ""Hi"" Multiple meows, especially if accompanied by a vertical tail = Excited greeting. e.g. “Great to see You!” often there's a subtext of ""Have you got any food handy?"" Or ""Give me some fuss"" as well. Mid-pitch meow = Polite request for something, “I'd like to eat.” or ""Play with me"" or ""Fuss me!"" Longer, more drawn-out mrrroooow = Demand for something, often an escalation of the ""Polite Request"" e.g. “Open the door. NOW.” or ""Feed me puny Human!"" Low-pitch MRRRooooowww = Complaint of a wrong you have done. e.g. “You still haven't fed me!” or ""The litter tray is full of poop and I need to go"" or ""You're ignoring me and it's making me cross!"" etc. High-pitched, relatively loud RRRROWW! = Anger or pain. e.g. ""You just stepped on my tail you oaf!"" Hiss = Aggression e.g. ""Go away!"" Or ""Don't mess with me or I'll totally claw your face off!"" Hissing is used cat-to-cat as is growling as well as to humans. BRRRUPP! = ""Excuse me, coming through!"" PRRRIP! = General happy noise Chirping/Chittering = Mild frustration e.g. ""I can't reach it (the prey/toy)"" Multiple ""Yowl!"" Sounds = ""I'm in heat"" Low-pitched growl = ""This food/toy/blanket/whatever is MINE, don't come near!"" From how you describe it I think this is likely a plea for fuss or attention, and as @Mick mentions in his comment you probably want to consider carefully before going ahead as the cat may be looking to bond with you and if you aren't prepared to reciprocate then it may be inadvisable to encourage her. Vocalisations do vary from cat to cat, some don't even ""talk"" at all. The nuances of an individual cats ""speech"" are something that an owner gets used to over time. That said there is substantial overlap across many cats in general terms and the list here is intended as a rough starting point for people like the OP who don't have any history with the cat they are trying to understand, it's not always going to be right but it's better than nothing."
Who should win at tug of war?,"This answer is not correct. If you have a dominance problem with the dog (which MANY people do) letting the dog win will just exacerbate the aggression displayed by your dog. The act of playing is a release of energy and aggression, so I don't agree that you need to let the dog win in all circumstances.  Personally I don't let my dog win at tug-of-war, and she isn't the least bit less interested in playing because of this. That being said, I have trained some very timid dogs, and it is beneficial to them to win at tug-of-war, as it increases their confidence. As with many other things, one answer is not suitable for all dogs. Edit: Let them win: Don't let them win: Depends (there are a lot of these, I left most of them out): Now, I'm not asserting that all of these sources are credible by any means, but it gives you an idea that the problem is hardly ""solved""."
Can cats safely eat raw meat?,"You can feed cats raw meat, they're obligate carnivores after all, but human processed meats can introduce other bacterias and contaminates into meat that might not be there otherwise. If you want to do this, which I can understand, then you should introduce the raw meats carefully into their diet and only from a source that you trust, such as local butcher who is following good practices (if they save bones for dogs, it's probably a good sign).  While you're doing this, monitor your cat carefully and if there is anything happening that concerns you such as unusual stool, vomiting, etc. then stop immediately and potentially take him/her into a vet for a check up. As an aside, there are some really good food products for cats that don't have as much (or little) filling in them. Spend some time reading the labels and look for products that are all meat or very, very high meat volume. Your cats will appreciate it. :)"
What causes a dog to lunge at an unknown child and how should the owner respond?,"Distraction, via food, voice or otherwise, is usually a good way of managing in the short term but in my personal view it can take quite some time before the dog gets the connection if you're using distraction alone and relying on things to happen (i.e. whenever a child happens to pass by). Another short term technique to can be of help is finding an incompatible behaviour, i.e. one that, if he performs that behaviour, he can't exhibit the problem behaviour at the same time. In your case, for example, you might ask your dog to sit and to watch you. Both behaviours are incompatible with lunging, i.e. it can't lunge and sit at the same time. But you'll have to ensure his motivation to keep sitting is higher than his fear of the child. So get not just your average treats but very, very special super yummy sausages, steak, whatever he likes most. This is different from simple distraction, as you are asking your dog to actively do stuff and he knows that lunging at children will mean losing out on the reward he knows he's getting if he just keeps still that little bit longer. The long term solution is what's called desensitization and counter-conditioning. In short, it means gradually getting your dog used to whatever triggers the fear reaction (and it is fear 99% of the time rather than aggression) while at the same time associating the trigger with positive outcomes. Practically, it means you'll want to recruit someone's child to help you, since children seem to be the trigger. The main thing to do is to make this training exercise safe for the child, your dog and yourself, so ideally set it up with a fence between the dog and the child, so the dog can't get at the child even if you lose control of the leash. Find the distance at which your dog is still comfortable with the child, i.e. well before it starts lunging or showing any other warning signals (growling, raised heckles, etc.). While you are at a comfortable distance, whenever the dog looks over to the child, reward it with lots of praise and food (or a toy, if that's what motivates your dog). Really hammer it home that good things happen when it looks at the child and doesn't react. The best way to do this (if your dog is food motivated) is to give him a special type of treat, the nicest you can find, that he only gets when he is around children and behaves himself. Don't use this type of treat for anything else! Once your dog is happy with the child at a certain distance and realises good things happen with the child around, move a step closer. Really go slowly, as getting it wrong will undo a lot of work up to that point. When you do get it wrong and your dog reacts to the child, lead it away to a safe distance and start again. Don't punish the dog! You're the one who pushed it too quickly into a situation the dog is not comfortable with. Simply go back to a distance the dog is OK with and start again. Do this for 5-10 minutes, then wait until the next day. Gradually build up your dog's resistance to children and slowly associate them as being good for it. Keep in mind that this might be a long and slow process for the simple reason that when you're actually out on a walk and your dog is forced into a situation it's not comfortable with (children have the unfortunate tendency of wanting to pet even the most fearsome and aggressive looking dogs) and it lunges, the kid will probably run away, meaning the dog's response just got reinforced and you have to undo that again. Dog is scared of kid, dog lunges, kid runs away => dog achieves desired outcome."
Overly friendly stray cat wants to come in our house,"Thank you for your concern for the little homeless kitty. While it's very likely the cat has fleas and intestinal parasites, the good news is cat fleas do not feed on humans. I used to rescue dirty, sad, abandoned cats and never once was bitten by a flea or any other skin parasite. Treating the fleas is best done with a medicine applied to the back of the neck in my opinion. Advantage II is an example of this. These can be pricey at around $40 or $50. The flea collars are cheaper but be aware you cat will be wearing a potent poison around its neck. This is not good for cats, people who pet them, or babies in the house. If you go the flea collar route, just keep the cat away from the baby and wash your hands after handling the cat. Naturally, don't touch the collar. The fleas are not good for the cat, but it is unlikely they will cause your cat any serious harm if you have to wait a while before treating the fleas. If you just want to clean the cat up, Vet's Best No-Rinse Clean Waterless Cat Shampoo is about $5 on Amazon and very easy to use, and involves no potentially traumatic (for both owner and cat) baths in the sink. The alternative to declawing is manually clipping your cat's nails. This requires some finesse, technique, and getting your cat used to the process, but it is not too difficult. There are also glue-one cat nail covers (think fake nails for cats), but they are a costlier solution. As far as the cat's eyes go, what you describe sounds like an eye infection. These are very common in strays and feral cats. You can try gently dabbing the eyes with a moistened cotton ball to remove any liquids or dried-on exudate. If the liquid is yellowish, greenish, or brownish, it may be a bacterial infection. This may clear up on its own or may require a topical antibiotic ointment.  A good vet will get you a broad spectrum ointment without you having to make a more costly office visit. Also, some stores will sell animal antibiotics over the counter. Terramycin is a good one. Do not use antibiotics sold for human use on a cat. One thing to keep in mind is while you may not be able to perfectly care for the cat, and your baby may be a little rough with the cat, the cat will be much better off just living in your house, under your care and protection, getting regular meals.  The average life expectancy for a feral cat is about 4 years. Under your care she can live 4 or 5 times this or more."
"Is this normal first day home behavior for my kitten, or should I be concerned?","This seems pretty standard for a kitten that was separated from her mother and siblings maybe a bit too young. 6 weeks old used to be the standard age to send kittens to new homes, and it won't hurt your kitten long-term, but it can produce this sort of mourning period. These days, 8 weeks old is the recommended age for re-homing, after they are independently on solid food and independently using a litter box.  Obviously, there's nothing you can do about it now, and you didn't know beforehand, so there's no use in worrying about an early separation. Instead, watch the kitten closely and be as hands-on as possible. Snuggling and petting will help her adjust to you. You can put hot water in an old soda-pop bottle (or any other container) and wrap it in a towel for her to snuggle with. Make sure that the food you're offering her is the same as the food that she was getting before, and make sure that it's very close by to the nest she has made with the blanket. You might also try hand feeding her a few bites to pique her interest. See if you can get her to drink a little water. You might even dip your finger in water and then gently put it in her mouth a few times. Make sure that she is using the litterbox. If you think she hasn't peed or pooped in the last 24 hours, you should stimulate her by gently rubbing a damp, warm washcloth over her abdomen. Her mother used to do this with her tongue when the kittens were younger, and although a 6-week-old should be able to do her business by herself, she might be having some difficulty. If more than 48 hours pass without her eating, drinking, or passing waste, take her to the vet right away. But it will likely not get to that. Best of luck!"
Is blinking slowly at cats a way to tell them that you love them?,"In the Manual of Clinical Behavioral Medicine for Dogs and Cats, Karen Overall describes the slow blinking motion of a cats eyes as a sign of a fully relaxed cat. If a human is mimicking that action, the message they're potentially sending to the cat is that they're, themselves, relaxed and so trusting in the presence the cat. That consequence of that, in turn, may be to further relax the cat which then causes a similar response as well as, possibly, a soft purr. Basically a whole lot of contentment all around. If nothing else, the ability of any animal to be fully relaxed and comfortable in the presence of a human is a sign of trust and confidence and that's as much a sign of love as anything else we could choose to take. So, I think you're both right. :D"
Does purring tire cats?,"Purring is a sign of wellbeing for the house cat. She certainly purrs because you are petting her, but if she would be sleeping on you then chances are she would probably also be purring without you touching her. Imagine this. When you pet her it's sort of like when you get a massage. You might fall asleep or you might drift off a little bit. Your cat is the same. Petting her for 15 minutes if she's purring the whole time is equivalent to her being completely relaxed. It is only natural for her to fall asleep. If she is tired of the petting and want you to stop, she would just move or show you by play-attacking you. Cats can stop purring immediately if something makes them uncomfortable. Edit:
Like @Ross Presser mentioned, cats can purr while in pain, but this does not mean you should ever be alarmed when your cat purrs. However, it is important to check in on your cat and keep an eye on how they are doing. If they show any other new strange behaviour or react in a negative way combined with the purring, then a good suggestion would be to have a check-up at the vet."
"How do I ""apologise"" to my cat?","I wouldn’t start giving treats for small accidents - what kind of behavior are you trying to reinforce? The cat won’t understand the concept of an “apology” via treats. And if careless weaving results in treats, kitty may end up with receiving more kicks trying to elicit treats from the human who is stumbling to the bathroom at night. My preferred way to apologize is to show affection, e.g. a quick scratch behind the ears, “fussing” a bit, something like that, then continue as if nothing happened. The less drama you make out of the situation, the less reinforcement of “something bad happened” in the cat."
How do I give a cat a pill?,"Update : Zaralynda's answer below contains very important advice I wasn't aware of when writing this answer.  To summarize, you must make your cat drink water after pilling him/her, or s/he may suffer esophagus damage.  I believe the best is to wait for the cat to be thirsty or hungry before pilling him/her. After about one month of daily giving several pills to my cat, I managed to find the process not so difficult after all.  Only one person (with two arms) is required. First, firmly catch your cat by the neck's skin with your left hand (mirror this howto if your left-handed), where it is insensitive (you know, just as the cat mother catch them with her jaws to move them), while he's still on the ground.  You don't want him to be too uncomfortable, so if you feel your hand is not at the right place, move it until you find the right spot.
Edit : be cautious with this technique.  You may prefer alternative ways of handling your cat (like the towel technique, handling your cat with your arm under his throat, or help from a second person), especially if s/he is old, fat or becomes aggressive.  However I feel in most cases this technique is the most appropriate for pilling a reluctant cat.
Edit2 : I tried several times to handle the cat without scruffing him, but the results were always terrible and most of the times I ended up scruffing him anyway.  I feel it's much more comfortable for the cat to be scruffed during 15 seconds (actually less than 5 seconds when you're used to it and everything goes well) than to be gently tortured during 5 minutes or more. Then, bring his neck up so that he's on his back paws. Take the pill between the thumb and the forefinger of your right hand. Use your middle finger (or others if you find it easier) both to open his jaws and to keep his muzzle up.  (Now that our cat is used to this procedure, I find the opening of the jaws the most difficult part of the whole procedure, as he won't open his mouth willingly — in particular after the first pill…)  Once the jaws are open and the muzzle up, release the pill, aiming at the oesophagus.  You may have to wait for the cat to flatten his tongue before.  Finally, and it took me a while (and many many spitted pills) to figure this out, the key is to keep the cat muzzle up until he swallows.  This reduces drastically the spitting (thanks to gravity, I guess).  On a side note, actually I managed to give my cat a pill yesterday while he was laying comfortably, without steps 1 & 2, just by ensuring his muzzle stayed up. Caress his chest and release him.  Make sure he drinks something to help the pill get into the stomach (see Zaralynda's answer below).  If he doesn't, use a syringe to force him. Of course the cat may still spit sometimes, but just take the pill back and try again. Tip : if you have several pills, have them ready and don't release the cat until you're done. PS : I didn't invent anything, it's the way my vet taught me."
Can I rename a dog I get from a shelter?,"It doesn't really matter. It's a training thing. You can make the dog respond to either name it might just take some time, especially for older dogs. We adopted our second dog from a shelter and he was so conditioned on his name that he'd cower in fear hearing it, so changing it was not a question. If you think about it, training a new name is basically just training a new command/word for ""hey, attention""."
My cat is not eating or drinking anything after the death of the fellow cat,"If a cat isn't eating it's always time for the veterinarian! As Trond points out, make sure he is drinking water. And until you can see a vet keep the cat properly warm (not hot, but make sure he isn't cold). This could be a disease he caught from the other cat, or it could be a severe case of grief, but when a cat isn't eating veterinary intervention is needed urgently! EDIT: Since a vet has (hopefully) ruled out diseases it's time to go into caregiver mode. I'd try the following, roughly in order, until the cat is eating again: Wet food, first in a bowl, then trying to get him to lick it off your finger, make sure to try both chunks in gravy, and the pasty stuff. Treats, either hand fed, or mixed in wet or dry food. Try warming the wet food in the microwave, to make it more smelly. Fed in bowl, or by hand. Chicken (careful not to include bones), or cooked fish. Tuna, but make sure it's high quality, and never more than a little. It smells really good to cats, and I've never met a cat who will refuse it. But it does contain some traces of mercury, which will build up in the body and could cause issues in larger amounts. If none of the above works, it may be time to look into force feeding, I'd get back in touch with the vet to get instructions on how to do this, and with what. It is also important during all of this to give your cat extra attention, lots of cuddles, maybe having him in your lap on a warm blanket whenever your lap is available. And trying to get back to normal by playing with him. "
How to introduce my aggressive dog to other canines?,"I would really urge you to see a professional dog trainer that you trust, with experience with aggressive dogs, and have him assess your dogs and help you out. But after reading a bit more detail about your situation here than what you gave in another question on why he lunges at children, I'll take a guess at your dog's previous history, which might go some way towards explaining its current behaviour, and I'll try to give you some pointers as to what you can do to improve the situation. Dogs, by their very nature as social animals, are very non-confrontational. Because they possess very many very sharp teeth, they have evolved a multitude of warning signals that let other dogs know what they are up to*.  **Which is why cats, which are solitary predators, never let you know before they scratch you. Giving away your intentions is dangerous if every interaction with another member from your species is a potential fight.* Dogs will look away, lick their lips, turn their heads, pretend to sniff and present the side of their bodies in order to calm other dogs down. If that doesn't work, they start staring you down, raising their heckles, baring their teeth, snarl, growl, bark and snap at you, all in order to get you to chill the heck out. Only if none of these signals work will they start biting, and even then it's usually just a quick nip. However, many of those behaviours are seen as problem behaviours. Many people with a dog that has associated other dogs and people with bad things happening, and therefore constantly growls, lunges and barks at them, will punish the dog for these behaviours. Unfortunately, the dog will fail to pick up on the reason for being punished in most circumstances. Instead, his association of dogs/people and bad things happening will grow but he will start to suppress one warning signal after another until he goes straight for the bite. I'm suspecting this is what happened to your dog and, depending on how much this has been trained out of him, he could be quite difficult to rehabilitate. Given his history, he probably isn't safe to be off leash around other dogs at this particular time. The main problem is that, if another dog does anything to upset him, he won't let the other dog know that he's not okay with it but go straight on the attack. Your main technique for dealing with this issue, as with the lunging at children, is desensitisation. Slowly introduce him to other dogs in a manner that he is comfortable with. If that means the other dog has to stay twenty metres away, then so be it. Reward your dog every time he shows interest in another dog (i.e. looks at him) with lots of treats and praise. Be very quick in your reactions, you want to reward him for looking and before he starts deciding whether that dog poses a threat or not. Try to set him up for success as much as possible. Every time you judge his comfort zone wrong, he'll regress far more than the progress he gets from one good association. If your dog does react badly and starts lunging/barking, try to distract him any way you can but without anything negative, otherwise it'll simply reinforce his bad associations with other dogs. For example, try to get his attention with treats and calling his name in a really exaggerated high pitch, happy voice but only reward him after you've asked him to do something, e.g. sit or watch. If you can't distract him at all, lead him away to a distance he is comfortable with, which will likely be around the corner and out of sight of the other dog.  One thing you can do to let him know that you don't want him to do something is to introduce a no reward marker, i.e. a command that the dog associates with losing out on a reward. This can be a simple ""oh, oh"" or ""oh no"" in a disappointed voice, rather than the stern ""ah ah!"" or ""no!"" you'd use as a verbal correction. Once you have a no reward marker trained in (see below), you can use it to correct bad behaviour without forming bad associations. It won't be enough to stop him barking at other dogs, but if you're trying to distract him with a sit, and he keeps getting up and turning around, it might just make him more likely to listen to you.   In order to train in a no reward marker, you need to set your dog up to fail. This seems opposite to what I've said above, but he will only be failing some of the time. Ideally, get some treats that your dog loves but that you can eat as well. Cheese cubes or hot dogs work great, assuming you're not vegan or lactose-intolerant. Try and find a situation where you ask your dog to do something and you know he will fail a few times. Training in a new command is a good candidate for this. If your dog is a jumper, stopping him jumping up is even better. Taking that last example as a case study, with the dog sitting in front of you, hold a treat above your head and slowly lower it down towards the dog. Depending on how jumpy your dog is, only lower the treat a little bit before reaching down to it very quickly and rewarding him. The goal is to judge the distance at which your dog jumps and, normally, to reward it before reaching that threshold. You slowly set that threshold closer and closer to the dog's face, until it won't jump up at all and waits for you to give it the treat. Now, your typical jumpy dog will break its sit and jump up. In this case, quickly pull the treat back up out of its reach and mark that loss of a reward with an ""oh oh"". That way, your dog will begin to associate the command with not getting the treat. If that doesn't stop your dog jumping after a handful of tries, eat the treat yourself whenever he jumps up. That way, you really hammer home that that treat is gone! Be careful though to get the balance right, you don't want to frustrate your dog and lose interest. So for every time it gets it wrong, put the threshold further away from its face to a distance you know it can deal with and repeat the exercise from there a couple of times. A similar technique to desensitisation is Behavioural Adjustment Training. The basic idea is to retrain your dog to defuse situations rather than escalate them. For that you put your dog in a situation that he is somewhat uncomfortable with but doesn't react to yet. That is, you get your dog to walk towards another dog (or have the other dog come towards your unmoving dog) to a distance that he notices the other dog but does not lunge or bark at it. If your dog starts to show any sort of calming signal (averting his eyes, sniffing the ground, turning its head, licking its lips), you mark the occasion with a resounding ""good boy!"" and reward him by removing him from the situation, i.e. walk away with him. Your dog would be much happier if everyone else would just keep their distance, so removing him from an uncomfortable situation can be a powerful motivator for him. For this to work, it is even more important not to ""set him off"". If he does react to the other dog and lunges at him, help him out and move him away from the dog. Make sure to keep him at a much larger distance the next time, as he'll be more sensitive. For this to really work, though, you will probably need the help of a professional, as your timing and your reading of dog body language will have to be spot on. For a fantastic introduction to dog body language, have a look for a DVD called ""Calming Signals"" by Turid Rugaas. There's a five minute intro on YouTube that will give you a sense of how horribly produced it is, but if you love your dog, you will brave the sleep-inducing Norwegian accent and the horrible 90s camcorder look. Because for all the cheesiness and tackiness of the video, it is by far the best video on dog body language I have ever seen. Unfortunately, you might, to some extent, also be part of the problem. Having a reactive dog, it is likely you tense up whenever you see another dog or child in the distance, trying to decide whether they'll come close enough for your dog to react and how you can avoid them. Your dog will pick up on that, whether it is from your body language or because you hold the leash ever so slightly tighter. You being nervous is one more reason for him to keep other dogs as far away from him and you as possible. He will also have learned to associate you being tense with other dogs being around, so he will actively look for them. If you have a friend you can trust to be able to handle your dog under any circumstances, it would be interesting to see him take your dog for a walk to see whether he reacts the same if you are not around. Even just being on leash, however, also puts up his stress levels, as he knows his movement is restricted. Unfortunately, having a history of attacking other dogs when off leash, it won't be easily possible to see how much being on and off leash affects his interaction with other dogs. It will be very difficult and time-consuming to socialise your dog to other dogs, and you can probably never trust him fully around other dogs. But with time and dedication, you can alleviate his behaviour to an extent where you are both comfortable and happy to go on walks and be around other dogs without constantly worrying about what might happen.

"How can we find a dog to ""test drive""?","Fostering is a great way to see if you're ready to commit to a dog, contact your local rescues to see what kind of dogs are available. The perks with fostering are: 1) You're helping a dog in need. 2) You do not need to keep the dog or find it a new home if you decide it's not for you. 3) Shelters typically provide all food and vet care, no cost to you. 4) You may end up falling in love with the dog you foster and keeping that one instead!

What to feed kittens that are only a few weeks old? (Their mother died),"At this young age the kittens still require milk, you can probably get some kitten milk from a vet store, a quality pet store with a knowledgeable staff, or make your own (only if not available elsewhere, as it is extremely hard to get the nutrition correct, but should be safe for a few days until you find a commercially available one). They will have to be fed with a bottle or tube of proper size. If you have a vet available, please get in touch with them as soon as possible as they will be able to give you advice and help you with the supplies you will be needing. From the first article linked below: Emergency Kitten Milk Replacer 3 oz condensed milk 3 oz water 4 oz plain yogurt (not low fat) 3 large or 4 small egg yolks - no whites It is very important to accurately age the kittens, as they may not be able to properly urinate or defecate yet, which is something they are able to do at about 3 weeks. If they are under three weeks, you can take a cotton ball or piece of very soft cloth moistened with warm water, and gently rub the anal and genital area; within one to two minutes the kitten will urinate and/or defecate. Washing: Most washing should be done with a damp cloth, to also teach them to groom themselves, but if they are very dirty it's ok to use warm water under a faucet to clean dirt out. Be careful not to get water in their noses, mouths, and ears. If these areas need cleaning use a dry or moist cotton swab or cotton ball, or a clean piece of cloth. It's important to not leave them wet for too long, as this is a sure way for them to get too cold. Links to help you along:"
Why does my cat put toys in my shoes?,"This is a common behaviour. There are a few different ideas as to why cats seem to like shoes in particular as stash locations. They are small spaces that seem hidden, which cats like - they want to hunt things and then  hide them for later, and the shoes seem like a good sneaky way to hide them away from the other people in the house (or other animals), as they are small and hard to see into and easy to overlook. They are bringing you a present! Cats tend to hunt and bring the kills to whoever they care for (other cats, people, etc), and since your shoes will retain a lot of your personal scent, especially if they are ones you wear often, the cat will associate them with you, and thus put the toys there for you to find as gifts and proof of their hunting prowess.

Cat is tipping over bed-side lamps during the night,"The other answers are good, but I've had success with a more direct approach: outstubborn the cat. Rather than trying to minimize the sound/inconvenience of the falling lamp, try to maximize it. Be creative, e.g. put a bowl with glass marbles on the lamp (I used this + a metallic plate to create a really loud and startling noise). Anything that makes a racket will do. The idea is to teach the cat that knocking over the lamp is not nice. As you said, there's not much drawback to the cat when it gets knocked over now, so make the message clearer by making the experience even less nice. My cat did it twice after I started using the marbles, and never again. However, you will of course not enjoy the loud sounds so it requires some tenacity from your end."
Why do dogs eat grass?,"I have also been told by various sources eating grass helps dogs with digestive issues.  If the dogs are doing it every single time as you state yours are, they may have picked it up as a habit. According to ""A Vet's Take On Why Dogs Eat Grass"" (Modern Dog Magazine), the following possibilities exist:"
"Why do cats lick plastic bags, and is there any harm in it?","Extensive online research shows it is not just plastic bags which appear to be cat tongue attractants, but photographs as well.  The activity of bag licking varies among cats; not all cats lick bags and not all bags get licked.  There is no definitive answer, but most theories support @JohnCavan's answer of bags being rendered with animal fat or having acquired smells.   Unfortunately, the majority of answers found are incestuous, referring to each other. Here is the culmination of what I've discovered, with each reason listing the seemingly independent sites which support each conclusion: Due to the bio-degradable nature of the bag, it was rendered with something that created a lingering odor.  This could be anything from rendered animal fats (""tallow""), lanolin, petrolium products, gelatin, or corn starch.  As regards photographs, Manhattan Cats notes that gelatin is also used in the photo emulsion process, directly connecting photo licking to bag licking. The Feline Express article breaks down bag materials as it relates to cats, noting the manufacturing process may have simply created an odor which we cannot detect, but cats prefer.  Though Chron Blog proposes corn starch, Feline Express dismisses the ingredient, as corn starch bags were only manufactured for a short time among few vendors.  Feline Express continues by dismissing tallow and even fish scales, referencing quotes from manufacturers stating they are not used. Supporting Sites: Vetriscience, Chron Blog, Feline Express, Amazon AskVille, Manhattan Cats, HDW Depending on what the bag has touched or held, there may be lingering odors from the prior contact, which the cat can detect and is trying to taste, or is simply curious about. Supporting Sites: Vetriscience, Chron Blog The coolness of the plastic, or the texture of the material, feels good to the feline tongue, and may even taste good as well. Supporting Sites: HDW, Manhattan Cats Your cat likes the sound of the plastic bag being licked.  It may simulate the noise of a caught animal.  This is dismissed by some sites as unlikely since cats tend to dislike noise. Supporting Sites: Vetriscience, Manhattan Cats, Chron Blog Plastic bag licking is compensation for an unsatisfied dietary craving. Supporting Sites: Chron Blog Your cat may either have pica, the compulsion to eat things which are not food, or obsessive compulsive disorder.  Either seems unlikely since the licking activity is apparently quite common among cats.  HDW proposes the cat may be performing an orally compulsive act to replicate ""nursing"". Supporting Sites: Vetriscience, HDW, Amazon AskVille Per all the sites, you should not allow your cat to persist in licking a plastic bag, as this may tempt them to chew and swallow plastic pieces which may result from the activity.  Consuming these pieces could potentially create intestinal blockage.  Several of the cited sites refer to instances where plastic bags had to be removed from cats, or plastic pieces were found in excrement from the litter box.  Additionally, you might not know the history of the bag; it could have contacted a substance poisonous to cats. I recommend, when possible, that you do not allow your cat to continue licking plastic bags."
How to prevent my dog from barking constantly when I am not at home?,"You can't expect your pet to keep mum if you are not with him. Solutions: Get the dog someone to give him company. When there is no one at home, you can consider  leaving him at some neighbors home awhile. You can request somebody to look after him while everybody has gone from your house. You can provide him something to play with. This is not very effective in every cases. But in 50% cases, it would work. Give a bone toy or a ball to chew with. My own dog likes to play with them and we got rid of the barking problem. Dogs do not like being locked. Just letting him be may work."
My cat gets angry and scared at me if I stand,"Your cat may be interpreting your standing up as an aggressive posture, as cats will arch themselves up to make themselves as tall as possible when they're being scared or aggressive. Or, it may be that your cat is very jumpy, and dislikes the sudden movement, whereas if you're sitting or lying down you're bound to be pretty still. Perhaps it might help if you try to give it positive reinforcement while you are standing, so it starts to associate your standing up with good things. For instance, toss the cat treats while you are standing, or try to play using a feather wand while you are standing. It's important to also try to get the cat to come to you, rather than trying to approach it, so it feels in charge of the situation and not cornered. "
How do I get my cat to wear a tuxedo for several hours?,"Cats look perfect without any clothing.  Dressing a cat is just about as sensible as throwing a blanket over a statue. If you really want a cat to be in a tuxedo, may I suggest a ""tuxedo cat"".  I have a tuxedo  Manx who is always purrfectly groomed. The main difficulties with dressing a cat is that cats have a strong aversion to being put in things by external forces, so I'd say dressing a cat is not terribly nice to them."
Is it ok to pick my adult cat up by the scruff of the neck?,"Of course, there is a huge difference.  I'd never condone holding an 8 kg cat in the air by the scruff of the neck : always keep his back paws on ground, and as far as the answer linked in the question is concerned, release him as soon as he has swallowed his pill.  And don't use scruffing when not necessary. That being said, having tried to pill my cat without scruffing him, I feel it's much more comfortable for a cat to be scruffed during a few seconds than to be gently tortured during 5 minutes or more.  That's a fact. ;) Now, no other facts, but experts advices (the bold weighting is from me) : Traditionally, scruffing (grasping the cat by the scruff of the neck) has been considered an acceptable way to maintain control of a cat because it does not harm the cat if done properly, and it is effective in many cases.  However, scruffing has become a controversial issue.  Some cats react negatively to scruffing and actually fight harder instead of holding still.  Also, some overweight cats have very little loose tissue to scruff, so the hold will be less effective. In general, scruffing should be used only if minimal restraint techniques are not working.  If scruffing seems necessary, try it for a few seconds.  If the cat gets worse, discontinue and try something else.  When scruffing a cat, use the minimum amount of force necessary and take care to avoid injuring the cat's neck.  A cat should not be lifted or suspended by the scruff because this is uncomfortable and may make the cat's behavior worse. (Joanna M. Bassert & John A. Thomas, Clinical Textbook for Veterinary Technicians, 8th Edition, McCurnin's 2013, ISBN 978-1437726800 — p.186.) ‘Scruffing’ is a general term for a variety of holds on the skin of the cat's neck.  Grasping the scruff of the neck varies from a gentle squeeze of skin, to grasping a larger fold of skin with varying amounts of pressure.  Consideration of natural feline behavior can help put this technique into perspective.  Cats grasp the scruff of the neck of other cats in only limited circumstances.  During the first few weeks of life the mother cat may lift kittens by the scruff of the neck using her mouth.  This is a method of transport and immobilization, and not a form of discipline. During mating, the tomcat grasps the scruff of the queen. Some veterinarians and veterinary behaviorists do not use scruffing and do not condone its use.  They find that using other gentle handling techniques is less stressful, more time efficient, provides greater safety for personnel, and allows the cat to have a sense of control.  They prefer other methods to manage situations where feline welfare or personnel safety are at stake. Other veterinarians handle cats gently and use scruffing only if it is necessary to protect the welfare of the cat or for the physical protection of personnel.  Still others think that scruffing a cat is acceptable for short procedures, in an emergency, and to prevent the cat from escaping or injuring someone. If you think this technique is the only alternative, carefully evaluate the cat for any signs of fear or anxiety.  The cat may become immobile but may not be comfortable, or may become aggressive.  Handle the cat as gently as possible and guard against using aggressive handling techniques out of anger or frustration.  The panel does not condone lifting the cat or suspending its body weight with a scruffing technique because it is unnecessary and potentially painful. (Ilona Rodan et al., AAFP and ISFM Feline-Friendly Handling Guidelines, Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery, Volume 13, Issue 5, May 2011, Pages 364-375, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2011.03.012.) Having a sense of control, even if it is not exerted, makes the cat more comfortable and reduces stress.  Importantly, using the minimal amount of handling gives the cat a greater sense of control, so the cat is less likely to be aggressive. […] Most of us have been taught to scruff cats, but scruffing often only increases a cat's arousal and fear, because scruffing removes the cat's sense of control.  Many cats become fearfully aggressive when scruffed in an attempt to protect themselves.  Some veterinarians, especially in Europe, find “clipnosis”¹ helpful for restraint.  This procedure is also controversial, again because it removes the cat's sense of control. In the author's experience (at least 5 years without scruffing or clipnosis), cats are usually calmer and easier to handle if they are not scruffed. (Ilona Rodan, Understanding Feline Behavior and Application for Appropriate Handling and Management, Topics in Companion Animal Medicine, Volume 25, Issue 4, November 2010, Pages 178-188, ISSN 1938-9736, http://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.tcam.2010.09.001.) ¹ IIUC, clipnosis consists in pinching the scruff of the neck with a clip in order to induce behavioral inhibition — hence the term ""clipnosis"", deriving from ""clip"" and ""hypnosis"". BTW, thanks for asking, I didn't thought about such behavioral implications."
How can I gain back my dog's trust after accidentally kicking him?,"If it means anything to you, dogs have a very high tolerance for pain, so when they scream out it is more because of them being startled or shocked than because of pain.  I accidentally closed a door on my dogs tail, not hard but the startle caused him to let out a loud yelp. He will regain trust you in over time, but an important thing to remember for the future is that dog psychology is VERY different than human psychology.  Your first reaction if you accidentally hurt a child is to immediately fawn over the child and shower him/her with affection.  The child needs to cognitively recognize the accident to get over it. When you immediately get emotional, nurturing and reactive after an accident then you are teaching the dog through your nurturing that you are rewarding them for feeling scared.  Nurturing is a reward for wanted behaviour so in the dogs mind you are telling the dog it is right to be scared and anxious about the very person or situation involved in the accident. The best thing to do is to check the dog for injury, then immediately move on and try to get the dog to not dwell on what happened.  After the dog is calm again, give them a treat to reward them having calmed down and give them extra affection then.  It is never a good idea to give affection to a dog in emotional distress (physical distress is a bit different). You will find the dog will move past the incident rather quickly because the dogs ancestors don't dwell on accidents.  They make their intentions very known through deliberate communication and action.  Dogs also live in the present.  They don't dwell on past memories, their memories of what happened in the past are mostly emotional based and not event based.  Eg. they smell the grounds of a dog park where they were attacked by another dog and they get an emotional surge of fear.  The fear is an automatic reaction."
Cat meows for wet food in morning despite dry food being available,"We had the same problem with our cat. Here's how I solved it (and @Nova did too, once).  When he first came to live with us, he was fed in the morning when I got up and left the bedroom. But one day he became emboldened, and he decided he’d be fed when he wanted to be fed, which was earlier than my regular wake-up time.  Accordingly, he’d wake me up to make that announcement. I found that I didn’t agree with this new policy.  So, starting on the second day of his new behavior, when he'd meow in the morning for his food, I responded by getting out of bed immediately and spraying his face with water from a squirt bottle. The immediate nature of the response was critical because it never allowed him the opportunity to meow repeatedly, which would have reinforced the unwanted behavior.  Then I went back to bed. If the meows repeated (which they did for a few more days, gradually tapering off day by day) I'd respond in kind with another squirt, sometimes chasing him down to ensure he didn’t avoid it. He soon understood that the result of this early morning meowing wasn't food, but water to the face. Within four days, the meowing had stopped completely. Now, more than a year later, he just waits quietly, and when I open the door he greets me happily and gets his food. If you don’t mind the dedication to getting out of bed immediately and consistently (along with the somewhat enhanced level of corrective action) this may do the trick for you. Good luck, and remember YOU are the boss, not the cat. "
What can I do to ease my dogs' fear of loud noises?,"One thing to keep in mind is to not try to comfort your pet. If you secure your pet by using a gentle voice to calm him, it confirms his fear! You are actually telling your dog that it is normal to be scared. The best thing to do is act normal, completely ignore his fear, talk to him normally, play with him as you would normally do and do not allow him to do things you normally don't like sitting on the couch or similar. Your idea of using music to help the dog calm down is good, but do not use it to cover up the sound. Also, you'd want to give him some help to calm down and you can, but don't do it because he is  afraid. Basically, distract him first like stated above, once he ""forgot"" about the storm you can put him in his basket. He will feel comfortable there, as usual, and hopeful unstress. He will then learn by himself to go there when he is scared, but all this should make him less nervous too. Ignoring a puppy might be harder than a big dog, but do keep in mind that comforting a puppy will also have a bigger impact."
How can I help my obese cat lose weight?,"I have had very good luck with two different obese cats using a Tiger Diner cat bowl. They have to work for their food, so they eat more slowly and feel like they are eating more, one of my cats started actually leaving food when using the Tiger Diner. The various food balls and feeder toys are also good. One of the obese cats I've dealt with is also very nervous about food. One thing that helps is to put part of her dry food in one of the timed 'vacation' feeders. She knows that there is food in it and trusts that she will get it eventually but can't eat it right now. This allows her to relax and not stress about getting food. Although it did not work for us, my vet recommended making a broth of water and wet food and offering that in addition to or instead of water. This has the benefit of getting more water into your cat (most cats don't drink enough water) and makes them think they are getting food without a lot of calories. If you can do so without making your overweight cat too nervous, feeding the timid cat in a place too small for the other cats might be helpful as well."
Can my dog get sick from my human illness?,"In the case of the flu, it depends on the strain of it. The specific type of disease that transmits from humans to animals and the other way around is called a Zoonotic Disease. According to PetMD:  The potential for zoonosis depends on a variety of factors, including
  climate, geography, population density, sanitary conditions (or lack
  thereof), grooming habits, and other factors. Something like Swine Flu is a good example and the linked article provides many more.  In the case of ferrets and the flu, its possible to transmit generally human-only strains to them. This is why ferrets are commonly used in studies because their immune system is similar to our own. From Wikipedia:  Because they share many anatomical and physiological features with humans, ferrets are extensively used as experimental subjects in biomedical research, in fields such as virology, reproductive physiology, anatomy, endocrinology, and neuroscience. To really answer your question: In general, no. But there are other factors (like the particular strain of a disease) that can cause you to transmit your disease to your animal. If you're unsure, I think you should attempt to distance yourself from the animal or at the very least try to avoid contaminating their food. "
When is declawing a viable option for cats?,"Declawing is considered a last option before having to hand the cat over to a shelter. It is often only recommended in situations where there is a medical condition that would result in bleeding out at even the most minor scratch. Some other options to use that I have found work very well are Declawing the cat results in permanent damage and can alter cat's behavior and ability to walk without pain.  Learning to manage cat's claws becomes second nature after a while. Also, playing with the kitten with toys only and not with hands should help to prevent claw marks."
Putting a cat into a carrier,"When I put my cats in the Carrier (They don't like it) I use the following method: This is perhaps clearer with a picture, so here is me subjecting one of my cats to this:  Also, as preparation I get my cats in a room where they can't hide, because as soon as they see the carrier they look for a place to hide :-) One last idea is to try to lure them in with a treat, but my cats figured that out pretty quickly and it stopped working."
Can I feed my cat whenever she wants?,"I would not give your cat as much as she wants, obesity is a problem in our pets because they eat too much and don't exercise enough. There are guidelines on the bags of food that tells you how much your pet should be eating of that specific food. Sometimes these guidelines are generous so weigh your kitty every 2 weeks to minimum once a month. From petobesityprevention.org In the October 2016 clinical survey, 53.9% of dogs and 58.9% of cats were classified as overweight (body
  condition score (BCS) 4) or obese (BCS 5) by their veterinary healthcare professional. That equals an
  estimated 41.9 million dogs and 50.5 million cats are too heavy, based on 2016 pet population projections
  provided by the American Pet Products Association (APPA). In 2015, APOP found 53.8% of dogs and
  58.2% were overweight or obese. Cats are known grazers so it's a good idea to purchase an automatic feeder that dispenses portioned food at different times during the day. On average a cat should eat 3/4 of a cup of food or less a day (check the guidelines of the food you have). Cats benefit more from wet food than dry so be sure to add some canned goods, again you would substitute some dry for the increase of wet. Portioning your pets food also allows you to easily see if your pet is losing it's appetite or always begging for more food. Both cases warrant a vet visit to screen for underlying ailments such as diabetes or hyperthyroidism. Here's a good chart to body condition score your cat  DISCLAIMER: To avoid confusion there are 2 different scales - petobesityprevention.org does the 1-5 scale where as now the standard is leaning towards 1-10 scale to be more precise with scoring body condition"
How do I keep a cat out of my Christmas tree?,"We used to hang a bell on a low branch that would ring when the cat started to climb the tree.  We called it the ""cat alarm.""  When it would ring, we would come and get the cat out of the tree right away. Whether or not your cat will eventually get discouraged from climbing the tree is up to your cat.  :) The other thing we did was we cut out a three foot circle out of plywood, and screwed the tree stand down to the plywood.  That way, even if the cat did climb the tree, there was no way he could knock it over."
How do you safely evacuate with cats?,"The first thing to consider is planning.  It is recommended that you keep at least a week's supply of any consumables you will need for your pets in or near your emergency shelter.  You should plan in an emergency how you plan to deal with your pets.  You should also realize that during an emergency you pet is likely going to be acting differently than they will during normal calm periods.  If you have an animal that is normally caged taking them out of the cage then you will want to make sure you have a transport carrier or cage ready that the animal can be safely kept in.   If you have more than one pet, make sure that everyone knows what to do with each of your pets during an emergency and set up who has the primary responsibility for each animal.  Doing this will help get the animals to safety rather than trying to figure out what animals still need to be rescued. Finally as sad as it is to lose a pet your life is much more valuable than that of your pet.  Do not put yourself at great risk to save your pet.  Running into a burning building to look for a loose pet is a lost bet.  If the animal was loose it may already have escaped and run away.  If it is trapped inside unless you know right where it is chances are more likely you will be injured than you will be able to save your pet.  Tell the firefighters where the pet is, if they can save it they will.  Recently an area about 10 miles from my home lost over 1000 homes to an F4 tornado.  The local vet clinics have been offering a weeks free boarding for animals to help their families get a chance to get on their feet.  This is pretty common, as a friend of mine had the vet offer them the same when they lost their house to a fire.  So I would recommend you call your vet and see if they can help, or if they can refer you to someone who can help.   There are also some families offering to foster animals until the families are back in a position to care for their animals.  This is a risk but if you are unable to afford to board your animals for the months it may take to rebuild, this may be an option.  I expect most of the people offering this service are doing so in good faith.  But I would still want to vet them before I turned over any of my animals. This is also something you can plan for.  Talk with your family and friends and see if there is someone willing to commit to helping you out with your pets should the need arise.   This is also something to think about in case you need someone to take care of your animals should you and your family become unable to.  We have an arrangement for our dogs with one friend, and our rabbits with another. So if something were to happen we know they would be taken care of."
Does neutering have any negative effect on the health of a dog?,"Recent studies focusing on pet altering show an emerging concern of spaying or neutering pets too soon can have adverse effects on the animals health. While some will argue that the testing samples are too narrow (focusing on certain breeds) and too small of samples, the results may be of interest to pet owners. While this procedure is the most common pet surgery performed in America, in Europe this operation is considered risky before the age of one, and in general Europe does not typically alter their pets. According to the American Veterinary Medial Association or AVMA and PLOSE ONE a study done at University of California-Davis shows a link between altering and musculoskeletal disorders (hip dysplasia and other joint issues) and some forms of cancer. The study followed 759 Golden Retrievers that showed in several instances intact dogs have a much lower overall incidence of several cancers and joint disorders. Other studies published by JAVMA have shown intact animals mixed and purebred in cats and dogs there are lower incidences of obesity and incontinence.  Many experts believe that the UC-David Golden Retriever study data cannot be applied to all dog breeds. In fact, in a similar exploratory study by UC-Davis using Labrador Retrievers the same links were not found. Also many studies have been shown to prove the opposite of the UC-Davis Golden Retriever study, many altered animals have shown lower incidence of reproductive diseases in AVMA past studies. Many experts feel this is an issue related to the age of the animal being neutered. Earlier castration can cause more adverse effects. However, according to PLOSE ONE's data, intact animal's almost always have the lowest incident of cancer and joint issues among Golden Retrievers even for those who have been neutered later in life. Past studies have also shown a link between early neutering and longevity. The Golden Retriever Club of America had this to say: ""The difference in age at death between intact and neutered dogs probably resulted from
selection bias rather than from any biological advantage to neutering. For example, for a dog to be neutered at 8+ years of age, it must first live at least 8 years. Thus, only older dogs fall in this age category and this artificially results in an older age at death. Also, Goldens in this population were probably neutered earlier in life if they had physical or medical problems that made them unsuitable for breeding."" What should I take away from this research? This research is considered new and emerging and many experts have conflicting ideas about spaying and neutering Even the AVMA Has published an article still advocating the need for spaying and neutering as well as citing its health benefits. Sites like Northwest Spay and Neuter even suggest altering your pet as young as two months old. Listening to your trusted vet on the right age for your pet, because it will depend on your dogs condition and breed.  The truth is there is still a misunderstanding among backyard breeders and the overcrowding in pet shelters. Irresponsible breeding behaviors have led to this push to spay and neuter all pets, and I will personally advise to anyone to spay or neuter their pets as well. Many people will not take the precautions to prevent their dog from having a litter of puppies (because they don't know how or they don't mind if their dog adds to the pet overpopulation). "
My cat demands a lot of attention,"Your cat has been on an emotional rollercoaster ride in the pet shop, and possibly before this, too. She's been meeting lots of people and having little stability in her life, so you need to give her time to put this behind her. If you make some elevated spaces where the cat can see you, she will most likely start to calm down and start to relax more. Cats in general like to have places where they can see what is going on and where they feel safe. You need to create some fixed routines where you engage the cat in play first and then you feed her. Food will make her tired and more relaxed; this will mimic how cats first hunt, eat their prey, and then sleep. The cat needs you to be there for her and she needs to feel she can trust you. How long this might take is up to your cat and you (I have had cats that needed two months to fully settle down in a new home). The play is a good way for your cat to get the stress out of her body, and she will calm down. Just give her the time she needs."
How can I stop my cat from eating too fast and throwing up?,"I really like the specialized ""Tiger Diner"" food bowl. It forces the cat to slow down and ""hunt"" his or her food out of the bowl, resulting in slower (and often less) eating.  I usually use it with dry food, but if you break up wet food into smaller chunks, rather than simply a can-shaped blob, it works just fine. Here is a photo of it: "
How can I stop my dogs from scooting / dragging their butts?,"My dogs also scoot, which indicates it is time to express their anal glands, or ""scent glands"": two internal sacs with openings to the anus, each containing powerfully-scented fluid for marking their poop. By scooting, the dogs are probably trying to express them on their own, all over your carpet, which is a delight to try and remove.  I find that once their glands are expressed, future scooting is prevented.  Glands re-fill over time, so you might need to express them periodically, though expression should also happen naturally when they poop. Do consider that if periodic manual expressions are scheduled, there should be less to express in future... expressions.  Express.  Of note, @KatePaulk from the comments below recommends (and I concur) that periodic expression is a good thing to prevent potential gland impaction / blockage, which could cause them to fill to bursting level, a situation no one wants to deal with. ""So,"" you ask, ""that's all great about expressing the glands, but how do I actually undertake the task of expressing them?""  Expressing anal glands is a horrific process you can pay your vet or groomer to suffer through for you, or you can save a few bucks and do it yourself in the privacy of your own home (hooray!).  I'll explain the process below, as this is how I handle my dachshunds, who are not large dogs (with large glands, containing lots to express).  Certainly, there are videos I can link to, but nothing can quite relate the experience across as a step-by-step process does, so hold onto your seats, no pun intended. Disclaimer: I am not a veterinarian, but I have done this at least one time before. Safety not guaranteed. Must bring your own equipment. Good luck!"
How long is a cat's memory?,"Cats do remember places and people, although where/who they remember, and for how long, is variable (just like humans). There's been some research on feline short-term memory, but I could find less information on long-term memory. This article is rather poorly referenced, but does make some statements about long-term memory that it claims are research-based: Researchers have discovered that there is not much difference between how a cat, a human, or another animal's brain utilizes certain cues to assist in the creation of short and long-term memories. A cat's brain functioning has been compared to that of a two to three year old child and, when compared to a dog, a cat's memory is almost 200 times more retentive. Without repeated and reinforced training, a dog's memory span is about 5 minutes. Cats, on the other hand, averaged about 16 hours, only IF the activity benefited THEM. and  A cat's long-term memories are directly related to experiencing pleasure (benefit) or displeasure (pain, fear or threat). For example, it takes a long time and a lot of patience to gain the trust of an abused or neglected cat. If they suffered physical or mental abuse from a man or child, then they will associate that memory with all men and all children. The same holds true for positive experiences. Every time a cat receives affection, praise, or a treat for doing a specific activity, it is logged into their memory as ""a good thing"" and they will continue to use it to their benefit. The inevitable anecdotes I believe that I've experienced cats remembering me years after we have had prolonged interactions.  One example is a roommate of mine that I lived with about 10 years ago.  His cat is not generally friendly, but we got along very well, and I was one of the few people the cat would actively seek out (i.e. he would climb in my lap and sit there while I pet him).  After my friend moved out, there were periods of 1-2 years in between my visits to his new home, and when I would come over, his cat would still come and climb in my lap for petting.   Over times, my visits have unfortunately become less frequent (I moved out of the area), and while the cat still seems to remember me, he is not as friendly to me as he used to be. Here is a video of someone who claims to have been reunited with their cat over a year after her cat left home and roamed the neighborhood as a feral cat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnTtc4OCu-E The internet is littered with similar claims.  There is also a host of unreferenced claims about feline memory that I won't include here. However, it is pretty certain that your cat will remember you after 6 months if you interact with the cat on a regular basis. Whether the cat is happy to see you (at first) will be another story... ours tend to seem mad at us when we come back after leaving for a few days, and we get the ""cold shoulder"" for the first day or so :)"
Is dry food better for pets’ teeth?,"Trying to find some peer-reviewed article or book about the subject, I found ""The Manual of Veterinary Dietetics,"" from Saunders / Elsevier. The conclusion is that Soft vs Hard foods don't have any clear winner. Many studies were made or reviewed, and the authors found it hard to compare the conclusions because each study involved different animals, with different methods of analysis. Those authors' conclusion was that animals of the same breed may have more tendency on developing dental problems since their anatomy is different, for example, having more or less space among the teeth. Some special food (textured dry food), on the other hand, could be beneficial in the plaque removing process, and flat rawhide chews of small sizes could help too.

What to do when moving next to a bird sanctuary with a loosely-domesticated cat?,"Whatever your general opinions on free-roaming cats may be, allowing your cat to hunt in a bird sanctuary definitely sounds like a highly irresponsible thing to do. If you'd rather not lock your cat entirely indoors, one option to consider would be to build a secure outdoor enclosure for your cat.  Unlike Allison C, I wouldn't rely on just a fence, no matter how ""cat-proofed"", because cats are really, really good at finding ways over, under or through fences. What does work though, in my experience, is simply surrounding a suitable space on all sides with a durable net or wire mesh, and making sure there are no holes large enough for a cat to get through.  The details will vary depending on what your new house or apartment is like, but it could be as simple as surrounding a balcony / terrace / patio / veranda or any similar ""semi-outdoor"" area with cat-proof net or mesh. For a practical example, here's one of my parents' cats watching the local wildlife from behind a temporary net set up to close off their new ground floor apartment's patio:  and here are both of them in winter (one braving the cold outside, one safe and warm inside behind the window), showing the final (semi-)permanent enclosure we built out of chicken wire:  The new structure extends a few meters into the back yard, so that there's room for a small garden inside, including some vines to climb and partly cover the wire fence (not yet visible in these photos).  It consists of just a few wooden posts and beams that attach to the existing partition walls between the neighboring patios and support a chicken wire fence between them, with the old nylon net now serving as a roof over it (because cats can climb, you know) and the chicken wire extending some distance underground (because they can dig too — not that either of these two have ever tried). We even built a simple lockable gate (half visible on the right side of the second photo) into the fence so that we can still get to the outside (not that there's much there, except some trees and neighbors' back yards) without having to walk around the whole building. The important thing to remember (for your peace of mind, and the safety of any birds living nearby) is that cats can squeeze their head through surprisingly small holes if they're sufficiently motivated, e.g. by tasty birds waiting just outside — and if the head gets through, the rest of the cat will most likely follow.  (For evidence, see e.g. any of these YouTube videos.)  But there are limits, and something like a 1 inch / 2.5 cm mesh size is definitely too small for any adult cat to possibly get through.  Meanwhile, it's still large enough that any small birds or rodents that may unwisely enter the enclosure can also easily get out. Ps. I wrote most of this answer before noticing the How to let an indoor cat have some outdoors time safely? thread, which also has some pictures of outdoor cat enclosures.  I figured I'd post this anyway, because it's still a valid answer and shows a somewhat different style of enclosure."
How to keep my cat stress free during periods of constant 90dB+ sound?,I'm in the UK so our nearest equivalent would be the fireworks displays during Bonfire Night and New Year's Eve so I'll base my answer on what I advise to do during those:
How do I introduce our dog to a brand new baby,"The Humane Society of the United States has a few suggestions to prepare your pet. Some of them sound a little silly, but they do work.  One of the most important things is getting the pet used to the new noises and sounds the baby will make - a lot of pets will find baby cries and the like upsetting. You can play crying sounds and the like to acclimate the pet, for example. As for actual introduction of the baby to the pet, they suggest first giving the animal something with the baby's smell on it (a blanket, etc) so they don't get alarmed by the new smell in the house, if possible.  It is also suggested that you try to keep your pet's routine the same as much as possible, and that you greet the pet first without the baby when you arrive home with your new child.  Basically, you want the pet to interact positively with the baby, so you will want to reward and encourage positive interactions, and at first you might want to limit the time the pet and the baby spend actively together. Bring the baby to sit with the pet, etc (with you holding the baby, of course), for small bursts, extending them over time, as the pet gets used to the baby."
How do I discourage my cat from biting?,"I researched this awhile back when adopting kittens. It seems there are a lot of variables with cat biting. These are some tactics that I've had successful experience with (in slightly different situations): If the cat was biting as a sign of play (your fingers, arm, etc. is like a toy) then ignoring the cat is recommended. First, play with the cat (Never let your body be a toy. You can hold a toy, but never make your body part a toy. Use a toy on a string, a long toy or throw a toy. If it's small just do the best you can. I'm just saying this for everyone that might read it.) If the play session ends naturally (cat gets tired or bored) give him a treat. This is a natural occurrence for cats - to eat after play/hunting. If the cat attacks your hand/food/etc (claws or teeth), pull back to yourself and try making a loud sound as if hurt (sharp short high-pitched yelp or hiss) right at the moment of the attack. Do not delay, animals have difficulty connecting your reaction to what they did unless it's immediate. (If you forget to make the sound - don't do it late.) Leave the room as quickly as possible. Take the toy with you. Try to shut a door between you. Ignore the cat as much as possible for at least 15 minutes, preferably longer, like 30 minutes. If you can't keep the cat out, just keep leaving whatever room your cat is in to signal you do not trust to be in the same room with it. Try playing again the next day. If the cat attacks again before the next play time, try to react as you did earlier, as much as is possible within your schedule.
I was trying to socialize a semi-abandoned outdoor kitten that lived in my landlord's barn. He had a terrible biting and clawing habit. This technique (modified for his barn area) worked amazingly well. (Of course leaving him really did mean leaving him for at least a day. Sometimes I only visited for 1 minute! But in just a week I noticed a difference. He stopped biting and started retracting his claws and focusing on toys and walking next to me instead of attacking.) A vet on NPR discussed that nipping (gentle biting) is a natural cat-to-cat interaction that you may never be rid of. For example, during petting when your cat wants attention and suddenly nips. To the cat, it isn't really hurting you. But a lot of vets point out that you can sometimes predict these nips. The cat may be flicking their tail or turning their ears or head (signaling displeasure) before they do it. They are getting annoyed with your petting, it's too much or not in the right place anymore. To us a bite seems over-the-top, but to the cat it was a gentle correction. ""I swear my cat enjoys it but then it bites."" Then remember that it is possible for something to feel both good and bad, tickling is a common example for humans. Vets also point out that the cat may be anticipating a ""bad petting"" and biting when a person only walks near to warn off the person in advance. Two of my cats tend to bite when they get so into petting that they frenzy. They purr like crazy and start rolling over and pacing back and forth. The more frenzied they get, the more likely they'll suddenly bite. When you walk off, they follow you and rub on you ""asking"" for more petting. The best we've been able to do is stop petting them but stay with them when they start getting frenzied (before they bite). We minimize the petting until they calm back down. This is probably too late for you (I haven't read anything about it working with adult cats) but another tactic is to make sure the cat grows up with other cats. It's been shown that kittens that grow up with siblings tend to tuck in their claws and bite lightly. This is because they learn through experience with each other that claws and biting hurt. Basically, they learn to tone it down so they can continue roughhousing for fun. The cat grows up with ""no-claws"" as the default way to play, even with toys.  I've never heard of the ""hold mouth closed and blow on face"" thing for biting, but I have (since you asked about experience) blown on my cats' faces when they get near my food. I don't touch them at all, I just blow a little puff of air toward their face. It works surprisingly well. Anything else and they just came back, but one puff or two and they walk away for good. So I think that might have been a valid idea as a deterrent, not sure as a punishment. Perhaps kittens are more susceptible to being corrected than adults."
"I can't afford vet treatment, what are my options?","The Blue Cross offer's free veterinary services in cases where the owner is unable to afford vet's fees. Eligibility is determined via means testing of the owner, this is based on whether the owner is in receipt of certain government/council benefits: The RSPCA offer reduced cost veterinary services which are based on essential care. Eligibility varies and should be checked with your local branch. The PDSA offers both reduced cost and free services at any of it's 48 UK animal hospitals subject to eligibility. For reduced cost services people in receipt of one or more of the following are eligible: The free service is limited to one pet only where the owner is in receipt of one or more of the following: If none of the above services can help and the situation is an emergency then you can take your pet to a vet and as part of their registration with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons they are obliged to provide short term emergency treatment where the animal is suffering. This really is only going to provide the most basic level of treatment necessary to alleviate the immediate suffering and you should always be up front with the vet about your ability to pay (as otherwise you could be looking at Fraud charges) and I cannot stress enough that this is a last resort emergency option only."
How to let an indoor cat have some outdoors time safely?,"Supervised outdoor time is fine, provided that you take adequate precautions to ensure that the cat stays supervised. We've let our cats out onto enclosed balconies, and an enclosed screened-in porch, and they clearly enjoyed it (well, 2 of the 3).  A cat harness, such as John Cavan suggests, is also a good solution, although some cats will not handle any sort of leash or harness well at all. Some people even go so far as to build elaborate outdoor cat enclosures:  (Here are more images) My mother built one for her two cats, and they definitely seem to enjoy it (hers is nowhere near as elaborate as the one pictured above). The important thing is to ensure that your pets are safe while outside.  Cars, other animals (not just dogs, but also other cats, and various other mammals depending upon where you live), or even your neighbors can all pose serious risks to a cat."
My cat seems to dislike the idea of a morning walk. Should I continue?,"Putting a cat on a leash and walking it around isn't species-appropriate. You can and should do that with a dog, but cats usually hate that. They value their autonomy. The idea ""My cat will feel safe when I am around"" is wrong. Cats don't think that way. While they are social animals, they aren't herd animals like domesticated wolves dogs or humans who have a ""strength in numbers"" survival strategy. Cats don't protect each other, unless it's a mother protecting its kittens. For adult cats, it's an everyone-for-themselves world. Their survival strategy is to hunt anything that's weaker, hide from anything that's stronger and intimidate anything where it's unclear. Your cat will not feel more protected when you are around because it doesn't expect you to protect it. If anything, you make it more anxious because the leash limits its fight and flight abilities. Also when outside what my cat wants to do is to simply run to the nearest bush and get inside to hide. That's normal cat behavior. When you put a cat in a new environment, it will first look for a safe hiding spot. It will start to explore on its own when it has deemed the environment to be safe. You can't force that by forcing your cat out of its hiding spot. That just induces stress. Even in familiar environments, cats will often have hiding spots. That's because they are ambush predators. If you can't see it, the delicious mice can't see it either. Here are some cows, and when my cat sees one she gets terrified. All her hairs go straight as if to make her look larger than she already is. And she simply refuses to move any further.  That doesn't sound like fear. When a cat is afraid, it will run away and hide somewhere. Does the cat face the cows, head down and back up? Does it hiss? That's intimidation behavior. The cat wants to demonstrate to the cows that it isn't afraid of them and that it will stand its ground.  Intimidating cows might not make much sense to you, but remember that your cat is inexperienced with the outside world and unfamiliar with its own strength. It might not realize that cows are stronger than it but still rather harmless. So what's the solution? As the other answers said. Cats can live a perfectly happy and healthy life if kept indoor all the time. You just need to provide a cat-appropriate environment with lots of things to play with, climb on and hide in and you need to control its calorie intake so it doesn't become overweight. If you think that being outside is a more appropriate lifestyle for your cat, let it go outside by itself and let it explore the outside world on its own pace. It's a dangerous place out there and it might get hurt and killed, but there is nothing you can do about that if you want your cat to enjoy it."
Why does my cat bring me her toy?,"I saw a documentary that says cats will bring 'prey' (this included dead plant particulate as well as animals in the show) to their owners, because they believed they were bringing sustenance to the pack when they might not be able to obtain it themselves. So your cat probably thinks you're a bad hunter and she's trying to keep you alive. The things she has to do for you. :)) My cat does a similar behavior with his little ball toys with the bells in them. He'll pick them up by biting through the slots and then he'll walk around the house yowling. He doesn't do it often, but in his case, he's asking someone to take it and throw it for him to chase. He likes to hide around a corner and have someone roll it in from the other room so that he can pounce and swat it. He'll knock it around for a while, then bring it back to your general vicinity and drop it for you to throw again. It could be that your cat wants you to play with her."
How can I keep my cat from climbing on my desk?,"He gets lonely after losing his companion. Attention seeking adventures on your desk help him a lot. Every kind of attention you give a cat is attention. The cat gets noticed. Be it just a lifting off the desk or whatever, he gets what he came looking for. When you know you are going to work at the desk, start by playing with your cat first. After a healthy session of playing, you feed him. If he is on constant food offer, then you feed him those treats. What is important is that after the play he eats something. After eating you should have a satisfied cat lying on the sofa instead of harassing you on the desk. First of all, remove the treats from the desk drawer. Put garlic in there instead. The unpleasant smell of garlic should turn the previously interesting hiding place of treats not so interesting. There are a <selection of scents> that cats are said to dislike; for example citrus, lavender, rosemary etc. The smell of garlic has worked wonders for me. There is also a technical approach to this. It is a movement sensor actuated spray of odorless liquid that is supposed to scare a cat away from a certain place. In this case you would place the device somewhere on your desk and turn it On when you leave the desk. I have not used this myself, but a cat owner friend (having two cats) tells me it works nearly perfectly. Product name is ""ssscat"" in Amazon.com and you can order refill bottles for it too. 
photo by Maritta Arvilommi, used here with permission. If this does not work, I think giving up is advisable. Give up like you own the place: if there is a shelf of sorts on your desk, or right next to it, I suggest to make a bed for your cat up there. You know, something that he finds comfortable to lie on. If you currently have no suitable platform for this, buy something. Your cat should find the platform/shelf a good vantage point from where to keep an eye on you and your business. This leaves only the problem of how he will get there."
What happens if cats drink coffee?,"According to petpoisonhelpline.com, caffeine poisoning is ""[g]enerally moderate to severe/life-threatening"", but while ""[...] cats appear to be more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than people"", ""1-2 laps of coffee, tea or soda will not contain enough caffeine to cause poisoning in most pets [...]"". So you should be safe with the current situation, but please do be careful!"
How can I train a dog to behave with a cat?,"I'm not a professional trainer, but training is what I would do if faced with such a condition: Take the cat into my lap while the dog is watching and caress him (the cat) to make it clear to my dog: he's one of us. Opposite direction: when the dog bites the cat's tail, yell at him to stop. If he repeats it many times, say ""bad dog"" and ignore him for few hours. Eventually, even the most stubborn (or stupid :) ) of dogs will take the hint and leave the cat alone."
How to train a dog to poo in a particular part of the garden?,"Ultimately positive praise, reward, and repetition are the keys. When taking him out after meals, try to direct your dog to the particular area in which you would like him to relieve himself.  You will have to stay with him and try to encourage him to remain in that area until he goes.  Once he does, provide him with positive praise and rewarding him (food rewards obviously will work best).  And keep repeating until he picks up on the idea. However, just like with paper training an apartment dog or regular house-breaking, accidents will happen.  It is important that you do not punish him for going where you don't want him to go, especially very early in the training.  It will only confuse him and possibly associate the punishment with going to the bathroom, which will complicate matter significantly.  "
How can I free a snake from duct tape?,"The last thing you want to do is forcibly remove the snake from the tape. Doing so will harm the snake, by pulling off its scales. Sorry, but touching it is out of the question. Unfortunately you're going to have to get close if you want to save the snake. It's a harmless snake, so you have nothing to be afraid of. You can wear gloves if that makes you more comfortable, or have a friend help you. The first thing you want to do is carefully trim away the tap that isn't stuck to the snake. You'll want to avoid having it get stuck even more. The trick to removing the tape is using vegetable oil. It will be harmless to the snake and will interfere with the glue on the tape more than water will. Use a cotton swab to apply the oil to the edges of the tape, and slowly work it free. This is where you will most likely have to hold the snake, as it will be stressed and try to escape. Just make sure to be extra careful around the snake's mouth, because the oil could potentially block the airways that run along side the mouth. I can't tell from the picture, but if the tape has stuck itself to the snake's eye, it would be best to take it straight to a veterinarian to have the tape removed, just in case it ends up removing the eye."
How can I measure the weight of my cat?,"Do you have a (preferably digital) bathroom scale? If so, weigh yourself. Now get off the scale and let it reset. Pick up the cat and weigh yourself holding the cat. Subtract."
Can I feed my cat a vegetarian or vegan diet?,"Although PETA seems to say that it's perfectly healthy, cats are not vegetarian and thousands of years of evolution has made them into carnivores.  They have a specific requirements for nutrients that vegetarian diets just cannot provide. With the exception of special situations where the cat requires a modified diet, vegetarian diets should be avoided. As noted below, cats have issues producing Vitamin A & D as well as taurine, which are difficult to get from a vegetarian diet. Vitamins A and D: Dogs and cats cannot make vitamin D in their skin, so it needs to be in their diet. And the vitamin D needs to be D3, which comes from animal sources, not D2, which comes from plant-based sources. “People and dogs can use D2 to some extent, but cats really need D3”, Heinze says. Taurine. Dogs can make taurine if provided the right building blocks through dietary protein. Cats cannot make their own taurine at all, so it is regarded as an essential amino acid in this species and must be present in adequate amounts in the diet. Both species can suffer taurine deficiencies. If attempting a vegetarian/vegan diet, consulting a vet first is crucial, and then only going with cat food that has been specifically formatted in order to provide the required nutrients. Attempting a 'home grown' vegetarian diet is not healthy for cats and can kill them or cause serious harm. In no conditions should a vegetarian/vegan diet be attempted with a kitten. Source"
Can I make a baby wild rabbit a pet?,"There are several legal issues with making wildlife into a pet, these laws vary by location and any response on that topic would be out of scope for this site. It happens that Saturday; I met a woman whose children found a baby cotton tail rabbit and kept it in captivity for several years (I believe she said 13).  It was particularly interesting to note that the rabbit did not appear to become the friendly creature we expect with domesticated bunnies.  But this is not in itself conclusive, as any animal who is not suitable handled and trained, will not become a ""suitable pet"".   I spend a lot of time doing domestic bunny eduction, and interacting with the public who have used varied methods of interaction with a ""pet bunny"".  In this case I got the impression that the care provided to the wild bunny was neither significantly better or worse than average domestic care. In the end I left the conversation feeling that the experience was not as rewarding for the family or the bunny as one would expect with a domestic bunny. Again depending on local laws your local shelter may or may not be able to intake wildlife.  You may wish to consider searching for local ""wild animal rescue"" organizations, and discussing the situation with them. You should keep the wild bunny separated from your pet bunnies, as most if not all of the illnesses and parasites that infect wild rabbits can cross to your domestic bunny. In the end if you want a bunny to be a good pet, obviously the best results will be with one of the domestic breeds.  Expand Last evening I attended a presentation by Jill Argall who is the Director of the Wildlife Center for the Pittsburgh Animal Rescue League (ARL) they intake both domestic and wild cotton tail rabbits (the public often does not know the difference).  She said that the difference in response to humans was significant between the wild and domestic species of rabbits.  They have good results with releasing young weaned cotton tails rabbits as well adults who are brought injured.  The ARL has both wildlife and domestic animal programs.  Domestic rabbits would transfer to the shelter system, to be placed for adoption.  Wild rabbits would stay in the wildlife system to prepare for release."
How can I tell if my cat is happy?,"Some common indicators that a cat is happy and relaxed include: If you know your cat well, you can generally get an idea of the indicators that ""depend"". For example, Hunter (our only non-Siamese) meows only in distress while the three other cats talk all of the time about everything (my food bowl is empty, my food bowl is full, my food bowl is downstairs and I'm upstairs, hey I can meow!). Distress purring has a different sound than happy purring (it's subtle, but pay close attention next time you take your cat to the vet and you may be able to hear it). In addition, if your cat is meowing but you aren't sure what it means, you can look for other clues to help you figure it out. If your cat is meowing while standing next to the food bowl and you haven't fed them in several hours, it's probably distress (help help I'm going to starve!).  If your cat is purring while snuggling with you on the couch (fur/whiskers/tail relaxed) then your cat is probably happy."
Is it okay to feed my cats canned tuna?,"Probably one of the worst things tuna has, is the high levels of mercury. Even in humans, high levels of mercury acts as a neurotoxin, damaging the brain and nervous system. Since cats have a much smaller body mass than humans, their tolerance for mercury is going to be lower as well. For that reason, it's important to limit how much tuna you feed your cats. There was actually a study done in 1974 titled ""Neurological Changes in Cats following Long-Term Diet of Mercury Contaminated Tuna"" by Louis W. Chang, Seiya Yamaguchi and Alden W. Dudley, Jr. Unfortunately the article is behind a paywall, but it can be accessed here, and the first page and an abstract can be viewed. I will try to summarize my understanding of the study below: Sixteen kittens (both male and female) were fed a daily diet of tuna
  that contained a mercury content of 0.5 parts per million. They were
  given vitamin supplements to cover for the nutrients lost in a tuna
  only diet. The study lasted 11 months and an average of 21.1kg of tuna
  was consumed by each cat, along with an average of 6.3mg of mercury. What they found was that there were no observable changes in their
  growth rate or body weight, but at seven months three of the cats
  showed outward signs of neurological disturbances. Of the three cats
  showing symptoms, two of them showed transient symptoms (meaning the
  symptoms seemed to disappear after 24 hours), and the third displayed
  severe ataxia and incoordination in movements until the end of the
  experiment. After the 11 months, the insides of the cats were observed, and
  histopathological lesions were found in the nervous systems of the
  majority of the cats studied (I couldn't find the exact number). The
  most prominent lesions were found in the cerebellum, at the deep sulci
  of the cerebellar folia. Many of the granular cells (neurons) were
  found to be dense and pyknotic (Irreversible condensation of cells). The amounts of mercury allowed in tuna hasn't changed over the years I don't think. Even today, the amount of mercury found in Tuna, on average, matches the study at 0.5ppm. But it is important to note that the EPA does not take action until it reaches 1.0ppm, which means that you're likely to see ranges both aboth and below 0.5pmm to reach that average. The FDA has a monitoring program as well. There is another dangerous chemical that you can find in canned tuna, and raw fish in general. That chemical is thiaminase. Thiaminase is an enzyme that attacks and inhibits the processing of thiamine, commonly known as vitamin B1. Cat's need high contents of B vitamins in their diet, so feeding a cat too much raw fish would give them a thiamine deficiency. The side-effects of which include seizures and a loss of control over body movements. It's important to watch what the tuna is packed with as well. Tuna comes packed with either water, or oil. The oil is bad for cats as it can cause a vitamin E deficiency, which in turn causes problems with their muscles1. So you'll definitely want to try and stick only to tuna packed in water. Check the ingredients as well. Tuna also comes either salted or unsalted. As too much salt can cause electrolyte imbalances in cats, it would be best to only get the unsalted tuna (You can always add salt to the portions you eat). Some tuna also has onions and garlic added to it. Both are poisonous to cats. Other things that I would suggest you watch for is if your cat has possible allergies to fish, as fish is one of the more popular allergies that cats can have, and if your cat becomes to addicted to the taste of the fish. Just like children, give them a choice between something delicious tasting and something healthy, they'll take the delicious tasting food. With all this being said. It's won't be harmful to give your cat(s) a tiny bit of tuna as a treat on occasion. But it's really important to keep it in moderation. There are some good uses for tuna. Because it smells so strongly, it can be used to capture stray cats for catch and release programs. If a cat is sick and/or refusing to eat, a little bit of tuna mixed in might get them to eat. 1See ""The Cornell Book of Cats: A Comprehensive & Authoritative Medical Reference for Every Cat & Kitten"" and ""Nutrient Requirements of Dogs and Cats (Nutrient Requirements of Domestic Animals)"" for more information on Steatitis."
Why is iceberg lettuce bad for rabbits?,"In short, iceberg lettuce is mostly water with little to no nutrient value. A rabbit can fill up on it (because of the bulk), but still need food because they didn't get enough calories, vitamins, minerals, etc. If you look at the USDA's webpage on iceberg lettuce. You'll notice that water makes up just about 95% of the nutrients, leaving 5% to be divided up between every other nutrient. Protein is a little less than 1%, Carbohydrates less than 3%, and sugars less than 2%. Most importantly, you want to pay attention to the vitamin and calorie content. Iceberg lettuce has only 14 calories per 100 grams (2 calories or less in each leaf), and 18mg of calcium. Other effects to consider, is when fed straight from the fridge, lettuce will be cold and wet, both are conditions that can upset a pet's stomach. In addition, since most rabbit breeders do not feed lettuce to their baby rabbits, it is an unfamiliar food and if the rabbit owner does not add lettuce to the diet gradually, it will cause stomach upset. Finally, it is often believed amoung rabbit breeders that Rabbits should not eat some lettuces (such as iceberg) as they contain a substance called laudanum which can be harmful in large quantities. RSPCA: Rabbit Diet Myths But this is disputed because Lettuce does not contain laudanum. Edible lettuce does contain a chemical called lactucin which is a component of lactucarian. Lactucarian is the milky fluid found in some species of lettuce and occurs in much larger amounts in wild lettuce, Lactuca virosa. Lactucarium has sedative and analgesic effects. It creates a sense of mild euphoria. The milky exudate resembles that of opium and it can also be reduced to a thick substance which can be smoked in the same way as opium. As a result of which it acquired the name ‘lettuce opium’. Edible lettuce, Lactuca sativa, does not even contain lactucarium although it does contain lactucin which is in lactucarium. Lettuce for Rabbits and Guinea Pigs (note that rabbits and guinea pigs have different digestive systems, this link is included for the information on lettuce composition). It is not known if lactucin turns into lactucarium during the digestive process in the rabbit, there are some accounts of rabbits appearing sedated after ingesting large quantities of lettuce. Regardless of the laudanum/lactucin status, there's no reason to feed iceberg because of the low nutrient value. The House Rabbit Society's website has even more details on what foods are good for rabbits and why."
Active wildlife outside the window- Good or Bad for Cat psychology?,"I've heard pet owners express concern before that cats get frustrated at being unable to catch prey, but the thing is, they should be able to deal with the frustration because it's natural to be unable to catch prey a large percentage of the time. In the wild, all predators often fail to catch prey, sometimes more often than they succeed. There are also any number of natural situations in which the cat will be aware of the prey, but the prey will be out of reach. For instance, the prey animal has dived into a hole. Therefore, I do not think your cat getting frustrated should be a concern. Meanwhile, as you said, being able to watch provides great benefit in keeping the cat entertained.  However, make sure to still play with your cat on a regular basis, and use a physical toy that it can grab onto, so that it can also exercise and take out its hunting instinct. Your cat will be less interested in actually attempting to chase the animals it sees outside if it's being tired out in other ways. "
Why is my dog eating poop?,"Like you have noted, coprophagia (the technical term for feces-eating) can, like dirt eating, be a response to a dietary need (often stuff like missing enzymes and the like in their diet).  If the dog eats a dry-food only diet, they will be missing certain things that might make them more prone to seeking out poop as a way of filling that need for digestive enzymes. It can also be a stress response - dogs who are anxious or stressed have a tendency to eat poop more often, as do dogs who have been excessively punished for making messes in the house, for example. Attention seeking can also account for it as well - negative attention is still attention after all! I can also just be an oral fixation, which usually can be solved with giving the dog something better to chew on than poop.  There are a few things you can do to stop the behaviour. If you know the dog is eating its own poop, there are products you can add to its food to make the poop taste undesirable. You can also work with your dog to teach it a ""leave it"" command, but if the dog is outside without you present, this will be less effective, as then you won't be around to stop the dog from eating it. There are also things (such as bitter apple and bitter orange spray) that you can put on the poop itself to make it less interesting to the dog. In general, the best suggestions are to keep the yard poop-free, or to train your dog to leave things alone on command. "
When leaving my dog alone is it better to leave some lights on or all off?,"It depends on the individual animal, of course, but the wolf ancestors of domesticated dogs are nocturnal, and dogs have good low-light vision. Most dogs are not afraid of darkness. For roughly the same evolutionary reasons, most dogs won't be kept awake by light; they've been domesticated to follow a roughly diurnal schedule but their wolf ancestors slept mostly during the day. And indeed many dogs seem to prefer to sleep in patches of sunlight (although it's likely the warmth rather than the light itself they're seeking...)"
Recommendations for introducing kittens to adult cats,"The article ""Integrating Kittens with Cats"" (W.V. Cats) provides intricate details on a procedure for introducing kittens to adult cats.  According to the article, the paraphrased steps (backtrack to the prior step if there is an issue) are: Keeping the new kitten / cat separate from the household for multiple days. Providing scents from each feline involved to each other; transmitted through use of cloths.  This begins the process of a safe introduction. Non-interactive transference of each cat to the other territory to continue scent familiarization. Visually introducing the cats for a few minutes, without physical interaction. Feeding or rewarding the cats near the territory borders. Introducing the cats physically under intense supervision. Introducing the cats for longer visitations Allow unhindered interaction, but separate when unsupervised Allow unhindered, unsupervised interaction"
How can I safely pick up a garden snail?,"As a child I've always picked up snails by their shell. No matter if it were small snails or burgundy snails. Their houses are sturdy enough that you wont crush them when you pick them up, just apply enough pressure to safely grab it. Use as many fingers as you can so 
the pressure is distributed evenly.   A snails foot is well protected by the mucus on it. They also secrete mucus from the foot to aid in locomotion by reducing friction, and to help reduce the risk of mechanical injury from sharp objects, meaning they can crawl over a sharp edge like a straight razor and not be injured. As long as you are careful and don't rip the snail away from the surface, you should be safe lifting the it slowly. As soon as you gently pull it, it should let go of whatever it foot attached to or if it is too light, light a small twig, you will lift that, too. Another way is to touch the snails antennas. This usually makes the snail retract into her shell which makes picking it up even easier. Of course you have to be careful not to hurt the snail."
Do invisible fences pose long term health risks to dogs?,"The primary safety issue with invisible / electronic / underground fences is that they do not protect your pet from people and animals coming to your dog and possibly harming it. A standard fence, for example, keeps unfriendly dogs out as much as it keeps your dog in.  As for the collars, I bought a Tri-Tronics vibration only collar for one of my deaf dogs (and then trained the vibration to be a positive experience.) The manual was the same as the one for shock collars and it recommended that for the dog's health and safety that you make sure the dog has an extra pad of fur underneath where the electric part hits. I read that as the manufacturer saying they aren't necessarily safe as is.   There are also a number of risks to using punishment based training at all, these are well covered in the  ""American Society of Veterinary Behavior Punishment Position Statement"" Keep in mind that if you get such a fence, you also need to train your dog to the boundary, so that the collar only goes off when they break the 'rules' they have already learned. It is possible to teach this behavior without purchasing the fence in the first place. Additionally, the fence itself can negatively reinforce behaviors other than leaving the yard - Trainer Experiences with Invisible Fencese"
One month old puppy pacing in circles and crying,"I took her to a good vet today. She checked her, found that she was blind, but she was responding to sounds well. She was pacing in circles when she got stressed. Today with this new knowledge, I brought her home, started training her with sounds. She started responding well, she would circle a bit and then once she recognizes where the sound came from, she would walk in that direction. She even started drinking and eating on her own after she got comfortable with me. I have to hold the food and water up to her mouth, and she would eat/drink it, technically not by herself, but it's a big improvement compared to feeding her with syringe. Thanks for your help guys. UPDATE- 15-Mar-2021 She is now eating well. No need to hold the container near her mouth anymore. She identifies objects and people, and has become better tuned to focus on sounds and smells. She has become familiar with her surroundings now, and knows where things are at. She is eating more compared to the other two pups now, also she has started play fighting with the other pups. Before she was always confused and unable to fight back. I feel she is on a path to a healthy normal dog life."
How can I prevent my cat from extending his claws when being petted?,"This behavior is known as ""kneading"", and is an instinctive behavior that stems from feeding on its mother's milk.  Kittens knead at their mother to stimulate milk production while feeding, and the behavior tends to reoccur whenever they are feeling extremely relaxed and contented. Not all cats maintain this behavior into adulthood, but many do. Since it is both instinctual, and reinforced during early kittenhood, it is unlikely you will ever train your cat to stop.  However, a solution that may work is to get your cat his own blanket.   One of our cats kneads pretty regularly, even when no one is petting her.  She does so most often on a soft red throw blanket, that we keep on the back of the sofa (one of her preferred resting/kneading spots) for that very purpose.  This avoids damage to the furniture, and when company comes over, we can just put the blanket away."
How can stop my adult cat from urinating in inappropriate places?,"The first step for a responsible pet owner when their pet exhibits a significant change (such as described here) is to take the animal to the vet to make sure that there are no health problems.  Health problems can cause litter box issues in several ways.  Once health problems have been ruled out, start looking for behavioral solutions. For one of our cats this phase took 2 years, so be patient and consider everything. First, look at changes in the environment. Have you changed litter? Are the dogs new to the household? Have you moved? Etc. If you aren't able to identify any changes (there's been a change, but sometimes it's hard to find), then start laying out litter boxes.  One suggestion is to put a box everywhere he's gone. Another suggestion is to just put out a bunch and make sure that you clean the places he's been really well (use a blacklight to ensure it's gone).  Try different types of boxes (covered, uncovered, different sizes, different heights(sometimes an older cat will have a hard time getting into a tall box), different shapes, etc). Try different types of litter. Try different locations (some cats want a quiet place away from traffic, others want to be in the middle of everything).   Keep using the blacklight to track where he's going and make sure you clean where he's been really well. If you don't get rid of the smell, the cat will continue to associate that spot as a place to urinate. There are some cleaners you can use, like Nature's Miracle, or some common household products, such as vinegar. Don't use bleach to clean cat urine, as that can actually act as an attractant. Some notes from my own experience: We went through a phase with one of our cats where I changed litter suddenly and then he wouldn't go back to the box even after switching back to the original litter. I locked him in the bathroom with the litter box for about 2 days (with food and water placed on the other side of the room from the litter box), and then he was fine again. We have another cat who has anxiety/territorial issues. We tried her on prozac, but that didn't help the litter box situation. Eventually, we set up her own litter box in the master bathroom, moved her food and water bowls to the bedroom, and made that her territory. When we are asleep or not home, she's in there with the door closed. She only interacts with the other cats when we are able to supervise. That's mostly fixed the problem (occassionally when we're home another cat uses her litter box, so we also switched to cat genies, a type of automated box, so she has a fresh box that's hers and we don't have to clean that box immediately if another cat uses it). Good luck!"
Do dogs commit suicide?,"This is an interesting question.  Personally based on the information I've seen, I don't believe a dog has the cognitive ability to decide that death is better than their life.  They probably can't even comprehend what ""death"" is.  The idea of committing suicide is a very advanced thing to think about. I'm sure we've all heard the classic idea of ""self-awareness"", where it was proposed that humans are the only animals that are self-aware.  According to this wiki article, this idea extends to a few other animals, namely apes, elephants and dolphins.  Self-awareness  But self-awareness would probably be necessary to knowingly cause your own death. Also, a smaller part of this I think would be the idea of time.  When you commit suicide, you're deciding that your future won't get better over time.  The Jury is out on whether or not one could consider a dog to have a sense of time, but there are some interesting reads DOG BEHAVIOR
Do dogs understand the concept of time? Overall I think that it's possible for a dog not to have the ""will to live"" but I think that choosing their own death is a bit too advanced for his mind"
"What forms of ""body language"" can be identified in snake behaviour?","There are roughly three kinds of moods you need to be able to tell apart in snakes: Hungry / looking for food Scared / pissed off Relaxed / exploring around How exactly these moods look differs immensely between species and even specimens. Even snakes can have wildly varying personalities. For example, the ""essing up"" which my boa constrictor will sometimes do is a defensive/offensive stance, and suggests that it might strike, Not necessarily. Sure, having this 'S'-shape in their body will mean that if they strike, they can suddenly cover a bigger distance, but that doesn't mean that always if they coil up like this they want to strike, and neither do they always coil up before striking. So all in all, it is a bad indicator.  My Boa will just idly hang down her branch. This kinda looks like an ambush position, but that does not reflect her attitude when the cage is opened, so I'm going to chalk it up as idle. My Ball python will also do this as a part of their defensive posture, even when they have no intention of striking. Having their head closer to their body also means that it is easier for them to protect their head. All in all, I'd say it isn't the best indicator for their mood. Snakes have very bad eye-sight. So they rely very much on scent as sense. For this they use their iconic tongue-flicking. Each time they do that, they smell their surroundings using an organ in the top of their mouth. The way they use this is very indicative for their mood. If they are relaxed and moving around, they'll just flick lazily every now and then to take in their surroundings, to check if there is anything interesting somewhere. When they have to be more aware of their surroundings, for example if they feel that they are in danger, or that there is food somewhere nearby, they will be flicking a lot more. Mostly I would describe it as much more agitated. Many short flicks. At this point, it is still hard to distinguish food-mode from angry-mode, but that will come with: This is about the situation when you are near the snake, with the cage open for example. How does the snake react to your movements. If they are relaxed, they might very well just ignore you. They'll go about their happy business, whether that is sleeping (likely) or exploring (depends a bit on species).  As you can see above, she is just moving around, minding her own business, tongue-flicking every now and then and ignoring my movement with the camera :) However, if they are agitated, they will be much more inclined to follow any movement around them. This might be very subtle, like tracking the movement just with an eye, or they might just follow it with their head. This is a point where it is easier to tell defensiveness apart from a food-response. Snakes that feel threatened are not likely to give chase. Of course it depends on the species and disposition of the snake, but if they feel threatened, most of all they just want to be left alone. Getting away is always a win. However, if the threat doesn't go away, they might bite. Some species decide to bite very quickly, some species are known for being general assholes, but most commonly kept snakes are pretty laid back. For example, my Ball python is 10 years old now, and in the 8 years I have had him, he has struck only twice out of self-defense. In contrast, if the movement has sparked their interest because they think it is food, their reaction (on top of tongue-flicking) will be more forward. They will be much more inclined to follow the movement in a forward direction, inching towards it. This can be seen in the gif below. This is my Boa's reaction to food in its enclosure. You can see their immediate attention. You can see her tongue-flicking and essing up. But the two most important things to take away here are that she moves her head towards any movement and actively follows it, along with creaping forward. This shows a great deal of interest, and her going forward towards the movement is a great tell that this is not a defensive posture.  When you are handling your snake and they are not comfortable, this might also show itself in the snake suddenly trying to move away quickly, as if they are trying to flee. This should really speak for itself. A lot of this is down to experience and really relies on getting to know your snake. Some snakes are really keen on food and will turn into food-mode on a whim. It is important to know how to recognise this and when you only just have the snake, it is never a bad idea to err on the safe side. If you do it right, you should never really be the target of their food-mood. First you get to know what triggers it, then you make sure you prevent that from happening whenever it is not time for food. For many snakes, one such trigger will be the scent of their food. This is generally easy to handle by making sure food items are only nearby when it's actually feeding time and by washing your hands afterwards. Similarly, after a while you'll learn to notice when your snake is not comfortable and be able know when to leave them alone."
Is it ok to adopt a kitten if you have a murderous cat?,"First, step back and read up on best ages for kittens to leave their mother. (The best age to adopt a kitten is around 10 weeks.)  At 3 weeks of age a kitten is completely helpless and will need help with every thing from keeping warm to drinking (it cannot eat yet) and relieving itself. Till 6 weeks you are just fostering a kitten, let the mother take care of the kitten, please. Weeks 6 to 12 are needed for socializing from the mother. Your cat seems to have no problem with a (very) small dog. So I think you can introduce an other cat into the house. Then becomes the question: how to introduce a new cat into your home? That can be done, but it will take time. Experiences vary, mine was about 2 months before my 2 cats could safely be in one room... Good reads on this topic:"
How deep should I bury my pet (should I rebury)?,"Depending on where you live, burying your pet in your yard may be illegal.  You should check your local laws, before undertaking a reburial. If the area is in a neighborhood, the possibility that a neighbor's dog may find and remove your pet is very high, given the depth the you describe. Also, as you mention, the risk of wildlife exposing the body is significant.  A shallow grave is more likely to allow smells and other evidence of the decaying body to be noticeable in the area.  According to some sources, the appropriate depth for a green burial is 3 - 4 feet (Meter +).  There are also health concerns for any other bunnies now in your home or in the future (and possibly you or your loved one).  As an example Encephalitozoon cuniculi occasionally called 'EC' is a debilitating organism 'which can survive for a long time in the environment'. It can infect both humans and particularly devastating to rabbits.  A shallow grave may allow this or other organism to be transmitted, this is of particular concern if a contagious diseases was the cause of your pets death.  Your local vet should be able to address available options in your area."
What is required to house break a rabbit?,"Rabbits are very clean and easy to train for litter tray use. In nature, rabbits spend a lot of time in hutches and warrens, so learning to use a corner rather than where ever they are keeps their living area clean. This means your job as a rabbit owner is much easier as evolution has done most of the hard work. Most... When first house training your rabbit, confine them to a small section of the house, preferable one that is easy to clean such as an area with non-absorbant flooring, like tiles or linoleum - as with all animals, rabbits will make mistakes at first. In this confined area, in the corners you want to play several small litter trays over newspaper to catch any spills. As suggested, if you can, place something that has been soiled into the trays to reinforce the smell - however be careful with which wood you use, why is discussed below in the section on litter. Over time you will notice that your bunny will prefer one spot over another. As they start this preference, slowly remove the other trays one at a time. If they do have accidents in other spots, return the trays and start again. But its very likely your bunny will pick up on whats happening. Once they have a spot chosen, you can get a larger (more elborate) tray, and eventually they will imprint on the litter tray, rather than the area. This allows you to move the litter tray to a more convenient location, or if you need to leave your bunny with someone else the litter tray can go with to reduce mess. Rabbits are not cats and some litters designed for cats are not appropriate for rabbits. Above all else, softwood litters such as those based on pine or cedar must be avoided!. Safer choices include paper or hardwoods. Take time to find the right amount of litter for your rabbit, as they all have different preferences. Rabbits have larger and stronger legs than a cat, and a stronger urge to dig. This means that litter, especially used litter, can go flying. The best thing to minimise mess is to get a larger, deeper litter tray. Rabbits will often try to position themselves in a corner when relieving themselves, so positioning the opening in a way away from their chosen corner of the box will help reduce spillage. The below image shows an ideal rabbit litter tray:  Do not enclose the litter tray unlike in in nature, your bunnies litter tray is not a porous earthen enclosure with plants that enthusiastically absorb nitrogen. It is non-porous tray that needs to be emptied frequently and if left enclosed will allow nitrogen to build up. Rabbit pee can smell, so more often cleaning, or more absorbent litter is the answer. Enclosing the trya will just enclose the smell, and your rabbits nose is much more sensitive than yours, if the smell builds up too much they will just not go there, and will choose another place to go - like your bed. Rabbits occasionally suffer from excitement induced fecal incontinence, or cutely known as ""happy trails"". When excited, whether during positive experiences such you coming home, during feeding time, or new vistors, or negative experiences, such as for some rabbits, nail clippings, your bunny may release dropping pellets. This is outside of their control, and they will usally be very hard and dry, and easy to clean up. This is one of the joys of owning a rabbit. Rabbits are more comfortable in an area when they can eat. So add some hay to their litter box. This also helps to passively position the rabbit into a corner, as rabbits are quite clean and won't relieve themselves on their food. So by positioning the hay in one corner of the box, you encourage the rabbit to go in the opposite one. One a final (slightly off topic) note, as mentioned rabbit waste from a well fed bunny is very high in nitrogen. If you use a recycled paper based litter, the used litter is excellent fertilizer and can be used in the garden, for example to grow nice leafy green vegetables, to feed to your rabbit... thus completing the circle of life."
Are there health risks to leaving a dead fish in the aquarium?,"Assuming you're absolutely certain that the fish did not die from a disease or parasite (I'm not certain how you would ensure that, short of having absolutely nothing new introduced into the environment for an extended period of time prior to the death)... I would say it depends upon what died, and the other denizens of your aquarium. If you have a decent Clean Up Crew that will rather quickly consume the body, you're probably not going to run any serious risks of the body releasing enough toxins to jeopardize the other fish. If you lack sufficiently voracious cleaners, or your dead fish is on the largish side, you should pull it out of your tank sooner rather than later, though. Generally, at least among saltwater tank owners, leaving a dead fish for the CUC doesn't seem that uncommon."
What is the optimal age to neuter a male dog?,"For male dogs, it doesn't seem to matter. Some behaviours will respond to castration, others won't, no matter the age of the dog: Castration was most effective in altering objectionable urine making, mounting, and roaming. With various types of aggressive behavior, including aggression toward human family members, castration may be effective in decreasing aggression in some dogs, but fewer than a third can be expected to have marked improvement. Age of the dog or duration of the problem behavior does not have value in predicting whether castration will have a beneficial effect. (Neilson et al., 1997) For female dogs, however, it seems that spaying them to early is associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infections: Because earlyage gonadectomy appears to offer more benefits than risks for male dogs, animal shelters can safely gonadectomize male dogs at a young age and veterinary practitioners should consider recommending routine gonadectomy for client-owned male dogs before the traditional age of 6 to 8 months. For female dogs, however, increased urinary incontinence suggests that delaying gonadectomy until at least 3 months of age may be beneficial. (Spain et al., 2004) References"
Why does my cat wash her paws in her water?,"Have you seen your cat doing this? Cats don't usually use water to wash themselves - they'll use their own tongues, even when it's something really gross like litter. (I have seen cats washing actual feces off themselves with their teeth/tongues.)  If you haven't actually witnessed this ""washing"" behavior, it's more likely that your cat is dipping her paw in the water bowl to drink from it, which is a common cat behavior (even in cats that hate getting wet).  The litter getting into the water from the cat's paws is a byproduct of this behavior. Try a different brand of litter that might be less ""sticky"", or make sure that you are scooping the litter box frequently so it's nice and dry in there. I would be willing to bet that this problem will solve itself over time. Kittens are not notorious for their cleanliness, especially in the litter box. As the cat grows up she'll get better about keeping herself clean, and even if she still dips her paw in the water to drink, she'll make less of a mess."
How do I stop my dog from barking at people through the fence?,"This is a very tricky problem for the simple fact that your dog gets rewarded every time it barks at a passerby. In the dog's head, it's all very simple.  Person approaches, dog barks, person leaves. Yay to the power of barking!  Depending on the size of your garden, if none of TildalWave's suggestions are an option, you might have to temporarily keep your dog in the house while you're not at home and in a room that doesn't allow him to bark at passersby through the window. The long-term approach is to use desensitisation and counter-conditioning, that is, slowly get your dog used to strangers coming near the fence and start to associate strangers with good things happening(TM).  You'll have to recruit some strangers (to your dog) and ask them to approach the fence to a distance that your dog is comfortable with. Reward your dog for noticing the stranger but not barking at it. Slowly move the dog and/or stranger closer together and keep rewarding good behaviour. Try to set your dog up for success as much as possible. The less often you get your dog's threshold wrong, the quicker it'll learn.  Also, it is very important for the stranger not to move away if your dog does start barking, as this will only reinforce the unwanted behaviour. Just ask the person to stay still and move your dog further away from the fence. Most of all, exercise plenty of patience as it might take a while. "
Why does my cat like licking my armpits?,"Humans secrete a fair amount of salt when sweating and many animals, especially cats, are attracted to the taste of that for some reason. Another reason is, actually, scent. Your cat may be trying to apply their scent to you in, well, a fairly obvious spot for them to override.  A third reason is grooming. Cats will groom their human companions. This is a sign that they're quite relaxed and comfortable around you. As for health, well I can't say, except that I doubt it's dangerous if the antiperspirant is truly gone. You could look at citrus-based deodorants as a deterrent since your cat won't like the taste. Might sting a bit though...  "
How often is too often to bathe a dog?,"General Rule: Whatever the breed is, it is advisable not to bathe your dog more than once a month unless otherwise instructed by a vet using proper shampoo and soap.  If you bathe a dog too often, its coat will lose shine and the dog can become itchy. Also, dog has a natural coat protecting system which can get harmed by over-bathing. So, once a month is preferable. However, we bathe our German Shepherd twice a month and I haven't experienced anything problematic about it.  As far as the smell goes, it is very natural for a dog to have some smell. It should not bother you."
My friend is allergic to only some of my cats; why is that (and how do I mitigate for future cats)?,"Oddly enough, it could be the color of their fur. A study has shown that darker color cats are more likely to induce an allergic reaction: While the reason is unclear, researchers at Long Island College Hospital in New York speculate that darker cats may produce more of an allergen called fel d 1 in their skin and saliva than do lighter colored felines. A study of 321 patients found that those who owned dark-colored cats were up to four times more likely than those with light-colored cats or no feline friends to suffer moderate or severe allergy symptoms, according to a report to be published in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Then again, as is often the case with science, another study has reportedly found the exact opposite result.  There is a study titled Fel d 1 levels in domestic living rooms are not related to cat color or hair length, but I cannot find details of the actual study (possibly due to the current government shutdown).  It is possible that the previous study may have simply been too small, and insufficiently randomized, as the cohort was only 321 patients. According to yet another study, it is also possible that male cats may produce more fel d 1 than female cats, and intact males may produce more than neutered males. In any case, fel d 1 levels do seem to be the most likely culprit.  Since the hormone is secreted in saliva and from the sebaceous glands, it is most abundantly produced during grooming. To mitigate your friend's exposure, you can try to keep him away from areas where the cats are most likely to groom themselves."
How long can a healthy cat go without food?,"When I've had to change my cats' food and they resist, I mix the old and new foods, slowly adding more of the new food, until after a few weeks, all I'm serving is the new food. In the beginning, the cat will pick-and-choose the OldFoodBits and leave the NuFoodBits behind; but gradually he'll start eating more and more of the NuFood. And the transition will be less traumatic, less chance of damaging his health. And you can also see if the new food is really really something he Absolutlely Won't Eat, or just something he needs to slowly get used to. I know this doesn't answer the question in the heading - how long can a healthy cat go without food - but this might help you with the transition. (Kind of like how Ebay changed their page background from its original yellow, to white. First people shrieked, so Ebay turned it back. Then they made it a shade lighter every other day until it was white...and almost no one noticed.)"
How can I know if my cat is in pain?,"As Monica and Me123 have said, the big two signs of cat distress are: Other signs I've seen with various cats include:"
How can I permanently reduce the pH level of my aquarium?,"You should consider adding some natural pH reducing element. Adding drift woods, indian almond or oak leaves will slowly leach tannins, which in turn will reduce the pH. If you have a planted tank, you can start injecting CO2 which will also lower the pH. Another option is to filter the water through peat moss or commercially available peat granules."
How can cat owners protect cats from secondary poisoning from rodenticides?,"This isn't the answer that you're looking for, but the best way to prevent secondary poisioning from rodenticides is to keep your cats indoors.  Keeping your cats indoors protects against MANY problems that can make your cat sick or die! Cats who are either part-time or full-time allowed to roam outdoors alone face the following risks: Source: Indoor Cats vs Outdoor Cats If you're determined that your cat should be allowed outside, the best solution is to build a protected enclosure (often referred to as a ""catio""). There are a ton of resources online for how these can be built/bought, performing a google search for ""outdoor enclosure cat"" and ""catio"" turns up a lot of resources. "
How can I safely reintegrate 3 male dogs that have a history of fighting?,"Without knowing exactly what preceded each episode of neck shaking, this requires a little more caution in how this needs to be approached. If you had defining incidents that precipitated the behavior, these behaviors could be monitored, but in this case, all  behavior needs to be monitored. As you have successfully reintegrated them in the past, I won't focus too much on that, as opposed to preventing the neck shaking from reoccurring. Reintegration: To begin with the dogs should be safe to reintegrate on leash, by being in the same room for periods of time while under the supervision of their owners. This allows them to get used to being in each other's company without any more aggravating behaviors.  Gradually allowing them supervised time off leash, in each others company. Offering plenty of praise and distraction. The idea being, they will learn to be in each other's company without being focused on each other and even forgetting about each other. Prevention: The best way to prevent the neck shaking or other aggressive behavior is to nip all rough play in the bud. The dogs need to be allowed to meet and greet, the investigative sniffing, and can be rewarded for good behavior by being allowed off leash together. However any sign of rough play, mouthing, jumping on each other, the pug jumping up at the boxer, the boxer pawing the pug, any growling, must be met with firm vocal chatisation from the most suitable person present; there and then. A firm, deep and bellowing No! with the accusatory finger pointing at the offenders with continuous eye contact until the offenders (I put them in this basket together) both posture submissive stances with the owner.  Generally the adult mot likely to achieve an effective result in discipling dogs in this way, will be the one who will naturally react quickly to handle the situation, so it is not even something that needs to be clearly defined, who does the disciplining, but that there is some sort of consensus and consistency in how the dogs are disciplined. Possible causes: Dogs will naturally wrestle for dominance within a household, usually the hierarchy of dominance is established early on and this tends to remain the status quo (unless more dogs are introduced), however it does not prevent the lessor ranking dogs from wanting to push the boundaries from time to time, and in some cases the established hierarchy can be a little shaky and enforced without a convincing submission from the under dog. As a general rule for desexed males the older dog will be the most respected, a female will tend to boss over the males. I have noticed that the desexed males will tend to have more flux and tousles over dominance. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, usually this is not an issue, unless one dog decides he no longer wants to defer to the older dog. This is what I think may be happening here. Solutions for dominance:  As the boxer is the offending dog in this case and the younger and so, most likely, more trainable dog Your parents could try practicing a few techniques to reduce the dominant features their boxer is displaying. Although it is a good thing for a dog to be protective of it's humans, a dog can become a little overprotective, which can result in some over zealous or aberrant aggressive behavior. These are some simple techniques that can be used explained in thiese posts How can I stop my dog jumping at the table and mouthing my fingers? and here Why does my dog act differently outside the house?. It is worth mentioning that this is not outrageous behavior by dogs, by any means. Dogs can be prone to friction and they can't argue it out. Given your only want to bring the dogs together for 3-4 hours and that in the past, they had been together for a prolonged period before this neck shaking occurred, I'd be quote hopeful that you could integrate the three dogs for family gatherings, but I would not leave them unsupervised."
Cat behaving strangely for no apparent reason,"Every thing you say in your question makes me think your cat is in pain, urinating and defecating on the floor but sometimes using the litterbox (pain using the litterbox). Moving low to the ground, pain when walking (urinary tract infection pain). Does not want to leave the room, does not want to move as this causes pain. Does not want to go outside, not feeling well. All of this makes me think that this is not a reaction to fear of other cats or anything in the house. You need to take your cat to the vet as this is not normal for a six year old cat."
How do you clean poop out of a long hair cat's fur?,"To be honest, if you get most of the chunks out and blot the dampness up as much as you can, I'd let her clean the rest of it herself. Grooming is a self soothing activity, and since she doesn't know you, you cleaning her will stress her out. The exception would be if you know (or suspect) that she has a poop borne illness, and want to prevent the other cat from potential contamination. Make sure the room you confine her in is warm, and change her bedding every few hours until she gets it cleaned up. It's usually recommended to confine new cats to a small room (like a bathroom) for the first couple of days anyway, so in this case I would doubly recommend bathroom confinement."
How can we prevent our cats from scratching on our chair?,"You say that you have scratching posts around your house, but they may not be the right type. Cats have definite preferences for scratching surfaces, and something about that chair makes it ""better"" than the posts. For example, we had a cat who LOVED to scratch on our ottoman. We had plenty of posts, but eventually figured out that we didn't have one tall enough for him - he wanted to get a good long body stretch, so the post had to be about 3 feet tall. Once we added a post of that height, he rarely touched the ottoman again (instead of a daily thing it became something he did once a month or two). So, some things to consider: In addition, make sure to keep their claws trimmed. Even if they aren't scratching on your furniture on purpose, running and playing across the furniture can cause damage. An alternative to trimming (which may help while you're figuring out what kind of scratcher he wants) would be to use nail caps. He'll still make scratching motions on the furniture (so you can monitor your progress with finding the right scratcher) but it won't cause damage. You CAN have nice furniture even with cats! We have 4 cats and leather furniture. We occasionally get accidental scratches from running and playing, but nothing on purpose.  As a last note, declawing is NEVER recommended. Cats generally become more aggressive (especially biting) when you remove their claws because it's painful and you're taking away their defense mechanisms. In addition, as a declawed cat ages it will tend to develop arthritis on the paws which will make using a litter box painful, and cause an aversion to the litterbox. For more on the hazards of declawing, I recommend the Paw Project"
What can I do now that my cat is terrified of me after I broke up a fight involving her and two other pets?,"This is a very common question on this SE and it makes perfect sense. The cat for some reason is traumatised by your action. You might have stepped on his tail, or she might just be upset because you defended the dog. It doesn't necessarily mean you did something bad, it is just impossible to relay the reasons behind our actions to the cats. The good thing you need to know is that animals don't hold grudges. Even the most abused animals might start trusting their owner back, so I am very confident that your relation with your cat will be as good as it was before. Keep in mind that just like you are still shaken up, so is the cat. It might just be a few hours before she cools down, so there is a good chance you won't need to do anything. The most important thing is not to rush the process. Just like patching up your relation with a human, you need to give the animal some space. Starting with the treats was the best approach. Don't overindulge your cat with treats though because they will be detrimental to her health. You might want to refrain yourself from touching the cat. Ask for your cat's consent before you touch her by extending your finger to her nose. If she smells your finger, it means she allows you to touch her. Never pick her up until you fully regain her trust. Cats do not generally like being picked up. Do the lazy cat blinks. The meaning of lazy blinks is disputed whether it is a smile, kiss or just a statement of non-aggression, but whatever it is, it instils trust in the cat. Try to offer some toys from time to time. Keep your distance if your cat still distrusts you. I hope this helps."
"Why are cats released as part of ""spay and release"" programs?","Feral cats tend to stick to specific areas, and may form loose colonies with other local feral cats.  These colonies can range in size from a handful to dozens of adult cats, and, in the absence of concerted spay and release efforts, the size of the colonies tend to continue growing. Larger populations of feral cats in neighborhoods can become a real nuisance, with issues including noise (particularly when one or more females go into heat), food raids (garbage cans being tipped over, unguarded food snatched, etc.), and waste (gardens make good substitute litter boxes). When local cats are viewed as pests and nuisances, the likelihood of abuse from the human residents increase.  These cats are at risk of deliberate poisoning, getting shot, trapped in inhumane ways, or even torture. The idea behind spay and release is that you are allowing the animals to live out their lives in a way that gives them at least some chance of happiness, while putting a stop to the cycle of breeding to avoid more cats being born into the rather harsh conditions most feral cats put up with.  The gradual reduction in numbers reduces the pressure from the local environment on these animals, largely by making them less of a nuisance. People actively involved in spay and release programs frequently feed the feral cats in their neighborhood.  Their houses or businesses therefore tend to be areas where the local feral cat population will converge.  This makes it easier to keep track of which cats they've already captured and had ""fixed"", so if one is accidentally recaptured, they simply release it immediately instead of bringing it to the vet (unless they decide to bring the cat in for other medical reasons). If a cat that has already been fixed is captured/recaptured, a veterinarian will be able to ascertain this prior to committing to surgery. As thkala mentioned, there are issues with finding homes for feral cats.  Simply put, they tend to make horrible pets. My mother was active in spay and release with the local cats in her previous neighborhood, and the people who owned the house prior to her made a habit of feeding the neighborhood cats.  Over time, all but one of the local cats disappeared (presumably dead).  When she finally moved to a new house, she caught the remaining feral cat, and brought it with her (fearing that it had become overly dependent upon her providing food, which was not something she could guarantee the next owners of the house would continue). She still has this cat.  It lives in her basement, and hides in a storage area.  It does come out to interact with the domesticated cat they also have, but my mother almost never sees her (and when she does, it is just a quick glimpse as the cat runs and hides). Very few people want an animal like that living in their house, and therefore finding a home for individual animals, let alone an entire colony, is almost impossible. Many areas have charitable organizations dedicated to supporting the costs and logistics of spay and release programs.  These programs may offer live animal traps, assistance in finding local veterinary offices that will assist with spaying, or even vouchers to get the procedures done at a reduced cost.  Individual veterinary offices may also support the practice with discounted rates or other services. It is worth a quick search in your area to see if there are any spay and release organizations nearby.  "
How do I walk a small dog afraid of loud noises in an urban area?,"Because the dog is so young, I think it is very likely you can slowly accustom her to urban walking.  I think a natural response when you see a small dog cowering or wimpering in fear is to console them, or pet them.  This is not an effective way to dissuade fear.  It is better to ignore your dog and not feed into its fearful emotions. [see below] I think the best bet is to teach your dog that walking in urban areas is fun.  Bring treats and toys, walk in a zany unpredictable way, go for short burts of sprints, etc.  Your dog will eventually begin to associate urban walks with fun times and an owner in good spirits."
How to get my cat to stop being annoying at night?,"He's bored.  The first goal should be to make some place (not your bedroom) a much more entertaining place to be than your bedroom is. Set up some toys in your living room or some other place like a puzzle feeder, automatic wand toys, or other toys that he likes. In the morning these toys should be put away to keep his interest level in them up. Then, make your bedroom as uninteresting as possible. Put the pill bottles and jewelry away, don't respond when he steps on you, etc.  Last, take advantage of the cat's hunt, feed, groom, sleep cycle. Use an interactive toy for awhile right before bed, then give him some food. He should settle down pretty quickly after that (it works amazingly well on our youngest). Pam Johnson Bennett outlines this plan in more detail on her site."
Is it okay for an elderly cat to be sleeping in the litterbox?,"First, with any behavior change, you should take your cat to the vet to make sure there's no underlying health problem. After the vet has determined that the change is behavioral and not related to a physical problem, you can start to look at your cat's environment from his perspective to try to track down the change. Understand that cats are comforted by things that smell like them (they have a much stronger sense of smell than we do and it's much more important to their understanding of the world). The litter box is definitely a strong personal scent (even a ""clean"" litter box will retain some of the scent to a cat). So look around for things that may be causing stress for your cat. Some possibilities include: Once you have some ideas (or even if you don't!) there are some ideas that you can use to reduce your cats' stress level. If you can pinpoint a few things that could be causing stress, try ideas from the following list that are related. For example, if there's a new dog in the house, then installing elevated pathways (bullet 2) will help him avoid the dog and feel more secure in the house. To end this novel, I'll add that the first winter we had Cat Genies we found Kendall sleeping in one. They wash and blow dry the PVC litter-pellets, so we eventually figured out that he was cold and put a heating pad in a hidy-box. Now we know the weather is starting to turn cold because 3 of our 4 cats fight over who gets to be in the hidy-box (only 2 fit at a time). So, sleeping in the litter box is not always an insecurity thing. In our case, what changed was the litter box and the weather."
My cat mixes up the floors in my building. How can I help him?,"This is hard to answer. I think you will have to do some experiments. If your cat has a toy or object he likes, you might try to put this outside your door so he can smell his own scent to make him recognize he is at home. Cats in general do know their area by sight and by scent, There are many examples of cats living in an multi-apartment building and not having any  problems in finding the right door to where they live. I think one of the things you need to do is to visit the vet to see if your cat has any problems smelling or if it might have eye problems. This is to be sure it is not a physical problem. If nothing physical is wrong with your cat, you can try to mark your apartment by putting up a visual marker and/or a scent marker for your cat outside your door to help him locate his home. You can simply move the welcome mat from inside to outside your door or hang one of your cat's toys on the door so he can reach and smell it."
Is it harmful for my cat to eat bugs?,"In my experience, cats are pretty good determining whether something they've caught should be eaten - one of the cats I grew up with was an avid hunter but while he played with a rat that had eaten poison, he didn't try to eat it. The other cats I've lived with haven't been as eager to hunt but none of them ever tried to eat anything poisonous although they'd eat bugs quite cheerfully (including crunching down on grasshoppers). If you're not poisoning the bugs that get in, there shouldn't be a problem - but keep an eye out for venomous spiders that are common where you live. Your cat probably won't try to eat those, but hunting them could get the cat bitten, with ugly consequences.  Update for those who object to my offering the anecdotal evidence of having spent most of my 47 years living with at least one cat and those who think my lack of concern about cats eating insects is problematic:"
Why is my dog drinking his pee after he urinates inside?,"Why is my dog drinking his pee when he urinates inside? Dog's drinking urine can be a sign of a few different things: This answer is linked with this post How should I correct my dog when I catch him drinking his urine?.  The inside of your home is the den and pack animals naturally like to keep their dens clean. They will want to relieve themselves as far away as possible from where they eat and sleep. From wolfcountry.net During nursing the mother will clean the pups and stimulates them to urinate and defecate by licking the genital region. She swallows all of their excretions, keeping 
  the birthing area clean and odor-free.   In wolf packs the entire pack protects the mother and the den and help to raise the puppies. Given he doesn't do this when he is outside, I wouldn't regard it as a problem, per se, he is doing what comes naturally and cleaning up. Why a Dog Laps Its Own Urine One reason is that urine doesn't absorb into linoleum, tile or
  finished wood like it does into dirt, grass and concrete. It remains
  pooled on the floor, tempting the dog's curiosity. Another reason is
  that, while a dog may not be housebroken, it may still know that
  urinating inside is forbidden. It will lap up its urine to hide the
  evidence. Conclusion: You've stated your dog came from a reputable breeder, implying he was well cared for as a pup; so it's unlikely this is caused from the syndrome of dogs in confined spaces learning to eat and drink their own waste. Given the information that it only happens when you forget to take him out at night or when  go to bed early (so he has to hold on longer overnight) I would say it's just your dog trying to fix up fix mishap and no great problem. My suggestion is that the cause of the problem sounds like:"
Cooling a goldfish tank during summer,"Well, you didn't say so, but I assume you have a thermometer inside your tank, don't you? Or did you measure the temperature using a portable, temporary one? Since your tank is inside your house, it's not directly at sunlight, perhaps some breeze was on it, etc. For the solutions, since it only happens few times a year, I'd go with ice cubes of pre-treated water, or as Baarn suggested, water that you have taken from your aquarium (although it might get... smelly... when you freeze and unfreeze it, since you´ll be killing some bacteria). Since they won't have chemicals that are harmful for your fish, it can be used without problems. Since some energy input is required to transform ice to water, the ice will ""steal"" this energy from the water, cooling all the tank. And due to convection, the cold water around the ice cube will flow to the bottom of the tank, and the warmer water will flow to the top, get in contact with the ice cube, and doing a cycle. You'd just need to make things slow (so you won't be changing the water temperature too fast, causing some cold shock on your fish). The thermometer will be your friend here."
How can I deionize water to prevent brown eye stains on my dog?,"The iron in your water is present in two forms.  The majority of it is iron (III) oxide, also known most commonly as rust.  The second is ionized iron, which is Fe2+. Iron oxide is insoluble in water, and if enough of it is present (usually happens in well water) then the water will start to have a brown/orange tinge.  It is not filtered by Brita filters.  They use activated carbon filters which will not filter out iron. Reference for this. See section called 'What Activated Carbon doesn't do' Fe2+ is usually not present in in high quantities in water, as it is a rare form of iron, and in drinking water it is not stable and precipitates into iron (III) hydroxide, which is also insoluble and rust colored. Reference.  There still some remaining though. To fully filter out the ionized iron and the solid iron, you need a system that oxidizes the ionized iron and a filter (sediment filters are fine) to get the particles that become oxidized or were already present.  More information here. This is all very complicated and can be expensive though (unless you just want to buy a sediment filter, which can be 10-15 dollars). A less expensive option would be to buy a large jug of water at a grocery store that was treated by reverse osmosis, as this removes most of the iron.  Make sure you check out the standards of the brand you are buying though, because some filter out more things than others."
Why do cats love sleeping on cardboard?,"This has to do with security. A box has 4 sides so they feel safe and protected since they are closed off. It also gives them the element of surprise and if anything happens they can easily escape/attack etc. (src) They like the security of an enclosed space. A box resembles a cave and may make your cat feel secure knowing they are protected and, theoretically, cannot be attacked from behind. Boxes are fun! Lots of cats seem especially playful in and around boxes. Cats enjoy jumping in and out of a box, pouncing, stalking and climbing atop boxes. Cats are little predators, and a box is a great spot from which to pounce on their prey, even if the prey is just a catnip mouse toy. Boxes are cozy. Try putting a soft blanket in the bottom of your cat’s favorite box. The sides help retain the cat’s body heat making a comfy nest. (src)"
Cat has bad tooth and won't eat but vet won't remove tooth if she isn't eating,"As someone with 5 cats, one of whom recently lost a lower front tooth, I'd be inclined to get a 2nd opinion from a different vet. My reasoning is that she can't eat anything because of the pain in her mouth. She can't drink anything because of the same problem (unless you can get her to try warm water), so how is she to ""get healthy"" enough for the extraction? After the extraction, I would think your cat would be more happy to chow down and not be in pain. Plus, your vet making your cat suffer for another 7 days is very stressful for her (and you). That's just not right."
Is it a responsible action to adopt a starving kitten when I live in a very small place?,"First question is, do you want a cat? If not, disregard the rest of my comment and say no. I'm inclined to agree with your friend, although I do understand your reservations. If the situation the kitten is currently in involves potentially starving to death - any kind of living area where they are not starving is much more preferable. Consider how you would feel if the same situation applied to you. Of course in the future, the cat may ""grow out"" of your living area, but at least it will be alive. You could always rehome to someone with a bigger house, or the cat could be so grateful for saving its life it won't be too bothered. Also, cats live a long time, you might move in to a bigger place during its lifetime. "
Safe for cats to drink from the aquarium?,"Here are the main problems in my mind: I'd first put a lid or covering on the tank to stop the direct access that the cat already has. If this isn't possible because the filter would still be exposed, you can try training your cat not to go there. If the cat really only likes running water, you can also get it a drinking fountain (This is the first one I found online - YMMV). The cat will be able to drink from a running water source without needing to disturb the aquarium."
Did I Traumatize My Puppy?,"That was probably a little too much in one go for a puppy. Puppies learn natural dog behavior from their mothers and rudimentary human behavior from their mother's owners (that's called socializing). They are most trusting and confident in situations they experienced in a positive way during socializing. Everything above and beyond makes them insecure until they learned how to cope with the new situation. After such a negative experience, you need to give your puppy much love and, if possible at all, repeat the same or a similar situation in a much more positive way. First there was cutting the nails. This is not an activity you usually do with a puppy during socialization and holding the feet of a dog is not part of the natural behavior. Almost all dogs get nervous during nail cutting at first and need to be trained to endure the procedure in a calm way. You should train ""holding hands"" with your puppy. He can be sitting up or lying on his side (to hold the feet). Just pet him a little, take one of his feet in your hand, look at it and move it a little bit for 5 - 10 seconds, then release it and continue petting. This connects the experience with positive emotions. Next you should include the nail clipper in this training. Let your dog sniff at it, then do the ""holding hands"" training but instead of just holding his feet, touch his nails with the clipper. You don't need to actually clip his nails, just touching is enough. Continue petting after that. Next time you need to cut his nails, repeat the same training, this time actually cutting his nails. Pet him after every single nail that was cut. Next the bath. Many dogs are afraid of the bathtub because they cannot see the shape of the surface clearly, it makes a metallic sound that most dogs aren't used to and amplifies sounds and on top of that, they get wet. You could compare the experience with a ghost train for dogs. Some simple tips to make the experience less frightening are: Getting water into a dog's ear can cause ear infections, so avoid that at all costs. Even plain, clean water without shampoo will significantly raise the risk of an infection. Always use a shampoo designed for dogs. Shampoo for humans shouldn't be ingested, can dry out a dog's skin for several weeks and cause itching or rashes. Once you're done, either let your dog jump out of the tub or lift him out. Offer a towel in your open hands and call him to you. Rub him dry in a playful manner. Our dog loves to rub himself on the towel and squirm around on it. Last but not least, the ears. I share your fate in that regard. Any ear infection is extremely unpleasant for a dog, and so is getting any liquid into their ears. Our own dog whines as if he's being slaughtered every time we treat his ears. Don't grab your dog by the snout and force his head into the position you'd like. Don't clamp his head between your legs. This is not only a form of violence, it also means a rather severe punishment in a dog's natural body language. That way you connect treating his ears with very negative emotions and he will fight harder and harder against it. Instead, you need to have more patience and outsmart him. You should start massaging his ears with your non-dominant hand. In case of an infection, it's best to massage from the cheek (inner ear) towards the neck (outer ear) to dislodge any accumulation of ear wax. If there is excessive ear wax, it's best to wipe it out with a moistened cotton swap before applying any medication. Do not use Q-tips / cotton buds in a dog's ear. Then move your dominant hand (holding the medication bottle / dispenser) to the same ear and quickly squirt some of the medication in the ear. Continue massaging the ear to spread the medication. If the medication is very liquid, you don't even have to aim. It'll flow into the ear while you massage. If it's more like a gel and your dog won't let you aim in his ear, squirt a dose onto your finger tip and gently push the finger as deep into the ear as you can get, then massage. Be careful not to hurt your dog with your finger nails. After each treatment, give him some very special treats he doesn't get every day and praise him."
What level of output laser pointer is safe for a cat?,"This article from Princeton University deals with laser pointer use and human effect, and it mentions that use of laser pointers that are higher than 5 mW are dangerous and should not be used, so it seems like the green one might be safe, although they recommend that the lower the output the better, as they will be safer. Like with any laser, avoid pointing it at your cat's eyes, or at reflective surfaces that might reflect the laser into their eyes, and that can cause problems, the same way it can for humans.  Further, though, beyond just the output, another concern is that since the cats cannot ""kill"" the laser, they are not able to come down from the ""high"" of hunting, and may redirect that energy in negative ways (excessive grooming, aggression, etc), so it is suggested that at the end of a laser pointer play session, you give the cat something to ""kill"" such as a stuffed toy or something similar. "
Is it possible to have a pet cat even with cat allergies?,"It's definitely possible to live with a cat even if you have cat allergies. There are several things you can do to reduce, and remove the allergens that cause a reaction. Step one is always fresh air, ventilation, and filtration. Open windows when you can to get fresh air flow moving through the house, bring in new air and take away the old with dander and other allergens. If you can't have the windows open all the time, like if it rains or gets cold outside, you can use an air filter like Oldcat suggested (Technically you can use one all the time I guess, but come on, fresh air!). Here is an example air filter. Though I have no idea how good this one is, it has a 4 1/2 star rating. You can always give the cat its own space so that your wife has places to be safe from any reactions. The bedroom is a perfect place to make into a safe room. You should be able to spend time with your cat whenever you want, but in the case of an allergic reaction, your wife should have a place to get away. Brush the cat often to get rid of shed hair and dander. Also, brush it outside if you can, or in a well ventilated room. You're brushing the allergens off of the cat and into the air, which is something you definitely don't want. Furniture and upholstery are allergen traps. You can either clean them often, or you can put allergen protectors on them. My wife is allergic to dust mites, so we have a mattress cover on our bed. I will warn you they make crinkling sounds when you move on them. They make anti-allergen sprays that are supposed to remove even pet allergens, though I can't say the effectiveness of those, it might be something to look into. Watch your vacuum. Old vacuums with bags are especially notorious for kicking back some dirt and dust. You can get allergen trapping bags, but newer, bagless vacuums are much better. Keep the litter box clean. Not only is cat urine an allergen, but cat litter is extremely dusty. You might want to try different kinds of cat litter to see if that helps. Yesterday's News is made of old newspaper, and Feline Pine is made of compressed sawdust. Keep the cat clean. While cats will wash themselves, they will not get rid of all their dander on their own. Also, cat saliva is an allergen too (go figure). I personally don't suggest daily baths; especially for kittens. But a bath once a week or so would help. Daily wipe downs with a cloth or kitten wipes are an alternative to baths, and can be less stressful on both of you. Important notes:  
Finally, I would suggest you get treatment -- Even if it's just taking antihistamines to reduce the allergic reaction. There's also the option of getting an allergy test to tell what specifically you're allergic to. That can help you target the allergens more effectively.  You will want to speak to a doctor about immunotherapy for the details but I can tell you this much: It will not cure allergies. What it does, is it gets your body used to the allergens. Desensitizing your body to the reaction and lessening the immune system's response. Your wife still might have allergic reactions after the treatments are completed, but the point is that they're so minuscule she won't hardly notice. First thing to do is understand what an allergy is. At the basic level, an allergy is the body reacting negatively to an otherwise harmless substance. What immunotherapy aims to do, is expose the immune system to the allergen in minute amounts at first, then slowly increase the dosage until you no longer feel the effects. The process does take time, so don't expect it to be done anytime soon. The treatment goes something like this: You will go in once a week for a mall dose at first, then once every other week, then once a month, then once every few months, then once a year, then once every couple years. The dosage increasing by a fraction each time. Because there are so many treatments, it can be fairly costly, but I cannot give an estimate with any confidence. I will say immunotherapy has been shown to be an effective method of managing allergies. If you and, more importantly, your wife are patient enough, it will help her manage the allergic reactions.

Can I use a gecko to get rid of a cockroach infestation?,"If I read your question right, you want to use the gecko to clean up the poisoned roaches? You'll just end up with a poisoned gecko that way. But either way, a free-roaming gecko isn't going to make a dent in your roach problem, because roaches go out of their way to live and breed in places that predators can't reach, and to be honest the population is probably more than large enough to sustain itself even with minor losses from poison or predation. Plus, roaches tend to live within a few meters of their food supply, and letting reptiles run around your kitchen increases your risk of catching salmonella from them. It sounds like you have a pretty bad infestation, which unfortunately is not going to be easy or quick to get rid of. There's never a silver bullet for any kind of infestation, and you need to look at everything that's encouraging the roaches to settle in your kitchen: how new ones come in, where they're getting their food and water, where they're hiding and breeding, and so on. This approach is called integrated pest management (IPM), and it's the most effective response to any vermin problem. It's perfectly reasonable to hire a professional exterminator who understands IPM in a case like this (and I'd personally be skeptical of any exterminator who doesn't)."
How long can a 1-year-old cat stay home alone?,"It's not really about age once they get past 6 months, and it depends on him. If he's the reclusive sort that doesn't want or expect a lot of attention, you can have a friend come over daily to make sure he's got food and water and a little play time, and tend to the litter box as it needs it. It's good to have feeding systems that store enough for a couple of days no matter what, you never know when something might come up. If he craves attention and actively seeks it, you probably don't want to leave him at home alone for a protracted amount of time, or no longer than twice the length of time you'd normally be gone. That could be quite a bit of stress on him, and that can lead to undesirable things. He'll need a couple visits each day you're away. If you don't have a friend that you trust with a key, consider a good cat kennel where he'll have plenty of room and opportunity to interact and play with people. Just check them out first, the best ones are those that come recommended by other cat owners you know. "
Why do rabbits chew electrical wires?,"They have to chew. Rabbit teeth are constantly growing and the chewing activity actually serves to grind them down. Rabbits will chew pretty much anything ""chewable"" which includes wood, wires, and the like. If you give them lots of non-wire stuff to chew, like apple tree branches, then it does reduce the chance they'll go after your wires, but it doesn't stop it in my experience (we had two rabbits once). One good option, by the way, is the plastic teething keys you can get for babies. Not only do rabbits like to chew on them, but they also toss them about for play. Our rabbits loved the plastic keys."
Why is it not common for cats to be taken for walks?,"I use a leash and harness with my cats to let them outside, but I don't take them for a walk as I would with a dog. It's more letting them explore around the yard as much as they want, but controlling how far they go, and when they come back. They're not interested in walking around the block because they don't really like meeting strangers outside of the house, as they're already nervous from leaving the known safety of the house. I also don't want to take them outside of the yard because I don't want to have to deal with finding out what happens if they meet a dog. They've already had some bad experiences with dogs, so I'd rather keep them away as much as possible. The only types of cats that really do enjoy walking around the block are cats that are still relatively wild, like Bengals and Servals. They still have strong instincts to patrol/mark a broader territory than normal housecats, along with having higher amounts of energy. Servals are rarely seen as pets due to the legal restrictions on them, and Bengals are generally kept by owners who care more about how they look than how happy they are, so the chances of you happening across an owner walking their cat is almost none. The only reason I like to take my cats outside to explore is for the fresh air, really. It's mental stimulation, the same reasons people want to get out of the house: it gets boring after so long. It's just nice to see something different every once in a while. Sure, it's a bit of exercise for them too, but it's not the only way they can get exercise. They are smaller than most dogs, meaning they have more room to run around without knocking into things (most of the time). But really the main difference is that they can climb. I have a 6 foot tall cat tree that my cats can climb up and down, which gives them vertical space to exercise."
Are cats appropriate pets if I am not home for most of the day?,"The short answer: ""Yes"" The longer version: cats are generally pretty independent creatures, but they do miss their humans especially if we're not at home during the day. If you have just one cat, be prepared to be met with demands for attention, playing, and a great deal of petting when you are home. This will be strongest after you get the cat, because it won't be sure that you're coming back until gets used to your work routine.  Some of the things you can do to help are: "
Are there any special considerations when taking in a stray cat?,"There are several considerations: Health: A top priority is a visit to the vet to check for any health issues (illness, parasites) and get any immediately-needed vaccines (your vet will advise on this).  The vet should also check for a microchip; if for any reason the vet can't check this, call a local shelter and ask where you can have the cat checked. Do not allow the cat to interact with any other pets in your house before being cleared for health issues by a vet.  When I adoped a stray from the street she lived in the basement for a few days, well-separated from everybody else -- not much fun for her, maybe, but better than living on the street or potentially infecting my other cats with something contagious. Try to find the owner, if one exists and wants to be found: I mentioned checking for a microchip above; other things you can do, as JoshDM mentioned in his answer, are checking for and posting lost-pet notices.  It's also useful to call all local shelters and the animal-control division of local government to report the found cat.  An owner who's lost a pet will be calling those places, so this maximizes chances of you finding each other. House prep: If these are their first cats, they'll need to do the ""cats 101"" stuff -- food, litterbox, removing (or putting away) household hazards, etc.  That's beyond the scope of this question. Integration: If there are other pets in the house, follow the usual practices for gradually introducing the newcomer to them.  (I answered a related question about moving house here; I can't find a general ""how to introduce cats to each other"" question.)  If the cat is feral (as opposed to one who was previously a pet) things can be more complicated; see here for some advice."
"What causes fur clumps on my cat's back, and how can I prevent them?","These are generally called Mats. They are particularly a problem with long haired cats, but short haired cats can get them too. They are more susceptible to them in the spring and fall when they are shedding their seasonal coats. Also, overweight cats might get them in parts they can't easily reach to groom (i.e. their back). Prevention is quite simple, just brush your cat regularly and they are unlikely to occur. The main goal is to facilitate shedding. I'd recommend a strong wire brush (often called a cat rake) for this, for example something like:  The reason for this sort of brush is that it gets into their undercoat where mats generally develop. So when brushing your cat with this you want to be fairly aggressive (which they tend to like). The other advantages of regular brushing are that your cat will most likely love it, they will shed less (if your cat is indoors), santization (brushing out dirt / cat litter) and it will help prevent hairballs as well.  As far as what causes them I am not entirely sure, but I think it is probably similar to ""Why do cords always end up getting tangled?"" "
My cat loves coconut oil. Is it safe to give him some?,"Coconut oil is safe for cats, if given in moderation. Potential side effects include: Since you've been letting your cat have small amounts without any allergic reactions, I would think it is safe to assume that he is not allergic. Coconut oil has many benefits for cats and can be used internally or topically for a wide range of reasons: Topical Internal How much? The research that I've done suggests 1/8 to 1/2 teaspoon once or twice daily. Here's the catch, extra virgin coconut oil contains 92% saturated fat, or 117 calories per tablespoon, 14g fat and 12g saturated fat. This is a high-calorie supplement. If your cat has existing weight issues, or if he gains weight, it may become necessary to cut back, or reduce his caloric intake elsewhere. As with anything, if you see any side effects, stop immediately and consult with your local vet.

How can I stop my inside cat from being irritated by other outside cats or animals?,"You need to add a relatively tall climbing tree (the number one answer to almost anything related to cats) or similar high-up vantage point near the window and instead of closing the curtains I'd let a view to the outside from this tree. Closing the curtains forces your cat to go on the windowsill where s/he is then suddenly too close to the passerby. Having the window glass between them makes no difference, as you've noticed. Provide your cat with the high-up observation platform with a good view to keep watch over the ""intruder"" while the cat itself can stay invisible (or at least feel like invisible). How this might work depends a lot on the reason what really upsets your cat in the first place. Usually it is the close proximity to the passerby, which is quite unavoidable if the cat sits on a windowsill and the intruder moves right under your cat's nose. Stealth is life! What changes between night and day is the lighting. During a day the brightest light comes from outside, which makes it very difficult from the outside to see in. An animal passing the window at daytime can't really see in, so it can't make eye-contact with your cat. Your cat is invisible because of the glass reflection. Night changes this. An animal on the outside can see your cat so close on the windowsill and makes eyecontact. In case there is an outside lightsource that shines through the window illuminating your cat as well as the outside creature, then a roll-down curtain might help by shadowing your cat out of view. Like this:  Update:
From what I've later understood of the setting, it seems the above pic is not quite what your basement apartment looks like. If I got it right, the relation of ground level to window looks like this:  For the happiness of the cat I would not try to prevent access to the windowsill, as cats seem to like to sit and watch things through a window. I would turn the window into a one-way-mirror to the outside, which adds some darkening effect to the inside. Making it one-way to outside allows you (and your cat) to see out, but from the outside it appears to be a mirror. I don't know what the product is called in English, but it is a thin foil-like adhesive film that is spread on the window glass. Though there's no guarantee that this would work, but at least it would prevent eyecontact between your cat and the by-passing animal, as I believe that is an important part of the problem. The get a full mirror-effect requires that there's some light on the outside and relatively dark in the room inside."
Why is my cat growling at his toys?,"Cats growl when they grapple with their prey. Your cat is just playing, which in cats is just following their natural predatory instincts.
  Source : Why does my female cat hiss and growl over furry toys? In addition to this, I suggest that you do not try to pet him or stop him when he is doing this. If you do, he might think you're trying to take his ""prey"" away from him and can become aggresive towards you."
How can I encourage my kitten to leave my adult cat alone?,"The solution has two parts. First, tire out the kitten so she's less likely to view the adult cat as a plaything.  Wand toys like Da Bird are pretty effective for most cats (though I have one who prefers snake toys, so we have a wand toy with a feather boa instead of a ""bird"" attached for him). Second, make sure that the older cat has enough pathways to escape the younger cat's advances without getting cornered. You want to make sure that there aren't any ""dead ends"" in your house, and where there are dead ends, generally add vertical shelving/trees to enable the older cat to escape UP and continue getting away instead of having to face the younger cat.  In a similar situation we've also belled our youngest so that the older cats can easily find him.

Jackson Galaxy also has a great show on Animal Planet (and Netflix), My Cat from Hell, that may be able to help. Good luck!"
How can I keep my cat stimulated when she's stuck inside the house during winter?,"There are a lot of toys on the market designed to stimulate cats who are stuck in indoor environments, and usually they are designed to mimic behaviours that cats use outside and in the wild, etc. Some suggestions you might want to try that don't involve buying possibly expensive toys that your cat might not like are:"
Why does my cat (almost) constantly purr while he's awake?,"The language of purring Cats also purr if they're injured, while giving birth - even when dying.  British zoologist Desmond Morris has observed that  purring is ""a sign of friendship - either when the cat is contented with a friend or when it is in need of friendship - as with a  cat in trouble. (1) A cat's purr is a type of language, as is the meow. The meow tends to be a more intense expression than a purr. Although purring can also have emotion effect on cat owners. Purring doesn't always indicate a cat is content, it can mean a variety of things. (2)  At the very least it is a way of displaying submissive as opposed to aggressive intention.  German ethologist and cat behaviourist Paul Leyhausen interpreted the
  purr as a signal that the animal is not posing a threat. (3) Purring and attachment Even if you're across the room, your cat is still communicating with you, and being affected by your presence, which is probably reassuring for him. An interesting test would be to film him while you're out of the house. It could be his way of maintaining a connection with you. It is theorized that kittens and mother cats use purring as a way of bonding and that this may be a form of communication used throughout a cat's life to facilitate bonding.  Kittens are able to purr from a few days after birth. They can purr
  while suckling from their mother which may communicate contentment or
  maintain contact with her. ... Mother cats may also purr while nursing kittens, perhaps >to  maintain contact with their offspring. Or maybe it’s all down to the
  hypothalamus detecting a pleasurable sensation and helping to trigger
  purring. (3) Possible emotional damage of rescue pets Contrary to the prevailing view, there is evidence that emotional pain may induce greater suffering than physical pain. Studies have shown that emotional factors weigh more strongly in animals’ behavioral choices than physical pain. (4) Although it has yet to be determined what the long term effects of psychological or emotional suffering can be; it is becoming more apparent that a history of emotional abuse or neglect may well have lasting effects on a pet's psychology. Given you got him from the shelter, it might be a huge relief for your cat to have found you, and this could result in him being extra purry. He may well have an underlying insecurity, without knowing his history, he may have been happy with another owner and then suddenly removed, this is conjecture, but the fact he ended up homeless, means he's been uprooted. It would be hard to provide a definitive explanation as to why your cat purrs so much.  What we know for sure is that animals do suffer psychological and not just physical pain, and that emotional abuse and maltreatment may be far more widespread and pernicious than physical abuse. (5) The many articles I've linked discuss the variable nature of purring. If your cat is in good physical health and as settled as he sounds, it doesn't sound like something to be concerned about. As for something else going on in terms of physical health, there is some discussion about possible physical health issues that can cause (perceived) excessive purring.

How can I make one of my two cats eat less?,"Instead of forcing the lean cat to eat in a ""prison"", like a carrier box or a closed room, you could take advantage of the fact that the fat cat is just that; fat. Can he jump as high up as the lean one? Can he fit through a hole so tiny that the lean cat is just able to wiggle through? Find such place in your home that only the lean cat can jump onto, and put the food bowl up there. Show the place to the lean cat, so it'll know where to find food. The fat cat can't get there; problem solved. Example of a cat's ability to jump and climb:

(This animated gif is found in several pages in internet, I don't know whom to credit for it.) I currently have this situation with our cats. We have five cats, the youngest of which is overweight. I feed four of the cats on kitchen counter. This one cat is not willing to jump even this much, a relatively low (85 cm/34 inches) height for a cat, but simply waits on the floor until I give him the leftovers after the other cats have all eaten."
Why is my cat so interested in me making the bed?,"I cannot provide a definitive explanation. I only have my own anecdotal assumptions. I have always assumed that the cats which do this are motivated by their prey drive and their ""need"" to hunt & stalk. Cats differ as to how they express this need.  A common way people experience a cat's  prey drive is as an obsession to chase a dangling piece of string. A more elaborate cat toy designed to stimulate this same impulse are the wand toys such as ""Da Bird"" (example pic below).    Media figure Jackson Galaxy advocates regular ""play therapy"" with your cat(s) in order to satisfy what he considers an innate need to hunt.  I tend to agree with this advice, though I don't know if it has ever been investigated (verified) in a formal fashion. When you make the bed, the cats can be attracted by the sheets flying through the air and attempt to pounce on and catch them. Another motivation can be either to explore or hide in the small ""burrow"" created when they get underneath the sheets. Whether a cat is playing or hunting when they do this does not strike me as something worth debating.  It is likely different elements of each for different cats. I have several cats, but only one of them is especially interested in ""playing"" when I am trying to make the bed. I find it extremely annoying. (I also really miss it the occasional times he does not do it.) "
How can I keep my cats safe in my car?,"When transporting cats in carriers, I always put the crates in the back seat of the car and run the seat belt through the handle on the top and around the side of the crate. Like with children, the back seat is safest for cats and other pets, not only physically in event of a crash, but also limiting distraction to the driver (as when I have the crate in the front seat I often look over and talk to my cat).  I would think that the airbag deploying on a crate wouldn't be a good thing since it deploys with enough force to break bones in a human, and could potentially crush the crate.  Putting the crates on in the hatchback wouldn't be optimal, since the crates could slide around and tumble in event of a crash since they aren't secured by anything. Belting the crates with the seat-belt as explained above would be the best bet to reduce the risk to your furry friends.  Many dog and cat carriers have a slot for seatbelt on both sides of carrier topside."
How can I ensure that homemade dog food is healthy for my dog?,"Dogs are not pure carnivores and so do need a certain percentage of vegetable matter in their diet, but the majority of the diet should still be meat and with a little variation in the type of meat. About 20% of the remainder of the diet should have some vegetables in it. From the meat perspective, you want to have a decent mix of organs, muscle, skin and fat roughly in proportion to what they'd get from prey or scavenging. The meat that you use, though, should be meat that is fit for human consumption (even if we don't want to eat it). The vegetable mix can include things like squash, lettuce, carrots, cabbage, and similar, don't use carbs.   A good source for more detail, along with some recipes to help you get started at Dog Training Central or at Know Better Pet Foods. As with any diet, you should very carefully monitor the health of your friend as you transition his diet, pay particular attention for any signs of gas, vomiting, or other unusual behaviour such as lethargy."
Is there benefit to feeding my cats cat food that incorporates fruits and vegetables?,"Most of the relevant work seems to indicate that the nutrients found specifically in vegetables/fruits aren't digestible by cats, and the nutrients that they need are found in animal tissue (usually muscle or fatty tissue). So the inclusion of these ingredients in their food is not poisonous, but adds indigestible mass that they don't need. For example, in The carnivore connection to nutrition in cats (JAVMA, Vol 221, No. 11, December 1, 2002) Dr. Debra L. Zoran states: Vitamin A is found naturally only in animal tissues, and it must be
  provided as the biologically active form in diets formulated for cats
  because of the fact that cats cannot convert β-carotene (which is
  plentiful in plants) to retinol (the active form of vitamin A); this
  conversion is not possible, because cats lack the necessary intestinal
  enzyme. In high enough levels, being unable to digest some materials can actually be harmful to the cat. For example, benzoic acid is one of the components in cranberries (a popular fruit to add to cat food because of its folklore status as a cure for urinary tract infections in humans). Too much benzoic acid can be fatal for cats. Outbreaks of poisoning affecting 28 cats have followed ingestion
      of meat containing 2.39% benzoic acid. The effects were nervousness,
      excitability, and loss of balance and vision. Convulsions occurred and
      17 cats either died or were killed. Autopsies showed damage to
      intestinal mucosa and liver. The sensitivity of the cat may be due to
      its failure to form benzoyl glucuronide and toxicity may develop with
      quantities greater than 0.45 g/kg single doses or 0.2 g/kg repeated
      doses (Bedford & Clarke, 1971). However, you'd have to feed your cat a LOT of cranberries to get to this level of toxicity, so I don't believe your cat would be in any danger from a commercially produced food that included cranberry. Cranberries are somewhat of an unusual case. Their inclusion is often to promote urinary health, not just to increase the ""nutritiousness"" of the food. Skepvet summaries his findings: There is weak theoretical justification for using cranberry products
  for UTIs, though none of the supporting preclinical evidence involves
  dogs or cats. There is conflicting clinical trial evidence in humans,
  and no clinical studies in dogs and cats. There are weak theoretical
  safety concerns. Peas and pumpkin can also be included not for nutritional value, but to bulk up the stool and relieve constipation. I don't generally recommend feeding fiber to an otherwise healthy cat and prefer to monitor the situation myself. GI symptoms can be the first sign of an illness, so I prefer to know as soon as possible that something may be wrong. "
What can I do about the black dots on my cat's chin?,"This looks and sounds like something known as feline acne.   Basically, they're blackheads, or clogged pores. We have one cat who suffers from this.  She commonly gets black spots on her chin, lips, and muzzle, although the underneath of the chin is were we see most of them.  The veterinarian identified the spots as acne, and suggested that we try switching from plastic bowls to metal or porcelain.  He also suggested wiping them with a warm, wet rag, which generally seems to work. I've seen some disagreement about exactly what causes this.  Some suggested causes I've seen are stress, hormones, allergic reactions to plastic bowls, hygiene, or an overactive sebaceous gland. Its definitely worth taking your cat to the veterinarian, for a professional opinion.  Even if it is feline acne, the blackheads can become infected, or may be associated with other problems."
How do I help my dog with major leash anxiety?,"how is it going? Your description makes me think of a dog that might have been a nice, even beloved homebody dog who developed into an unmanageable training drop-out so that his owners despaired of being able to keep him - and hoped to give him a chance with somebody else. Supposedly he knows some training 'helpers', starting with stopping when he pulls and trying to get the leash out of his mouth by pulling - so he was given every chance and time enough to find his antidote for any of those methods - probably without ever understanding what kind of behaviour they wanted from him - and that it might bring him some kind of success he finds attractive in his situation, if would only he choose another option than pulling/holding/shaking. Later on I would think they probably tried to correct him by some rather more desperate kind of punishment - seemingly not connected (by him) with his owners actions but with the leash situation/strangers (you possibly know, what's in the market)-for me that could explain his fearful body signals when on leash with anybody else, his shaking and so on.  Not Dominance, but bad outcome of some training experiments during his impressionable younger years. What to do? Would first try to teach him to heel at home without collar and leash (not to trigger the 'old' behaviour again by them and not get him fixated on grabbing the leash again (which keeps his neck safe from most kinds of leash punishments at least he might have learned). Because of possible earlier trainings issues I would never use 'normal' signals for any training with him - not to remind him of earlier errors but use foreign language ones or/and unusual body signs, use praise and high value treats/play for any nearness to heel position (no command, not even a 'signal' or lure, just waiting what happens with a friendly dog when You walk around the home without any distractions and talk to him some friendly nonsense...  Just 'golden' the position near your leg (might choose the right instead of the usual left - reason the same as above: completely unrelated new training usually much easier to introduce than any changing of old habits/expectations). If he gets the idea, You might slowly add the first distractions and later on a new collar (still no leash) and then look for an qualified APDT-Trainer to help you get it 'on the street'... Who am I? A dog trainer from another country with university degree - noticeable not in English - and decades of experience with normal and correction work in a soft way."
Why does my dog's leg shake/twitch when I scratch certain spots on her body?,"You are eliciting a Scratch Reflex* that is located in the animal's spinal cord.  The urge to itch is involuntary. As for the ""smiling"" aspect, I don't know how that relates to the scratch reflex, but I can only surmise that it's similar to a minor grimace that a human might have while they are stretching their muscles. *Warning, skip the article if you are sensitive to descriptions of animals being used in research "
"Dog likes walks, but is terrified of walk preparation","Please consider that the problem might not be the harness itself, but how you act with the harness. Chihuahuas are small dogs and can be slinky when they want to avoid something. If you grab her, lift her up and somehow force her into the harness, that process is very uncomfortable. Even if you don't cause her any pain, it's still uncomfortable from a psychological point of view to be robbed of your ability to escape. The way I often see people put a harness on their dog is: standing with their legs fully stretched, bending at the waist to reach for the dog and grabbing or pulling the dog if it doesn't stand still and in some cases even trapping the dog between their legs. In short: people are towering over their dogs, which is a very aggressive pose in dog's body language. And since many dogs want to avoid this aggressive situation, people become even more aggressive or physically rough to just get the darn harness on. A much better pose is to kneel or sit down and offer the harness to the dog with outstretched hands. If the harness (or coat) needs to go over the head, you should hold it in a way that the dog can simply walk into it. To train this behavior, hold a treat behind the hole to lure the dog into the harness voluntarily. If kneeling down isn't an option for you, you could have the dog jump on your lap to avoid the towering pose. If the legs need to go into holes, the process is a little more complicated, but still works best without applying any force. Having their feet lifted from the ground can be disorienting for dogs. So it's better to stroke the fur from shoulder to the foot to give the dog time to either lift the foot themselves or to mentally prepare for having the foot lifted. Maintaining a calm chat of encouragements and praises also helps convey the message that this isn't an aggressive situation. If your dog is very nervous or too hyped up, you should speak with an extremely low and calm voice to calm your dog. In your specific situation you could start a harness desensitization training. Right now your dog connects the harness with negative memories, so she hates the sight of it. By connecting the harness with positive experiences, you can change her mind. If you already have different harnesses, I highly recommend doing the training with a different harness than you use for walking. Get the harness out several times a day (without actually going on a walk) and offer a treat in the close proximity of it. Your dog should simply come to you and eat the treat. After that you simply put the harness away again. It may take a few tries at first before she even takes the treat, but eventually she will trust that she can eat it without having to put the harness on. Once she reliably takes the treat, you can adapt the training to make her put her head through the harness in order to take the treat. A few days after she started doing that reliably, you can start putting her legs through the holes and rewarding her with a second treat, but still without closing the clasps and going out. Only when she voluntarily puts her head into the harness and you can calmly put her legs through the holes should you switch to using the training harness for your actual walks."
Why doesn't my cat like being held?,"It may be the cat's personality; however, you may well be able to change that to some extent. We adopted our cat when she was about two years old.  (She is now about thirteen.)  At first, she was very skittish and spent most of her day hiding behind furniture.  It's possible that she was badly treated by her previous owner, and certainly she was traumatized by the noisy, competitive shelter.  To this day she is still rather hesitant to approach strangers; and she still does not like to be picked up.  (The latter is because we have not tried to alter this behavior, and usually when we pick her up we're about to stuff her in her carrier to go to the vet, or give her medication!) Here's what we did to encourage her to be petted. Nowadays she responds to her name; she jumps on the bed and purrs if she sees that we're there; and she will come over and jump on my lap (and purr) if she sees me sit down.  We've even trained her to meow for treats, ""stand up"" and paw at my leg to get me to pet her, etc.  She did not do any of this when we first adopted her -- and she was an adult at that point.  So don't give up: it can be a long, slow process, but at least in our experience, it is possible and quite rewarding in the end!"
Cat Keeps Drinking Unattended Drinks,"I propose replacing his assigned water bowl with something he likes drinking from, like a dessert glass bowl or a drinking glass with a low rim. Different containers can add their own smell and taste to the water in them, especially containers that aren't supposed to hold liquids for a long time. The main reason why water bottles have a use before date is not that the water somehow goes bad, but that the bottle itself slowly breaks down and releases weird chemicals into the water. To make him unlearn that he can find drinkable water in your glass, you should always put a lid on your glass. There are different types available online or in stores for kitchenware. I think it would be best to find a lid that fits your usual drinking glass as best as possible, or maybe buy a new glass with a lid included."
Can I use human medicine on dogs?,"Never give pets human medication unless advised by your local Veterinarian. People may be tempted to try and save money, by bypassing a trip to the Vet or paying for expensive Veterinary medications and products. Unfortunately the cost of looking after our pets can be high, but to try and help our pets with well meaning shortcuts, by using human products and medications is not a viable solution. Animals metabolise drugs differently from human beings and differently between species. What may be effective in a human being, may be harmful or potentially fatal for a dog. Top 10 Dog Poisons Dog poison No. 1: Prescription medications for people. Drugs that
might be beneficial or even lifesaving for people can have the
opposite effect in pets. And it doesn’t always take a large dose to do
major damage. Some of the most common and harmful medications that poison dogs
include: Common Dog Poisons Medications that can be toxic at certain doses include: Aspirin, Paracetamol and Ibuprofen. Other medications that should not be given to your dog as they can be potentially lethal, even in small doses, include: Antidepressants – can cause vomiting and lethargy with certain types leading to serotonin syndrome.
ADHD medications – act as a stimulant and dangerously elevate heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature.
Anti-cancer drugs.
Anti-diabetics – cause a major drop in blood sugar levels causing disorientation, lack of coordination and seizures.
Cold medicines – acts as a stimulant causing elevated heart rates, blood pressure, body temperature and seizures.
Vitamin D derivatives – cause life-threatening spikes in blood calcium levels in pets that can lead to kidney failure.
Diet pills.
Muscle relaxants – can impair the central nervous system and lead to death. (2) It's important never to assume: An important note to make is, although many medications may be the same that is used for a pet and a human, it is important not to dose a pet based on the dosage given to a person. It is not just a weight by weight correlation, different species may require a varying dose per weight, as they have different metabolisms. The only exception: On the written advice of a Veterinarian:
For instance, you take your dog to the Veterinarian and the Vet gives you written instructions on the use of any over the counter medications  with explicit dosage guides. References: WebMD (1) Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI)

Cat digs litter out of the box,"Some cats are diggers and there's not much you can do about it.  A covered box is an option but traps odors, so monitor the situation carefully.  (One of my cats wouldn't go into a covered box at all, even clean -- claustrophic, I guess.)  I just keep a broom and dustpan handy; it's less hassle than cleaning up outside-of-box rebellions. A suggestion I've seen but never tried myself: get one of those big, deep plastic tubs, and cut an entrance in one of the short sides (down to the normal litterobox height) wide enough for the cats to easily negotiate.  Kicked litter will still come out the ""door"" but the other three sides will be more resistant, and because you're not putting a top on it you don't have odor-containment issues."
How can I teach my cat that the middle of the night is not the time to play fetch?,"A trick I did was to grab and hold my cats close if they disturbed me during the night. They didn't like it, but it was not painful.  In order to avoid it, they leave me alone when sleeping."
Do bunnies eat their droppings?,"Rabbits excrete two types of droppings, ordinary fecal waste matter, which are dried out pellets (fecal pellets) and cecotropes, which are not fecal matter and form moist grape like bunches. Cecotropes  are predigested hay/food pellets for the rabbit to eat and further digest.  A rabbits digestive system has a two step process. A rabbit requires a substantial proportion of hay and/or grass in their diet. This type of roughage is difficult to digest in any animal gut, and the rabbit's gut is highly specialized to process this in the cecum. Here the fibre is partially digested and the rabbit excretes this partially processed fibre as a specialized pellet called a cecotrope. The rabbit then eats the cecotrope and the nutrients that were locked within (almost indigestible) hay or grass are absorbed by the rabbit's gut. This predigested matter is easier to process the second time around. Any waste produced by digesting the cecotrope is expelled as normal, inedible fecal matter, as is any waste products foods in the rabbit's diet that is easier to digest). Rabbit's will usually feed on their cecotropes overnight, which is why some owners may not see them doing this. Cecotropes are a good source of nutrition: vitamins, fatty acids and protein for rabbits (1). In fact, rabbits cannot survive without them. The Scoop on Poop The cecum contains a wild brew of bacteria and fungi that are normal and beneficial for the rabbit. In fact, the rabbit cannot live without them, since the cecal flora produces essential nutrients (e.g., fatty acids and vitamins) that the rabbit cannot produce on her own. There is more detail about this in this post here

How can I get my dog to slow down when eating?,"There are dog bowls designed for slower eating available in most pet stores. They work by having an irregular design that makes it more difficult to get at food.  Also, try wetting the food; it will go down easier."
Is it okay to keep my fighter fish all by itself in a bowl?,"Betta fish, which is how your fish are more commonly known, are famously aggressive. Males in particular should never be kept with other males -- one will kill the other. Females can be kept together in larger groups with care, but pairs or mixed-sex groups won't work. Don't even worry about trying to find it a mate until you're really comfortable keeping them. Even if they weren't aggressive, the bowl itself is a problem. Bettas really need more water than the bowls they're usually sold with, and there's definitely no room for anything else. They don't need a huge tank if they're on their own, but you may have trouble keeping him in such a small space long-term. I've never personally kept bettas and don't know offhand what the go-to references would be, but nippyfish.net looks like a good place to learn more. There are sections on how to house them and how to choose non-betta tankmates down the road, and lots of other information about their care and natural history."
How do I convince my dog that a collar or harness is not the end of the world?,"It sounds like you are on the right path. All the positive reinforcement will help him learn to learn and trust you as well. Don't give up... you will get there. If it feels like you have hit a wall it's probably one of two things. ..or a combination. Either he has figured out the ""game"" or you went to fast at some point. Either way it will help if you change the game a bit so that you are helping him generalize it. In other words you can show him more and more things that are OK so eventually he will learn that just about anything you do to him is ok. So some things to try... put a piece of fabric on his back, around his leg, touch his tail with it. Change it so it is a sock that you are using or a shirt. Can you get to the point where you can put it over his foot? What about getting him to stick his nose in it (this may also help anyone working on muzzle training too). Can you get him to walk under a sheet that is draped between two chairs?  What if it is on the ground and you hold it up...can you get him to push through it with it touching his back? Every time you work on it try to change it just a little and keep your sessions super short... like some of them should be 5 seconds... you want to end with him wanting more not you pushing to get one last good try. If you get any good progress forward stop and take even a short 5 minute break before you come back to it. Your dog will come back to training with more enthusiasm and willingness.  All of those things will help him understand that every thing you ask him to do will be ok. It will also take his focus away frrim trying to keep you from putting a restraint on him. This will also keep him guessing... he wont be able yo predict what your goal is. Reward the smallest progress and remember to reward anytime he is really trying for you even if he doesn't guess right. The reward doesn't always have to be food it can be playing with a toy or just getting some love. Only try to actually put the collar on him when he is tired. Exercise him as much as you can. Give him a bunch of brain work then let him start to settle down.  Once he is calm then you can try a little to get it on him. Once it is on leave it on for as long as you can. Let him sleep in it. Most of all have patience and don't give up. Our dogs are often much more strong willed than we are so it works better if you can convince him it is his idea that the collar is the best thing ever. "
Why do cats tuck their heads when sleeping?,"It is not so counter intuitive for a cat  to sleep curled up as you suggest. Protecting the head whilst sleeping is not counter-intuitive for safety.  If you think about it, it is, perhaps, the safest position to sleep in. The back is exposed and all the soft belly and face is protected. Even the hard skull at the back of the head is a like a little armour.  As opposed to a stretched position, where this picture illustrates well the soft underbelly that the cat is protecting.  Dogs will often sleep rolled up in a ball also, it's good to observe when they do and when they are relaxed enough to lay out stretched, or even have a play stretch. It's also noteworthy that  animals will find the safest place to sleep."
"Do fish get bored, and if so, how can fish boredom be identified?","From what I've seen, there's not a lot of settled science about the inner lives of fish. It's not really obvious whether they even experience emotional states like boredom in a way we would recognize. Most of the research in this field of animal behavior focuses on larger vertebrates from what I can tell. When we talk about a bored pet, what we're basically talking about is whether the environment we provide offers enough stimulation to meet its behavioral needs. In other words, how do we recognize when we inadvertently cause stress by keeping an animal from interacting with its surroundings in the ways it's instinctively prepared for?  Like many animals, unusual behavior is one of the most visible indicators of stress in fish. Changes in behavior from things like poor water quality or disease are usually easy enough to spot, but the stresses we're concerned with here tend to cause more chronic problems. Identifying these means knowing what's typical behavior for the species, and recognizing when an individual is acting out of character. That could mean aggression in a peaceful fish, a heightened fear and startle responses in a calm one, or constant hiding in a bold one, for example. If a fish is known to readily breed in healthy conditions, it probably won't when it's under significant stress. The trick of course is that all these things can be caused by more urgent physical problems, but if your water parameters are good and no obvious disease presents itself over time, the stress may be psychological. In many cases, it's not too hard to identify the source of the problem. A fish acting aggressively might need to be in a larger school, or it might need more hiding spaces it knows it can retreat to. These kinds of needs are often collectively known about your animal; if you have something kind of new to the trade, you may need to look at what's known about similar species, or even better, its natural behavior in the wild. Generally this sort of thing is known as environmental enrichment, and my own opinion is that it will help minimize stress for most captive animals, aquatic or otherwise. Many aquarists provide some degree of this already. We keep community tanks, so there's plenty of inter- and intra-specific interaction. We keep plants and driftwood and other decorations that can be grazed on, hidden under, and claimed as territory. We (hopefully) provide enough physical space for the fish to be explore and be active within. All these things present our fish with regular ""natural"" events to initiate or respond to. There are more proactive things we can do as well. Food in general is one of the best approaches we have: if you can, present it in a way that mimics how the fish would encounter it in the wild, like chasing down food in the water column or foraging in the substrate. (Fortunately, this is a big part of the branding for many prepared foods.) Live food that needs to be hunted is great, but just having a varied diet is helpful. Species that have distinctive reproductive behaviors, such as parental care or elaborate courtship rituals, should be encouraged to breed if you can accommodate it. Basically, look at the kind of puzzles your fishes are specialized to solve -- like ""all my food lives in the sand"" or ""I need to defend my own little kingdom about 30cm in diameter"" -- and try to provide safe opportunities for them to solve those puzzles. I suspect this is what the cause of ""boredom"" in pets, and even humans, ultimately boils down to. Unfortunately the research I've found on this is mostly paywalled, and for the most part I can only get to abstracts. Here are some of the more interesting pieces: This wiki article on fish intelligence has a lot of good information and references. "
Why won't my dog eat on her own?,"Going for several days without food is not usual for a healthy dog. I would ask, are you sure your dog eats absolutely nothing in this time, as I would be skeptical. Having said this, dogs can go for a number of days without eating, though this is not optimal. The following is advice for a healthy dog. It is always a good idea to get your dog checked if you are worried. If your dog shows signs of poor health, weight loss, lethargy, any worrying signs, it is a good idea to get her checked professionally. The best  and easiest solution. The best way to encourage a fussy eater to eat is to introduce competition for the food. Many dogs that eat slowly, are fussy and will not finish their food will eat reasonable helpings in good time when there is another dog present. This is not always a viable option, especially to own a second dog. If you have any friends, family or neighbors with dogs, it would be worthwhile experimenting by feeding both dogs together, separate bowls, but within reasonably close proximity and see if this makes a difference. If not then there may be an organic cause for your dog's sussy eating behavior. As a general rule, though these things are behavioral and your dog has no reason to gulp her food quickly, and it pays her to be a fussy eater, as she is fussed over, petted, offered a variety of food and hand fed. It is good to remove these rewards if this behavior is a problem. The harder and more realistic solution. Consistency is the key word. You must not feed her, except for what is in her bowl for the following to work. Make sure the family eats their evening meal first. When this is finished, place a set amount in the bowl for 30 minutes, and take it up until the next day and repeat. She needs to learn two things: If you give in, she will learn that she just needs to wait it out. She's obviously not starving, or she would eat, and the pay-off of holding out is worth it for her. Ruling out health problems, you'll find your dog will eat what she needs to maintain a healthy body weight. 
The one problem you will have is going to her less favorite foods, try and keep her on her most favorite dog food mixtures, this is something you can worry about changing down the track."
Laser pointer: does a no-win situation risk psychological harm to cats?,"I wasn't able to find any solid research (at all, on playing with cats and laser pointers). What I can find is animal behaviorists who say that laser pointers (without transition to a solid toy/treat) are psychologically harmful. Examples Pam Johnson-Bennett (Certified Cat Behavior Consultant, on TV show Psycho Kitty) gives additional reasons why laser pointers are frustrating. Cats are tactile creatures and when they pounce on their prey they
rely on being able to feel their captured treasure underneath their
paws. Cats have carpal whiskers on the underside of their paws (at the
wrist) and they use those whiskers to detect movement of prey when
they have their paw over it. Imagine doing a great job of stalking and
pouncing and repeatedly NEVER feeling as if you’ve successfully
captured your intended target. Putting a paw over a laser light is an
exercise in frustration. Most of the other certified cat behaviorists that I found online don't seem to have very instructive websites/articles on this particular issue, but Ingrid Johnson (Certified Cat Behavior Consultant) states Our cats may seem like pampered indoor housecats, but on the inside they are still fierce predators! The greatest thrill for a cat is what is referred to as the “completion of the sequence of the kill.” It is important when we are playing with our cats that we remember this sequence and try to mimic it the best we can. Whether playing with an individual toy or engaging in interactive play with you, it is important to allow them to capture their prey. Many people think it is funny to not let the cat catch the toy; this is actually very frustrating and quite frankly, not nice. If you play using a laser light toy, give your cat a tangible object to capture at the end of the play session, feed them a meal or offer treats, something that says you caught it! Finally, Jackson Galaxy (on TV with My Cat From Hell, but who does not appear to have formal training/certification) gives two cases when laser pointers are useful (to get a cat motivated before transition to a physical toy and to distract during intercat aggression) but he gives the downside as If they can’t catch “the dot,” and the dot is put away at your convenience, then there will be an “inappropriate victim” down the line: other cats in the house, or your ankles as you walk by.  It’s like winding up a jack-in-the-box and expecting the top not to blow off.  If used as the only toy in the cat’s play life, the laser pointer can actually help promote further play aggression, and undo the benefits of play therapy."
Why do dogs place their heads above the backs of other dogs?,"Dogs are social animals and have a large repertoire of communicative signals and behaviors. Additionally the interactions between two dogs also involve many ""learned"" kind of interactions. One dog can learn that the other dog will let him do something. If that something is associated to a context that both dogs appreciate, it can become a learned habit. For example your dog could do that as a way to relax and send a ""I'm calm and relaxed"" signal to the other dog. Observe when your dog is doing that and then you tell us what you think are his reasons. Referring to @Chris's answer involving dominance. The outdated ""dominance theory"" has been debunked in every aspects, over the last ten years and by many authors (including Bradshaw, Dunbar, Eaton and many others). In short here are some key arguments: The dominance theory is based on the observation of captive wolves packs, where the individuals are constrained to stay in the pack and are, in most cases, unrelated Observations of wild wolves packs is quite different in term of social structure and hierarchy. A typical wolf pack involve a single breeding pair, along with the previous years litters and the cubs. In that sense, the alpha pair are simply the parents. Dogs do not socially behave like wolves (captive or wild). Studies and observations of feral dogs (eg. Pariah dogs in India) revealed that the ""pack"" are very different from wolves packs. There is no single breeding pair, the individual from different groups often interact without fighting (which is very different from the behaviour of wolves from different packs: they avoid each other but will fight in almost all cases if they do meet). The ""dominance theory"" took all of that a step further by claiming that dogs will keep that social structure even in their interactions with humans. No scientific data supports that assertion. Notable Sources: Dog Sense: How the New Science of Dog Behavior Can Make You A Better Friend to Your Pet (Bradshaw - book) Dominance in Dogs: Fact or Fiction? (Eaton - book) Dominance in domestic dogs-useful construct or bad habit? (Bradshaw - paper - see references inside)"
Negative reinforcement: how to replace an object?,"Whenever discussing operant conditioning it helps to speak the same language: These terms can form four different combinations  (N.B.: Examples in brackets are examples, not advice!): In practice, these can get muddled. For example, you making noise with the box is a stimulus designed to decrease the frequency of a behaviour, so it's technically an example of positive punishment, but if you stop the noise once the dog performs the correct behaviour, you also remove a stimulus to increase the frequency of the correct behaviour, hey presto!, negative reinforcement. But that presupposes that there is a correct behaviour for your dog to perform. You don't specify what the undesired behaviour is, or if there is a desired alternative behaviour that you are trying to reinforce. If all you do with the noise is trying to stop him doing something, then you are providing punishment rather than negative reinforcement. In either case, part of your problem is probably that you are only using primary reinforcers and punishers, i.e. ones that the dog doesn't need to learn. Food, for example, is a primary reinforcer. The dog knows food is a good thing without having to learn it. By extension, the noise is a primary punisher, as it is uncomfortable for the dog to hear. Secondary reinforcers and punishers, by contrast, are those that the dog has learned.  The classic example is Pavlov's bell that he would ring everytime he provided the dog with food. By consistently pairing a primary reinforcer with a stimulus, the stimulus can start to act as a secondary reinforcer. That is, the dog learns that the bell signals the arrival of food and will react accordingly.  You mention that you use the word ""no"" (hopefully in a stern voice, dogs are quite adept at discerning intonations) when telling your dog off, along with the noise. The ""no"" should act as a secondary punisher, the same way praise can work as a secondary reinforcer. But you probably failed to phase out the actual noise gradually, by starting to sometimes only say ""no"" but not do the noise. The problem is that, by now, your dog has picked up on the fact that ""no"" with no box around means no primary punisher, i.e. the two are not related, and he, therefore, is save when it's not around. I suggest that you open a new question describing the actual behaviour(s) that you want to discourage, and we might be better able to help you find a way using the whole spectrum of operant condition to get your dog to learn what you want it to do."
Why does my dog sing along to Final Jeopardy?,"Animals learn behaviours through a mechanism called operant conditioning (see this answer for a quick introduction). Basically, a dog will do whatever works, i.e., if performing a behaviour has previously led to good things happening(TM), it will probably try the behaviour again. If good things happen often* when the behaviour is learned and the dog will keep doing it. It is likely that your dog got lots of attention and maybe even praise the first time it did this. If it did it again and you showed your family members what happened, they also paid the dog more attention, thereby rewarding the behaviour until your dog learned to perform it every time. Skinner's pigeons are a great example of the type of behaviours animals learn in response to a reward mechanism they can't figure out. Another great example is this post from cheezburger.com  *The most effective way to train a behaviour is through intermittent reinforcement, i.e. rewarding unpredictably but often enough (think slot machine) rather than all the time (think snack machine)."
Do fish need a dark environment at night?,"Fish do care if it´s day or night: they have a cicardian rhythm and many physiological events are related to the day / night time. Light could interfere with that. Source: this book, chapter 6. Even blind fish can have a cicardian rhythm Leaving the aquarium light accidentally lit for one night won´t instantly kill them but will cause some stress."
How can I prevent my dog from digging in furniture?,"Dogs are social animals and they always love company. Without company, they want something to do, digging can be one of them. To control this, using a polite way is the best, by distracting him from acting those things. Like if you see your dog digging, distract him by giving him some toys or play with him etc. Giving him more of your company will be better. Losing a mate can be a reason for this behavior. "
What does this cat want from me when meowing accusingly?,"Odds are, the cat's as wary of you as you are of her. She wants to know if she can trust you. These cautious approaches are very typical, and you're handling it very well. As she starts to get more comfortable with you, she'll stick around longer for more attention. Not chasing after her or holding her in your lap when she wants to go are very good things, as she knows that she can get attention from you when she wants and also leave when she wants. From the video you included, I'd say you have nothing to worry about. She clearly likes the attention you're giving her. She just wants to have it on her terms."
Should my cat be allowed some wet food every day?,"Well first, bear in mind that a cats natural diet is carnivorous and that type of diet is seldom dried pellets. :) In general, dry and wet food options are, these days, quite on par in terms of nutritional quality. In the past, there could be complications from some varieties of foods containing high quantities of ash that could lead to kidney failure (we lost a cat as a consequence of that), but good quality food sources these days have removed that risk. In any event, why you might want to feed wet foods: Why you might want to feed dry foods: I've found no evidence to suggest that there's any adverse issues with feeding both forms of food to your cats as a part of a regular diet and it can be recommended (link) in some cases.  In general, assuming that they're not overeating and becoming obese, you can get the benefits of both forms of food if the cats are happy to eat them.  I would, however, make every effort to prevent sharing of food if you're still medicating. As with humans, sharing meds is not a good thing to be doing or to allow to happen."
How can I train my cat to not jump on the kitchen counters?,"One option for ""punishing"" cats that works with some of them is to get a water spray bottle. You then spray them with it when they jump up on something you don't want them on. Please be sure to use a bottle that is just for water and never had any chemicals in it (could be harmful to them since it could get into their eyes and cats lick themselves a lot) "
Stepped on my kitten's paw,"The way to see if the injury is serious is to observe your cat for a couple of hours: if your cat is still limping and tries to avoid using the paw when she walks, you can start thinking about taking her to the vet. If the paw starts to swell, it is time to call your vet. You are saying ""kitten"" in your question, so I am assuming she is only a few months old. The bones in a growing kitten are flexible, so they do not break easily. If your cat can walk on the paw and is not limping after a couple of hours, you can assume that she will be fine. You can examine your cat yourself by taking a firm grip on the paw that you think might be injured and if your cat shows signs of pain or cry, you need to take her to the vet to get her examined. By a firm grip on the paw I mean just taking the paw in your hand and give it a little squeeze, like when you grab your own finger. Try not to worry, most of us cat owners have stepped on our cats paw at least once and injury to the cats paw is not very common, at least when it comes to fractures. Soft tissue injury will heal in a couple of days, so again, try not to worry."
Why don't fish grow to their full size in a small tank?,"Fish excrete hormones in their waste. In a confined space like an aquarium, these hormones build up and act as growth inhibitors, this is basically an evolutionary mechanism, to prevent fish from dying if they end up in a water system that is cutoff from continuous fresh water. The larger the fish, the more space and continuously replenished clean water they need for survival. Fish do not ""grow to the size of their tank"", as is often quoted, they are basically poisoned by their own waste which prohibits them from reaching their potential in a poorly sized or cared for environment."
How can I prevent my cat from chewing up the carpet?,"Some cats are horizontal scratchers instead of vertical ones, they like pulling and yanking at carpet and stuff rather than, say, a couch or something, if they don't have something appropriate. You can get scratchers that are just corrugated cardboard stuck together in flatter box shapes that you set on the floor - I had a cat who was determined to yank up all my carpets, and then I gave him something like this, and he stopped trying to pull my carpet up, and chewed and scratched on the cardboard thing instead. If it isn't a scratching need, then you might want to try putting pepper (cayenne or black pepper, I have used both) in the area you want to keep him out of, like along the seams. I do this to keep my cat out of plants and other places, and it works pretty well. Also lemon juice or vinegar also work, although make sure they won't damage your carpet.  You could also get a small rug and try to train him to only pull at that one, but I have never  really gotten it to work (although other people apparently have.) There are commercial sprays you can use, that claim to keep cats from scratching at things, but I can't speak to how well they work. It also might be a boredom thing, or an attention seeking behaviour, and he might just want more active playtime, and there are a large variety of toys and things you can get to help with this. Also, I found some cats responds better to a noise deterrent than being sprayed with water - for one cat I had, I used a can/jar with rocks in it and shook it right near him when he was doing stuff I didn't like, and it worked well. "
Encourage rescue cat to sit in lap,"I adopted a young adult female cat (estimated to be 2 years old at the time) from the street, probably a dumped pet (not feral).  She was very skittish at first and never did sit in my lap in the following 14 years, but gradually over time she got comfortable sitting next to me.  I've adopted other adult cats who were sitting in my lap within weeks (or days), so it's not a kitten-versus-adult thing.  Every cat is an individual with its own background, and when we adopt we usually don't have any clues about that background. With my reluctant cat I found that the worst thing to do was to pick her up and put her in my lap (or even just hold her).  Picking her up triggered an ""aiiieee! I'm not in control! Run away!"" reaction.  I sometimes sat down next to her (if she was, say, lounging on the couch); I moved slowly and avoided any sudden movement or noise, and that allowed me to sit next to her and pet her.  Eventually she started coming to sit next to me, which I rewarded if I could (I kept a bag of treats near my favorite chair for a while).  I also pet her gently when she did this, just as I did if I sat next to her. This is a long, slow process that is based on building trust.  Anything you do to alarm your cat will set you back.  Some cats may never sit in your lap, but others will eventually.  Take it on your cat's terms."

Cats making a mess with litter,You can get a drip pan for under a car at the auto parts store for about $10(US) it is about 24 inches by 36 inches.  Place towel over it to provide traction and absorption for the cat getting in and to catch anything trying to leave.  You may want to use a layer of anti-slip cabinet lining between the drip tray and the towel.  Place the litter box on the tray/towel combination to encourage the cat to take the longest trip on towel practical.  We use a similar solution for bunnies as seen in this picture.   Note the pictured solution is for a rabbit.  Rabbits require hay 24/7 and they do not have a tendency to jump on tables. So the hay tied to the table legs would not be part of a cat solution. 
What is the maximum proportion of fish per liter in an aquarium?,"When determining the capacity of an aquarium, it is common to look at total fish length rather than number of fish.  The idea is that bigger fish need more room.  The rule-of-thumb I've always used for freshwater tropical fish is 1 inch of fish length per gallon of water (or about 25 mm of fish length per 4 liters).  However, this can vary greatly based on the species of fish.  Some fish need more room than others."
What's the least painful way to euthanize a fish?,"Depending on the size and temperature limitations of the species, there are several ways approved by the American Veterinary Medical Association.  One-step process of immersions (intentional overdose via immersion) in easily obtained (for hobbyist) solution includes: It is important to note a concentration of 95% ethanol is humane and CO2 saturated water should be saturated from pure sources, such as CO2 canisters. My preferred method is clove oil as it is cheap and painless. It acts as an anesthetic to the fish. I remove the fish from the tank and place it in an easily cleaned or thrown out container of tank water. I take another container (usually a pill bottle) and put 3–5 drops (for fish up to 4 inches / 10 cm in length) of clove oil along with tank water and shake until the water is milky. Then I add this slowly (while stirring) to the container the fish is in. The fish will slowly go to sleep and will flip over and float upside down. This is just the fish being knocked out. I then mix another concentrated bottle of clove oil with water and add that to the container which causes the fish to die. Depending on the size of the fish, adjust the concentration. I leave the fish for about 10 minutes and then check for gill movement. I've had pretty decent success with this method with a very low percentage of fish showing any signs of distress. I keep clove oil on hand. If you don't have access to these methods, there are physical methods described in the AVMA Euthanasia Guide."
Is it healthy for a cat to regularly eat cheese?,"While kittens generally can handle dairy products, adult cats usually can't. Feeding cats dairy products can lead to digestive issues resulting in diarrhea or vomiting. Simply stopping giving into the kittens demands would most likely stop this behavior as the cat will learn that their meowing doesn't result in a reward.

Is corn based food bad for my dog?,"The subject of corn and grain based dog food is one that is contentious and subject to a lot of debate.  Numerous studies have been done on this subject and many heated opinions exist on this. Many veterinarians believe in corn based dog food and how it is highly digestible and contains many health benefits for a dog. http://avetsguidetolife.blogspot.com/2013/04/corn-in-foodno-its-not-bad.html Here is an excerpt from a dog food company that sells corn based dog food that claims that ""Cornphobia"" is a scare tactic marketing campaign pioneered by luxury dog food manufacturers. Some of the first dog food companies that thrived were Science Diet, Iams, Eukanuba and Purina; that was some pretty stiff competition! A common denominator to their dog food formula was corn. The popular marketing game of ""they have it and we do not"" began the gloomy demonizing of corn. http://www.kumpi.com/corn.php On the opposing side here is another vet that speaks vocally against corn based diets in dog food on his blog. I argued against the notions put forth by nutritionists interviewed for a veterinary news magazine article that 1) ingredients in pet food aren’t important, 2) that dogs require grain-based fiber to be healthy, and 3) that dogs are omnivores (they are scavenging carnivores). I also pointed out that many veterinary nutritionists have financial ties to some of the largest pet food manufacturers in the world. http://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2013/01/02/veterinary-nutritionists-favor-commercial-food.aspx The fact of the matter is that there are veterinarians on both sides of the debate both making claims of financial bias by the others.  Well then what about studies?  There are many studies done on the subject and most of these are funded by the very industry groups that would stand to benefit or lose greatly by the findings of such studies.  Few long term studies have been done on the long term effects that such a diet can cause. Without being able to find an official study on corn based diets and weight, I will only share my personal experiences and what I have witnessed.  I do not feed my dog corn based food, and he is the most fit and athletic basset hound that I and universally all of my friends with basset hounds have seen.  The vet regularly complements me on having a basset hound that is a healthy weight and how unusual it is for this breed that is typically prone to being overweight or obese. I have never known an overweight dog that was on a non-corn diet.  Every overweight dog I know of ate cheap corn based dog food. This is not a study and there clearly might be a correlation between the much higher price of non corn based dog food and the tendency for more educated consumers with more spending money to purchase said food."
Where did my danio fish mysteriously disappear to?,"It is actually not uncommon for fish to disappear, seemingly without a trace.  It has happened to me a few times.  Sometimes you eventually find out what happened, sometimes you don't.  There are several things that could have happened to it.  Each of these things has happened to my fish at some point in the past. It might be hiding.  Some fish are really good at this.  We had a kuhli loach that was very good at hiding in the gravel.  One time we didn't see him for a week, and we thought sure he was gone, and then one day he was swimming around the tank again. It could have jumped out.  Even if you have a cover on, if there is a small gap around the filter or heater cord, a fish can jump through it.  We had a glass bloodfin tetra that disappeared, and we eventually found it on the floor underneath a book rack next to the tank. When a fish dies, often other fish will eat it very quickly.  This can happen fast (a matter of hours).  It doesn't mean that you have aggressive fish, it just means that once your fish dies, the others see it as food.  They are fish, that's what they do.  This is probably the most likely scenario in your situation. On the other hand, the fish might be the victim of an aggressive fish.  This is always a possibility, even if the fish are supposed to be peaceful, and there isn't a big size mismatch.  We had a molly that, for whatever reason, always attacked any other molly in the same tank."
"As a complete novice, what costs should I plan for when adopting a shelter cat?","Any specific cost figures will be (a) localized and (b) out of date eventually, so I'll address categories more broadly. Adoption costs: The shelter sets a fee for this, sometimes reducing it for older animals.  At least in the US, but I suspect most other places too, the cat will come microchipped, spayed/neutered, and current on vaccines. Even though the cat is current on vaccines, it's a good idea to take it to a vet for an initial checkup soon after adoption.  The shelter I used required this within two weeks.  See ""vet"" below. Food: This depends on what you feed, both type and brand, of course.  To estimate this, look at packages in the store, using the feeding instructions and package size to work out cost/day.  Then do the math.  My two adult cats go through about a pound of dry food a week (together) plus about 10 cans; your mileage may vary. In addition to food you will probably want to keep treats on hand.  This is a minor addition to the food bill. Litterboxes and litter: The conventional advice seems to be to have one litterbox per cat plus one more.  The box is a one-time expense.  The initial filling of litter is more expensive; after that you just need to top off to replace what you scoop out.  I go though a 20-pound jug of litter every couple weeks, I think (for two cats). For both food and litter, you can also ask the shelter for advice on rate of consumption.  They have data; I have anecdotes. :-) Routine vet visits: Plan for an annual checkup and vaccines (twice-annual later in life).  A vet can give you prices for this over the phone.  Prices vary. Non-routine medical care: As with people, sometimes stuff happens -- pets get sick, or have accidents, or some emergency comes up.  As cats get older the likelihood of conditions requiring medical attention rises.  You're adopting a cat for its lifetime, not just its good years, so do plan on this.  Unfortunately this is hard to predict; some cats may be fine with regular checkups and others may need a lot more.  Once cats reach about ten years old, in my experience vets start recommending twice-annual checkups (no longer just annual) and at-least-annual bloodwork (CBC screen or the like).  The latter helps to detect problems like kidney disease or liver disease. Supplies: You'll want to have a variety of toys (stuffed toys, string toys, balls, etc) on hand.  Different cats prefer different types, so don't buy a lot until you find out what your cat likes.  These aren't that expensive, and some you can make yourself if you're inclined.  Over time they get destroyed and you replace them. It's important to have things to scratch.  Some cats prefer to scratch vertically (scratching posts) and others horizontally (cardboard scratching pads).  Don't skimp on a cheap, short scratching post; the cat needs to be able to stretch out.  I've found that the ones with sisal rope get more use than the carpet-covered ones, but I don't know if that's common or just my cats.  I get about a year out of the cardboard ones before I have to replace them. Some cats like beds, cat trees, padded window seats, and the like, and others completely ignore them and sleep on your couch (or your bed, or you if you let them).  Among the cats I know, the ""doughnut"" beds seem to be the most popular of these items. Grooming: Nail clippers, a good brush, and a flea comb are essential. Carrier: You will need a carrier to transport your cat safely (e.g. to the vet). Pet-sitting: Cats are creatures of habit so it's much better to have somebody come into your house than for you to board the cat when you travel.  Pet-sitters are probably listed in the phone listings, and if your vet offers a bulletin board for ads, business cards, etc you'll find many options there.  Prices vary, so shop around.  Personally, I prefer to trade cat-sitting services with friends who also have cats; that way I know the people who are coming into my home and all the cats get to know the people involved. Household wear and tear: Some things are going to get scratched, knocked over, or occasionally soiled.  It happens.  For the last, the right cleaning products applied promptly should fix it up."
Why does my cat hold its mouth slightly open sometimes after smelling something?,"This would be the Flehmen response: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flehmen_response Many animals will do this to move air over a specialized scent gland which is used to identify pheromones for reproductive and communication purposes. Our cats will do it for anything they think smells interesting, usually before they go to investigate more closely."
How can I teach my dog to walk on slippery floors?,"We had this problem with both of our Labrador Retrievers when they were young, but fortunately we didn't have much wood except in 2 rooms that they rarely visited.  What was even more confusing is they didn't have any problems with the tile or vinyl flooring, just the wood.  And they would usually walk into the room just fine, but leaving was another problem. When they did venture into those rooms, they would get themselves stranded on the area rug in the middle of the room and would stand there trying to figure out how to get out without stepping on the floor, and their solution would usually involve trying to jump to the surface they were more comfortable with.  but since the span was usually too far to jump, it would usually end up with them landing on the wood and result in a crash landing, which would make them more nervous on the floor and eventually would leave them barking from the room when they were stuck. So what worked for us was encouraging them to walk across the floor with us nearby.   This was not a quick process (I think it took 3-6 months for each of them), but we'd only do it a few times each session a couple of times a week.  We also tried to end on a success so we cut a few session short if they had a couple of positive results in a row."
Should my cat follow daylight savings?,"According to various pet behaviourists, dogs' Circadian rhythms are generally set around the amount of daylight rather than time, as they lack the ability to differentiate between say, 6 PM and 7 PM the way humans do. This is mitigated some by the artificial light cycles (you turning lights on and off, etc) in your home.  Your pet might notice the change and will likely take a bit to adjust, but generally they do adjust to the differences (in daylight, timing, etc.) which come with Daylight Savings time.  If you like, you can choose to slowly adjust the pet's schedule, but generally the pet should be okay with the time change. Like humans, pets will need time to adjust, but they generally figure it out. "
What do I need to know before adopting an FIV-positive cat?,With the caveat that I don't have a huge amount of experience in this area:
Are chicken bones dangerous for dogs?,"Cooked bones can be dangerous for dogs or cats. The cooking dries them out and makes them more likely to splinter. I've been advised by vets to give dogs and cats raw bones, never cooked. The size of the dog would make a difference, too - a large dog is much more likely to gulp down a chicken bone whole and have it lodge somewhere it shouldn't, where a small dog wouldn't have that issue. "
Does leaving wet pet food at room temperature for 12+ hours pose a risk for your cat?,"I would not suggest leaving wet cat food out for more than an hour or two tops. Wet cat food at room temperature is a perfect environment for bacteria cultures, which can grow quite quickly and may pose a threat to the animal. If the kitten consistently eats about half a can when you put it out, then I would only put out half a can. The other half can be safely stored in an airtight container or Ziploc bag in the refrigerator and be served later in the day or the next day."
Why does my cat come to me when I'm sitting on the toilet?,"It is one of the most common behaviour in cats. Cats normally do not just follow you to the bathroom, they usually follow their human companion to everywhere. But cats following us to the bathroom is more noticeable, hence the confirmation bias. Cats following humans can be due to a variety of reasons. They might be spooked by something you can't see or hear, they might want food (my cat's favourite reason to follow me to the bathroom), they might want pets, they might be curious or in some rare cases, they might think that you are vulnerable with your pants down so they might want to protect you. I observed that most cats have a daily routine. They go to sleep at similar hours, demand food or pets at similar hours etc. Your bathroom schedule might have synchronised with your cats' petting schedule so that might be why they are following you. One more thing, cats also learn from other cats, so one of them might just be following you because the other one is."
Is it safe for a cat to be with a Covid patient?,"TLDR: Not really. While the risk is low, COVID-19 seems to be fairly indiscriminate, with documented cases of dogs, cats, zoo otters and farmed minks getting it. Most corona virus (There's a whole family of similar viruses like SARS and MERS) outbreaks are pretty certainly zoonotic (they come from animals in the first place), so extra caution is a good idea. The CDC advises you don't, and interestingly advises safe distancing for animals: Keep cats indoors when possible and do not let them roam freely outside. Walk dogs on a leash at least 6 feet away from others to protect them from interacting with people outside the household. They also indicate that the symptoms are at worst mild, or affected animals may be asymptomatic. Pets infected with this virus may or may not get sick. Pets that do have symptoms usually have mild illness that can be taken care of at home. Which of course leads to the possibility of it being spread via your pet to other people and animals. The Mayo clinic concurs, advising: Isolate yourself from everyone else, including your pet. If possible, have another person in your household care for your pet. Essentially, please treat any mammalian pet as at risk of contracting COVID-19. While you love your cat, waiting for the necessary time is both for your safety as well as for your cat."
"Should cats eat ""huge"" animals?","Meat is meat. All cats have roughly the same digestive system and metabolism, so their choice of prey is more about size than nutrition. It needs to be a large enough meal to justify the effort of hunting it yet small enough they're likely to be successful. A large enough pride of lions can take down enormous prey like buffalo, giraffe or even elephant. Solo lions, tigers, jaguars, leopards and cheetahs easily take down antelope, pigs and similar sized prey. Your housecat would enjoy all of those huge meals too, but he simply couldn't catch them and knows that even trying would likely result in his own death. On the other hand, your housecat will happily hunt rodents, birds, and other small prey that the larger cats lazily ignore as not worth the effort. Each has their own place in the ecosystem."
Should a puppy with its first vaccinations meet a dog that’s not fully vaccinated?,"You need to wait 2 weeks after the final vaccination to allow your puppy to mix with dogs that haven't been fully vaccinated. For socialisation it's good to find dogs who have been fully vaccinated or other puppies that are similar age and are also starting their vaccinations. For yearly boosters, it would depend when the dog had its last yearly booster. Some vaccinations provide immunity for a lifetime, or many years. Kennel cough is the main concern for dogs that are not having booster shots. It's impossible to know if the dog is immune or not without a titre test. Also the puppy does have some immunity with the commencement of their vaccinations. You could always ask them to get the dog's booster vaccinations. Or one for Kennel cough. Unless or course the other dog doesn't go into public places or have other dogs visiting. In which case it's unlikely the dog would have any disease. To be on the absolute safe side, it would be better to keep them separated. Some reading: https://www.innersouthvets.com.au/dog-vaccinations-annual-or-three-yearly/ You might have read about the changes to canine vaccinations in the media over the past few years. Research has emerged that the core vaccinations against parvo, distemper and hepatitis viruses (C3) may not need to be given annually as previously thought. Once the dogs are adults a booster vaccination every three years for parvo, distemper and hepatitis viruses may be sufficient to protect your pet. (This is NOT the case for Kennel Cough vaccination however). This is quite similar to the changes that we see to human vaccination schedules from time to time. As science evolves, so too do the schedules recommended to protect our beloved canine family members! When can I take my puppy outside? Vets recommend waiting until one to two weeks after your puppy’s last vaccination booster – usually at around 14–16 weeks of age – before introducing them to the wonders of local parks, beaches and walking trails. and Start by introducing your puppy to known ‘safe’ dogs – dogs that you know have a good temperament and that have been fully vaccinated. It’s best to do this in a safe environment such as your backyard. You can also try socialising your puppy by introducing them to lots of different people and by giving puppy school a whirl. Puppy and dog vaccination schedules and vaccination costs Over the last decade there has been increasing debate about the over-vaccination of pets. Depending on the vaccine used and the individual animal, immunity can last significantly longer than 12 months. Some pet owners worry about vaccinating their pet whilst its immunisation is still sufficient. If you are concerned about this, and would like to test if your dog’s immunisation is still sufficient, an antibody titre test may be an option to consider. In this process, a small amount of blood is taken from your pet and a laboratory test is used to determine the level of antibodies in your dog’s body. Still Vaccinating Your Pet Every Year? ""We know that for [canine] distemper and parvo, for example, the immunity lasts a minimum of five years, probably seven to nine years, and for some individuals for a lifetime,” says veterinarian Jean Dodds, founder of Hemopet, the first nonprofit national blood bank program for animals, located in Santa Monica, Calif. “For cats, so far we have challenge data out nine years showing that immunity is still protective,"" says Dodds. And with rabies vaccine, new data indicate the immunity lasts for at least seven years, she says."
Why do cats hate riding in cars?,"Anecdotally, I have to first say that not all cats hate riding in the car.  I've known at least one cat that was perfectly content to ride in the car.  This cat started as a kitten going for rides to all sorts of different places, which is probably directly relevant to what follows in this answer. I believe that the main difference between cats and dogs in this regard involves differences in how the two species remember information. While I was unable to find specific research covering this, my own experiences and some insufficiently referenced articles indicate that cats have the potential for some degree of long-term memory that works in a fashion fundamentally similar to humans. Dogs, on the other hand, seem to have generally less ability to remember specific things or events. Perhaps most relevant, though, is that cats have significantly better retention, both short-term and long-term, than dogs: Researchers have discovered that there is not much difference between how a cat, a human, or another animal’s brain utilizes certain cues to assist in the creation of short and long-term memories. A cat’s brain functioning has been compared to that of a two to three year old child and, when compared to a dog, a cat’s memory is almost 200 times more retentive. Without repeated and reinforced training, a dog’s memory span is about 5 minutes. Cats, on the other hand, averaged about 16 hours, only IF the activity benefited THEM. Source So unless the car ride to the vet, and the wait to actually see the vet, is less than 5 minutes, your dog probably forgot the series of events of: In particular, #4 generally provides a lot of distractions to a dog, such as a novel environment filled with new smells, or a variety of other pets also waiting. Cats, on the other hand, seem to recall quite well that step 1, get into the cage, most likely leads to step 6, get poked, prodded, and possibly stabbed with one or more needles. Certainly some dogs can, and do, form an association with car rides and going to the vet, but for most dogs a trip to the vet seems to be less frightening and unpleasant than it is for a cat (a cat is far less likely than a dog to look upon a room full of new smells and strange animals as a positive). Furthermore, dogs are more likely to have travel experiences that don't involve a trip to the vet (e.g. a ride to the dog park, going to a pet-friendly pet store, hiking, hunting, or even on family vacations), and less likely to be confined to a cage during the ride (and of those dogs who do ride in a cage during a car ride, many of them have probably been specifically crate trained). With regards to how you might improve the experience for your cat: You can try to reduce the negative associations your cat already has with being in the car (and probably being put into a carrier prior to the car ride).  It is certainly easier to do this when they're young, before they've formed the negative associations (such as the kitten I mentioned earlier in my anecdote), but you may have some luck by taking your cat on ""joy rides"".   Start by bringing your cat out to the car, and let them explore (closely supervised! You don't want the cat to get wedged under a seat where you can't get them out) the car while it sits parked, with the engine off. Do this every couple of days (or even every day), until the cat seems comfortable in the car. Then progress to short trips around the block. If your cat handles strange animals (particularly dogs) reasonably well, you might eventually try a trip to a pet-friendly pet store, but for most a nice quiet park where they can walk while on a harness would be a better choice. Once your cat becomes accustomed to these pleasant (or at least, not unpleasant) trips, you should (hopefully) see a reduction in anxiety during car trips in general."
Why do cats enjoy playing in cardboard boxes?,"Not being a cat myself makes it hard to speculate about their motives, but my guess is: Cats seem to enjoy nesting an playing in snuggly-cuddly enclosed spaces. Not just cardboard boxes, but also baskets, laundry baskets, etc The insulation properties of the cardboard probably gives it a warm feel, which cats enjoy. Cardboard is easily scratchable and chewable. The flaps are fun to play with, and makes it into a neat hiding place from which one can stalk ones enemies. Our cat was very fond of my mother's wicker baskets, and would exhibit much the same behaviour as you are describing, and would also enjoy the smell of the wood. (BTW, I've also had the opportunity to observe parrots and boxes; for them the appeal seems to be that they are chewable, as well as the intriguing conflict between being scared senseless and being curious about what the new thing is.)"
How can I clean the shell of my tortoise?,"I was afraid of damaging the shell (particularly in the growth regions) by scrubbing at it, so the tortoise's vet recommended using something like baby shampoo. Baby shampoo has had some unfavorable press in the last few years due to additives. However, most of these additives have been removed from the formulations, and it also uses mild surfactants instead of soap. Surfactants are safer than soap to use in the growth regions in between the scutes (plates) of the shell, because these regions can dry out with regular soap, causing cracking and disturbing the natural ""growth rings"". Using a soft cloth or chamois to gently wipe the surface and rinsing the tortoise well to get rid of any residue will remove most of the surface dirt."
My cat has uncontrollable twitching on her back near her tail,"First of all, I would take your cat to the vet to see if there is an obvious diagnosis. Take video of your cat during an episode, and show it to your vet also. It could be helpful for diagnosing your cat. That said, if no other specific cause can be found, your cat could very likely have feline hyperesthesia. While severe cases could lead the cat to self-mutilation, that is not the case for the less severe or more average case. You may see frantic licking, scratching, or biting without actually being at the level of self harm. Or it could be as mild as getting suddenly twitchy, especially the skin on the lower back, and jumping up and running, just like you describe your cat doing. As quoted from https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2018/03/25/feline-hyperesthesia.aspx In kitties with hyperesthesia, the skin on the back ripples from the shoulders all the way to the tail, and sometimes up the tail to the tip. The movement is clearly visible in some cats, but more difficult to see in others. What many pet parents notice instead is the kitty suddenly jumping and turning toward her tail as though something back there is bothering her. This can even happen during sleep. The cat might also try to lick or bite at the area. Kitties with hyperesthesia also have muscle spasms and twitches, and tail twitching. And as regarding self-mutilation: In severe cases of feline hyperesthesia, cats will self-mutilate by biting, licking, chewing and pulling out hair. These poor kitties suffer not only hair loss, but often severe skin lesions and secondary infections from trying to get relief from the uncomfortable sensations they experience. Since if your cat does have hyperesthesia, it appears to be a mild or average case, I think it's more likely your vet will just tell you to try to prevent the cat from having episodes rather than resorting to drugs, although I should note that I am not a vet, so you should take their word above mine. Hyperesthesia is made worse by stress, so minimizing stress will help. Episodes can also be triggered sometimes by touching the cat in certain areas, especially the lower back, so if you observe these episodes are happening after you touch some area of the cat, refrain from touching that area."
How does a cat's personality change by having kittens?,"In my experience and from discussions with vets, spaying a mature female cat tends to ""freeze"" their hormonal balance. A cat who is spayed while in or near season can spend the rest of her life acting as though she's in season. A cat spayed before her first season is effectively still a kitten and remains that way all her life. Cats who are spayed before they have a season tend to be more kittenish in their behavior - more affectionate and more tolerant of other cats (this obviously is also affected by whether the cat tolerates others or not as well as whether she is used to living with other cats - I've found a female cat is more likely to accept a male than another female, for instance, but if they're littermates who grow up together or are introduced as kittens two females can get on fine). Cats who have had kittens are more likely to adopt a very young kitten (and have been known to produce milk for unweaned kittens even if they are not the mother). They are also more likely to develop issues when spayed such as uncontrolled eating (I had one who had this issue) due to the tendency of the hormonal cycle to freeze in place. Every vet I've spoken to prefers to spay before the cat matures because of the higher chance of hormone-related health issues when an adult cat is spayed. That said, every vet I've spoken to would rather spay a queen at any age than not spay at all, because of the number of kittens that could be produced: there's a decent calculation at about.com (http://cats.about.com/od/faqspregnancyandbirth/f/How-Many-Times-Could-My-Cat-Become-Pregnant-In-A-Year.htm)."
My pet snake seems to have some sort of bugs crawling on its face; do I need to worry?,"Yes, these parasitic mites can be a vector for illness because they're effectively feeding on your snake. They're white when young, but will turn dark once they feed and would become easier to see, but they'll also be irritating the snake quite a bit. In the linked article there is some information on treatment, which is basically to bathe the snake and, possibly also oil him. You should also treat the housing area to remove the mites. Some good information on treating your snake can be in this article: Dealing with Snake Mites."
Can I bring my dog or cat on Amtrak?,"As of November 2013, Amtrak does not allow pets on trains (see Amtrak's website).  However, there are bills in Congress which would require Amtrak to change this policy: H.R. 2066: Pets on Trains Act of 2013 and S. 1710: Pets on Trains Act of 2013.  The bills state that Amtrak must designate at least one car (on all trains with two or more cars) for passengers with pets.  The pets must ride in crates at all times and are only permitted on trips that are less than 8 hours.  It also states that Amtrak should charge a fee to pet-carrying passengers that would at least recover the cost of implementing this policy. You can follow the progress of the house bill or the senate bill on govtrack.us.  The site also provides instructions for contacting your congressman about supporting this bill. If you want to go even further, I've created a flyer you can print out and post at your train station, pet store, vet office, or kennel/day care. March 2015 Update The 2016-2019 Amtrak Funding Bill, H.R. 749, includes a provision directing Amtrak to introduce a pilot program allowing pets on certain routes. This bill has passed the house and is on to the Senate. The specifics are similar to what was proposed in H.R. 2066 and can be read in section 210 of the bill's text. The pilot program shall be in effect on the Northeast Corridor and routes less than 750 miles. May 2016 Update Amtrak has unveiled an official pet policy. Pets that are 20lbs or less are allowed on most trains on trips that are 7 hours or less for a fee of $26.  For full details, see Amtrak's official rules."
How should I decide between a collar and a harness for a dog?,"A harness just puts the pressure of the leash around the strongest part of your dog's body. So, while the harness would technically be more comfortable for the dog, it will be less comfortable for you. A harness will help your dog control you better, rather than the control you're looking for.  The long-term solution is to train your dog not to pull on the leash. The ASPCA has lots of good guidance on that. Leash pulling is not necessarily a permanent behavior, regardless of whether you're using a collar or harness. It's possible to train it away, and that's the best solution."
Cat reacts randomly to tail and enters frenzy,"Cats are just like dogs in that they need a lot of exercise. More importantly, they also share the same instinct to kill, except to a much greater degree. I would say that your cat needs one or both of these things to happen:  What I mean by something to kill is a toy or something for it to chew on after some laser chasing or something. If a cat chases after something but can't actually do anything with it, it can build up frustration and aggression."
How can I introduce a cat into a household with dogs?,"Tl;dr - Dogs decide a lot of things solely by how it smells. Let the animals get used to the smells of each others, and keep the dogs calm no matter what the cat does. The long version: I have brought a cat, and then some more cats, to our home where we already had two dogs for several years as our only pets. Every cat was brought in the same way. First the cat was brought in our home in its container letting the dogs take a quick sniff of the container and its inhabitant through the narrow slots, then I took the container and cat in one room and closed the door. Our dogs were quite cool during the brief moment, possibly because the container was in my hands, and our dogs tend to keep their calm better with me than with my wife. Once the cat is in that one room, it was let free by opening the container door. Some cats take longer to come out, some sprint out pretty soon, point is that the cat comes out voluntarily. That's it for a couple of days. The cat will get to know you, and feel safe in the room. It will find food, water, litterbox and normally it will feel at ease soon enough. Depending on the age of the cat, and its personality, this phase could take longer than two days, but two days has been enough for us so far. Next we have taken the cat into livingroom in my wife's lap, in such a moment when the cat has recently eaten and is calm, sleepy even. Gone to sit in a sofa with the cat in her lap, so that our dogs can come close and sniff the cat. (Our dogs are not allowed on the sofa, they stay on the floor.) My wife holds the cat so that it can't see the dogs, but dogs see the cat, or at least its rear end. If dogs become excited, I'll take them into another room and leave them there. Goal here is to let them get the smell of the cat, and to see it protected by a human member of our family. We let the dogs sniff the cat as much as they like, just as long as they do it nicely and stay calm. Repeat step 3. a few times, a couple of times a day or even more. This is to see how the dogs react, and as soon as they are cool with seeing the cat then my wife has started letting the cat see the dogs too, and perhaps even let it move with some freedom on her and on the back-rest of the sofa. Kittens are nice in this phase, adult cats might be more eager to seek a hiding place. We have returned the cat into its room once it starts to turn playful or my wife gets tired to hold the sleepy cat. While the cat is in livingroom with my wife, I let the dogs in the room the cat has for itself. I only remove the food first, then the dogs may sniff around as much as they wish, drink the cat's water if they like, just as long as they want and stay calm. If they get excited, it's the penalty room again for them (never a long penalty, just for the moment while the cat is still in livingroom with my wife). The better the dogs behave, the faster the cat is let more freedom to explore the livingroom. With our cats and dogs this phase has come in less than five days, but I'd guess this is because we've been bringing kittens in house. It may take a lot longer with adult cats, but I've never done that (yet). Later, when the cat is fully accustomed to its new home, we have still needed to keep an eye when our dogs are eager to take part, or to shepherd, the cat when it is playing. We discourage the dogs to take part in the play. At the moment we have five cats and sometimes they play quite roughly by themselves. Our dogs tend to ""go looking"" when a cat is complaining over too rough play. We just tell the dogs to let the cats be, and that's it. I can see the dogs would still like to go and see what's bothering the cats. Maybe they do it while we are away, however I can tell the cats don't just stay up on their platforms when we are away, there's always clear signs of cats having been playing around the house when we come home :)  This has actually been the easy way, when our cats have come in as kittens and our dogs have been more than three years old. Younger dogs can be very different, for they are still ""teenagers"" and have lots of extra energy, and an older cat can be a handful as well."
Why is adding hay to a rabbit's diet important?,"Rabbits need to be feed hay and grass daily. It needs to be the basis of a healthy diet.  It is important for:   Dental health  Digestion  Rabbits have two processes of digesting. The fibre is vital to stimulate the rabbit's highly specialized digestive system. Hay and grass, this coarse type of roughage is digested in the cecum (a part of the rabbit's large intestine) that partially digest the hay, which is then expelled as a specialized pellet called a cecotrope. This partially digested hay, or cecotrope is then ingested by the rabbit, where further nutrients can be absorbed.  Without this source of fibre, rabbits are prone to diarrhea and motility disorders, because the peristalsis (movement) of the gut is not stimulated enough, so it causes digested food to rot. A diet high in sugar will also promote the growth of bacteria in a sluggish bowel. This in turn can interfere with absorption of nutrients. A sluggish bowel, can also lead to loss of appetite and thirst, resulting in dehydration and weight loss. This decreases the production of cecotropes, lowers the rabbit's well being, as it's nutritional needs are not being met. Hairballs aka wool block  Maintaining healthy motility of a rabbit's gut is also necessary for the rabbit to pass hairballs. With a sluggish bowel, hairballs can remain in the rabbit's stomach, where, hastened by the increasing dehydration of the rabbit, the hairball hardens, creating the rabbit to feel bloated and full, further decreasing appetite, thirst, increasing dehydration, weight loss and this destructive cycle continues. The best remedy to relieve a rabbit's unpassable hairballs is to offer the rabbit a diet only of fresh green hay with plenty of fresh water on hand. It takes three days for a rabbit to create more fecal matter. This is the best treatment for hairballs in rabbits and it is rare that a rabbit will require surgery, if offered a diet like this.  The following picture gives a great visual idea of how much hay is needed in a rabbit's diet.  image subject to copyright and courtesy of San Diego House Rabbit Society sandieograbbits.org References: University of California

Why do dogs lean against you?,"The issue of the reason for dogs leaning on owners is quite conflicting. As you said, some people believe that it is a sign of dominance but from personal experience and some research, I believe your dog will lean on you for affection, to get your attention . My dog leans on me mostly when he wants something. Like, to play fetch, remind me it is time for me to feed him, etc. This absolutely is not dominance, he is just trying to get my attention. But not a single person brought up the fact that many dogs will lean on their owners for security. They will lean on their owners because they are shy, fearful or insecure. They are not trying to dominate their owners. They are trying to feel safe. Nine times out of 10, when dogs lean on us they really are just seeking attention. (1) The best way to react to this is not to pet the dog because this will not build his confidence rather it will make him more timid and shy. It’s easy to nurture a small dog’s fear by carrying him around and telling him “It’s OK. It’s OK, baby.” But this will not help the dog build any confidence. Instead, the owner should place the dog on the ground and slowly help him understand that nothing bad happens in new situations. The owner should ignore the dog or move away when he frantically paws at her legs to get back up. She should give him a treat or pick him up only when he is calm or if the situation is truly unsafe for the little guy. (1) I'll say is not bad for your dog to lean on you as long as you understand your dog so as to take the appropriate actions. When your dog is leaning for affection, It is best to pet him and show the affection he wants but when your dog is leaning for security or because he is scared, It is better to help him build up his confidence.

How often and long should I walk my puppy?,"Your puppy is still quite young so over-exercise is not good for him at this stage Depending slightly on the breed, a puppy's skeleton doesn't fully mature, and the growth plates do not fuse until the puppy is 18 months old or older. The growth plates, which are part of the bone structure, typically fuse during the puppy's tenth month, but after that the skeleton continues changing as the bones adapt to the various kinds of stress put on them. The skeleton is not fully formed and bones are not hardened until 18 months or later. Before the growth plates close, too much exercise can jar and loosen little joints, and cause stress to the skeleton, which can cause permanent damage including elbow and hip dysplasia, joint problems, and growth abnormalities in the cartilage that can cause pain and lameness. (Source :  How Far and How Long Should You Walk Your Puppy?) The distance and time your puppy should walk for,  varies according to the breed. So it is advisable you always watch your dog whenever you take him on a walk and try to notice when he is tired probably when his speed reduces, etc. When you notice he is tired, Stop the walk in order not to Over-exercise him. However, as pointed out by My dog's life, There is a 5 minute rule which is basically 5 minutes walk per day, per month of your puppy’s life, so therefore a 3 month old puppy can be walked for 15 minutes and a 4 month old puppy for 20 minutes, which is a guideline but as an owner make your own judgement on your puppies needs as each puppy is different. It is important to walk your puppy each day to help with training, plus during a walk he/she will gain social skills, mental stimulation and physical exercise.  As your puppy grows you can extend the time of each walk and remember to go on different walks with new surrounding and scents which will be more stimulating for your puppy, plus more enjoyable for you as you will meet new dog walkers during your walk. In addition, when you want to take him for a walk, it is advisable you go to a clean environment free of dirt, dog poop, etc. Also you can take along with you a pedometer so that you can measure the amount of steps your puppy took before he grew tired. Then you can apply this to your other walks."
How to get cats to coexist in peace?,"Generally, when introducing mature cats to a each other, it's a good idea to put them in adjoining rooms, where they can sniff and hear each other from under the door. It gives them a chance to become familiar with each other, without feeling threatened. The door would then be opened and they would be allowed to be in the same room, but under supervision. Depending on how this went, they would either be separate into the adjoining rooms for another day and the process would be repeated until they were both relaxed enough to be in the same room without any hissing. This process can take a number of days (sometimes longer, depending on the cats). So I would recommend doing this, or just keeping them separated for the duration, without introducing them at all. Given there is only another week and they may not meet up for another year, any work that you achieve now will have to be repeated next year from the beginning. "
Why does my dog act differently outside the house?,"Behaviour in and out of home: Dogs are pack animals and when they're at home, they are safely in the den. The home environment becomes predictable and even boring for dogs, so coupled with this feeling of safety the lack of stimulation leads to some dogs lazing around the house (which is not a bad thing). When they are out and about, the environment is new and stimulating. There are many potential threats, and dog's, generally, feel it's their duty to protect their people, not just themselves, so there's a lot going on for your dog.  The behaviour you describe is not of fear, but the alertness and protectiveness of an alpha dog. Walking in front of you is an assertion of his authority as the leader (which may or may not be a problem). He walks with almost his entire weight over his front paws; ...  he has his ears up and tail stiff ...  he will lunge at basically any moving object ... He pulls on the leash, and essentially refuses to walk anywhere except in front of me.  Dogs communicate with other dogs by marking their territory. They enjoy discovering new smells and cocking the leg is like leaving a calling card for other dogs. He smells and urinates on everything, often kicking dirt when he's done. Most animals react to eye contact, particularly if you are staring close to his face, he will aver his eyes to avoid confrontation with you. By ignoring you he is challenging your authority over you, by avoiding your gaze he is actually submitting to you in that instance (which is good). He completely ignores me, so badly that even if I grab him by the snout and point his face at me, he keeps his eyes glancing sideways The first steps: The way to overcome this is to reassert your position as leader of the pack, your dog needs to know he is the lowest member of the family pack (last after all the humans). This can be done with a number of simple techniques within the home to begin with. The family should sit and eat their main meal and finish before feeding the dog. The dog should never be allowed titbits from the table.
Lower pack members eat last. Highest ranking pack members have the, literally, highest places to bed and the lower the pack member the further it's position from the pack leader. Ensure any family members bedrooms are between you and your dog's bed. Same principle as above, the dog cannot share the same privileges as other family members. This may sound harsh but with a pitbull cross he is a naturally dominant dog. I love large dogs and have owned a rottweiler and dobermanns. With these breeds, it is vital to retain the position of pack leader."
How can we make putting one of our two dogs to sleep easier on the remaining dog?,"We had two rescue kittens, a brother and sister. The sister went missing (she fell off the balcony and later died). Her brother would go onto the balcony day after day meowing for her. It was really sad. If the dog attends while the vet does the procedure, it cannot process this situation. It is a human being coming in and doing something to the dog and the dog dying. There is nothing to be gained from it, from this aspect. You don't want your dog to have a bad association with the vet. Even if the dog was to attend after the procedure, there would be the smell of the vet and chemicals, and it wouldn't be a good association. So how to reconcile the dogs need for loss, without causing a bad association with human beings? I would suggest having the dog taken from the house and it done at the Vet's practice. The dog will grieve (as our cat did), but will eventually accept that the other dog is not returning. I would suggest then giving the surviving dog more attention and affection in the proceeding months. This is my advice, and I don't believe there is a definitively best way to proceed with this."
Why is my dog eating dirt?,"If your food is giving your dog the complete nutrition they need, and they don't have anything else wrong with them, it can be either from boredom, from some sort of stomach upset (which is rare), or part of a range of compulsive behaviours (excessive grooming, licking, etc), or they just might like the taste of the dirt for whatever reason, usually due to ingredients in the fertilizer or the plants around the area, and so on. It is relatively common for dogs to eat dirt, but it can pose some problems. If they are eating a lot of it, it can be bad for their teeth and stomach, as well as increase their risk of picking up parasites and the like, as you mentioned. If you are concerned about the behaviour, you can try checking with your vet to make sure there isn't any other condition that is causing the dirt eating. Some occasional dirt eating is common and not a concern, however. You might consider changing their food if it is mineral deficient, or engaging in active play with them if they seem bored, but in general, if it is a cause for concern, contacting your vet is likely best. "
Should I let my cat go outside?,"If I were in your shoes, I would not let the cat go outside. It is just my personal opinion based on safety, though - and I'm saying this as a person who thinks that indoor cats are indeed missing an important, but non-essential aspect of their lives. Also, I tend to get deeply bonded with all the pets I'm taking care for, maybe too much, or maybe not - thus my opinion is naturally biased towards sacrificing their freedom for safety in such dilemmas. My main concern is the fact that indoor cats, on average, have a lifespan of around 16 years - while outdoor cats of only around 4 years (please see the references included at the footnote for sources). I will paraphrase what a wise person once said, in your context: a child denied of going for a meal in a fast-food restaurant, and given broccoli instead, would also act like it is genuinely hurt, trying to make the parents feel bad, sometimes also making them not being able to stand it and give up - but this is actually bad for the child itself, and so is in my consideration letting your cat outside in this situation. I think it is okay and even preferred to let your cat outside if you are living in a village, especially if there are no wild predators like coyotes, etc. where you live - but city presents just too much potential hazards in my opinion. High density of traffic, high density of people (and not all people like cats!), dog owners deliberately unleashing their aggressive dogs to attack cats for fun - of course, all of these hazards are also existing in a village scenario - but it's just that in the city they are much more likely to happen. Ultimately, it is your cat and your choice - but also your responsibility, thus I am happy and glad you have asked this question let us help you in your considerations. Please take note that I don't intend to mean that letting your cat outdoors is the worst idea possible; I generally think this dilemma is too complicated and multidimensional to be able to be easily summarized and answered by a single, best-solution approach. It depends on what does the owner value the most, and it naturally varies from person to person. If the owner shares the safety-number-1-priority-attitude with me, my answer might be convincing and useful. If not, the owner could decide to not agree with me and let the cat go outside - and that's fine, but it's preferred that it is a conscious decision, made after taking all the related hazards into consideration. Getting to see and analyze a point of view from a safety-oriented person, like me, is what could be regarded as getting informed about these hazards.

What are the signs of an old cat dying?,"This is an emergency, so you need to get her to the vet. If a cat stops eating for more than 24 hours it can cause fatty liver syndrome; this might be fatal in itself. And the illness that is the cause for not eating must be solved as fast as possible or your cat will die. You need to call your vet to find the closest emergency veterinary service; where I live the vets are still open for emergencies but not for the regular services.

How much space does a hamster need in its cage?,"A lot of people keep hamsters in 10-gallon tanks, but the Humane Society writes: Size: Minimum 24 inches long and 12 inches wide; 10-gallon aquariums are too small. Consider not only size but shape—a long aquarium is better than a tall aquarium with unused height.  So you might want to consider a larger 20-gallon tank if you can manage it.  Hamsters are very active and like to run around a lot, and they like to have different areas for different things: one place for food storage, another for sleeping, and so on.  They're really quite happy with more space! But I don't think that's why your friend's hamster is always trying to get out.  To be honest, that's just normal hamster behavior!  I've had over a hundred pet hamsters, and I can tell you that most of them were very happy and had more than enough space, but they'd all try to escape anyway.  In fact, hamsters are well known for this behavior: they're often referred to as ""escape artists""!   Just make sure they can't get anywhere they can hurt themselves.  Make sure any Habitrail lids (or other openable sections) are securely fastened.  Hamsters chew everything in sight, and they can eventually gnaw away the tab that holds a skyhouse shut and pop it open.  Or they can chew an opening large enough to squeeze through--they can squish themselves through surprisingly small spaces! So make sure you regularly inspect your hamster's living environment and keep it secure, whether it's large or small."
How do I help my cat tolerate a bad-tasting liquid medicine?,"Atopica has the worst taste! My cat also hated it with a passion, but it helped his allergies so much more than anything else. Yes I actually tasted it, I wanted to see why my cat was acting up so much when he took it and I only put a tiny amount- not even a drop- on my tongue and it was just horrible. I don't recommend trying that...
I was not able to use the pill version as it only comes in dosages much higher than my cat needs and it can't be divided.
I finally figured out a way to keep my cat from having to taste the Atopica though. I bought some empty pill capsules, and I use the dosing syringe to measure his medicine into the empty capsule, and then just give it to him like any other pill. So that way he doesn't need to taste it at all.  I even found a website that does flavored empty capsules for pet medication, so it masks the taste even more. Just be careful not to get any of the Atopica liquid on the outside of the capsule when you are syringing it in, or else they can still taste it."
"Will kittens of a feral mom ""suddenly become feral"" if they are allowed outside?","I have almost no kitten experience, but Alley Cat Allies is the leading advocacy group in feral care. They say in the beginning of their Socialized Cat Guide: Kittens who do not have any contact with humans after they are born
  will be feral, regardless of whether their mother is a lost house cat
  or a feral cat living in a colony. They will be frightened of people
  and demonstrate all of the signs of fear and anxiety that an adult cat
  would, like spitting, hissing, and running from human contact. To become pets, they will need to be socialized, or taught to be
  comfortable around people. If the kittens are eight weeks or younger,
  usually just about anyone can socialize them by following some simple
  steps. Kittens between two months (eight weeks) and fourth months of
  age often take more time and skill to socialize. Learn how to
  determine kitten age. Specifically, if your neighbor has not been regularly handling these kittens they are currently feral. They are still young enough to be socialized into pets if they are given to people who understand what a commitment this is."
How do I teach a young dog or puppy not to bite me?,"From my experience:  My dog is now 9 months old and still bites when playing but he now knows that his jaw can hurt. I am not stating this is the best way, there are loads of ways I have read, and decided to use this one as it was the one I was the most comfortable with. When the puppy is young, he might bite for no apparent reason when playing or not. One important thing to remember when playing with him: you have two hands that can be used to hold him for fun. Pay close attention at how many times you close your hand on him while playing (I love to ""wrestle"" with my big boy). He wants to do the same but without hands; dogs use their mouth. Add to that the fact that the teeth are growing, and like for humans it hurts and chewing anything is attractive. (My dog ate a lot of volcano rocks, my vet compared them to my childhood toys and was not concerned by it) Remember that the puppy is not biting to hurt, he's just biting as he does not know better yet. Some people say a dog should never be able to feel human skin on their teeth. But it could bring some other problems that my solution circumvents but might create others. The idea behind the solution I adopted is to make sure the puppy is aware that biting can hurt, and teach him the strength that can be used when playing. That way, when he gets bigger, he knows why he should not bite hard and not just because we said so. He will also understand better how hard to bite if need be such as in domination. Although he should not be allowed to bite hard at any cost, no matter the way you use for him not to bite, he might bite. This makes sure he won't bite as hard as he can, he knows better than that now. The easiest way to do it is when the puppy bites a bit too hard (too hard should be 80% of the strength that could be applied without hurting so you have a buffer zone), is to simply say a sharp and acute ""ouch"" and immediately stop playing. Come back to play a little while after. Rinse and repeat. He might not seem to understand still he learns that hurting stops the game. I also had to show him that biting hurts, by sometimes biting his ear (easily reachable, soft, clean spot; get cautious, he will turn his head towards your face) What I liked about this is that my puppy now knows how to use his jaw, and knows that it can hurt. Things like very slowly taking a toy/treat from my hand, not getting too close of my hand when pulling became natural and I never needed to teach him those. The biggest advantage I have seen between that and not allowing to bite at all is that when he will want to bite for real, he still knows it can hurt and can control the strength applied instead of over doing it."
Adding neon tetras to an existing school - Any concerns?,"Neon tetras will school together irrespective to the order of introduction. The new fishes may hide and not eat for the first few days, but eventually even you wont be able to differentiate them. While not necessary, try to get same sized fishes as the existing ones. Acclimate them properly. Turn the lights off after releasing them into you tank. My Neons even school with Cardinals. The same goes for Harlequin and Lambchop rasboras. As stated by Keltari in another answer, as long as the visual differences are not easily distinguishable, they will school together."
"How does one effectively ""cycle"" an aquarium?","First, a little background on the aquarium nitrogen cycle. Fish produce ammonia, which is extremely toxic to the fish.  Unlike in a natural body of water, in an aquarium there is nowhere for this toxin to go, so it builds up fast.  Luckily, there is bacteria in your tank that converts ammonia into nitrite.  However, nitrite is also extremely toxic to fish.  So it is good that there is another type of bacteria in your tank that converts nitrite into nitrate.  Nitrate is also toxic to fish, but not nearly as much so as ammonia or nitrite, which means it is easier to manage with water changes. When you first set up your aquarium, the population of these bacteria is low and needs to be built up.  So the goal of ""cycling"" your aquarium is to get the population of bacteria up to where it needs to be to keep your fish healthy. One way this is done is to simply put cheap fish in your tank that will bring bacteria with them from the pet store.  The problem with this approach is that the first several fish you put in your tank will likely die, as the population of your bacteria has not grown yet.  Your cycling is complete when the fish stop dying. Instead, I have had great results with fishless cycling.  The idea is that you set up your aquarium with the heater and the filter, but before you put any fish in it, you add drops of pure ammonia to feed the bacteria.  Then you test the water every day for ammonia and nitrite to check the progress of the bacteria population.  When you get to a point where you can add ammonia, but the ammonia and nitrite are quickly processed by the bacteria, then your tank is ready for fish. There is a great article on fishless cycling with details on a good procedure here:
Cycling Your First Fresh Water Tank The whole process can take a few weeks, and it can be sped up by introducing something from an established aquarium, such as a decoration or a plant, that will bring some bacteria with it.  However, if you do bring something over from another tank, make sure it is a healthy tank, as you can also transport diseases to your new tank."
What is the best way to keep a cat in a multi-cat home from eating all the food?,"One way that might work while there's a significant size difference is to place the kitten's food in a location that the larger / older cat can't physically get into. If you're a DIY type person you might be able to come up with something elaborate but a simple and cheap way that comes to mind is to use a document storage box such as the following:  You could cut a hole in the bottom using a box cutter until the kittens can just fit in while the older cat can't and keep enlarging a little as they grow older. The lid on most of these boxes are fairly tight-fitting and I doubt a cat would be able to remove them, but if that or it getting pushed around turns out to be an issue they are robust enough to cope with quite a bit of weight, so you could place a few bricks or similar heavy object on top to prevent it. The tops are easy enough to remove for food replenishment and they're sufficiently cheap to replace from time to time if they get dirty or you could use a liner. As an added bonus kittens seems to like to get themselves into the smallest possible area so they'll probably enjoy their own little ""getaway""."
"What, exactly, is ""ich""?","Ich Ichthyophthirius multifiliis 
(Source: aquariacentral.com) Ich is an tiny ectoparasite that can harm fish if they succumb to it. If not cared for properly, it can kill fish. It's important to note that ich is always present, and there is nothing you can do to get rid of it. Fish are naturally immune to ich, and only succumb to it when their immune systems or protective slime-coating have been compromised, or when they're stressed. Think of it like a person with the flu. The flu virus will always be present, and our bodies have natural defenses in place to protect us, but external factors such as lack of sleep, a person who is already infected sneezing nearby, not washing hands, etc. can all cause the virus to get past our defenses and make us sick. This is why you will commonly see fish contract ich after traveling, if they're being bullied by other fish, and when they're living in poor water conditions. Also, if you have a fish like a H. plecostomus (also known as pleco), loach, or certain catfishes, they will actually attach to other fish, and ""bite"" off their slime coating, exposing them to ich. Finally, just like if you moved a person sick with the flu into a house full of healthy people, introducing a fish with ich into an established aquarium is a bad idea. And just like giving a healthy person flue medicine, giving healthy fish ich medicine isn't a good idea. It's a good idea to have a small tank on hand, one that's big enough for one or two fish, so that you can quarantine and treat sick fish away from healthy ones. For freshwater fish, ich can be treated in several different ways: Chemical treatment: something like Ich Attack or ParaGuard are two that I personally recommend. Follow the directions on the bottle, it'll tell you how much to put in per gallon, and how often. Be careful, these two shouldn't effect anything else in your tank, but with chemical treatments you always run the risk of throwing off the chemical balance (usually pH levels). Copper-based treatments like CopperSafe, while effective, are also really bad for invertebrates, like shrimp and crayfish. I would suggest avoiding copper if you have invertebrates in your tank. Aquarium salt: adding aquarium salt to the water helps calm fish, providing them with certain nutrients, and protects fish from nitrites via blocking gill absorption of nitrites, helping fish to absorb more oxygen. I wouldn't recommend using aquarium salt with H. plecostomus in the tank, as they can be sensitive to it, though some people have no problems. Also, aquarium salt is special; don't use other kinds of salt. Temperature: raising the temperature to about 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) will create an environment that the fish can survive in, but not the parasite. Don't leave the temperature at that though, as it will stress the fish out to be in there for long. It's all about who can survive it longer. Aquarium salt and temperature: I prefer this option as the salt helps the fish through the temperature rise more. Again, think twice about salt and plecos. For saltwater fish, the treatment is a bit more tricky. The first thing you want to consider is if your treatment will effect the live rock and any corals in your tank. In my opinion, for saltwater tanks, a small quarantine tank (with the same water parameters as the established tank) is a requirement. If you notice a sick fish, move it to the quarantine tank to protect the rest of your tank. There you can treat the fish without worrying about the medicine harming other fish or corals. In a quarantine tank, us chemical treatments on the fish. Since you're treating the fish in a quarantine tank, you can use copper-based treatments like CopperSafe. I have not had the guts to try it, but according to the bottle, Ich Attack is reef safe. Meaning you should be able to use it in a tank with corals in it without killing the corals. I'm not going to say you shouldn't do anything like that, but I don't want to take responsibility for anything like that. An UV sterilizer will help remove some of the parasites from the water. I've never used one, so I can't say much about them. They're expensive, and if you have the money for one, I think they'd be nice to have. On top of the treatment, I would perform gentle water changes. Something like 10% every 5 days. Enough to take out a good chunk of the old water, but not enough to stress the fish anymore than necessary. Have a bucket of water prepared the day before with something like Seachem Prime for freshwater fish. For saltwater fish, use pre-mixed saltwater already heated to the right temperature to avoid any drastic changes."
What should we look for in a kitty companion for our rabbit?,"I am active in the local rabbit rescue and humane society. This answer is based on multiple conversations with many cross species pet parents. All the points made are from experiences shared by parents and supported by reliable references where available.  In my opinion and experience a rabbit & cat are probably the two easiest animals to join together in a single household.  In any introduction of a new family member to the household early visits should be supervised, and the new member should not be left alone with existing member(s) until everyone is comfortable. Introducing two rabbits to each other is called bonding, it can be a significant undertaking.   The most appropriate cat is going to be a well socialized (not feral) adult cat, in short a cat that acts friendly to you can reasonably be expected to act friendly to the rabbit in your family.  A kitten can be brought in but is more difficult, with the kitten being somewhat at risk.  The size difference between the cat and rabbit are of minor concern. With the most important issue being to prevent the prey/predator responses particularly during the first visit. Rabbits are territorial and may be overly aggressive toward the cat during early visits so, do not let stereotypes cloud your judgement during introductions. So what makes a rabbit and cat so well suited for each other? The first 4 make perfect sense, but what is this complementary body language thing?   Other than who gets the peoples' attention, cats and rabbits only have one thing to argue about: Dominance. When two rabbits come together the one on the bottom is dominant; they are presenting themselves to be groomed.  Failure to provide grooming on demand can be painful, this is part of why the rabbit will often be the most dominant pet in the house. So when the cat and the rabbit approach each other, the rabbit will have its head lowered to assert its dominance (I AM ROYALTY YOU MUST GROOM ME).  The cat will immediately notice that the bunny is approaching in the classic cat language, submissive head down posture, and the cat knows that the bunny has recognized the cat's natural dominance and is bowing before it.  The image below captures abby hairboat's (OP) Kitten meeting her rabbit.   In this one most important element, the battle for dominance, both the cat and the rabbit win.  So what should you look for, in finding a feline companion for the bunny?   The perfect candidate will likely be at your local shelter.  They will probably be in a room with multiple cats (sometimes called a cat colony, where the most sociable cats live in a group).  They will be an adult of any age.  You and the cat will like each other.  The largest concern, is litter box sharing.  A cats litter and litter box are not appropriate for a rabbit.  Addressing that is the subject of the question If I have both a cat and a rabbit, can they (or should they) share a litter box?"
Are onions dangerous for my cat or dog and why?,"Yes Feeding onions and garlic to your dog or cat is not only bad for their health, but is potentially fatal for your pet. It's not just onions or garlic, but the whole category of plants that fall under the botanical name Alliacea (see table below).    Onion, garlic, and many variegations of the onion plant  contain sulfoxides and disulfides - onion itself has higher concentrations. These chemicals cause the red blood cells in cats to break up, which can result in hemolytic anemia. This type of anemia can make a cat fatigued, affect a cat's physical and mental performance and is potentially life threatening; the condition is known as  allium toxicosis.   If this type of poisoning occurs there is nothing that can be done to reverse the effects; only the symptoms can be treated. Affected animals may be treated with intravenous fluids and may require blood transfusions.  It's important to note the signs of toxicosis may not surface for several days after the animal has ingested the offending food. If your pet has eaten onions in any food, please monitor your pet and if any symptoms, like vomiting or diarrhea, develop or your pet seems unwell over the following few days, seek veterinary attention. Common sources for pets ingesting these toxins are onion plants, table scraps, garbage cans, and manufactured food made for humans, including baby food. The signs of toxicity are:   CLINICAL SIGNS
  In dogs and cats, clinical signs of Allium  species
  toxicosis may appear within one day of  consumption if large amounts
  of material have  been ingested. However, it is more common [to see] the
  development of clinical signs after a lag of  several days. The
  first signs are usually of  gastroenteritis: vomiting, diarrhea,
  abdominal  pain, loss of appetite, depression and dehydration.  It
  will take a few days for the dog to display the  signs associated with
  the loss of red blood cells:  pale mucous membranes, rapid respiratory
  rate,  difficulty to breathe, lethargy, dark colored urine  (reddish
  or brown), jaundice, weakness, and rapid  heart rate. Depression,
  hemosiderin in urine,  exercise intolerance and cold sensitivity may
  also  be observed. In cases of recent ingestion, the  breath of
  the affected dog or cat may smell like  onions or garlic. (1) A full list of the plants associated with allium species toxicity is here:

How can I make my dog stop playing with the water hose?,"About the only way I know of to deal with this problem is through conditioning.  Unfortunately, that topic is too huge to thoroughly handle in an answer.  However, this site is a great reference. The basic idea is to train your dog not to react to the hose though exposure to the stimulus, in this case water spraying from the hose, and then punish behavior that is not desired, but reward behavior that is desired.  What works and does not work often varies by dog, and ideally you want to use the method that causes the least amount of stress to your dog. Another option would be to use progressive reinforcement training.  This is really just a type of conditioning, but many trainers believe that it is a type of less stressful conditioning than some of the other options. The most important thing to remember when training your dog is that you do not want to become your dog's opponent.  If it becomes a contest of wills, your relationship with your dog will change, and could become unhealthy.  Instead, try to work with your dog to keep both you and your dog on the same side."
What strategy to undertake for a long car trip with my dog?,"I doubt that there is an answer that fits all circumstances. While it might be OK for the dog to have a break every 3-4 hours, chances are that your dog needs to get out earlier. Try to keep an eye on your dog while driving. If he seems to get nervous and starts moving around a lot, it might be best to stop and let him out of the car.   When we did longer trips with out dogs, we added a break every 1-2 hours. These were only very short breaks. Let them jump out of the car, wait near the car for five minutes and let them do their business on their own (they don't need a leash) and then return to the car. Some of the breaks were prolonged rests were we offered them something to drink.  How much and how often does the dog drink under normal circumstances? There is no need for a water container right beside him in his crate. It will only spill and wet his compartment. Instead offer him something to drink each time you stop. If possible use the water bowl he is used to from his home. Carry some bottles of water, just be sure that the bottles were not used for anything besides water before (the smell might confuse him and he could reject the water even if thirsty)."
Can an adult feral cat be socialized/domesticated?,"Feral cats can be domesticated, but that is somewhat dependant on why they're feral in the first place.  A cat born wild is likely to stay mostly that way even if it is comfortable with other cats or one human. A cat that is feral because it was ""kicked out"" or abandoned is more amenable to human contact and can be brought back to comfort with humans as a result. My in-laws have done this successfully with about a half dozen rescues and our current cats are offspring from one of those successes, it just requires a lot of patience and a willingness to sit still for it. I did a similar thing for a persian that was badly abused and was deathly afraid of men, eventually he was the biggest suck of a cat you could meet. In terms of your Mom's cat, it may never entirely get comfortable with people and not all cats are keen to be petted either. The puppy represents a disruption to routine as well and some cats really hate that, so that may be the real reaction rather than specifically the puppy. Mind you a nutty dog in a dignified cat's ""space"" may be sufficient offence anyways. :D"
"What to do when a cat is in ""attack mode""","I have the same kind of cat with the same ""fight mode"". Often it seems that this happens when he's hungry, but hasn't realized that he's hungry. Giving him a treat might calm him down, but it also might encourage this behavior in order to get a treat.  So my usual tactic is to shower him with love. I pick him up with a firm hold on the scruff of his neck, and just hold and nuzzle him, rubbing my nose on his forehead. Now, he usually doesn't enjoy this at first; but he either starts to enjoy it after a minute and will sit and cuddle, or when I put him down, he's in a different mood and eats a little and takes a nap. If he's on your lap, the easiest thing to do is to stand up.  Something I've learned from the show ""My Cat from Hell"" is use a wand toy or laser pointer. If you can burn up the hunting energy without rewarding him for biting hands and fingers (and wrists! ouch!), that would be ideal. Reward him with a treat (or a few: my cat has negotiated his way up to 4 or 5 treats and will demand more if fewer are given), and let him take a nap."
Should I worry if my cat accidentally ate some chocolate?,"I would keep chocolate well away from any cat or dog.  I would freak out if my cat ate chocolate (or for that matter: onions, garlic, mushrooms, broccoli - those all have other phytotoxins in them).  Certainly, there are cats and dogs have lived after eating chocolate, but likely they got some organ damage as a result of it, and plenty have also died from it. Theobromine poisoning: cats, dogs & humans (humans can take much higher doses even mg/kg of theobromine because we have defenses like cytochrome P450 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450)) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theobromine_poisoning"
Is it safe for a dog to drink water from a stream?,"Generally speaking, if you are not familiar with the water source, it is not safe to let your dog drink from it. Leptospira, which is a genus of bacteria excreted in the urine of infected animals, can survive for many months in water ways, so our vet has recommended that in addition to his normal annual shots, he also be inoculated for leptospirosis. Beyond the additional inoculations, our vet has not shown any serious concerns though.  However, it is always advisable to consult with your vet as there may be pathogens that are common to waterways where you live."
Spray bottle becoming ineffective,"As Zaralynda said in this answer on another question, it's better if you can identify and address the cause of the bad behavior.  But that doesn't always work immediately, and so in the meantime, there's the squirt bottle. You mention the ""mist of water"" being ineffective.  I use squirt bottles with adjustable flow; I can produce anything from a fine, broad mist to a narrow burst of water (think squirt-gun-sized stream).  I've found the latter to be more effective; it's more concentrated and I think the cat notices more. If you're not already using an adjustable bottle, try that first.  It might do the job without any additives, at least long enough for you to find and fix the core problem."
How much exercise should a young cat be getting?,"Daily exercise is good for both your kitten's mental and physical well-being. Exercise can help your baby cat avoid problems with his joints later on in life. Basically, getting your cat in the habit of regular physical activity while he's young is the cornerstone to a long healthy life and helps his physical development. How Much is Enough? Make sure you're consistent with the amount of exercise your kitten gets. You need to help him build its stamina, and the only way he can do this is by exercising regularly but with caution. At the kitten stage, he's much too young to be doing the rigorous activities that he will be more able to do as he grows older. The amount of exercise your kitten needs depends on his age, breed and medical condition. Not every breed will be up for a long walk through Central Park. Some breeds are just not built to go the distance, while others are always ready to romp.  But in general You should try to spend about 10-15 minutes a few times each day engaging your cat in some form of activity. Young cats and kittens will usually take the initiative in engaging you in play, or they will find their own entertainment. Take a look at : Exercising with Your Cat: A How-To Guide "
What can I do to prevent/educate a kitten from chewing wires?,"Contrary to what I've implied in ""How to use a spray bottle as negative reinforcement?"" this is one exception of the case. I have not used a spray bottle, but instead I've kept a glass filled with very small amount of water near the place(s) where my kittens have liked to play with electrical wires. When I noticed anyone of them playing with wires I've sneaked near, taken the glass of water (placed near the place beforehand), then waited a short moment, and finally dropped the water on the kitten. I've kept the amount of water so small that I haven't feared shortcircuiting anything, not even felt a need to wipe the spilled water off the floor afterwards. What is different between a spray bottle and a tiny amount of water dropped from a glass is in the way the water falls on its target. Spray bottle makes a squirt that has direction and length, while a drop is a single point in time-and-space when it lands on the kitten. Most of the time kittens are so focused on the small area immediately around them that they can't really figure out where the water came from. I'm not standing quite next to them, and not moving, so they (usually) haven't made a connection between me and the water. What is right there in front of the kitten is the wires, and s/he was playing with those wires, which makes an obvious connection between the unpleasant surprise and the wires. So far I've had good results with this method. Adult cats are far more observant to their surroundings. I'm quite convinced that this method would fail to make the wanted change in their playing with wires. I have one adult cat who likes to chew thin wires, like headphones cables and batterycharger wires. I haven't even tried to train him away from this habit, instead I've just removed all thin wirings from his reach. Somehow he still finds all of those that I forget to hide. Casualties of the last year: four headphones and three battery chargers."
Make life easier for motion sick dog when traveling?,"When taking dogs on long trips or managing a dog that is prone to motion sickness, it takes planning and can take the spontaneity out of short trips. For an adult dog this is easier to manage, as an adult dog only needs to be fed once a day and this is usually, best done in the evening. Do not feed the dog before the trip.  If you are planning a long trip, feed your dog a little earlier than usual the day before. In the afternoon, rather than the evening. Make this feed a little lighter  in quantity than usual. Make sure your dog still has plenty of access to fresh water. On the morning of the trip, remove your dog's water bowl an hour or so before the trip, ensure he has managed a good morning drink. This will help to reduce his stomach contents.  A drug free and great way to treat the motion sickness is to give your dog a junket tablet. Junket tablets are used to make milky desserts. They curdle the milk, causing it to solidify, it does this to your dog's stomach contents. This helps prevent the liquid in the stomach from refluxing into the esophagus, causing nausea. This has been the gentlest way I have managed motion sickness in dogs. If this and/or other simple approaches do not work, please advise and we can make a post on how to manage more severe motion sickness. Please note that a dog cannot be taken on a very long trip without being given regular water, in this case a dog, that needs to have water restrictions and is prone to vomiting, I would advise against taking the dog on trips that are longer than 2-3 hours."
Are there any health or behavioral issues specific to tripod (3-legged) dogs?,"Most three-legged dogs get along just fine.  The key is to treat them like a normal dog.  They don't know to be sad about it, so you shouldn't be sad either.  They may have some confidence issues you should help them work on, making them feel like the best dog ever!  If it does have confidence issues, then other dogs are more likely to pick on it. The biggest health issue I see is weight. Make sure they stay a good, healthy weight so that they don't put a lot of extra weight on the remaining three legs. "
How can I get my cat to not be afraid of me?,"It will take time. I don't know how for how long you have owned her now, but from my experience, the relationship can take long to establish itself. To create this bond you are looking for, don't rush things. Never chase her, never hold her when she doesn't want to, and never make sudden movements when you are near her. This would only make her more afraid of you. Instead, sit down next to her, with her daily food, treats or toys, wait until she comes on her own to eat or play. She needs to understand that you are not a threat. Just hold your hand in her direction, without moving. She will, eventually, come rub her head against your hand. This worked with 100% of the cats I have met :) Speaking with her gently also helps. Try to call her by her name when you wait with her food/toys. She should learn that this means no harm for her."
Is there anything I should know or consider before giving a pet as a gift?,"As a general rule, it is unwise to ever give a pet as an unsolicited gift. A pet is a large commitment, and there are animal shelters full of unwanted Christmas, Easter and birthday gifts.  A puppy, kitten, bunny; any pet is a living being and totally dependent upon their owners in all ways, they are a lifetime commitment. Too often, life's circumstances will force dedicated pet owners into the difficult corner of having to surrender their loved pets. Deciding and choosing a pet is a decision which takes time and forethought on the part of the would-be owner. Facilities, lifestyle, time, and financial constraints are unique to that household; an outsider can only guess at these factors. Families may have many varying restrictions on whether or not a particular, if any, type of pet is suitable for that family, so an outsider buying a pet for a family or person, does not constitute responsible gift giving. As for parents buying their children pets as gifts, any wise parent knows that the responsibility of a pet ultimately lies with the parent, just as the responsibility of the child is with the parent. So if a parent chooses to give their child a pet as a gift, at any time of the year, the parent needs to know and accept responsibility for that pets well being. So, to decide if you are gifting a pet, you need to replace  these question: 1) Is this pet a suitable gift for [insert person]?  With this more important question: 2) Am I going to be caring for this pet?  If the answer to the second question is ""No"", then the answer to the first question is also ""No"". Am I going to be caring for this pet after it no longer young and cute?  Am I willing to care and pay for the pet when it gets old and/or sick? Many pets are given as baby pets while they are cute, young and healthy, a pet remains dependant upon their owners as they grow old, sick and have behavior that does not always suit our lifestyles. Maintain an animal within a human household requires effort. A pet doesn't attribute value to material things as people do, so when a cat is scratching up furniture, or a dog chews an expensive pair of shoes, or a bunny leaves dropping all over the house, this all requires effort, patience and expense, that can make the reality of owning a pet outweigh the cuteness of the original gift. Unless you have prearranged with someone , with  whom after long consideration and consultation, has  agreed and desires a particular pet, a responsible adult who is prepared to make the lifetime commitment of caring for and homing the pet and together you have chosen this pet; the answer is always a categorical no pet is suitable to give as a gift. My personal examples: 1) My neighbors took my daughter for a walk (as they often do), but this time returned with two goldfish in a small goldfish bowl.    I was dubious about the potential survival of the fish, as the bowl was small and we had nowhere to place the bowl where it would not be bumped.    After the first fish died, we had our neighbor add the surviving fish to their pond.  The moral of the story: No matter how easy caring for a pet may seem, do not give pets as unsolicited gifts. 2) I was given a bird, a budgerigar as a  child. The bird was I failed to feed and provide the bird with fresh water and he died. My mother then used the event as a let this be a lesson to you, birds need fresh food and water daily. I then placed food and water beside the dead bird (it didn't help). This I have never forgotten, and although my children have pets, and I prompt and remind them to feed them, the responsibility lays firmly at my feet to ensure that our pets have  daily fresh water and food. The moral of the story: No matter how responsible or ready our children may seem to be for pet ownership, the responsibility, ultimately, lies with the parent, so gifting a pet to a child, in reality means gifting the pet to the parent."
How should I dispose of a dead fish's body?,"As Precious Tijesunimi mentioned, it is wrong to flush a fish, live or dead (perhaps especially not live, as this is how many harmful species get introduced to environments they don't belong to... not to mention it is cruel).  Especially don't place it into a ""natural"" ecosystem!  In fact, both of these options may be illegal in many areas. Depending on your area, cremation may not be a legal option (I know some areas have restrictions on open fires of any type). Burial and trash strike me as the best solution.  However, there are some caveats: If you bury it, bury it deep enough that neighborhood critters (cats, raccoons, dogs, or any other scavengers) don't smell it (you don't want to smell it, either!).  Consider placing a decent-sized rock over the burial location, both to discourage digging, and to mark the spot as a memorial. If you throw it in the trash... place it in a ziplock bag, first!  Rotting fish is a very pungent odor, and your neighbors and your trash collectors will appreciate this basic step towards preventing the stench from spreading.  Plus, it will also reduce the chances of critters trying to go through your garbage until it is collected."
Do cats know instinctively which plants are safe to eat?,"Absolutely not. Lilies, which are very common houseplants, particularly in the spring when people are likely to bring them in for Easter, are one of the most toxic plants for cats, with minimal ingestion (i.e. licking a bit of pollen off their fur) required for lily poisoning, and a fatality rate of 50-100%. With the danger presented by lilies, if your premise was correct, cats would stay far away from them; however, one emergency veterinary practice reported in an article on their site that in the span of 2018-2021, they saw nearly 1,000 patients suffering lily poisoning, the vast majority of them cats. If cats won't avoid one of the most deadly toxic plants they can come in contact with, it would be foolish to assume they'd avoid any other plant on the extensive list of common household plants that are toxic to them. While toxicity on the list ranges from ""deadly"" (lilies) to ""gastrointestinal upset,"" most if not all plants on the list should be avoided, particularly if they can't be kept away from the cats. Anecdotally, I used to have a beautiful oxalis (shamrock) in my house; while certainly not the most toxic plant on the list, it carries a risk of kidney failure. My cats became obsessed with the plant and constantly tried to eat it; the plant now lives at my office to keep them separated. As a final point, if any of your new houseplants are any type of lily, remove them from the household immediately and thoroughly clean the area where they were located to remove all pollen. Monitor your cat for any signs of lily poisoning and take her to a vet immediately if she shows any indication of illness at all."
What should I do if my cat stops eating and starts hiding more?,"(I see that your situation has resolved itself, but I want to talk a bit about cat anorexia and fatty liver disease because it can be a real problem). Cats can stop eating for a variety of reasons. They ate a bug, they have a hairball making them feel weird, they're stressed, they have a cold, there are a ton of reasons. Feline Hepatic Lipidosis The main danger when a cat stops eating is feline hepatic lipidosis, commonly called fatty liver disease.  The exact mechanism by which fasting in a previously healthy cat
  causes hepatic lipidosis is not clear. The process is unique to cats
  in both severity and rate of occurrence. It is understood as the
  anorexia continues more and more fat is broken down throughout the
  body and that this fat is then transported to the liver. The liver
  should then process this fat and export it back to the rest of the
  body in a new form. In cats developing hepatic lipidosis this process
  is impaired and fat accumulates in the liver. Damage to the liver
  occurs as a result of liver cells being too swollen with fat. It's also not really well understood how long it takes for a cat to develop fatty liver disease, but it's believed that overweight cats will develop it faster than normal/underweight cats.   I had a cat with recurring anorexia (as a result of sinus problems) and the general timeline we followed was: Fortunately he never developed fatty liver (he was pretty underweight from these recurrent episodes). It's very difficult to get enough calories into a cat with a syringe, and if I knew how often we'd be doing it I would have had a feeding tube placed in his neck to aid in the feedings. Dehydration Another concern when a cat stops eating is dehydration, because cats get most of their water through their food (especially on a wet food diet). There are two ways to check your cat for dehydration at home. Dehydration can be easily treated, but a vet needs to examine the cat to be sure that there is not an underlying problem causing the dehydration. When to See Your Vet If your cat is dehydrated, you should see your vet immediately. If your cat has not eaten for 2 days, you should see your vet immediately. If it's a Friday and your cat just stopped eating and your vet isn't available on the weekend, call you vet and ask for advice specific to your cat's health and any existing conditions. What to Expect The most common treatment for anorexia is appetite stimulants. This medication is often used in addition to treating whatever the underlying cause for the anorexia may be. For example, in the cat with sinus problems, we would often give him antibiotics for the sinus infections and appetite stimulants to get him started eating again.   Feeding tubes are a treatment method for chronic anorexia, or anorexia that has progressed into hepatic lipidosis. It can sometimes be used as a treatment method in other cases of anorexia as well. For example, after a surgery, Juliet stopped eating due to stress. She hates being handled by people (medications, syringe feeding, etc), so I had the vet put in a feeding tube immediately and she was fine a week later. I believe that if we had tried to syringe feed her, it would have continued to stress her out (continuing the anorexia). If your cat is also dehydrated, the vet may administer subcutaneous fluids to your cat, or use an IV for more intensive therapy. Your cat may need to stay overnight or at the vet's for several days if she is very ill (from anorexia, dehydration, or from the underlying cause)."
Discouraging cat from scratching couch,"You're going in the right direction, with your efforts to make the couch unappealing, and provide scratchers as alternatives. You just need to experiment a bit more to discover the right combination of things to discourage it from the couch and encourage it to the scratchers. Some tips on trying out scratchers: From personal experience, sometimes cats seem to have different preferences when it comes to scratchers than when it comes to furniture, so don't rule out scratchers that you might think are too dissimilar from your furniture. For example, cats might reach up to scratch your furniture, but still prefer floor scratchers. I've also had alot of success with the destructible cardboard scratchers. I think many cats really tend to like those because they like the feeling of really destroying something. But of course, every cat has its own preferences, so if those don't seem to appeal either, just keep trying until you find the one it really likes. Sometimes it takes a while for the cat to figure out the scratchers too, so don't take the scratchers it doesn't seem interested in away too quickly.  It took my cat months to realize he really likes the cardboard scratchers, but now he's really good about scratching them. Regarding negative reinforcement: The reason why people say to not use it is that usually it just doesn't work. The cat will continue to do what it wants when you're not there. You'll get mad when you inevitably discover the cat is still doing what it wants, and the cat might decide it doesn't like you as much for yelling or spraying it or whatever. That is why most advice you read will talk about trying to rearrange things so the cat will naturally be inclined to do what you want it to. So don't think of ""no negative reinforcement"" as ""tying your hands,"" but rather it's just saving you from wasted effort and frustration. There is one exception, which is if the cat is doing a behavior only when you're around. For example, the cat is jumping up on the kitchen counter to steal food when you're preparing meals. But in these cases, try to use as little negative reinforcement as necessary. Like in the example earlier, you don't need to yell or spray it. All you need to do pick the cat up and put it back on the floor. This is technically negative reinforcement, though it's so minimal it might not seem that way, but the cat will still give up the behavior quite quickly as long as you're consistent."
Does picking up an adult cat by neck cause them to be paralyzed like kittens?,"Cats can be temporarily paralyzed by pinching the skin on the back of their neck. This is called ""pinch-induced behavioral inhibition"" (PIBI) or ""scruffing"" or ""clipnosis"" (a composition of clip and hypnosis, because clips are often used in veterinary or scientific settings to keep cats immobile). It is a reflex in cats and other animals like rodents, rabbits, guinea pigs and dogs. This reflex stays active as the animal ages. You can read more about it in What research is there on the long term effects of pinch-induced behavioral inhibition conditioning on cats?. However, the skin of the neck can only support a limited amount of weight and is not suited to support the body weight of an adult cat. You will certainly cause your cat pain and potentially injure it by literally picking it up by the scruff of the neck. Please read more about it in Is it ok to pick my adult cat up by the scruff of the neck?"
What should I consider when deciding to purchase pet insurance?,"Read the coverages carefully.  When I investigated pet insurance several years ago, I found that it was only useful for catastrophic costs; the premiums were about equal to the cost of the annual exam (or vet check) and shots, and provided minimal discount there.  At that point, you're playing the odds: if your pet develops cancer, you'll be glad to have the insurance, but if it develops something that requires medication, but not surgery, it may not help much. Additionally, there is often an age threshold: for the policies I was looking at, my ten-year-old cats were too old. The best way to evaluate the cost is to compare the premiums and coverage amounts with your past and current data, if you have it, or failing that, with estimates from your vet."
What is an effective way to discipline a dog?,"Depriving a dog of food is not a productive way to discipline a dog.  From the sounds of it, this dog needs a lot of attention, in the form of training and fun dog activities. Useful methods to discipline dogs are ones that will teach the dog. Dog's are intelligent animals, but they have an intelligence similar to the level of young children (<=4 years); so they cannot understand elaborate consequences, they respond to simple cause and effect whether it be positive or negative reinforcement. The best way to discipline a dog is to proactively train a dog.  From the sounds of it, it would appear that your friend's dog has not been trained much, if at all. These are all symptoms of a bored dog that has not been well trained or socialized. Balancing positive and negative reinforcement with dogs is important, as continual negative reinforcement without praise can cause a dog's nature to become less friendly. Some tips would be to try and train the dog the basics, a  reward based training system is good. This PDF by the Australian Veterinary Association gives good advice on how to apply positive rewards for good behavior and  appropriate punishments to deter unwanted behavior. There are two types  of reinforcement techniques
Positive  reinforcement involves giving the dog something it wants to make the
  behaviour more likely to occur again.  This occurs if asking the dog
  to sit and stay and giving it a reward (something the dog wants)  for
  staying away from the biscuit on the table increases his likelihood of
  doing as asked again.
Negative reinforcement involves removing
  something aversive to make the behaviour more likely to occur again.
  This  occurs if holding the dog back from the table by a tight choker
  chain (an aversive stimulus), and releasing the pressure  when the dog
  sits down and stops leaning in towards the biscuits. This results in
  the dog being less likely to try and  approach food on the table in
  the future. Note that an aversive stimulus had to be present (the
  choker) for the dog to  have to work to escape, so negative
  reinforcement can also be called escape or avoidance learning. Personally, I like to train dogs with a style of integrating positive or negative reinforcement with my own natural body languages. The voice should always be used when praising or correcting, and the pitch and tone of the voice, that's a good dog and a good pat with a  food reward; or a firm and deep No! and a loud clap of the hands with either a spray from a water bottle, or check from a check chain. This causes the dog to associate your voice and actions the external stimulus, so that eventually the external stimulus can be removed."
What can I do if my puppy is hyperactive?,"I am not an expert, just happened to have lived the same thing a couple of months ago. Your dog needs to have a spot for himself, a basket or something similar, where you can send him. This should never be used as a punishment but a place for him to ""hang out"". Once the order of ""go to your basket"" is learnt, it will be a lot easier for you to help your dog calm down. Chances are that, at 8 weeks old, his mom did not get all the time to teach him to return to calm. If your doggy wants to play it is a good sign! But make sure you are the one initiating all the play times. If he comes to you with a toy or just try to get your attention, ignore him, or even a ""no"" might be in order if he insists and 5 minutes later go play with him. This way you will be the one who controls, and you will teach your dog that bugging you to play is useless. It is also normal that your dog sleeps while you are not around. As most animals, when their needs are fulfilled and no other stimulant is around, they are recovering or saving energy to be ready if something happens. Don't forget dogs used to live in the wild :) Personally, I have found out that making him use his brain during playtime was a good way to make him learn, learn about him and tire him down somewhat quicker. My dog is now usually feeding off a plastic milk bottle (could be soda bottle, but the opening might be a bit too small), he cannot use his teeth on it at all. He has to bump it with his nose or use his paws to get some food out. I also mixed sit and a couple other orders during our games and he learnt a lot faster than when we tried with treats. Refs:
Own personal experience, doggy is now 9 months old, still has as much energy but he knows (and us too now) to control it. A personal trainer was of big help to us too, most of what I stated is suggestions she made that we followed. Good luck, may the patience be with you"
Would an indoor cat need flea treatments?,"We've never done that with our cats as they're indoors, but the risk of fleas being introduced into the house through other means is probably your basis for consideration. If there is some chance of wildlife making it in or other pets visiting (like a friend's dog), then you might consider it. However, if it's gone this long without the treatment, I would probably deal with a flea situation as a one-off using flea soap when, or if, it happens.  Why put the poor cat through the indignity of a bath if you don't need to? Doing that is not a lot of fun... Edit: Mind you, you could consider the spot-on treatments like Advantage Multi as a way of preventing. It's not hard to do and effective. As I said though, if there is no evidence of fleas, why do it?"
How long can we hold off euthanizing our cat?,"You are trying to balance the cat's pain on the one hand versus your sister's distress if this happens before she can get there.  You can talk with your sister to gauge the latter, but you can't ask the cat how much pain she's in, nor ask her for an opinion. While it's impossible to judge these things over the Internet (and I am not a vet), you seem to be describing a situation that is under control.  In particular, the cat is still eating and drinking; from personal experience, once they stop doing that you're in trouble, but you're not there yet. You need to discuss this with your vet, who is probably the only one who can assess the cat's level of pain and discomfort for you.  I trust that you're also giving the cat plenty of TLC -- holding, petting, and the like. I was overseas when my 19-year-old cat's heart condition took a big turn for the worse.  I was already boarding him at the vet's (due to him needing medicine that needed ongoing adjustment) and I was in daily contact with my vet, trying to figure out what was best for him and me, desperately wanting him to hang on a little longer and questioning whether I was putting him through pain on my account.  This was very stressful for me, but the regular updates made a big difference (and I knew the cat was in good hands).  It might be good for your sister to talk with the vet directly, in addition to talking with you about what the vet said.  Ultimately she should be part of the decision."
How can I move houses with a friendly feral cat I care for?,"First, my wife and I have experience with 11 feral cats over the past 10 years. I don't intend this as bragging but I know a great deal about feral cats, some of it learned the very hard way. Now, there are three types of cats you encounter outside: Cats whose owners let them roam - that is very dangerous in urban and suburban areas in the US. Brits - I know that your environment is very different that ours and I accept that it is much safer to allow your cats to go outdoors as they please - just trying to forestall any arguments. Cats who are the classic ""stray"" cat. These are cats who once lived with humans but lost the home. Maybe they go lost, they ran away from bad people, or they were dumped but stupid humans that think cats can survive outdoors on their own - maybe lions and such can but, not domestic cats who have lived with humans and might not know what to do with a mouse if they caught one. Feral cats - these are cats born and raised with no human contact. They regard us as another possible threat and they will run away as fast as possible. Should get one cornered, plan on being bitten and scratched when he or she fight, in their minds, for their life. My wife and I have learned that the hard way. You are not dealing with a feral cat. There is absolutely no way that a feral cat would come close enough to be touched, let alone go into your house. You have to use a trap to catch a feral cat, there simply is no other way to do it. So, what should you do: Take the cat into your home and begin trying to limit his outdoor times. It will be difficult but we have found most cats can be converted to indoor cats provided enough of the right type of attention is given to them and they showered with love. Do not over shower them, however, cats often get more attention than they want at a particular time. Take the cat with you when you move. You have no choice in the matter. The cat has become dependent upon you in many ways and it simply is not right nor acceptable for you to move and leave him behind. Don't worry about him learning to use a litter box. Every feral we have trapped and taken to socialize knew instantly what a litter box was and its intended use. Even feral kittens who were born outside and have lived outside their entire lives will instinctively know the use of a litter box - it's actually sort of spooky that the adapt instantly to a litter box. I'm going to end now and hope I can submit this answer. I hope I've addressed most of your questions. If not, either edit your question or post a new question."
Is it true that goldfish growth is limited by container size?,"Toxotoes answer references an article on trout studies.  There's no basis for equating a study on trout with that of goldfish.  Moreover, the study referenced doesn't even support the researchers hypothesis. Unlike other aquarium fish, goldfish excrete a hormones such as aminobutyric acid (GABA) and somatostain, that acts as signal of how many other fish and what sized body of water they are in. In the wild, this will regulate their size and the size of others and help keep them from running out of resources.   While the GABA / somatostain regulation is an example of a ""crowding effect"", it shouldn't be confused with the stress based responses common to all fish in which epinephrine and norepinephrine increase due to poor living conditions (bad water and overcrowding).

What will help an aging dog with arthritis?,"There are several types of arthritis that can affect your dog. Some of these are very treatable, others less so. In either event, I think it is a good idea to get her looked at by a vet. In terms of general activities/considerations as a lot of the arthritis management truisms for us apply to them1: Make sure that her weight is ideal. Heavier dogs are going to be harder on their joints than dogs at an ideal weight. Certain forms of exercise can be really beneficial, notably swimming. Swimming does a couple of things here: relieves pressure on the joints and provides non-impacting exercise. Keep her exercises less impacting in general. For example, softer surfaces for walks (grass rather than pavement) and reduce leaping around (especially jumps from heights). In terms of medicating, I think it's best to talk the vet. There are some human medication options that can help, but best for your vet to recommend. If it is a treatable condition, then its almost certain there will be a regimen of medication to treat. 1 Blackwell's Five-Minute Veterinary Consult: Canine and Feline (5th Edition):  Osteoarthritis, Appropriate Health Care"
How can I ensure a ferret's longevity?,"According to ""Are Marshall Farms ferrets less genetically favorable"" (All About Ferrets), you can identify a Marshall Farms (MF) ferret by observing 2 little blue dots tattooed on its ear.  The article is inconclusive regarding a genetic issue (considering potential in-breeding at Marshall Farms and whether the Farm is actually doing anything about the concern) and relates back to the basic factors of diet and care as primary for longevity. Several comments applied to the article from visitors are negative regarding MF ferret longevity.  Commenter ""spunky"" supplies the following information, which I am unable to fact-check: ""... Marshall Farms primary customers are not pet owners, they are research facilities. Therefore, longevity is not one of the traits they breed for. They don’t even know how long any of their animals will live because they are either donated into research or euthanized once they are too old to reproduce [...] genetics are not a priority for them."" Do note that, unless all MF ferrets are neutered / spayed before being distributed to pet owners, the potential for private in-breeding of MF ferrets may exist.  As they would be produced outside of MF, the resulting members of the brood would have the same genetic disposition, but not the identifying tattoo.  This might not be true for broods resulting from the pairing of MF ferrets to non-MF ferrets."
What's the best way to heal a scab on top of my dog's head?,"The solution is simple: Stop your dog scratching.  However, implementing the solution is the challenge. Basically, every time you're with the dog you want to remain extra vigilant to make sure that she doesn't scratch it, distract her with something. If you simply don't have the time to hawk eye your dog (as most don't), then it looks like a lampshade collar would be your best bet (they're available at most mid-size pet stores), which are something like:  My mother's Bichon had one of these in the past when she had a cut on her paw to stop her from licking it and breaking the scab and it is the only really practical and effective way of stopping your dog from scratching the scab."
Claw-clipping for the visually challenged?,"So, some advice from someone who had to clip the claws of an ornery Tortoise Shell cat as well as a few bunnies that can kick like the blazes... Don't let the cat tell you when to stop. You need to demonstrate that the clipping is done when you decide that it is done, no sooner. Use a magnifying glass like the big reading ones on their own pedestal or a magnifying mirror to help guide you.  Have some styptic handy when you do make a bad clip. It happens, don't beat yourself up over it, just help bring it to a stop for your furry friend as fast as possible. Wrap him/her up in a kitty burrito. Nothing like a towel to bring some of the fuss under control to allow you to get it done. It's especially useful for squirmy cats and bunnies."
Why does my cat dig at mirrors and glass?,"From what you say, particularly about her knowing that it's ""bad"" behaviour, it sounds as though it's an attention-seeking behaviour. As noted on that page, the key to correcting attention-seeking behaviour is very similar to correcting attention-seeking behaviour in children, and involves essentially three steps:"
Why do cats not like their front paws being held?,"The biggest reason I can think of is that you're taking away a defence mechanism for the cat. Is your friends' cat declawed by any chance? If it is, it may be that it no longer sees those paws a defence. In general, though, I've found that cats see that as an aggressive behavior and react (mine will nip if I do it)."
Why does my dog get stuck to the female after mating?,"The males penis will swell inside the females vagina during the mating. This will cause them to get stuck. It is completely normal for dogs to get stuck together after mating and you should not attempt to divide them. If you don't want them to mate you should have had enough time to try separating them before. Our non-neutered female dog mated with our castrated male a few times. Especially during the first few times we had to secure them, as she got very excited after the mating. She tried to run away and this caused or male incredible pain. I held her by her chest/neck area so she could not run away any longer and waited until they separated on their own. The time it takes for the swelling to reduce and allow separation differs, one article on the breeding tie suggests a time between 2 and 30 minutes. I quote some other information from the article I think is noteworthy: Getting stuck together is normal. Do NOT ice them to get them apart. […] It is advised that you give close supervision and keep them calm. […] You do not want the female to panic and start squirming. If she is larger than the male she can really hurt the male. He is helpless and will usually stand perfectly still, waiting. […] After a tie […] check your male, and make sure that his penis has gone back inside of him and is not strangled in hair or stuck out. Note that the article is about breeding, thus I removed information that does not relate to your question about mating."
Is it a good idea to allow my cats to eat leftovers / table scraps?,"It is not a good idea to let cats eat scraps off plates for two reasons. It encourages bad behavior. It would be better to select any suitable scraps and put them in the cat's food bowl. This also ensures that what the cat is eating is being supervised. When selecting table scraps for you cat, pick off cooked, unseasoned meat and feed it to your cat in her food bowl. There are many things that can be, potentially, harmful for a cat to eat from human leftovers. Sometimes cats will vomit up table scraps, as they don't cope well with big diet changes, they cope better with gradual changes and introduction of new foods. Also the type of seasonings and spices human foods have frequently do not agree with a cat's gut and can cause irritation.

How hard will it be to train my parrot to talk?,"It depends on the species of parrot you plan to buy. E.g. African grey parrots are the most intelligent ones and quick learners. They have the most clear voice. Similarly the macaws, alexandrine can also mimic human voices well. Indian ringnecks, budgies etc will not mimic human voices but can only produce different kinds of whistles. It would be best to buy a parrot when its still on hand feeding, it will learn better and can get better attached with you. But, don't buy too young, at least 40 days old as it's harder to feed younger than this. Further you can use recorders to continuously play small phrases and words. Keep them at a common place in your house like the living room, place the cage at least at height more than 3-4 ft. Parrots loose interaction when kept on low heights. It's not really too hard to raise and train parrots, it needs almost the same devotion which any pet would require. Best of luck."
Why do cats like catnip?,"Interestingly enough, feline response to catnip is genetic in origin and not all cats respond to it. For example, cats in Australia generally don't respond.  At any rate, the active compound in catnip is nepetalacton which acts as a mood elevator in many cats and can make them happy. However, cat response to this being variable means that some can become overly aggressive. Alternatives, with similar chemical compounds that can cause like reactions include honeysuckle and valerian."
How can I prevent a neighborhood tomcat from harassing my neutered female cat when she goes outside?,"In my experience there really isn't much you can do - without getting a dog (and having the ""fun"" of introducing your cat to the dog) the best I've ever managed is to chase the offending cat off my property any time I see him around. That tends to make the tomcat a bit more circumspect around your property - which should give your cat a safe-ish outdoor area. The only other option I can suggest is an outdoor cat run she can access from indoors (usually via a cat door) where she has plenty of space but the tomcat can't get to her. That's going to cost you either money or time. Unfortunately, your cat being spayed isn't enough for some toms, particularly if there's a queen in heat and they can't get to her. They're going to try to mate with anything feline that holds still long enough.  Also, there's some dominance behavior going on here - the tom regards your property as part of his territory, and he's trying to ensure that your cat acknowledges him as the top cat.  I'd suggest you keep an eye on her - in situations like this it's not uncommon for the female cat to be injured trying to escape the tom. More than once I've had to take neutered females to the vet to treat bad claw wounds near the base of the tail."

Why should there be one more litter box than the total number of cats?,"According to this article on Pet Health Network, there is not really some special reason behind having an extra litter box - it is just for precautionary reasons. A dirty litter box could cause: Cats are very territorial animals and might not want to share their litter box. So what happens when your cat's litter box becomes dirty and you are not around to clean it up? (The extra litter box comes in). An extra litter box can also give your cat variety of choices."
How to train a kitten to climb tail-first down a tall climbing tree?,"In my experience (having owned over a dozen outdoor cats), they tend to learn this skill on their own through trial and error. It helps if they have siblings and/or other cats they can watch and learn from as well. Although I was unable to find any formal documentation or guides on ""how to train your cat to climb down"", I did find this one which details how one owner trained their cats to climb down through the use of a harness, patience, and treats; the basic gist being, have your cat climb the post, then physically move their paws backwards/down. Personally, I would be hesitant to attempt to ""force"" your cat to learn through physical intervention because if its unpleasant for them, they may come to associate the climbing post with discomfort and avoid it altogether. If you are concerned with the cat injuring itself, you may do well to add some kind of padding underneath the post, or lower the platform some, though I would dissuade you from going overboard with such measures because if it becomes ""easy"" for the cat to simply leap off, then that will impede the speed at which they learn to climb down.

Why do neutered dogs still show sexual signs?,"It is a sign of dominance. By mounting other dogs, your dog tries to assert it's dominance, literally being the ""top dog"" (source: psychologytoday.com). Also, there may remain some hormone activity after being neutered.   I've personally known a young female dog who was neutered, but kept making ""passes"" at the housewife, whom she perceived as the pack leader. This behaviour went away over the year that followed.   And, it can happen when the dog is both excited and upset at the same time, feeling conflicted (source: vetstreet.com)."
How can I tell when it's time to stop playing?,"We had a Labrador Retriever that would run down and catch a Frisbee all day long.  When you threw it, she would run it down, catch it, and bring it back and kept doing it as long as you kept throwing it.   Because of this, it became necessary to have to cut her off more than once when she started to show signs of wearing down.   It's been a few years since the Lab passed, but from what I recall, the serious warning signs that our vet gave us were: However, it is best to stop the dog before it gets into a danger area of heat exhaustion or heat stroke.  We always tried to gauge just much she was actually catching her Frisbee and how quickly she brought it back.  If she let too many hit the ground, or was starting to trot back more slowly, we usually would take a nice long water break and get her inside."
How to determine the amount of fish that can live in a pond?,"A few points to note before we get down to actual numbers: When determining how many fish your pond can hold, both the surface area and volume of the pond are important. The surface is where oxygen transfer happens, so a deep pond with a small surface area will be able to hold less fish than a one with the same volume which has more balanced proportions. However, volume is also a factor: a pond that is too shallow can cramp the fish and not give them enough room to swim. Koi should not be kept in a pond that is less than 1 m deep. This careguide suggests you allow 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fish per square foot of surface area. This other careguide from the same company suggests allowing 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fish for every 13 US gallons (50 litres) of water. Personally, I would compute the number of fish using my pond's surface area, then again using the volume, and use the smaller of the two numbers (or close to it). Good filtration and water features could allow you to increase the fish capacity by up to double the (surface area) guideline above. Having more filtration will increase the number of fish you can keep because it will make the water cleaner as waste will be eliminated more promptly; water features will increase it because the water will get more oxygenated as the water bubbles and splashes around. However, these will only work up to a point - fish still need a certain amount of space no matter the cleanliness and oxygenation of the water. As an alternative way of thinking about it, here is how the above careguide describes the different pond sizes. The measurements are US gallons. If you are interested in larger ponds or lakes, there is a guide here on how many fish to populate your lake with. It's probably outside the scope of pet keeping but might be interesting as further reading. (Bear in mind that bigger ponds can tolerate much more variance, so I wouldn't advise using those figures and ""dividing down"" for a smaller volume.)"
Why does my cat lay down with me whenever I need to or I’m about to get up? Is this a common thing?,"Odds are, the cat is not lying down next to you every time you're about to get up. There are times when you get up without the cat lying down next to you, and time when the cat lies down next to you when you're not about to get up. However, because those times aren't remarkable, you don't remember them. Instead, you remember the times when the cat lies down next to you when you're about to get up. This is a flaw in human thinking known as confirmation bias, and you can see it in a broad range of human endeavors. If you want a definitive answer to why this occurs, you need to ensure that it is actually occurring, and that means that you need to numerically track every time you sit down, every time your cat sits down next to you, and whether they're sitting down next to you when you're about to get up."
My old cat died and I don't know how to deal with it,"Loss of a pet, for some people can be no different than losing a family member. The effect may be more intensely felt by children and teenagers compared to adults. Therefore, grieving after a pet is no different than grieving after losing a family member. Anything you can find online about grieving your parents or your children is relevant. As a disclaimer, I am not a psychologist so my suggestions are based on my experiences. The biggest problem you might face will be other people belittling your loss. Try to isolate yourself from people saying ""It was just a cat."" It is impossible for someone who never had a similar connection with a cat to your connection with Bee to anticipate your grief. Firstly, if you need a venue to express grief, you can organise a funeral. Carry out the funeral only with a small group of friends and family who knows you and your loss. A funeral can mark the closure of your life with your cat, Bee, and allow you to see grief of others touched by Bee's demise. After that, give yourself some time. If you are at school, have your parents talk to your teachers about giving you some space. If you are working, talk to your supervisor about it. Most people will accept your loss. If you find it hard to attend work or school, you can always talk to a GP or a psychiatrist to have some time off. Attend to your other cats. They are probably confused to why Bee is no longer around and if they have good relations with her, they will be grieving too. Not only you will be helping them, they will also help you. Until you feel better, minimise your presence on social media, especially with friends who would not understand you. You will hear many people saying ""But this cat looks like Bee, take her"". Ignore them and if possible, shut them off temporarily. It is not their fault that they do not understand you, they just cannot because they do not know how close someone can get with a pet. At the end, everyone processes grief differently so do not force yourself to do anything that you are not comfortable with. This includes all my suggestions here. Eventually, you will start to focus on the quality memories you had with Bee rather than her demise. I had hamsters for some time, and because of their limited lifespan, I witness the death of eight hamsters of mine. The bond you make with your hamster is not as strong the bond with a cat, however losing every single one of my hamsters hit me deeply. The loss of my 15 year old Maine Coon, Charlie, was even greater. I tried to take relish in how well he was looked after and how he outlived an average Maine Coon by three years. I took two days off work and prepared a folder with his photos and videos for my close friends who also loved Charlie. Then, I focused on my other cat, Sonny. My condolences, and I hope this helps."
How can I prevent my puppy from chewing on objects?,"""Buy a new pair of shoes and a woodworks lathe."" said an old man to me when I went about asking what and how should I prepare for my first dog (puppy). I said I can imagine why the shoes, but what's the lathe for? His prompt answer was ""you see, it is not nice to walk barefoot to a shoes dealer; that's why you buy the new shoes now and hid them somewhere high up. And the woodworks lathe comes handy when you are constantly in need of new legs for your chairs and knobs for your drawers, it'll also become cheaper in the long run if you have your own lathe for the job."" The straight answer to your question is no, chewing can't be prevented.  At that age it is quite normal for a dog to chew after chewing. It is for the new teeth coming up and the worst of the chewing will end soon enough. Just keep on feeding your dog with things to chew. Not only toys and such, but also chewing sticks and bones. Even an adult dog will occasionally like to chew something, but for a puppy it is a necessity. The odd thing is they don't like to chew just anything. There's your job to find out what he'll like to chew and what not. My family is lucky to have two dogs who won't chew our shoes, though they did chew almost anything. You might use this in the training and socializing of your puppy. Use chewing sticks as reward for succesful obeying of ""Here"" command. After all, that's the most important command you'll need to drill into a dog's nerve system, so you might as well use such rewards that your puppy will value highly at the moment.  There is something I am not quite sure about, but I'd think it good that your dog is not drawing an equal mark between ""I'm bored"" and chewing. You should do good to make him associate chewing with play and training and fun and rewards from you. Later in life, when you are at work and your dog is home alone and gets bored in waiting for you to return - there is a chance he won't start chewing down your furniture if he doesn't connect boring and chewing."
How can I prevent my cat from making a mess when he eats?,"I can think of two possible solutions, having experienced this problem myself. The first would be to use a dish with higher sides as long as feeding is still physically possible. You may also purchase a dish that has sides that curve inward so that the cat cannot push the food over the sides (see picture).  Now this may not be the exact style of bowl that will work, it is just an example. Plus you should probably use a safer material than glass. The edges could curve inward more drastically and even curve downward after inward. The base should probably also be more solid and larger so that it won't be easy knocked over. The second solution would be to place a mat under the dishes. I have used placemats but you could use something with edges, such as a rubber shoe mat. This makes for easy cleanup. You remove the dishes, shake the mat off into the garbage, and put it back. If you have a vacuum cleaner, they are pretty easy to clean off as well. Edit: I have found a commercial solution if you desire to try this instead. I have never tried it yet it seems to have good reviews on amazon. I will provide the link and you can peruse the reviews and decide if you are interested. Link: The Neater Feeder"
My cat vomited a big piece of plastic,"As @Cris says, you'll want to take your cat to the Vet right away. Right now, you don't know the scope of the problem and although a single piece of plastic has been vomited, there could be more. You must get a professional opinion to rule out any hidden internal damage.  Once your cat has been seen and the vet is confident that there is no additional problem there's a few other things you can look at. It isn't uncommon for cats to eat plastic (although often softer bags and packaging rather than rigid plastic). For example, cathealth.com lists a few reasons for cats eating plastic including nutrient deficiency, stress or an underlying medical condition. You might hear people throw around the term 'Pica' which concerns eating things which, normally, aren't considered to be nutritious. You noted in your question that they were not eating correctly and it has been very hot. These are things which could stress your cat. Generally, I'd suggest taking your cat to the Vet if they stop eating for periods of time and vomit if there is no visible cause. There's a really great answer here which discusses why a cat might vomit and when to take them to the vet.  One other thing to note is that if the cat has been spending more time doing very little (because of the heat) you might find that they are generally less interested in food because of this. Check out this question about helping cats during heatwaves. It probably goes without saying (and the vet will offer better advice than I can) but you'll want to keep a close eye on your cat for the next few weeks and ensure that there aren't any other problems."
"Can a cat, who only lives in a (small) flat, be happy?","We have a few existing posts about how much space a cat needs, I have included some below. Your area is large enough for a cat. But even a larger space will not be sufficient without enough enrichment, so having toys, and things to climb on will make a big difference.   Each cat is going to have a unique personality. So you need to consider the cats personality when choosing your pet. A cat with a history of living on a farm, is not going to do as well as one who spent their entire previous life in a small apartment.  Most cities that have small flats are also going to have cat rescues or shelters.  Contact a cat rescue near you, should give you opportunity to find a cat that is good match for you and your apartment.  Related:"
How can I keep my cat from being scared any time he sees or hears a person?,Here are some suggestions that may help:
Why does my cat's nose get wet when purring?,"Often cats will drool when they're happy. My youngest boy will drool a big puddle on me every day if I let him. I suspect that your cat's nose is getting wet from a small amount of drool. Normally drool isn't anything to worry about. It can indicate state of mind (cats drool when they're happy/relaxed, and also when they're nervous). However, drool can occasionally indicate dental problems, especially if your cat has started eating less. A two and a half year old shouldn't have a drastic change in schedule, so depending on how much more she's sleeping it may be worth a call to your vet. Make sure you're specific about how much more she's sleeping (if she's not greeting you at the door after work, that's probably not a big deal, but if she doesn't wake up for meals or playtime, that's a much bigger concern)."
How do I bathe my cat?,"A cat will fear drowning far more than being wet.
Having feet on the ground should make it a lot calmer about the process."
What is the importance of UV radiation to pet reptiles?,"Reptiles can see much farther into the UVA spectrum than humans… more so than can be provided by ""regular"" light bulbs. This allows them to perceive patterns and colors beyond what we can see. Depriving them of a large portion of their visible world can cause serious health issues, as well as physiological and behavioral abnormalities. Leaving a reptile blind to half of their environment causes unnecessary stress, which will generally affect their overall well-being. Lack of UVA light can impair a reptile's ability to recognize friend from foe. The UVA spectrum is used to recognize patterns of their fellow species from other animals, and plays a big role in helping them detect movement. It also helps them recognize their diet foods and generally stimulates the appetite by telling them what's good to eat. UVA also provides the visual cues that controls the basking instincts that they need to regulate their body temperature. UVA generally promotes more activity, foraging, social behaviors and reproductive activities. UVB light controls the synthesis of vitamin D3 through the skin, which is needed to metabolize and absorb calcium and other minerals. The need for UVB varies by species. Generally speaking, diurnal reptiles (active during the day) need UVB to manufacture vitamin D3. Nocturnal species (primarily active at night) will typically meet their vitamin D3 needs through their food source. Do your research on your chosen reptile. Without enough vitamin D3, reptiles can suffer from chronic calcium deficiencies leading to bone deformities. Vitamin D3 is also important to proper organ development and regulating the immune system. Reptiles that do not get enough vitamin D3 at a young age can even lose the ability to synthesize D3 through UVB absorption at a later age. Most reptiles do not exhibit signs of these illnesses until they are quite advanced and beyond help, so do your research. Another note of caution: I have been to a lot of pet stores that sell reptiles as a side line, and received a lot of bad advice throughout. They simply do not know what they are selling, so you have to do your research. Manufacturers learned long ago that herp enthusiasts were being told to ""use full spectrum lighting"" so anything that might typically be considered broad spectrum is being marketed as full spectrum. The amount of UVA and UVB output by a fixture can vary greatly. The needs of different reptiles vary greatly. Supplements range from somewhat helpful to actively harmful in overdose situations. But this all goes well beyond the scope of this question."
What are some effective non-chemical methods for controlling the snail population in an aquarium?,"One piece of advice I've seen is to use bait to lure the snails out, and then physically remove them.  This may help you keep up with them. Methods of baiting range from simple (put a large piece of lettuce in your tank, turn down the lights, and wait a few hours) to more involved (build a small ""trap"" by placing food the snails will find attractive in a container big enough to hold a bunch of the snails, but too small for your fish to get into to eat the bait). Another popular non-chemical option is to find fish that eat snails, and add them to your tank.  Loaches appear to be good choices, if available; especially the clown loach or yoyo loach. Puffers are also mentioned, but they can be aggressive towards other fish, so probably aren't a good solution. You can also help keep their numbers in check by cutting down on their available food.  Avoid overfeeding your fish, and periodically clean your gravel.  You can also add algae eating fish, such as sucker fish (be careful which kind of suckers you get, as some can grow quite large, and therefore require a larger aquarium to ensure their health). I found some good overall resources/guides for snail control: http://www.thinkfish.co.uk http://www.aquariumfish.net  http://freshaquarium.about.com"
Do cats dream or is it just restless sleep?,"Cats do dream when they sleep. The phenomena you are observing is related to sleep patterns that are also observable in human beings. There were (perhaps unfortunate studies) performed on cats to demonstrate the part of the brain responsible for for allowing  movement when  dreaming. A phenomena called  REM sleep without atonia (RWA), Michel Jouvet did some, now, famous experiments on sleeping cats, where he created lesions in the peri-locus coeruleus and demonstrated the variation between paralysed REM sleep and RWA. From this they were able to deduce the part of the brain responsible for preventing movement during sleep. REM sleep without atonia (RWA) and ""oneiric"" behavior that could only be explained by ""acting out dreams"" (or ""dreaming out acts""),  (1)  References:"
How do I determine the gender of a snail?,"Snails are hermaphrodite: Don’t waste your time trying to tell the males and females apart. This is because snails are hermaphrodites, meaning that they have the reproductive organs of both sexes on them, therefore they are able to produce both sperm and eggs. When they are mating they will both conceive and lay eggs. source: http://www.snail-world.com/#Hermaphrodites So, if you have snails and want to know who is who when they are mating, you´ll find out that both are playing male and female role at same time."
"How can I train my cat to stop ""demand meowing"", but not ""request meowing""?","We have several Siamese (a breed known to be more talkative than normal), and when they want something WE KNOW (even when we don't know what it is that they want).  We've also done some basic voice training commands. Is there a way to stop her from vocally demanding something without dissuading her from politely asking, or is this just too confusing for her? I'm not sure how you would differentiate this in the training enough to make it clear to her without being confusing. The difference is really just ""don't meow enough to be annoying"" and I (as another human) wouldn't know exactly where that line is. The only way I think it would work would be to instead train her to some behavior that   So, for example, sometimes our most bossy cat will just sit quietly by her food bowl when she's hungry and wait for food to magically appear. We laugh at her, but we could encourage that behavior since it's a non-annoying way for her to tell us that she's hungry.  Will us waiting out the nonstop meowing eventually get her to stop doing it in general? In my experience, no. Eventually you'll learn to tune it out or get used to it (or lock yourself in the bedroom or turn the TV/radio up louder). Or is there perhaps a way to distract the cat into forgetting about what she so adamantly wants in the first place? Sometimes? It depends on what the cat wants and what you're trying to do.  Usually Ginger yells at us for attention, so if I put her in my lap that's close enough to what she wanted that she quiets down for awhile, even if I'm not actually paying attention to her. If the cat is bored (which may be why she wants to go outside), try an interactive wand toy. If the cat is hungry, try a puzzle feeder with a small amount of food. I'm not exactly giving the cat what she wants, but I am giving her a small part of what she wants, while stimulating her mind and providing excitement. I think these things help a lot for a typical bored housecat."
How should I trim the wings of my bird?,"The other answer is good but there are some important things to note about when, how and why should be done if you decide to clip your birds wings. Clipping of the wings is usually done to either as a safety precaution to prevent the bird from hurting themselves while indoors, or it may be done as an attempt to pacify a difficult or aggressive bird and encourage them to be more sociable and easier to handle.  Many pet birds, especially larger ones like parrots achieve flight through speed and may not be able to break away or change momentum quickly enough to prevent running into walls or windows which can lead to injury. Flighted birds have two sets of flight feathers, primary and secondary.  Secondary feathers help with maneuvering and gliding and also support maintaining flight.  Primary flight feathers are longer and towards the end of the wing.  They are crucial for the bird to take off and achieve vertical lift.  When clipping be sure to only clip the primary feathers and never clip them below half of their original size.  If done properly it is not painful for the bird and they should be able to still safely glide or fly downwards without falling. They may still fly vertically but it should be very exhausting for them to do so, discouraging too much dangerous flight activity indoors. 
Above shown is a chicken but the process is the same Generally to get the bird ready to clip you should pick them up gently with a towel and attempt to cover their face so they can't see.  It is less stressful for the bird when done quickly and gently.  If you are unsure then it is best to consult a veterinarian for assistance or for instruction in how to perform this procedure in your home.  Be careful to hold their head steady, they don't generally like this and get a little bitey! It is crucially important not to clip a birds wings until a good time after they have been fledged.  Learning to fly is one of the most crucial parts of a birds development and doing this at too early an age can have serious and permanent developmental affects on the bird physically and psychologically.  They may have poor development of breast muscles that prevent proper flight as adults, and in other cases may have psychological and confidence issues, or may have difficulty bonding with humans or other birds. When purchasing a flight bird as a pet, ensure that the breeder or pet store owner allows the bird to be fully weened and have a good amount of time to master flying before they clip wings.  There are many breeders and pet stores only concerned with money and not with the animals well being. When clipping also check for swollen or infected blood feathers as they may be more common.  Sometimes a fall or an accident can cause a clipped feather to start to bleeding then it very well may not stop on its own, in which case it is highly important to seek immediate assistance from a veterinarian or pluck the feather yourself if you are comfortable doing this. Other Important Notes Pet birds that have been clipped tend not to get as much exercise as they would normally get in the wild (barring domesticated birds like chickens).  It is important they get extra mental stimulation and physical exercise to prevent too much muscle loss. Remember that birds molt periodically (frequency depends on the species), so clipping flight feathers is not a permanent change. Allow new feathers to grow in fully before clipping again. When the feathers are still growing, they have active blood vessels in them. Trimming these blood feathers' can cause the bird to lose blood.  If the bird happens to be bleeding from a cut blood feather and you cannot stop the bleeding, then plucking the damaged feather completely will generally help it stop.  If you are not comfortable doing this or you are unable to then consult a veterinarian immediately!  You can identify a blood feather by noticing the dark or red colour part way up the shaft of the feather from the skin."
Can cats survive solely on dry food?,"The short answer is ""yes"". The longer answer is yes, a cat can be fine on a diet of only dry food. Most of the dry food brands are formulated to contain all the nutrients a cat needs.  The main thing to be careful of is that cats tend not to drink enough (since in the wild they get most of the liquid they need from their prey) so you do need to make sure the cat always has access to fresh water and learn the signs of dehydration.  Your cat could simply prefer the dry food. Cats have definite preferences - with our three we have one fussy eater who turns up her nose at the wrong kind of wet food, one who'll eat anything that resembles food, and one somewhere in between. "
Are dogs carnivores?,"Dogs are carnivores.  They need meat to be healthy.   Dogs are carnivores, not omnivores. Dogs ARE very
  adaptable, but just because they can survive on an omnivorous diet
  does not mean it is the best diet for them. The assumption that dogs
  are natural omnivores remains to be proven, whereas the truth about
  dogs being natural carnivores is very well-supported by the evidence
  available to us. That they can eat human left overs is an artifact of domestication in that it was a trait that would help an animal survive if it could eat left over food scraps it became more valuable.  When dogs were first domesticated (prehistoric times) they were primarily kept around to take care of rats and other rodent pests.(source)  Since table scraps would often attract these rodents a dog who would clean up the scraps would be more beneficial to the man.  In addition this extra nutrition would help the dog survive during lean times. How will not feeding them meat affect their health? Dogs [do not] have the kinds of friendly bacteria that break down
  cellulose and starch for them. As a result, most of the nutrients
  contained in plant matter—even preprocessed plant matter—are
  unavailable to dogs. This is why dog food manufacturers have to add
  such high amounts of synthetic vitamins and minerals (the fact that
  cooking destroys all the vitamins and minerals and thus creates the
  need for supplementation aside) to their dog foods. If a dog can only
  digest 40-60% of its grain-based food, then it will only be receiving
  40-60% (ideally!) of the vitamins and minerals it needs. To compensate
  for this, the manufacturer must add a higher concentration of vitamins
  and minerals than the dog actually needs. (source)"
What harm will soap water do to my dog?,"It basically does the same thing to dogs that it does to humans, which means he's in for a bit of an upset tummy, a whole lot of gas, and very likely uncontrollable bowel movements depending on how much he drank and how soapy the water was. It should pass fairly quickly, but if it doesn't you should definitely contact a vet. Also, read the label to see if there's anything in that soap but soap that might be toxic - if the label advises you to contact a poison control center if ingested, then you should definitely contact your vet. If it's household dish soap or similar, you probably don't have much to worry about - but do check. Just make sure he's got plenty of water and make sure he's got enough water (he can dehydrate due to a very active bowel, just like humans can). It's also probably a good idea to keep him in a comfortable shady spot outside for a while for ermmm .. environmental reasons :) Note - dogs have a pretty good sense on what they can and can't digest (though it's not perfect by far). If there was enough soap in the bin to really make him sick, he probably would not have drank it, or at least stopped after the first taste of it. Just keep an eye on him, he'll be fine."
Can I make my own driftwood for my fish tank?,"It's possible, what you're going to want to do is water-log the wood so that it sinks. If it's a small piece, you can drastically shorten the time it takes to water-log it by boiling it constantly for one to three days depending on how hard the wood is. Once the wood is waterlogged enough to sink in water it's ready. Boiling it also helps to rid the wood of any bacteria and/or parasites that might be on it. If the wood is too big to fit in a pot, you'll need a container that's big enough to hold the wood submerged in hot water. Unless you're able to keep the water at a boiling temperature, this process is going to be much slower, lasting several months (The natural process of  water-logging wood takes about four to six months). Submerge the wood in boiling water and let it sit. Every other day you're going to want to perform water changes, taking some of the old water out, and replacing it with clean, boiling water. As the wood sits in the water, it will release what is called tannins. The tannins won't harm anything, but it does make the water cloudy, so it's best to get rid of it as much as possible before you put it in your fish tank. Depending on how you want your wood to look, after a week or so you should be able to start working the bark off. Taking off the bark should speed up the process a bit. If you want to keep the bark on, you'll still want to take a hard brush and scrub the bark to get as mush of the loose parts and dirt off as you can. Keep doing the process of changing the water every other day, and scrubbing the bark once a week, for about two or three months. By that time the water should have seeped into the wood enough to make it sink. If it hasn't you can continue, or weigh it down in your fish tank if you want, by then there shouldn't be much more for tannins leaching into the water. Some thoughts: I prefer to avoid picking wood that's been in the water already. While it will give you a head start, you also have to make sure you don't bring along any hitchhikers (snails, leeches, small invertebrates). While it takes longer to water-log wood from dry land, simply submerging the wood in hot water should get rid of any hitchhikers there. If the wood you find is small enough to fit in a pot to boil it, then it shouldn't be a worry. Some people suggest adding a tiny bit of bleach to kill the bacteria and hitchhikers when you can't boil the wood. The problem I have with this, is if you don't successfully get rid of the bleach it could seriously harm your fish, which is why I don't suggest it personally. I've heard using saltwater helps (saltwater as in ocean water, not adding table salt), but I haven't tried it myself. If I was able to at the time, I would have dropped a aquarium heater into the bucket to keep the water constantly warm. A broken heater that would keep the water boiling would be nice too. To get the bleached driftwood look. You'll have to take off the bark, then bake it under a heat lamp for a couple months before water-logging it."
Should I regularly feed my cat catnip?,"I have not come across any cases of catnip overdose where the cat did anything worse than vomit. Some cats know when they've had enough, and some cats don't. Luckily, there doesn't seem to be any harmful side-effects. So the cats that don't know any better don't risk harming themselves. I can't say that I've seen any behavior indicating addiction either. I would still avoid feeding it to your cat excessively, since the large amounts do cause them to vomit. It also causes diarrhea, which means at the very least, it causes a disruption in their digestive system. I would definitely avoid giving catnip to pregnant cats, as it's known to be a uterine stimulant. Here's a link to the American Veterinary Association's article on it. They mention a study on rats that showed they were more susceptible to seizures while on catnip. I would take it with a grain of salt, though, unless you find the study and they accounted for the dosage and  differences in hearts/size."
Will my pet get sick drinking from the toilet?,"I'm not aware of any studies or research showing there's a problem for the pet. This article sums up the current knowledge pretty well. But, honestly, there’s nothing in the bowl that she wouldn’t be better
  off not having. The short version is that as long as you don't have additives in the water and you're flushing after you use it, the water in there is likely to be cooler and fresher than the water in the pet's water dish. As the article points out, cool, flowing water indicates to the pet's instincts that the water is safer to drink, as it is less likely to harbor dangerous algae than warm, still water. I can say from my experience that even a not terribly agile cat can drink from the big porcelain bowl - my 18 year old cat with arthritis manages to get herself up on the seat and drink from the bowl. She usually manages to get her feet wet and splash water everywhere as well... Curiously enough, the two younger cats (one is 6 and the other is 8) don't show any interest in the big white water bowl. The article suggests that if you don't want your pet drinking from the toilet, a pet drinking fountain that's providing a constant source of flowing water is likely to help."
How can I stop my dogs from barking at animals on television?,"Have you tried counter-conditioning your dogs using a positive (reward) based approach? That is, when the dogs start their behavior use a ""tasty treat"" to train them to turn away from the TV and sit quietly facing you on some cue. It may take several steps to train the complete behavior. I would suggest either consulting a good modern book on dog training or getting help from someone who is familiar with using reward based training methods. A common objection to this approach is the belief that by rewarding the dogs, you would just reinforce their unwanted behavior. This reflects a common misunderstanding of dogs and a dog's attention span by humans. The link below is to a video on Dr Sophia Yin's web site where she demonstrates that it actually does not work this way.
Training Aggression? Counter-conditioning a Dog to Blowing in Face. As Dr Yin explains in the video, the purpose of the treats in this case is to change the dog's underlying emotional state. Instead of an image on the TV being a reason to be alarmed, it becomes a ""good"" thing because it means a treat may follow if they behave properly. Using aversives such as remote ""shock"" training collars is one of the worst ways to train a dog. It's not so much that you won't have an effect on the dog's behavior. It is that you won't know with a good degree of confidence what a dog is learning. People, being people, think it is ""obvious"" that if the dog is shocked while barking it will make a direct connection between the shock and the barking. But if you view it from the dog's perspective, the dog has no idea from where or why the pain is coming. So how can you know in what ways it may change the dog's behavior? You would also definitely increase the dog's anxiety level and that is never a good thing since it could lead to other behavior problems in another context. If a dog stops barking but then also begins to pee or poop in the house or chew or otherwise destroy property, would you be happy with the net results? Yes, humans have used aversives as the primary training method for (probably) millennia. But this says more about how easily and completely people can misunderstand how dogs learn that it does about what training methods are most effective. It was not until the last decade or so that behavioral research confirmed that using a reward based approach with minimal aversives produces the quickest and most consistent training results. This is becoming the standard approach with professional dog trainers. It is unfortunately taking much longer for the general public to catch up.  Here is a link to a blog entry by Dr Patricia McConnell, ""Simply Wrong"". It begins with some observations about a particular type of shock collar she saw an ad for, the SimpleLeash. She gives examples of other interpretations a dog can make about the ""shock"". From a comment by Chad:
We correct the behavior now and have for 3 years. But the behavior
  remains until they are scolded they bark. If you have not yet tried to counter-condition the behavior, then I would urge you to do so. It sounds as though all you have trained them to do is bark until you bark back at them. I think teaching them a more acceptable, alternate behavior they can engage in would be more effective. At the shelter I volunteer at we usually use counter-conditioning with dogs who react to other dogs. It can be very effective, but can also take a lot of repetition to generalize. It depends on the dog and how consistently you can train the alternate behavior.  While it's not pertinent, I personally find it interesting that you say you ""scold"" them. This is so quintessentially human. We have many behaviors which are so much a part of our being that it can be very hard for us to believe they might not be the most effective way to interact with another species. Humans talk. We love to vocalize. But there is compelling anecdotal evidence that, at least initially, it is easier for a dog to understand hand signals than verbal cues. We also love to hug. Dogs, in general, not so much. To Hug or Not?"
What quality of life will my cat have after edentation?,"Edentation, or the removal of all teeth, is a common solution to feline stomatitis when no other solution can be found. My experience with it has been entirely positive, and I've talked to several cat owners who have also had cats with stomatitis who have removed their cat's teeth and no one has ever said to me that they regret the decision. It's a relief to know that my cat is no longer in pain from eating. Here's my experience: My cat, Hunter, had mild stomatitis for several years when it suddenly flared so badly that his gums looked like balloons. We treated him with antibiotics (which reduced the acute flare), and then spent a few months trying several different experimental treatments my vet found in veterinary journals. Nothing helped, so we had his teeth removed. It's been about two years, and he's been back to the vet twice for his mouth. The first time, we noticed that once the swelling in his gums went down and everything healed, he had a bone spur on his jaw. It never would have become an issue if he had his teeth, but it was poking through the gum tissue and causing irritation, so the vet opened his gums, filed it down, and stitched everything back together.  The second time, a small root was surfacing. It had probably broken off during the extraction (which was done by my general vet, not a dental specialist). The vet was able to get it out with only mild sedation (not full sleep). His mouth is leaps and bounds better than it was, no redness or puffiness at all. He eats food just fine. He drops it a little more than he used to, so the floor is a little messier, but he'll eat a whole meal at once rather than a bite or two and walking away (we assumed that was because his mouth hurt). We feed wet and dry, and he has no problem with either."
How can I resolve a fish conflict in my aquarium?,"A lot of pet stores - particularly those dedicated to aquariums - will happily take unwanted fish off your hands.  So if that ends up the case, and you can't put them in another tank, call around and see if any stores will take them.  Often the fish just end up getting resold by the store.  I've heard some stores may even give you store credit towards the fish you 'trade in', though I've never asked for such.   Never release them into the wild unless that's the habitat they came from.  They'll almost certainly die right off the bat, and if they do survive, you risk introducing an invasive species (such as the Lion fish off the US East Coast and pythons in Florida) or a disease/parasite into the local habitat."
Why does my dog wipe his paws on the grass after he poops?,"The behavior in wolves is known as ""scrape behavior""; it is also present in their domesticated relatives.  According to Canine Behavior: Insights and Answers (Bonnie V. Beaver) the activity is commonly seen to be a visual marking, the scrapes, as well as a means of spreading scent to mark territory (as noted, dogs have scent glands in their paws). This activity happens most often in new areas, in the presence of other dogs, and in the early mornings. (Chapter 8, page 251). It is possible to train your dog out of this behavior if you so desire. Basically, it involves distracting him immediately after his activity with something like a treat in order to get him out of the habit."
Can walking past my cat at night disturb her sleep?,"So, first thing to note... Cats tend to actually be more active at night and so, if you're sleep disturbing then, the impact is probably lessened. Having said that, I don't think you need to worry. Why? Because cats have very different sleep patterns (pg 9) than we do and are more often in a light doze than a deep sleep as a result of being predator aware. You're also not around them 24 and 7, so any sleep loss that might have resulted from your incidental night passage is likely going to be made up at a different time. She may enjoy the petting (we do this to ours all the time), but I think if you want her to go to sleep faster, then this is actually counterproductive. If she likes it, however, keep it up. :)"
How do I stop my dog from eating things he finds during our walks?,"He is doing this because dogs are curious and like eating things that are not dog food. You can train your dog to avoid that but he'd still have to be very close to you even off-leash for supervision. Some dogs are extremely tempted by food and it's a hard behavior to break especially if your dog isn't trained. In a controlled environment put small treats on the ground and let your dog off the leash slowly. Every time he approaches a treat on the ground give him a firm ""No"", when the dog does not eat them or loses interest in them reward him with a bigger treat. Repeat this exercise with bigger treats on the ground and longer distance. This can take a while and success requires determination. Report results and let us know :)"
Do ferrets get along with other pets?,"Is it true that ferrets don't get along with other pets? The answer is a qualified ""no"". I had two ferrets. The oldest was always, always happy to make new friends, regardless of the species.  He was very excited to play with any new dog or cat he met, and would do the ferret ""bounce"" that typically indicates play. My other ferret was more curious than playful when it came to other species, but I wouldn't say she didn't get along with the other animals.  It was more that she was simply disinterested in them as play companions (she was very attached to any other ferret she met, though). However... every cat that saw my ferrets immediately freaked out.  The moment they caught scent of the ferrets, they were immediately on the alert, and when they saw my ferrets, the responses were invariably flight, or hunting/stalking/aggression. My friend's golden retriever was fascinated with the ferrets, and would gently poke at them with his paws, while my one ferret bounced back and forth in play. Whether the ferrets and the other pets get along is largely a factor of the temperament of each individual animal, as well as the circumstance in which they met.  I do know some people who have had both cats and ferrets living in peace together in a household, so they are certainly capable of learning to like each other.  I would suggest that the same steps for introducing new cats to each other be used for introducing ferrets to cats.  Go very slow, and take a bit more time with each step than you would with two cats.  Be aware, also, that ferret play typically consists of behavior that most cats will initially confuse with aggression: lunging with an open mouth, nipping, and attempting to leap onto the playmate's back for a nip at the scruff of the neck. The last one is particularly problematic, as ferrets have rather sharp teeth, but very thick, loose skin, so a ferret can grab another ferret by the scruff quite hard without causing serious discomfort, but a cat will most certainly not appreciate it. I would also be very cautious about introducing a ferret to other species of common pets.   Other ""pocket pets"" such as mice, hamsters, gerbils, etc., birds, or reptiles may actually trigger hunting instincts in a ferret, and the resulting interaction may result in serious injury or even death for the smaller creatures. Similarly, kittens or puppies would be at risk from a ferret that doesn't know how delicate they are."
What's a suitable way to drive with a big dog in the car?,"Depending on the country someone will be driving your dog in, some laws may be in effect about this topic. The best way to know is to ask your vet about this. For example, here in France, you have to make sure that the dog will, in no circumstance, be able to reach the driver if sitting on the backseat. So a net is in order if you are not using the belt. Here is the ""kit"" I'd suggest: I did not use a sheet until recently. The only reason we decided to get it is because the dog started to love swimming... Enough said :) But since then, he has an easier time staying in place, before he would slip a bit. Note: the sheet we got required some small modification for us to be able to pass the seatbelt through. But it prevents the dog from reaching the driver so the belt was really just for the dog's safety. The sheet I am trying to refer to:  EDIT: Coming back to this question/answer after a while I do realize that not enough emphasis was put on the fact that the safety of your car should be your last concern after taking care of the driver's safety, other occupants safety, and dog safety. A driver getting his elbow pushed by the dog who's asking for a scratch may become the cause of an accident..."
How do I know if my toddler is making a cat dangerously uncomfortable?,"Some basic signs: A cat will try to escape from an unwanted embrace, I assume this is what you mean by steps out. This is not a problem, unless the cat is prevented from escaping, then she is more likely to scratch your son. Growling (cat growling, that low lying ethereal sound cats can make) or hissing.  Tail wagging, cat being opposite to dogs, a swishing tail is a sure sign of a potentially aggressive cat. I think it serves to assist as a distraction for prey or predators. Ears, a cats ear will sometimes flatten or point backwards when they are not happy.  How to teach your son. If the cat displays these signs its time to teach your son (as best you can a 3 year old), ""no cat's not happy say 'bye bye' pussy cat"".  Perhaps showing him that just patting the cat is a good thing. ""Let's say hello to the pussy cat with gentle pats"".   With lots of praise, ""see the pussy cat likes this"", ""look she's not running away"", or ""she's making her happy sound (purring)"". A point to be emphasized is, to not allow your son to pick up other people's cats (or dogs). As a cat can scratch a person, without warning, trying to escape an unwanted embrace. As the cat tries to escape when your son attempts to pick him up, it is a sign the cat does not wish to be picked up (and honestly most cats do not enjoy being picked up by small children). So I would reiterate, to encourage your son to offer gentle pats in lieu of attempting to embrace the cat. Teaching small children things is a bit like training dogs, except training dogs is much easier :7)"
Is there truth to the idea that changing food too often make your dog sick?,I think it's a myth. My sister has two dogs: a Labrador and a French Mastiff. She often modifies their diet to give them equal proportions of calcium and protein as required. She always switches between food types and brands and it has never created any problems at all. I have been in touch with few dog owners who feed their dogs the same way; they have never had any problems due to it. But avoid doing so when they are puppies. Puppies take a little more time to adjust in food changes and can react negatively.  My sister's Labrador disliked the food change when he was a puppy but now he doesn't care and eats what we serve.
How do I control the convict fish population of my aquarium?,"To tell which are the girls, which are the boys: Juvenile convict cichlids are monomorphic until they reach sexual maturity. The male is mostly gray with light black stripes along the body. Males are larger than females, and they have more pointed ventral, dorsal and anal fins which often extend into filaments. In addition, older males frequently develop vestigial fatty lumps on their foreheads. Unusually for fish, the female is more highly coloured.[14] She has more intense black bands across the body, and pink to orange colouration in the ventral region and on the dorsal fin.
  (source: wikipedia) And to prevent they having sex... well: Sexually mature convicts form monogamous pairs and spawn in small caves or crevices. In the wild, the fish excavate caves by moving earth from underneath large stones.[14] Females lay the eggs on the upper or side surfaces of the cave to which they adhere.
  (source: wikipedia) So, perhaps, the best way would be separating males and females as soon as possible, and removing places where they would reproduce. But, of course, this can have undesired effects: when there are few opportunities to reproduce, they might get even more active. And some other solutions: give all them to someone else who wishes to have those species; begin to sell those little kids, and get a new aquarium :-)"
Why might my cat whine at night?,"Cats are considered to be crepuscular and/or nocturnal creatures. The exact nature depends on the cat itself.  In either case, they are generally more active at night, and less active during day which is why cats end up sleeping for most of the day. At night, they are more awake and can become restless since the whole house is sleeping. This is the most likely cause for cats whining/meowing at night. They can also whine for a variety of other reasons, if they are bored, disoriented, curious, hungry, and sometimes sickness causes them to whine as well. I don't think you are hurting your cat as you phrased it, it's just natural for cats. You will probably have to do some detective work to narrow down the cause if there is one particular reason that it is happening. Personally, my cat sleeps very well at night when I leave a nightlight turned on in the hallway. Generally we use the nightlight for ourselves (if we have to walk in the house at night but don't want to turn on actual lights), but this seems to have a calming effect on my cat. Perhaps this would solve your problem."
Why does my tortoise make a peeping or whistling sound while breathing?,"Consolidated analysis of responses to a similar question on
Tortoise Forum and Hermann Tortoise: For a question such as this, you should supply your habitat. Wheezing and clicking can occur with Redfoot tortoises when they lack proper humidity or are kept too dry. If you are concerned about shell rot due to increasing humidity, ensure the enclosure is kept clean and periodically clean your tortoise lightly with a soft toothbrush. Some red-footed tortoises just whistle regardless of humidity and health. In your particular case, I suspect this is due to humidity, but we would need more data and an implementation of a humidity plan to conclude this."
How can I train my guinea pigs to not attack one another?,"The second easiest way of eliminating fights is increasing their space i.e. give them a bigger cage. How big depends on the guinea pigs in question, but it needs to be big enough to fit at least one house per pig, and preferably one food bowl and one water bottle per pig as well.  The easiest way to stop female guinea pigs from fighting is to introduce a neutered male. Preferably a secure and dominant one. I do not believe you can train the pigs not to fight - they disagree about who's the boss and/or how that role should be managed. And I do not think neutering is the answer, it is quite risky to spay female pigs and nothing I would recommend. "
"In giving my cat a ""space"" (bed) on my desk, should I strictly enforce that she stay there only?","The important thing is to be as clear and consistent as possible. Keep the rules simple and the cat will learn them more quickly and reliably. When the cat starts to do the wrong thing, immediately but gently correct them. I found myself using a combination of ""no"", a hand gesture (hand held between them and the forbidden, back of hand toward them), and when necessary lifting them off the desk (if you do that you can't stay there). They picked up on this reasonably quickly ... a month or two, though they periodically check to make sure the rule hasn't changed. Mine are allowed on the desk but may not lie on the mouse and may not cross between me and the keyboard while I'm facing it. They're allowed to ask for attention but not demand it. They spend most of their time in the Kitty condo a few feet away, where they can watch me,  look out the window, and soak up heat from the radiator. That's another tip: give them good alternatives to behavior you're trying to discourage. "
How do I care for a quadriplegic rabbit?,"For descending paralysis, that is indicative of botulism, you can expect paralysis to continue to develop over several days (3 days in our case) and then progressively clear over several more days so the treatment will need to be readjusted as the paralysis changes. None of the following is intended to replace consultation with a qualified veterinary practitioner.  Always discuss treatment and seek prescriptions as needed from your veterinarian. Onset to stabilization Veterinary assistance is critical, some causes can be readily identified and treated.  Rapid treatment by an experienced rabbit vet can make a profound difference. There are several potentially fatal complications, with paralysis of breathing muscles the most difficult (impossible/impractical) to treat.  Other complications include infection and digestive issues, they develop over time and if watched for can be treated. Solution We provided soft flooring & area, removed her water bowl, and provided near 24 hour snuggling until she calmed down. Over a couple of days she adjusted to the new reality and was much calmer. Water is offered every 2 hours and if sufficient fluids are not drunk, subcutaneous fluids are given (as prescribed by your vet). Solution As well as keeping her as calm as possible and keeping the area clean and soft, we found that a towel folded to a height of about 3/4 inch (2 cm) thick helped to stabilize her head, keeping it better aligned and seemed to provide her increased comfort. She maintained some ability to move (flop) around during the entire event, and would generally reposition herself to continue use of the ""pillow"".  We monitored her eyes to make sure they stayed moist, and for presence of the ability to blink. Solution Talk to your vet! Do it soon, a few hours without food is probably OK, but after 12 hours it is getting critical and 24 hours... well, just don't go there.  In our case Ruby had acceptable jaw movement, swallowing and appetite.  The first 24 hours she had small meals every couple of hours. She had difficulty with hard food like pellets and hay, We mixed critical care with some of her normal pellets and water to make a mush.  Sitting cross legged on the floor, with her head draped over my thigh I could raise the bowl to her mouth and she could eat (video). By the third day she was eating 4 or 5 fairly large meals per day, she preferred thicker mush as time progressed. By about the 7th day she refused mushy critical care and pellets.  We transitioned her to dry pellets, lettuce and a couple days later added hay back to her diet.  I can not stress strongly enough how important every decision here can be, seek the best assistance you can find. Rabbits die from digestive upset, and they die if you fill their lungs with mush. Eating mushy food with a paralyzed head/neck can be messy.  Use a towel to protect your lap, and the surrounding area.  A warm moist wash cloth can be used to wipe your bunnies head and neck when she is done eating. We found that the area under the chin was most problematic to keep clean. Solution Up to the litter box every two hours. We used several methods to help protect in case of an accident (example) but our primary approach is get to the litter box regularly.  The first few nights I slept on the floor with her, and we got up to pee every 2 hours.  After the first few days we purchased incontinence pads used by bed bound humans, and moved ruby into our bed (after putting the mattress on the floor,so she would not get hurt if she fell off), continuing the every two hour potty break.  She has not wet the be yet.  This keeps her clean, dry and keeps her moving to prevent bed sores.   Because she has had much less fiber in her diet her her poops are much smaller, they occasionally stick to her fur but have been easy to remove.  Life Goes On After the first 3 days or so, things stopped getting worse.  Now we are on the road to recovery; we have feeding, sleeping, drinking & bathroom covered.  In activity is not a natural state for a rabbit (or person) to be in, a body expects to move around to keep.  Inactivity leads to it's own complications. Solution Monitor health closely, feed specific amounts of food and track your bunnies intake. You are already monitoring fluids, do the same for food in and poop out. If your bun seems unwell get a temperature (work with your vet to get a rectal temperature) a rabbit normally has a temperature of 101-104 °F (38.6–40.1 °C). Antibiotics may be required if there is a fever.  Following antibiotics you will want to consider recolonizing your rabbits gut bacteria. Any number of things can cause your bunny to feel a little off. If it not medical it could be her perception of the world, restoring a diet favorite, or modifying her environment to increase the feeling of comfort and/or security may help.  Use care in the feeding of treat foods as they can cause problems with gut bacteria. Solution When your rabbit is paralyzed to the point that it can not move around it's enviorment well, is not able to stand, walk or hop; it is time for physical therapy. Provide sufficient area for your rabbit to get as much exercise as possible on her own.  Once or twice a day provide passive range of motion through each limbs full ability.  Your vet can provide more information, but basically spend a few minutes on each limb moving it through all the positions it would see in a normal day for a non-paralyzed rabbit. Using a towel or scarf (maybe with holes for the legs) support your rabbit in a near normal position so her legs just touch the floor. Encourage her to move naturally.  Additionally wheel chairs are available, the majority found on the internet are for rabbits with rear leg paralysis, a quadriplegic is going to need a different solution.  Each rabbit will be different so working to customize a solution will be important. Solution while monitoring for her ability to chew and swallow solid foods. Re-introduce the regular diet, pellets, lettuce, greens.  You may have also included canned pumpkin (NOT pumpkin pie filling) to her diet to maintain fiber in her diet when she was not eating hay. You can continue the pumpkin in her diet. Hopefully at this point your rabbit has good control over head and neck, but may still lack the ability to get her body off the ground.  We use a towel rolled up and placed under her chest to elevate her so she can reach her food. Video 1, Video 2, Video 3 Solution To help make up for the lack of cecotropes in her diet, we have been feeding as much pellets and oat meal (dry rolled oats) as we could get her to eat. For the first 24 hours or so she would not eat the cecotropes even if presented to her.  We were not overly concerned as they are aged beyond normal, and she has been on several meds that probably had a negative impact on them.  Frequent checking to keep the area free and clear of these uneaten cecotropes and keeping her clean if any stick to her.  She is moving around better (but still has significant issues) it seems safe to start letting her sleep alone now (and potentially very yucky if she starts passing cecotropes in bed with us).  She still comes to bed for a while in the evening and morning, but back to her own room with, a soft, moisture resistant bed hay and water available all the time.  We are still getting up to help her to the litter box every 2 hours, and checking for cecotropes to keep the area clean.  She is occasionally turning around and eating the dropped cecotropes, but not consistently.  We encourage her to eat them as practical but are not fretting if she does not.  She has lost a bit of weight (3.35 kg - 2.80 kg = about 1 pound or 0.5 kg) so we are still encouraging a high food value diet.  Continuing Reglan (Metoclopramide) 1 cc, twice daily, every time we skip a dose she slows down on her eating considerably. Solution Continuing physical therapy 2 or 3 times per day. Full range of motion to keep joints flexible, muscles & tendons from contracting.  Start using an anti slip mat (like to keep throw rugs from sliding) to give her better traction. Instant improvement, with her footing more secure she is able to hold better posture and keep her limbs under herself better.  In the picture here the antislip mat is on a towel so any water spills will be contained.  The antislip mat was nearly magical solution, within hours she was moving around much better, we had to remove the exercise mat, and transitioned to just an incontinence pad with the anitslip mat over it. With in 24 hours she was hopping around, nearly normal, still a bit wobbly but a huge improvement. Ruby hopping around video 1 & Ruby hopping around video 2 At day 20 Ruby is nearly fully recovered. She has lost a lot of weight, and has been finicky about what she will eat.  Getting her back to her optimal weight and stabilizing there are on the task list now.  She lost a lot of muscle and does not have the strength or endurance she had 3 weeks ago before the event. She is able to get in and out of her room (small cage) and use the litter box on her own. She has full 24 hour access to her normal space (master bedroom) now, the mattress and box spring remain on the floor, and she is not quite able to jump up on the bed, herself yet. Physical therapy is now encouraging her to run around the room.  Her left rear leg is returned to near normal positioning and usage, but still has a ways to go before reaching 100%.  On day 21 she will be taking her last antibiotic (prescribed for elevated temp and listlessness), we will continue the Reglan for at least a few days after that, as we work to regain normal appetite and weight. After a month Ruby is 99.90% recovered, her left rear leg has been slow to recover fully. It has a tendency to be a bit more forward than it should be as if the ligament were stretched a bit, and have not returned to normal. At 6 weeks Ruby is 99.95% recovered, Unless you know what to look for, the left rear seems OK. She is back to her pre-event weight and behaving normally.  Just a normal happy snuggle bunny. This ends the journey of recovery for a quadriplegic rabbit.  Botulism remains the primary probable cause, see Why can't my rabbit lift it's head? Ruby is still doing fine. There are no signs of injury or loss of function related to the above. She is about 9 years old now and starting to show some slowness as she ages. Last year she stopped jumping up on the bed.

Do I need a bubbler in my aquarium?,"In general, the water flowing through your filter and agitating the water to mix it may provide enough oxygenation. Most of the oxygen absorbed into water is done at the surface; bubbling air through the water actually contributes a fairly low amount to dissolved oxygen, although the bubbles moving the water around might contribute to churning the more oxygen-rich water towards the bottom of the aquarium. Water temperature (warm water can hold less dissolved gas of all kinds, including O2) and plants (lots of plants/algae with not enough light for photosynthesis) can have an effect on oxygen levels as well. Absent any reason to think you have low oxygen levels (like your fish congregating around where the filter water is pouring and avoiding the lower parts of the tank), your waterfall is probably sufficient."
How should I correct my dog when I catch him drinking his urine?,"In response to some feedback, I'd like to explain clearly; the point of this answer is not to suggest that a dog drinking his own urine is by any means optimal, either for his health, or as a behavior, I am merely stating that if the animal is not let out to go to the toilet often enough and then does the best he can to correct his mishap; he should not be scolded for this. The idea behind this, is treating the cause of the behavior, rather than treating the symptoms. I am not disagreeing with @John's answer in principle; just providing an alternate  answer based on the reason your dog is relieving himself in the house; as per your linked question Why is my dog drinking his pee after he urinates inside?. Behaviour like this is normal, if the dog is not doing it outside, but only within the house. My answer here Why is my dog drinking his pee after he urinates inside? explains this in more detail. Given the dog is going with his natural instincts and trying to keep the den (your home) clean, I wouldn't go with any sort of negative feedback, as it's confusing to the dog.  The key to breaking this habit is to ensure you dog doesn't have any health problems preventing him from holding on to take your dog out for more frequent toilet breaks to provide, if possible, a dog door, so he can access the outdoors and relieve himself as needed. Although it is unpalatable to watch, urine (in it's healthy state) is sterile and no harm will actually come to your dog from doing this from time to time. After a bit of thought it also occurred to me; if you catch him in the act of doing this, it might be an idea to call him Rover! high pitched voice, in the tone of quick come and see this! and run to the back door with him and take him outside. It's not a direct reward for the behavior, but like an acknowledgment of yes, that's yuck, let's go outside and also serves as a complete distraction. Ingesting its own urine is very unlikely to cause any significant problems in a dog, since any organisms in the urine are already present in the dog's system. As long as another water source is freely available there should be no problem. Mike Richards, DVM"
Are simulated thunderstorms beneficial for a saltwater aquarium?,"Oddly enough, there are some articles about it. This article, Reactions in individual fish to strobe light. Field and aquarium experiments performed on whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus), deals with strobe light and whitefish, as its title says. Their conclusion is that fish will swim away from the strobe light and don't bother if it comes from behind. Since you describe a light from the top, they will hide from it too. Another article concludes that strobe light can be used as a barrier to some fish. I couldn't find any relationship to algae, O₂ or CO₂ level. So I think that it was just for decorative purposes - and, as some (or all) fish will avoid it, it doesn't seem to be a good decoration."
How much dominance is normal in 2 cats at play?,"I'm not fond of kittens and tend to get rescue kitties who are adults, so my advice is going to be based on my experience of mature, adult cats. I'm not sure if their young age would affect anything here, but I just wanted to point that out ahead of time. Your cats may have different play drives. The older cat wants to end the play session (thus, the chokehold) while the younger cat doesn't accept the signs that the older cat wants to quit until the older cat uses the chokehold. Some of this is likely normal until the younger cat learns the proper language signs for ""I'm done"" from the older cat. Or the older cat (who is still really young IMO) hasn't learned yet how to communicate that he's done except with the chokehold. What you can do is have your own play sessions with each cat to ensure that the youngest cat is getting enough play without having to harass the older cat for more play.  Interactive toys (like wand/string toys) are generally best for this.   To give you an idea of how much play is necessary, my two boys take about an hour to get tired and done playing. The boys are 9 and 4 (the girls don't like play time nearly as much for some reason).   The youngest boy spent a lot of time harassing the other cats (especially the oldest girl), but since I've made sure to give him enough play time and wear him out, they've actually become quite friendly and she tolerates him (she wouldn't let him get within several feet of her before).  It does definitely help! We also belled our harasser so that everyone else could avoid him if they wanted."
How to determine if a cat is generally at an ideal weight?,"If you want to know whether your cat is over- or underweight, the most reliable way to know is to take the cat to a vet. My vet can tell just by looking, even if she doesn't know the exact breed of cat. Barring that, it's better to look at body composition than actual weight measurement if we're going to talk in generalities. As people mentioned in the comments, different breeds have different weight ranges that can be considered healthy (anywhere from 5 pounds on the low end for breeds like Siamese to around 20ish pounds for Maine coons).  Here are some tips that you can use to tell generally whether a cat is a healthy weight: If you think your cat is obese, talk to a vet before implementing any sort of dieting program. Your vet can tell you for sure whether your cat is overweight or obese, as well as inform you of any health problems your cat currently has that might be related to an unhealthy weight. It's very important not to put cats on crash diets because if they lose weight too quickly, they can actually wind up with more health problems (and any pre-existing medical problems can be exacerbated)."
How does one stop a New Zealand rabbit from leaving droppings in the house?,"Rabbits are generally very cautious by nature, and when startled can leave a trail of droppings involuntarily. These are usually dry and easy (although understandably inconvenient) to clean up. It may be the case, that since these new areas are ""unfamiliar territory"" your rabbit is possibly getting spooked when its exploring. If possible monitor the situation and see if it improves with time. Alternatively, it may be attempting to mark its territory. While this is cute when they ""chin"" objects, droppings are less fun. However, again over time, when given the opportunity to feel at home in an area this behaviour should disappear. Likewise, try and slowly introduce areas to your rabbit. Set up gates so they can only explore smaller areas and retreat to safety easily."
Is there anything beyond preference that dictates whether dry food should be wet down?,"Dry dog and cat food should not be wet down if it is not going to be eaten in one sitting.  Moistened dry dog and cat food breeds bacteria. Part of the process that preserves the food for a longer shelf life is the dehydration. Moistened dry dog or cat food should be left out and treated as if leaving out wet dog or cat food. It should be picked up and discarded, when you would normally consider wet food has been out too long to be healthy. It doesn't need to be treated as if it is toxic after half an hour, by no means, it can sit there, but not for same the prolonged period that unmoistened dry food can be left out. Makers of dry dog food also advise this:   Another issue, which was discussed by @Baarn is that a dog (or cat) eating dry food will need to drink more water to counteract the dehydration processing of the food. The dry food is formulated with salt in a way to increase the pet's thirst, so they will crave more water, when eating dry food. If the dry food is wet down with water, this water contributes to the water needed to counterbalance the water needs of the pet. Any healthy pet will make up for this needed fluid b drinking.  It's always important to have an ample supply of fresh water for your dog or cat, especially when feeding with dry food, unless a qualified Veterinarian, who has examined your pet advises you not to do so.

What kind of paint is safe to use on a bird cage?,"To be honest I don't think any type of paint applied to a bird cage after the fact is a good idea. The paint that is applied to a bird cage is the negatively charged powder type that is typical in industrial processes where you want to ensure a strong long term bond to a smooth metal surface.  The metal cage pieces are positively charged while the paint is negatively charged causing the paint to adhere better than any DIY'er could do. If you attempt to paint the cage after the fact then likely it will chip off easily during cleaning, during beak sharpening or simply because rust will start forming underneath the paint and causing it to bubble.  Instead of painting I would suggest using a scour pad to rub off invasive rust as it forms, especially along the bottom of the cage where it is exposed to corrosive bird droppings.  As long as you keep up with this on a bi-weekly basis then you can get decades more life out of a rusty old cage."
Are ultrasonic repeller devices painful for dogs?,"I believe you are referring to a Riddex plug-in device.   I used to own one, and used it in my apartment where I lived with a dachshund. The instant I plugged the device in, a spider appeared on the wall from a vent, and crawled away down the hall.  This proved to me that the device actually did ""something"" to justify the manufacturer's claim.  My dog, a young dachshund with no known hearing issues (other than deliberately ignoring me when I ask him to do things), had no reaction to the device being plugged in.  To confirm he had no reaction, I plugged and unplugged the device multiple times, as this was a definite concern / deal-breaker for me if the dog was affected.  He did not react. At a later date, I replaced the Riddex with a newer version; same dog, no reactions.  This same dog does react to a dog whistle and a behavioral device, neither of which I can hear.  The description of the Riddex device claims it does not interfere with pets.  I only have my own experience to back this up. At some point, I stopped using the Riddex devices.  The first one died after a few years and I don't recall what happened with the second one.  I believe the devices become less efficient over time, but I have nothing to back up this claim.  I had not used Riddex in such a long time that I actually forgot I used to have one until I read this question.  As I live in a climate with many pests, I have hired an exterminator for regular maintenance."
Can a dog contract a sexually transmitted infection?,"Yes, dogs have risk of STD's or STI's. Canine herpesvirus and  Canine transmissible venereal tumor are among the diseases which can be sexually transferable among dogs. So you should always have to take care of it. (Source:vetinfo.com)"
How can I prevent my dog's frantic behavior when the doorbell rings?,"This is a tricky one to fix and that's because you don't want the dog to stop barking at all, especially if they're going to bark if you have an intruder. You do want to be able to stop the dog barking when you tell it to, though. First, let's examine a couple of things you should not do: Shout at the dog : You should never shout at the dog; this basically gives the signal to her that you are reinforcing the behavior by joining in. Give her affection : Your dog will see this as praise for barking, which is not what you want. Now, let's look at a couple that you can do: For more information, see the legendary Cesar Milan's full article on preventing dog barking."
How can I gauge a vet's experience with reptiles?,"The first thing I'd look for is a vet listed as an exotic-pet veterinarian because they're more likely to be able to care for reptiles than a normal veterinarian would be. It might be a different case in bigger cities where vets see a wider variety of animals, but I've not been impressed with the knowledge of non-exotic vets regarding animals other than cats and dogs. I believe this to be an issue of demand, which might change as reptiles become more popular as pets, subsequently being considered less exotic. Most vets probably do have some training with reptiles, but I wouldn't expect it to be as in-depth as a vet specializing in exotic pets. There's also the matter of how often they see reptiles compared to how often they see cats and dogs.  Even if trained with reptiles in school, if practicing on a reptile is a rare occurrence, their reptile training might diminish due to lack of use. Asking the obvious question, if they're trained to care for exotic pets (specifically reptiles), is best.  It should result in an answer of either yes or no. If the answer is no, you should follow-up asking whether they can recommend a properly trained vet in your area. I don't know of any vet who would lie about this, as (as it is with human doctors) it's a pretty big risk that if something goes wrong, they can be held liable for it. If you're worried a vet you're seeing isn't as capable of caring for reptiles as they say, ask a couple follow-up questions about their comfort levels with reptiles.   Follow with: You're going to have to use your best judgement to decide if you want to trust them. If no vets in your area are trained to care for your pet, that doesn't necessarily rule them all out.  A vet who is willing to learn and consult a specialist or reference manual if needed, is a much better option than not taking your pet to a vet at all.  It all comes down to a matter of using your best judgement on which vet to trust. With all that being said, I would say the best way to find vets who are qualified to care for exotic pets is by searching through the Association of Reptilian and Amphibian Veterinarians' website. They have a search feature for certified vets by state.  Likewise, there is an Association of Exotic Mammal Veterinarians, and an Association of Avian Veterinarians if you're into those types of pets. If nothing else, ask around.  Find a local group of reptile keepers or your pet store, and ask them which vet they use and trust.  It is the same as finding a vet for a dog or a cat; hearing personal recommendations is always helpful."
Rectifying behavioral issues stemmed from hitting my dog as punishment,"Being 10 months old, your dog has gone through much of her formative processes, this being said, there is much you can do to improve her behaviour, but you have a clearly defined personality limitation the work with.  Recovery of nose smacking  It would best to not smack her nose again, and make a habit of several times throughout the day of slowly approaching the side of her head (not her face) with the back of your hand to gently stroke the side of her head  and give her gentle verbal praise whilst petting her. It's a matter of regaining her trust (in terms of when your hand approaches her face). You need to convince her that your approaching hand means reward.  Being a small dog, there is a limit to how many food rewards you can give her in one day. If  she has a treat she is crazy for, put the treat in your left hand (for argument's sake) as you do the stroking exercise with your right hand and verbally praise her, you can slowly raise your left hand up in front of her so she eventually will look down and sniff and take it from her hand. Praise her verbally when she takes the treat ""that's a good girl"". Do this every second or third time you are doing the stroking exercise, it will reinforce the positive nature of the stroke and verbal praise. Scared of strangers  Many dogs react to a person putting their hand out. In this case, it would, most likely, be exacerbated by smacking the dogs nose as punishment. It is always better to offer the back of the hand in the direction of a strange dog and allow the dog to come to you and sniff. I would suggest, you proactively prevent people from attempting to pat her. You can do this by using you arm to prevent their arms from moving to close and suggest to them: look my dog is very timid, perhaps you can put your hand like this and show them how to approach you dog in a non threatening manner. Other dogs  Now, if another dog comes up to here, initially she will run a mile.
  If another dog doesn't acknowledge her, she'll either growl or run to
  see them. To me this sounds pretty normal for a small dog. To run away from a larger strange dog, is perfectly in accord within your dog's natural instinct. There are many larger dogs out there that maul small dogs. The act of running after a dog or growling at them if they ignore her is one of the characteristics I love about small dogs and their personalities. All bravo when the other dog has shown it is no threat. As a dog that will be a threat, is unlikely to walk pass and dismiss her. She is smart. Socialising in a dog club is always a good way to help your dog interact with other dogs. I prefer this for younger and/or timid dogs to begin with, as a dog club is more controlled, the owners are aware of any anti-social behaviour within their dog community and the dogs are supervised accordingly. Whereas an off leash area for dogs can be a bit chaotic for a small, young dog, and you don't want her to have any bad experiences that will set her back. Barking  Barking and small dogs is a really common problem. Partly due to the fact, little dogs are continually needing to reassert their authority, due to their lack of size. I suggest having a look at the post here How to prevent my dog from barking constantly when I am not at home? for some advice.  This isn't a complete answer. I haven't addressed the issue with your Mother's dog, but I am sure there will be other answers to come."
How effective is leaving a television or radio on to comfort dogs when away?,"Classical music would be preferable to rock music.  According to the study ""Behavioral effects of auditory stimulation on kenneled dogs"" from the Journal of Veterinary Behaviour (PDF), classical music ""may help mitigate some of the stress inherent for [...] kenneled dogs.""  Although your dogs are not kenneled, the result would be comparable to alleviating distress caused by your absence. I like to leave the TV on a talking channel, usually sitcoms.  This mimics general human chit-chat and has a light mood; I understand animals can pick up mood from human conversation. In your case, your dogs have each other for company, so it is unlikely they will become too lonely, though they can fret for their humans."
Whether and how to minimise physical activity of female dog immediately following desexing operation?,"Female dogs do need to be kept quiet after desexing, for a few days at least. They have undergone quite a substantial surgical procedure, removing the uterus and ovaries. Depending on the Vet, and how the procedure is done, where the incision is may vary. At the very least she will have stitches and it takes time for the wounds to heal. By reducing her activity, this lessens the chance of the stitches breaking, promotes healing (as dogs heal when they sleep) and reduces the stress of pain caused by physical activity. The amount of activity your dog can do will increase after a few days, but it is a good idea to reduce any strenuous activity for at least a week. Day 1. Bring her home and make her bed nice and cosy and keep her in a quiet, preferably darkened room with the door closed. When you take her out for the toilet, keep her on a lead, so she can't attempt to wander. At this stage, she'll, likely, still be sleepy from the procedure and the drugs. So keeping her locked away like this will give her a good place to just sleep. Some people use an internal laundry, as it is a small space, I prefer to use a small bedroom. Days 2-3. Keep your dog inside for the duration. If you have an enclosed yard, it should be ok to let her out off lead, but stay with her and bring her in after she has relieved herself and had a small sniff around. If she needs to be taken out into an area with other dogs, or no enclosure, she needs to be kept on leash at all times. If you have a small place, there is less need to restrict her movements within the home, but for larger houses, it can be a good idea to keep her in one or two rooms. The issue with this, is you don't want her to feel socially isolated from her family. Day 4-7. You dog can have more freedom, doesn't need to be restrained within the home. I would keep her indoors and let her have longer supervised periods outdoors. For 20-30 minutes at a time. I wouldn't be taking her on walks at this stage. It is important to follow any instructions given by your veterinarian."
Counterbalancing air flow and humidity in a tortoise enclosure,"I always suggest keeping tortoise pens as open as possible. In general, tortoises require better airflow than other reptiles; At least in the sense that they do not do well in an aquarium-type enclosure. The walls of glass terrariums are too high and block off airflow, making it easy for the ammonia from their urine to build up, and heat to build up from the stagnant air. So providing some fresh air not only helps to clear the ammonia, but makes sure that it doesn't overheat. That doesn't mean it's not possible to keep a tortoise in an aquarium, it just takes some work. I've seen some people use computer fans to regulate the airflow and temperature, but I think most people decide that for the amount of work it would take, it's better to build a custom habitat with lower walls. It's also just more important to have floor space than wall height, since it's not like the tortoises are likely to climb out. If you're using the exo-terra coconut fiber bedding, that actually holds moisture really well. The sphagnum  moss does too. You don't want the soil to be soggy, but if you mist it with a spray bottle enough to keep it moist, that should keep the enclosure humid even with a screen top. Simply having a dish of water also helps add to the humidity too. Plants are also really good at helping to keep enclosures humid. if you have the space you could add some plants. Even some edible plants. I haven't needed them, but other options would be getting an automatic mister or reptile fogger. It's always a good idea to keep track of the humidity still. Don't assume that because it's automatic, that it's correct. Always keep a thermometer and a humidity gauge in your enclosures. It's also important to remember that too much humidity can be bad as well. It can cause respiratory issues. You'll be shooting for a humidity of about 70%."
What can I do for a dog with really dry skin,"Some food related things I know to be a help  from working with pet food and supplements are:
- Coconut unsweetened sprinkled over the food can help the oil in the skin and coat to promote its health, or also coconut oil rubbed into the skin. they love licking it off though (its fine for them to eat) so you got to rub it in good before they get a chance to lick it off. 
- An oatmeal based food and or shampoo can help as well
- Their are also many treats and supplements at pet stores that are tasty and if given according to the instructions on the packaging are great for promoting skin and coat heath. "
How can I protect a fish pond during the winter?,"The fish should all be okay as long as the pond isn't going to freeze all the way over. I would say you don't want the pond to freeze over for more than a day or two, because carbon dioxide can build up under the ice, and new oxygen won't be able to get in. Also, since I'm pretty sure the sturgeon are still active during the winter, they will still need a steady supply of oxygen. The koi (and I think the goldfish too, but I'm not sure about them) will go into what is called ""Torper"", which isn't quite hibernation it's more like a state of stupor. They become lethargic, sitting in warmest area of the pond they can find. Their metabolisms do slow down while they're in this state, but they will still need a good supply of oxygen. It's pretty important to try not to disturb them while they're like this (it stresses them out) so I can understand why people don't want to put noisy pumps in their ponds during the winter. If you need to break the ice, I would try pouring boiling water on the ice, or using a hand drill, to make as little noise as possible. I've heard of some people adding salt to lower the freezing point of the pond, but I don't suggest that myself because it changes the chemicals of the water while most people don't have their pumps running, and it's not a good idea to let the water get much colder than 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) in the first place. Depending on how you feel about your electricity bill, you might be able to get by with dropping a large aquarium heater to keep a part of the pond just warm enough so that it doesn't freeze."
Cat may have spent a week locked in a drawer - how concerned should I be?,"The cat doesn't go into suspended animation when in the drawer. If she was really trapped there the whole time you would find, uhm, metabolic byproducts, in addition to claw marks where she tried to get out, and her health would be severely damaged at best. More likely that, like many cats, she discovered a way to climb up inside the cabinet. Many do have a space behind the drawers, and if the bottom is open and there's space to go underneath, a cat can often climb through that space and squeeze into the drawers from the back. If you're worried, bring the cat to the vet for a checkup. But I suspect she just found herself a safe den and stayed there when the strange human might notice her."
Can I release my pet rabbit in the wild?,"The short answer is no.  The longer answer: Your pet rabbit is probably a different breed than the wild rabbits you see around. It's been bred from tame/domesticated rabbits for generations. It doesn't smell like them, and it doesn't know how anything about living wild. If you let it go free, it will almost certainly be killed or eaten. If you are in an area where rabbits are not a natural species, your rabbit, if it survives, could cause immense damage (google ""rabbits in Australia to get an eyeful of the damage introducing rabbits has caused there).  Finally, any pet is for life - your life or its life. If you can't look after the rabbit any more, the responsible thing to do is find a shelter (preferably no-kill) and surrender it to them. Simply releasing any pet is cruel and a betrayal of trust. That pet, whether a rabbit or any other animal, looks to you to provide food, protection, and shelter. "
Why do groomers tell you not to shear a long-haired dog in warm weather?,"The main question is this: Is your dog Single coated breeds are often ""fashion"" or ""toy"" breeds like Poodles and Shih Tzu. They actually do need regular hair cuts because their hairs don't stop growing. Most dog breeds are double coated, especially herding and mountain breeds and those from arctic regions, like Huskies, Shepherd dogs, Collies, Shelties, Golden Retrievers, Newfoundlands, Bernese Mountain Dogs and many more. Double coated means that there are 2 types of hair: The problem is that a hair clipper cannot distinguish between top coat or undercoat, it just cuts all hairs to the same length. The top coat doesn't regrow fast, and if the dog develops a condition called Post Clipping Alopecia it doesn't regrow at all. The undercoat will regrow quickly and it will be longer than the remains of the top coat. To be absolutely clear: One single haircut changes the fur of your dog for a VERY long time, possibly for the rest of its life. Gone is the smooth, shiny protective top coat. Gone is the soft cushioning fur that protected your dog from physical injuries and sunburn. Instead of shaving your dog, you should remove the already shed undercoat as completely as possible. Brush her fur thoroughly or let a professional groomer wash her. Groomers use cold hair dryers to blow the loose hairs out of the fur. You should give her a cool, shaded place to rest and maybe even offer her a small basin of water to cool off in. To be honest, I cannot tell you for sure. It could be a case of half-knowledge being repeated without anyone doubting it. It could also be a psychological reason. Imagine this conversation: Owner: I want you to shave my dog, she's too hot in summer.
Groomer: That's a bad idea, her coat will be ruined.
Owner: You just shaved that poodle, you obviously had no problem ruining his coat. My own hair isn't ruined by a haircut either. My dog is too hot in summer, so I want you to shave her now.
Groomer (doesn't want to hold a lecture): Please believe me that neither you nor your dog will be comfortable with the outcome.
Owner (doesn't want to let their dog suffer): I'm certain she'll be very comfortable once she cools down a little, after all this fur is gone. It's the same as saying ""smoking is bad for you"". The uncertain future negative effect doesn't feel as important as the current negative situation. The possible outcome feels unreal and intangible, while the current situation is very real and can be changed. Most people tend to ignore statistics and evidence and think ""That only happens to others, I'll be fine"". On the other hand, if the groomer repeats the half-truth about fur keeping your dog cool, the owner feels like they are doing the right thing by not shaving the dog. Discussions and lectures are avoided. Most people accept the statement without questioning it or don't have the expertise to question it."
"How can we encourage our kitten to come up to us, if we're unable to get down on the floor with her?","First of all, get lots of cat furniture. Cats normally like perching up high, so if you give it places it can go to be higher off the ground, it will probably gravitate to them. You can make them even more enticing by placing them by windows or in rooms you spend a lot of time in. You can also place comfy beds on higher surfaces to encourage it to sleep there.  The other thing you can do is use treats or play to lead the cat to where you want it to go. Either can be done without bending over. With treats, you can toss them to the cat, and certain toys like a feather wand or laser pointer can be used while you are standing. This way you can get the cat to come up high, rather than having to bend over to interact.  Since it sounds like you're still in the introductory period of keeping the new cat to one room, that is actually a great time to get cat furniture. Place them all in its room, and encourage the cat to use them through play and treats. That way the furniture will have the cat's smell on them. Then once you are ready to introduce the cat to other areas of the house, move the furniture into those areas. This will spread its smell and make the introduction go more smoothly. "
How do I get my dog to stop stealing socks?,"Look who figured out how to get attention from you! And judging by him making you post here, he's done a fine job of it. Face it, your dog has outsmarted you. Happens to me almost daily. ;-) As you have already figured out, he's doing it to get your attention, and he's succeeding because you go chasing after him, right? Time to outsmart your dog! Find an old sock you don't care about and make it a toy for him. Tie a knot in it so you both know which one it is. When you have the time, let him grab that one and make it a game to get it back. This will be the game and the attention he craves. (Yes, dogs not only play games but invent them, and ""keep away"" is an ever popular one.)  When he grabs a real sock, completely ignore him. Do not try to get it back, do not even acknowledge he has it.  Really, you must completely ignore his stealing of a real sock no matter what. Pretty soon he'll learn that only The Sock gets attention. He'll learn to ignore the others, and now you have only one sock you need to control. It will take some time, probably weeks, but it will happen without undue stress to you or him and with no real major efforts."
Can dogs eat yoghurt?,"Actual natural yogurt's something that dogs in India have had as part of their diet for ages. Its worth remembering there's bad things about it - its milk based, and somewhat fatty (and if your dog is lactose intolerant, very bad things can happen) and good (it has lots of good, natural probiotics). A lot of store bought yogurt is terrible. The stuff with fruit is high in sugar (not good) and you'd need to check if the specific fruit and any additives in it are dog friendly. Avoid anything that's got artificial sweeteners especially xylithol. In fact, avoid anything that doesn't contain anything but starter culture, and milk of various skimmedness. Avoid anything with starch since it is obviously made by people who are not spending the time to do it right. Home made yogurt is... actually pretty easy but out of the scope for pets."
How to remove the algae from the glass of an aquarium?,"If the algae is brown in color (diatom), has already settled and is hard; magnetic cleaners or algae-eating species wont be of much help. You can wrap a small piece of cloth around your hand and simply rub it off. You can also use an old toothbrush. Once the algae is off the glass, you can then use a magnetic cleaner or introduce algae-eating species as a maintenance/cleaning crew."
What are the risks of leaving a dog unattended in the car?,"The interior of a car is capable of reaching far higher temperatures than the outside environment, becoming an oven for a dog (or child, for that matter) left inside it.  This can happen quite rapidly and affect swiftly. Dogs rely on cooling their body temperature through their paws (which is where most of their sweat glands are - have you noticed a vet's exam table get wet from a dog's paws?) and through panting; this makes them even more susceptible to overheating in an enclosed environment like a car. Even with the windows left down, a car can heat up quickly. People have been known to resort to smashing windows to remove a dog from a locked car.  In places where it is illegal to leave dogs alone in cars, the cost of the window repair is not recoverable by the owner. It's important to note that if any dog is left in a car, the dog is at a much higher risk of developing heat stroke; which can be fatal. (Thanks to @sulfureous) This Wiki How Article gives some good advice on managing heat stroke. The RACQ study below demonstrates temperature changes in cars over time, with windows closed and open: "
Which fishes can live together with neons?,"Neons and black skirt tetras* are both easy-going fish, so you won't have much problem with them being aggressive to newcomers. As long as anything you add isn't highly predatory/aggressive and isn't too huge, they'll probably play nice. (Bear in mind that if one fish can fit another into its mouth, it probably will at some point.) One thing that I'm not 100% clear on is whether these are the only fish in the tank. If so, it seems like you've got the upper/middle of the water column in your tank pretty well stocked, so I'd look at some bottom-dwelling fish. If you want to keep the South American theme -- which isn't necessary, but does make it easier to pick your target water conditions -- you could look at adding a handful of corydoras cats. If you've already got a bit of a community setup and are looking to add more schooling fish, there are tons and tons and tons of options. Aesthetically-speaking, you've already got a nice contrast in color and body shape between the two tetras though, so you might just want to fill out the black skirt tetra school if you've only got a few. *Just another common name for your black tetra; same fish."
Will dogs overeat?,"The answer is the same as it is with people. It depends on the dog. I grew up doing the same thing you did. We'd simply refill the bowl when it got empty. It was fine with our first lab. She was leaning more toward heavy than skinny, but was a decent weight. My second lab turned into a butter ball. I had a knock down drag out with my parents at the time, because she'd been hit by a car and as she got older, the arthritis took a toll. It was made much worse by the extra weight. She should have been about 73 lbs (33 kg) according to the vet, but she was more like 93 lbs (42 kg). My parents still wanted to feed her all kinds of table scraps.  I'd come home from college for the summer and put her on a vet recommended feeding schedule and walk her a mile or so several times a week, as well as regular weekend trips to the river. I'd get her down to 75 lbs (34 kg) or so and she'd be running around and playing like her legs didn't bother her. Then I'd go to school and they'd fatten her back up the 90s lbs. She'd limp around and not do much. I finally convinced them to quite and she did much better. Now I have a Jack Russell and a Keeshound I inheirited. I feed them a measured amount twice a day, but they often leave some in the bowl till the next feeding. I could leave it in the bowl for them 24/7 and they'd eat the same amount. Basically, you need to monitor your dog. If he's getting fat, then you either need to exercise him more, cut back on his feed, or both. Either way, I'd recommend doing it gradually. Consult your vet to see what a proper amount of food is for a healthy dog of his size and breed. Then buy a higher quality dog food. You don't have to break the bank, but you'll see a noticeable difference in coat condition and other areas if you feed a higher quality."
Big hound has eaten corn cobs what can I do to help him pass them?,"Corn Cobs are fairly absorbent.  The best option here is to provide plenty of water and encourage your dog to drink up.  The liquid will help soften the cob making it easier to pass.  The hydration effect will also help the chemicals in your dog's digestive tract permeate the cob potentially helping to break it down, also making it easier to pass. There is nothing in a normal corn cob that is going to be toxic to your dog so there should be no worries there.   I would also note that this does not guarantee that the cob will not become a blockage it just reduces the chance of it because the cob will be softer and easier to pass.  If your dog does become blocked, or experiences bloody stool after(or before) passing the cob you should take it to a vet immediately."
How do I stop my cat from biting cords?,"I've made sure to have more cardboard boxes around for my youngest cat to shred and bite. Yeah, they're messy; but each trip to Costco gets me another box, and when he has other sacrificial victims, he spares my cords. (And my books.) Whenever he looked like he was about ready to puncture another cord, I'd distract him with a box or piece of cardboard. Other things I've seen people do include wiping the cords' surfaces with lemon juice so that the cords taste nasty."
How can I tell the difference between play and aggression at the dog park?,"I'm speaking here as an owner of a Shiba Inu, who is frequently the bully as well as split from playmates because their person is unable to tell that they are in fact playing. Dogs use their mouths to interact with the world, some do it more than others.  Play biting is very common when dogs are wrestling.  My Shiba will generally target legs of larger dogs in an effort to get them on the ground so he can reach them better.  Dogs usually learn at a very young age how much pressure is ok to apply with a playmate. I've seen owners show concern over a bark, growl, or even a squeal, but many dogs are vocal while playing. A wagging tail is generally a positive sign, while crouching/tail tucking is a negative sign.  A dog that's wagging their tail usually isn't aggressive.  However, not every dog can wag their tail either because it has been docked or because they're physically incapable (my Shiba cannot).  Similarly, a tucked tail isn't always something that can be discerned. When my Shiba comes face to face with a dog he doesn't like, you can see it in his entire body:  his lips may curl, his hackles are raised, and he tries to stand as tall as possible.  When he's distressed, his tail will partially uncurl. Dogs he bullies generally respond by yelping, slinking along the ground, and/or running away."
Can I get sick from my cats sharing my food or drink?,"The short answer is yes.  The longer answer is that while, for the most part, there aren't many zoonotic diseases that can transfer from cats to humans, there are some infections that can be transmitted from the cat to you through shared sources, notably protozoal infections. These are basically single-celled organisms that can cause severe diarrhea in both humans and cats and are normally contracted from the same sources (e.g. tainted water). However, depending on the cat and its habits they may be drinking water you are not, such as toilet water, and so it's possible that it taints your water via transfer. Also, the great indoors is not always isolated from the great outdoors. Mice and other small rodents, along with insects, can also enter the premises and they may contaminate things that, in turn, get picked up by the cat. The Center for Disease Control has a list of possible infections that could arise."
Any tips for how to coax and teach a shy feral cat to trust?,"Feral cats can be tough. I applaud you for bringing one into your home. I've had a few experiences myself with one and it can be a challenge. However, I think you've got the right approach. In my opinion the most important key here is patience. Letting her set the pace will go a long way in her trusting you. That being said, there are a few things that you can do.  First, finding out what motivates them can help quite a bit with any kind of training or rehab. Food motivated cats are always the easiest, largely because it's easier to provide an immediate reward. If she is food motivated, giving her a single treat at a time to reinforce positive behaviors (choosing to sit near you rather than further away, any kind of positive physical contact, etc.) can help promote more discovery for her in that area.  We tend to forget that animals are very scent based creatures as we don't have as strong a sense of smell (myself in particular). One of the way cats bond is through scent sharing. They often do this by marking things with the side of their head (where an oil gland is) but giving the cat access to your scents helps promote bonding. You can do this by leaving some of your worn clothing in places or beds they sleep in. If you feel comfortable with it, give them access to your bedroom as well. It's the most scent heavy room in the house and generally cats who want to bond are drawn to it. Playtime can be a big way to win a cat over as well. Try a wand toy, or one that has a handle with a toy attached to a string. Drag the toy along the ground back and forth around the cat. If you can get them playing then you can expend a lot of that nervous energy and it can really help establish trust. They may even seek you out for playtime. It's great that they're feeding from your hand, but that may be the wrong time to try petting them. Some ferals can be defensive at feeding time (I know I just said to reinforce with food but, bear with me). Trying to touch them while they're eating may cause their defenses to go up. In my opinion (and it is an opinion) the best time to try petting them is when they're satisfied. That is, shortly after they're completely done eating a meal or 10 minutes or so after heavy playtime (too soon after playtime and they may see your hands as tasty chewtoys).  Start small, let them sniff your hand before touching them, keep the petting sessions short. Some cats can get overstimulated and bite if they're not used to being petted (this happens with my feral). If you're able to do this small amounts (and reinforce with treats) I think you'll see them seek out comfort and affection after a time. They may never be a truly cuddly cat but I do think that most ferals (particularly young ones) can come far enough to want human interaction and affection if they get it in the right circumstances.

How do I keep my supply of feeder crickets from keeping me awake at night?,"We buy crickets regularly for two frogs, and we have purchased crickets from two local pet stores.  Every batch of crickets we have purchased from one of the pet stores is noisy, chirping like crazy.  Every batch of crickets we have purchased from the other pet store is essentially silent.  As a result, we now only purchase crickets from the store with non-chirping crickets. I would suggest trying different stores until you find quieter crickets. I originally thought that it was the different species of crickets at the different stores that caused the difference in chirping.  However, I asked the guy at my favorite pet store.  He had no idea what species of crickets he had, but he said that the difference was in the size of the crickets.  He said that crickets start chirping when they get to about 1 inch in size.  At other pet stores, their ""large"" crickets are 1 inch long, and lots of them will chirp.  He specifically stocks 3/4 inch crickets as his largest size, and as a result, they hardly ever get a chirping one. So if you need quiet crickets, get smaller ones.  If your pet store doesn't have a good selection of smaller crickets, it is time to find another supplier."
How many plants do I need for my aquarium?,"Tiger barb prefer a well-planted aquarium, that would imitate their original environment. Tetras, in general, also like some plants to hide them from the light. Since there are so many specimens of plants, with so many shapes, sizes, densities... I think the best way to ""measure"" how much plants you could have would have to take into account all these characteristics. What I would recommend would be high, floating plants, covering 30% of the surface of the aquarium. And planted plants to cover about 20% to 30% of the area of the front of the aquarium."
How long and often should I walk my pig?,"Pigs and dogs are actually quite comparable - in size, development and intelligence. Therefore I'd like to refer you to this question: How often and long should I walk my puppy? There is a 5 minute rule which is basically 5 minutes walk per day, per month of your puppy’s life, so therefore a 3 month old puppy can be walked for 15 minutes and a 4 month old puppy for 20 minutes, which is a guideline but as an owner make your own judgement on your puppies needs as each puppy is different. Basically, you should observe the behavior of your pig. When he starts slowing down or showing signs of exhaustion, you should return home and let him rest. You should also avoid too much stress on the bones and joints, like having him jump down from heights or letting him carry weights. As long as he isn't full-grown, that could cause problems like joint pain or growth abnormalities in the long run. In general, wild boars are foragers and can roam several kilometers daily in search of food. That means the build of a pig is designed for long walks. As long as you don't force or animate your pet to walk when he already shows signs of exhaustion, he should be fine. One aspect that could affect him, but doesn't seem to be a problem in this particular case, is the abrasion of his claws. Comparable to the hooves of a horse, pig claws grow constantly but slowly. If your pig always walks on very soft ground, his claws may grow too long and force the foot into an unnatural and painful position. On the other hand, if he always walks on asphalted roads, gravel or other abrasive undergrounds, his claws might wear out faster than they regrow, making his feet very sensitive and walking painful."
How can I tell whether my horse recognizes his name?,"A name is really just a cue for a generic ""pay attention"" behaviour. In my dogs, the response can range from running towards me, to turning a head towards me, to sometimes just flicking an ear towards me, depending on their activity level at the time. I'd expect to see the same response in a horse. It's possible that horses sometimes do not develop as strong a response to their names because we do not talk to them as much as we do to a dog or cat, and rely more on physical prompts rather than verbal cues when we train them. They also would not get as many repetitions of the name=reinforcement pairing as an animal that lives in its owner's house, particularly since many horses do not get a lot of positive reinforcement from their owners. I don't have a horse of my own, but when I was a kid I took riding lessons and I have no doubt that the horses at the riding school knew their names. Sadly for the horses, it wasn't a ""pay attention"" cue so much as a ""keep doing that and I'll punish you"" cue. The instructors would yell out a name towards a group of horses, and only the target horse would show a fearful reaction."
When is it safe to add fish?,"Unfortunately I'd say no, not if you still have that much ammonia showing up. The rule of thumb I've seen is you should be able to add 2ppm ammonia and have it completely converted to nitrates within 24 hours.  It's odd that you're seeing ammonia and nitrates at this stage: you tend to see the ammonia-consuming bacteria show up very quickly (see the graph here), then the ammonia disappears but nitrites skyrocket and linger forever. They might not actually be coming from your denitrifying bacteria: do you know for a fact that your tapwater has 0ppm nitrates? If you haven't done so already, mix up a batch of new water as if you're doing a water change, let it sit about half an hour, and then check to see what your starting conditions really are. I'm also skeptical because you've been dosing the ammonia weekly. Were you testing to see when the ammonia started dropping to add more? If not, your NH3-consumers may not have had enough food to get established. (Two thumbs up for dosing your NH3 by the way: it's a lot more work than using fish, but so much safer for them, and more reliable.) I'm not convinced many of the bottled nitrogen cycle starters are very reliable, by the way. Older recipes don't actually have Nitrospira, the bacteria that consumes NO2, because until a few years ago, other dentrifiers were thought to be much more important to the aquarium nitrogen cycle than they really are."
Should I be concerned that my cat is breathing fast?,"I watched him for a few minutes (to determine that he hadn't just run across the room or something) and he continued to breathe fast. So I packed him up and drove to the emergency vet. The emergency vet told me that Hunter was seriously ill and it's a good thing I brought him in. They put him in an enclosure with increased oxygen to help him breathe more efficiently while they did testing and determined what the problem was. The radiologist determined from a chest x-ray that Hunter was having congestive heart failure. In this disease, the heart is not pumping blood efficiently, and fluid will accumulate in his heart and lungs. Symptoms of congestive heart failure include: (source: Cummings Veterinary Medical Center at Tufts University) If we had not taken him to the veterinarian for treatment he may have died. The vets gave him medication to reduce the fluid in his heart and lungs and were able to wean him off the oxygen the next morning. I will be able to take him home tonight (24 hours after the incident), and will have to continue to give him these medications. I also need to make a cardiologist appointment so we can determine what the cause of the problem was and determine the best long term treatment for Hunter."
Can a dog contract the Ebola virus?,"Canine Corner: Can Dogs Get Infected by the Ebola Virus? This link, I think, provides the best answer with scientific evidence and provided myself with the answer I was looking for. Unfortunately, we have more to worry about now since Ebola is actually in the US.  Here is a piece of the article that directly answers that question by Dr. Coren:  ""Although dogs are susceptible to Ebola, the CDC concluded that ""infected dogs are asymptomatic"", meaning that they do not develop symptoms. During the early phase of their infection, however, they can spread the disease to humans and other animals through licking, biting, urine, and feces. However, the good news is that once the virus is cleared from the dog it is no longer contagious. Dogs do not die from Ebola infections."""
How to leash train a rabbit?,"To get a rabbit to use a leash, the first thing to do is select the right leash for this type of pet. Depending on the type of rabbit, the animal may be more fragile than a typical cat or a dog. Rabbits, being prey animals, are also more likely to panic and try to run away. Therefore, to protect the rabbit from injuring itself, a harness would be best. When selecting a harness, make sure the straps around the front legs and chest can be tightened enough to where the animal doesn't get her foot caught in the harness, which can lead to her slipping out of the leash. For the European rabbit my brother found, a harness intended for a small poodle was almost sufficient, but we had to watch the rabbit to make sure he didn't slip the leash. Get the rabbit used to being in the harness by taking her outside in the yard, but only a short distance and for a short amount of time. She may behave differently than indoors. You may notice she'll be more alert and aware of her surroundings or sit perfectly still for periods of time. Unlike a dog, the rabbit may not seem as adventurous at first. Also, be aware of your movements. Some rabbits have poor vision and rely on shapes or silhouettes. See this What do Rabbits See? for more details. For instance, I was outside with the rabbit on a leash one day, sitting on the front porch as he watched me oddly. As I stood up, he suddenly bolted to the end of the harness and continued to try to run away once he reached the end of the leash. I had to pick him up and take him inside to let him go hide. He'd had enough of the great outdoors for the day. As with any animal training, a lot of it is about just getting used to something. The more time your rabbit spends outdoors on a leash, the more comfortable and relaxed she'll become. Just remember to take it slow at first, and be on the lookout for dogs and cats! If your rabbit does get spooked, WikiHow has some advice on How to Calm a Rabbit."
How can I tell if my cat knows his name?,"There's a high probability that he doesn't really know his name. The problem is that we use our pet's names too often and in too many different contexts. As you describe in your question, we usually call our pets by their name with a lot of hidden meanings. We should try to avoid doing that. Especially in case where we want to stop them. If every time you stop him from doing something you call his name, there will be a negative association: ""when I hear ""Sterling"" I have to stop doing funny things, that's very upsetting"" (OK, that's a bit anthropomorphic...). The goal when you call his name should be to have him look at you, even in the presence of distractions.  If you want to teach Sterling to respond to his name here's how I suggest to proceed. The concepts that are used here are operant conditioning, positive reinforcement and reward markers. Operant conditioning means that you will condition the cat to respond to the signal (his name) with a behaviour that he learned (looking at you). You do that with a positive reinforcement: you reward him once he looked at you. He will then choose to offer the behaviour to get rewarded. Note that this is different from luring him to do the behaviour. You reward (positive reinforcement) once the behaviour occurred. The use of a marker means that you will ""mark"" the moment in time when you decide to reward. This greatly helps the cat to understand what he is rewarded for. If you want to play this game, you could follow this recipe:"
How can I calm my cat so I can brush him?,"Making brushing an enjoyable experience is probably the best way to go. Reward him after sitting still and allowing you to brush him with a treat. Grooming is one way cats show affection towards each other, so making him calm and relaxed in order to brush him is essential. Wait until he is in a calm state, possibly napping or relaxing and approach and sit with him and pet him gently. Then introduce the brush and let him smell it, and rub his face against it. Then you should be able to brush him with only minor attacking of the brush. Also leaving the brush out in a public place so he can get used to it and it's not some strange object always helps me with my cats."
Why does my cat hold his tail forward over his body?,"My cat does a similar thing, except his curls some instead of being flat over his back. According to my vet, this sort of thing, where the tail rests on their back, is a genetic mutation that some cats have. It isn't painful and doesn't cause them any harm, it is just a difference in how their tail rests on their body. Most cats cannot pull their tail over themselves in that particular way, as their body structure prevents it, but your cat (and mine, and many others) were just born with a mutation that allows them to do this.

Can rabies virus survive outside host on grass or leaves under sunlight?,"First things first: Rabies is an extremely dangerous infection and regular vaccination (every 10 years) is the only sure protection! As far as I know there are about 15 - 20 people who have ever survived an acute rabies infection in the history of human medicine,  none of them without severe neurological sequelae and most of them died a few months after. The first reported case of a survival was Jeanna Giese in 2004. Now to your question: Technically viruses are not alive in the biological sense, so medical scientists speak of viruses being active (alive, infectious) or inactive (dead, destroyed, unable to infect a cell). Yes, the rabies virus can stay active outside of a host body for a limited time, depending on environmental factors. This German veterinary gives the following information: In addition, the safety data sheet of MSDS Online contains the following information about the virus: And from this scientific study (Matouch et al, Vet Med (Praha) 1987), which was summarized here, comes the longest recorded activity time of the virus outside of a host:"
How can you tell if neck biting between dogs is too rough?,"As an FYI before reading, I've cited a source towards the end of this post for most of the information you'll find in it. Typically when two dogs are playing rough, it's better to let them figure things out. If your male dog seems to be biting down pretty hard on the female dog's scruff/neck area, and she doesn't seem to mind or still exhibits classic play signs (I'll talk about those below), then you probably shouldn't separate the fight. I also wouldn't physically break up the fight, even if the female dog doesn't like it. When dogs are playing with each other and something out-of-line or undesirable is done, the dogs will let the other know with a preemptive growl or bite (not usually harmful, but just as a warning). So essentially if you have two social dogs who know how to play, they also know how to let the other know to stop playing when something has gone too far. I talked about indicative behavior above, so I'll cover a few signs of playful and aggressive behavior. Because a lot of dog play looks like it's aggressive and can be misinterpreted by other dogs playing, most social canines have specific signs to signal that their behavior has playful intentions. These signs are forms of ""metacommunication,"" meaning a secondary behavior accompanying the primary action which is essential in interpreting its meaning. In other words, behavior without these metacommunications are ambiguous.  Play bow before and after aggressive-seeming actions. A lot of times, when dogs do something like bite another dog, jump on them, whack them with their paw, lunge in, or something else, they'll do a play bow before or after to signal that there were no aggressive intentions and that the other dogs shouldn't take it as aggression. Bear hugging. So it's not exactly hugging, but in addition to play bowing, dogs will often bear hug. It looks pretty mean and aggressive, but it's typically 100% friendly behavior and it's a good indicator that your dogs are playing just fine. I'll put in a picture to illustrate how aggressive it looks compared to how aggressive it really is. You'll notice that the dog on the right looks pretty mean -- it's all play.  Trading, sharing, or temporarily stopping roles. A lot of times when dogs are playing, they'll give each other opportunities to trade roles. If one dog is on top of the other, the top dog should eventually give the one on the ground a small escape period where he should be able to stand up and continue playing. If two dogs are chasing each other, the universal ""this is just play"" metacommunication is for the head dog to slow down and let the other catch up, jump on him, try to get a toy in his mouth, etc... They may, again, switch roles. The faster dog might slow down and let his playmate run ahead for a few seconds. There are many more, but those are some of the more common ones. Others include wagging bodies (not tails), face biting/teeth locking, and stopping for a few seconds to take a breather. Above I mention that wagging or having a loose body is a sign of play, but not wagging the tail. Many people think that if a dog is wagging their tail, everything is okay because it's a generally accepted sign of happiness. However, even distressed dogs will wag their tails. When watching dog play, you want to be careful of stiff-bodied dogs, hair standing in a line down the dogs back (raised hackles), and body language, regardless of their tail movements. You can find tons of diagrams that illustrate various body language clues on Google Images just by searching something like ""dog body language."" If you're interested in reading more about canid behavior and don't want to read up on those sketchy ""how to"" links, I highly recommend Canine Behavior: Insights and Answers by Bonnie Beaver which you can buy or view in PDF form here. Beaver has done a lot of great research and a lot of what I've mentioned in my post I've learned from the resources she's written. In my original comment I also talked about letting out a ""yelp."" If you're really worried about your male dog's biting of the females neck, you can let out a real high-pitched yelp. This should immediately get both dogs attentions, they'll give you a surprised face, and then should continue playing, but it lets them know that you're not entirely comfortable with what they're doing. TL;DR: Dogs will know when it gets too rough and typically let each other know. They also have behaviors to qualify aggressive-seeming actions and make sure that if an action that seems aggressive is playful, it's interpreted properly. So don't stop the playing unless you're really worried and see obviously aggressive signs."
"My cat seems to have a harmless ""sneeze button""?","We have a cat that sneezes a lot, there are many reasons why a cat might sneeze including various viruses and dental issues. However, your cat is sneezing under a specific condition, which is basically a cheek rub with sufficient pressure against a hard, angled, surface.  The underlying cause of this can, in fact, be dental even if you can't see it. In fact, it's unlikely you would see it, most dental issues in cats will happen below the gum line. An abscessed tooth or other dental problem that is bothering her, thus causing her to rub it to relieve it, could very easily cause the sneezing to happen. Consider that we too will rub sore areas as a means of relieving the ache, this is activity, specifically to that cheek, seems similar in nature.  Unfortunately, examination of the teeth in this circumstance requires putting her under and, if there is an issue, then removal would probably be required to stop the sneezing and, more importantly, ease the pain. Cats are extremely capable of hiding pain, so don't assume that what appears to be contented behaviour means that she isn't in discomfort.  So, I'd have a vet check it out, if it is a dental problem, then it's not going to get better, it will probably get worse as it has with one of our cats. Veterinary medicine being a little less exact than human medicine had decided our cat's sneezes were viral... she now faces a possible full edentation (teeth removal) as a result."
How smart are ferrets?,"I have observed that male ferrets are much more intelligent when it comes to getting somewhere, and female when it comes to hiding something. Due to that I have observed male ferrets do insane acts of acrobatics, but have never seen female ferret do anything like that. However I suspect that female ferret was the better acrobat out of the two. I have never managed to successfully contain the male ferret to any single room, due to his body being able to squeeze literally through anything. He has learned to open doors, open locks on windows, and flip the light switch(always to off, never on :( which made tripping over them and objects thrown around always easy). Most of that was done by finding random objects, dragging them to the place of interest and tower building. Even if I didn't see the male ferret do a certain act sometimes, the objects being thrown around did tell a story about what happened and what was the goal. However female ferret was guilty of stashing things she liked in dark areas. I have never observed how the climbing was done, nor have I seen any objects thrown around that would indicate that someone was climbing, but I have found her favorite stuffed toys in places where the male ferret would never be capable of reaching, and there was absolutely no evidence of the climbing being done. The biggest mystery was how she managed to climb all the way to the uppermost cupboard in the kitchen. The surface was mainly marble and everything else was smooth, yet somehow the toys did end up there beside the sugar and other things somehow. So I think ferrets do make excellent intelligent ninjas as long as they are interested in what they are doing. They have all the cunning and skills of a true ninja."
What could cause my dog to fear power outages?,"The fire alarm and battery UPS will sometimes beep when power is lost.  Even if this had only happened once in your dog's past, the link between power outage and beeping is set in stone and can trigger anxiety. The beeping may not happen in subsequent outages, but some part of him is expecting it. My dog practically climbs on top of my head when he hears the UPS or fire alarm beeping due to low batteries."
Why does my dog roll in gross stuff?,"This comes from their ancestors, wolves.  The reason varies however, depending on the stench. Usually rolling in faeces of animals is to disguise their scent, thus being able to sneak upon their prey undetected. In the case of carcasses, this is basically a way of claiming it, kind of a ""look what I got"" towards other dogs. There are other cases however, where your dog just actually likes the smell, so is trying to rub themselves in it so they smell the same. Weirdly enough, my Bichon does this with orange skittles(!!!). Every time we present her with half of one, she rolls her neck in it and proceeds to play with it. That's basically because she likes the smell, not because she's trying to confuse her prey smelling of Skittles (albeit a great disguise)."
How can I tell when my small dog is too cold,"There are various stages of hypothermia to be aware of in terms of signs and sometimes improvement in a sign is an indication that the animal is getting worse, especially when talking about shivering. Early stages have shivering, it abates at later stages, so keeping an eye on your pet is critically important in this case. Very young and very old animals are at greater risk as are smaller animals with less natural defence. For mild or moderate hypothermia, you can treat with active external warming such as warm blankets, warm moving air, and the like, though checking with a vet is advised for moderate hypothermia. For severe hypothermia, you must seek medical assistance from a vet, though starting the warming process by drying and covering them is important too.  Whatever you do, do not, however, put the dog into a warm water bath as it could kill them from the shock. One thing you might want to do is find out how to take your dogs temperature, have your vet demonstrate it if possible. Knowing this will allow you to check, dogs should have a core body temperature around 101° - 102.5° so dropping below that indicates too cold (as a note, cats are similar and have the same warning signs). Mild (95° - 99°) Moderate (90° - 95°) Severe (< 90°) Main Sources (for additional reading if you want)"
How can I help my adult rabbit gain weight?,"There are a few things to help your bun gain a bit of weight.  In terms of hay, look to add some small quantities of alfalfa to the diet. Don't replace the timothy hay, but supplement in the alfalfa, perhaps about 25-30% ratio. This type of hay is good for young and growing rabbits and so will help her add on some weight as it is loaded with protein. You can also supplement in alfalfa pellets if you're feeding her pellets. Again, same reason. For other foods you can try to include high fat/starch options such as oats, nuts, or barley. Keep it at really small amounts, like 1/4 cup, total daily. Perhaps introduce in smaller amounts at first. Also, treat foods such as raisins (not a lot, but they love them), berries (e.g. strawberries), apple, pear, basically the high sugar options. As with all of the above, once she gains the weight, you'll want to trim back to eliminate some of this. Mostly, you'll want to get the alfalfa back out of her diet for the long term health. Bear in mind, too, that the health episode may have permanently stunted some growth depending on when. In that event, she may have peaked out on the weight.  Finally, when adding all of this into her diet, very carefully monitor her for any signs of illness or lethargy as well as keep an eye on her stools. Anything changes, stop the food supplement and bring her to a vet."
Is it safe for my cat to lick my skin when it has lotion on it?,"Among the things harmful to cats, the American Humane Association states the following:  Cats tend to be attracted to unusual flavors, so keep them away from
  calamine lotion, diaper rash ointments, sunblock and analgesic
  ointments. These products contain an acid related to those in aspirin
  and will prove toxic if ingested. The ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center also says that: We would not expect to see problems as a result of your cats coming
  into contact with your hands after you've applied non-medicated
  lotion. Should they happen to ingest a small amount of this lotion, it
  could potentially have a bit of a laxative effect, and may cause
  stomach upset. However, we would not anticipate systemic or
  life-threatening problems. So in general, if it is a non-medicated lotion, you should be safe. It's not something the cat should likely get a lot of, but if they are just licking your skin after you have applied it and it has soaked into your skin, the cat should be okay. However, if the cat suddenly appears to be ill after licking the lotion, taking proper steps to ensure its safety and health are always top priority, of course!"
How can I get rid of fleas without dangerous chemicals?,"I found a stray puppy some months back at the gate to my home and she was covered with fleas and cuts. She kept biting herself and would also wimper in pain. You could see the fleas in her fur, they were huge. First, I got a small empty aerosol bottle with a spray nozzle and bought a small bag of flea powder (the generic stuff you can get at any store, nothing special). I mixed this with luke-warm water and sprayed her with it for until she was fully doused. About a half-hour later she was fast asleep and when she woke up I noticed she wasn't scratching as much or gnawing at her ankles or rear end as much. The next day I got some flea shampoo and soaped her up, careful to avoid her eyes and mouth and held her in a bath of warm water for about a minute or so before rinsing and drying her off in a towel.
Note: It is important that you shampoo the head thoroughly especially around the eyes and ears as fleas tend to migrate to those areas when exposed to water and this can be very painful for the animal being treated. I didn't see her scratching out of the ordinary after that. Within a month, her fur had smoothed out and she had a healthy coat again also sans the wounds she had previously. I also tend to dust around her kennel every now and then with the same generic flea powder and make sure it is swept and kept clean. Shampooing or spraying a larger or friskier animal might not be so easy and I have never tried this on any other pet I have but I can say without a doubt that it worked. Also, I had never brought her into the house prior to the treatment so no specific advice on that except to perhaps dust corners and gaps in your house, disinfect areas the animals frequent and perhaps also vacuum."
How can I manage a big change in my cat's environment?,"Treat this as a specialized case of introducing a new cat to a household: initial isolation plus gradual expansion should allow for a gentle introduction. When I moved my three adult cats some years ago, I didn't do this and boy did I regret it.  I figured if I just opened the carriers in the basement in front of the litter boxes, with their food and water nearby, all would be fine.  Two cats found places to hide for more than a day and acted skittish for several more days. Last year, I adopted two cats into a cat-less household, and followed the shelter's advice: put each cat in a separate room and only gradually open up more of the house to them (along with gradually introducing them to each other).  While one cat took to hiding for hours at a time once given full run of the house, it wasn't nearly as bad as my moving experience."
Why does my cat walk away (and expect me to follow) while I stroke her?,"If your cat wants you to follow her, and you don't feel like it, don't follow her. She'll be fine. If your cat has clean litter, food, and water, and she's getting regular attention from you and exercise through playing, and she's got a comfy place to sleep, your cat is fine (barring any health problems). She probably wants you to follow her because she wants to monopolize your attention. (Many cats don't like it when their humans pay attention to other things.) If you don't follow her and she still wants your attention, she'll eventually come back - or get bored and wander away.  Where does she go when you follow her? If she leads you to her food bowl, she's trying to get you to feed her. If she leads you to a door, she wants to be on the other side of it. In these cases, and wherever else she takes you, if she leads you to something she wants that you don't want to give her, don't give it to her.  Cats are notorious for trying to bribe their humans with purring and affection to get what they want. Don't fall for it! Accept the cute attention from your feline friend, and then enforce the rules however you like. You're the boss! However, if your cat starts behaving oddly, take note. If she's leading you to a spot where it's not clear what she wants, she may be smelling or hearing something you can't detect. I had a cat that behaved like this and made me follow her to a certain cabinet that didn't seem to contain anything a cat would want... until one day I found mouse droppings in there. She could smell the mice and wanted me to let her in so she could hunt them.  Mostly, she wants your attention. If she's trying to get your attention when it's not convenient for you, it's perfectly fine to ignore her, as long as she's generally getting enough attention from you to be a happy kitty."
How to prevent my dog from bringing stuff into the house?,"Dogs can't learn (or un-learn) behavior ""after the fact"". Once your dog has brought something inside, you can't correct the behavior - you can only correct or teach the dog while the unwanted behavior is happening. So in order to correct this behavior, you'll have to catch the dog in the act. I would suggest supervising your dog when she's playing outside and coming in. This defeats the purpose of the doggy door - allowing your dog independence in going out and coming in - but once she's figured out what behavior you want from her, she'll apply it all the time, even when unsupervised. When your dog goes outside, go out to watch her and stay by the doggy door. Let her do her thing outside. When she heads for the doggy door with an object you don't want inside, stop her and make her drop the object. When she does, praise her and/or treat her, and let her go inside. Once she ""gets"" what you're asking her to do, she should make the ""drop object BEFORE doggy door = good dog"" connection and do it independently. You may end up with a pile of objects right outside the doggy door, which could actually be convenient when it's time to clean up the yard! Edited to add: It occurs to me that this training might get your dog to think that the good behavior is bringing objects from the yard to you, not dropping them outside the doggy door. You'll know if this is happening if you stop supervising your dog and she starts bringing things into the house and finding you to put them down - or if you're not home, putting them somewhere she associates with you (like your shoes, your favorite chair, or your bed).  If this happens, maybe try putting a box or bin of some kind outside the doggy door. She gets the treat when she puts the object in the box. This could prevent her from getting confused about what you want from her. (It could also have the added benefit of teaching her to clean up the yard herself - who knows?)"
Is hand feeding my horses hay enough to supplement their feed if my grass is not enough to sustain them?,"Do your horses seem to be losing weight? Are their ribs showing? Are they lethargic? Do their necks or haunches look thin or bony? If you're unsure, I recommend asking the vet's opinion. How much you need to feed them will depend on their age, metabolism, and how much grass is available to them. I'd recommend starting out with 1-2 40lb. bales of hay/day. If they eat it all, increase a little. If they're consistently leaving hay uneaten, decrease. If they seem to be eating their fill, but are still losing weight, you may want to consider supplementing their diet with grain, beet pulp, sweet feed, and/or senior feed. Make dietary changes gradually and consult with a vet before making any major changes or if you are still uncertain of what you should be feeding."
When is it safe to take my dog out to the park?,"Its always safe to wait till full vaccination.  Taking him to streets or parks is risky without full vaccination.  If you still want to socialize him before full vaccination, then you can make his interaction with known dogs that you know from the neighborhood etc which have had their full vaccination; either at your or their place. Avoid public places. "
What's the most effective way to pick up after and dispose of dog waste?,"If you are looking for an environmentally friendly, convenient, and efficient way to clean up after your dog's waste, there are several products for this. There are products which are built for discreet and convenient waste disposal. They are basically a small cloth bag with multiple compartments, usually one to hold fresh bags and another to hold bags with waste in them.  They can clip onto a belt, a leash, etc.  Here is one product and here is another. This also satisfies the environmentally friendly aspect of your question because it allows for you to pack your own bags or roll of bags.  These bags can be environmentally friendly and biodegradeable.  These bags do just this. A quotation from their product description: GreenNPack eco friendly products are designed to turn plastic into a material that has a completely different molecular structure that is bio-assimilated in the open environment similar to the decomposition of a leaf. If these options aren't convenient for you, you may look into a portable bag dispenser for animal waste, although it may be harder for you to find biodegradable bags for this. As far as disposing of the bags, if you use biodegradable bags, you could put them in the trash and they will eventually decompose like any organics would.  You could also consider using the waste for gardening purposes (compost). If you wanted to throw the waste into the woods with seeds, this may be a little bit more difficult.  You could grab a large leaf (if this is possible where you live) and always have some seeds in the bag cloth bag. Using the bag as a glove, grab the large leaf, pick up the waste, use your free hand to sprinkle some seeds on it, wrap the waste in the leaf, close the bag over everything, tie it so that you can get it undone, and then when you are by the woods, empty the leaf out of the bag into the woods.  This may be complicated, but it is just a suggestion."
What kind of brush should be used with a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel?,"A combination brush which is bristle on one side and pin on the other has worked well for me.  The bristle brush is good for her body fur, which is straight and medium-length so it doesn't tend to tangle. I use the pin brush on her ears, which have the long, curly spaniel fur that can get tangled. The reason I discounted the pin brush initially is that I was looking for one brush to use for all her fur, and the pin brush had no effect on her body fur.  Once I realized the two fur types were so different, I decided to take a combination approach, which has worked well."
How much food should I be giving my dog to maintain his weight?,"Most store-bought dog food bags have a feeding guide for distributing the daily amount of food.  This guide is based on dog weight, but the recommended amount may vary based on the richness of the food. The actual amount consumed is directly related to the attitude of the dog, and their activity and metabolism rates, their gender and their ages. For my dogs, they fall within the 15-25 pound range (the 13-year-old is 15 lbs, the 5-year-old is 23 lbs) and their individual foods both recommend 1 cup of kibble per day.  I divide it into two 1/2 cup meals (morning and evening).  The vet stated both dogs are at the correct weight for their individual sizes; they are not overweight. The 23 lb dog sometimes doesn't eat all of her food in the morning, to which I add the other 1/2 cup in the evening.  She sometimes doesn't eat all of it.  She is not overweight and she doesn't eat other things.  She is the more active of the two dogs.  The 15 lb dog only picks in the morning and consumes everything at night, including some of the larger dog's kibble.  He is somewhat inactive, but I believe he has a high metabolism."
Can dogs be infected by the brain-eating amoeba?,"I suspect the answer is theoretically ""yes"" because basic chemical makeup and temperature of a human brain is not dissimilar from a canine brain. So the question is, can the canine brain become infected with the amoeba?  In humans, the infections have come from swimming in contaminated water and taking the amoeba in through the nose or through use of a Neti-Pot. The term ""brain-eating amoeba"" makes the amoeba sound like a tiny
zombie stalking your skull. But brains are accidental food for them. According to the CDC, N. fowleri normally eats bacteria. The good news is that if you were to drink a glass of water
infested with N. fowleri amoeba, you would not get a brain infection.
It infects people by getting into your nose. Source So the risk comes from ways your dog can get water in the nose.  And then, even if the water gets into the nose, only a small percentage of time will that water contain an amoeba, and even if it does contain the amoeba, there is a good chance the amoeba will not make it to your dogs brain, but instead end up cycling through his system the way the rest of the water does. How Do Amoebas Get in the Brain? Studies suggest that N. fowleri amoebas are attracted to the chemicals
that nerve cells use to communicate with one another. Once in the
nose, the amoebas travel through the olfactory nerve (the nerve
connected with sense of smell) into the frontal lobe of the brain. How Frequently Do People Get Infected by Brain-Eating Amoeba? Even though N. fowleri amoebas are relatively common, they only rarely
cause brain disease. N. fowleri disease is known as primary amoebic
meningoencephalitis (PAM). It occurs from zero to eight times a year,
almost always from July to September. SOURCE It's a rare occurance, and it mostly happens in the summer.  The best thing to do is not stress to much, avoid allowing your dog to swim in untreated warm freshwater (SOURCE: see How Can Infection with Naegleria fowleri be Prevented?) and be careful while giving him a bath, and your dog should be fine.  As noted in one of your links, there are many experts who believe that it is not possible for a dog to even get the parasitic infection in the first place.  I asked my vet friend, and while she was unwilling to commit to the opinion that it was impossible, she stated there was enough differences in the canine nasal cavity from the humans, that she believed the incidence of infection would be drastically reduced."
Why does my cat scratch so much against the sides of his litter box?,"It is most likely a combination of marking his territory (aka the litter box), and also possibly cleaning off his paws from the litter that gets in-between the pads. It's not really a problem, because trying to stop it could give the cat an aversion to the litter box, which results in the cat using anything else as a litter box.  It could also be that the cat is entertaining himself by digging in the litter. "
Does my cat have eye worms?,"First, please clean your cat's eye to prevent further infection. Next, comfort your cat and very lastly after making a comfy travel crate with cushions and some course of water to keep from hitting eye, and staying hydrated to fight whatever infection the cat has. Take the cat to get a second opinion like you would for a child."
Can I allow my puppy near my breast?,"15 days is way too young to separate a puppy from the mother. Like Trond Hansen wrote, the puppy has to eat mother's milk in this age to be healthy and it needs the body of the mum to stay warm and comfortable. This could be the reason the puppy searches for the body contact with you. The near breast is not its aim I believe, because there is no smell of milk (I assume you have worries about this? Am I right?) in case you are no new mum now. You write ""the puppy is too much attached"" but this I assume is normal in this age. Being 15 days old, a puppy has no (really NO) chance to live without the support of other (normally the mum) animals. It knows this and is active searching for protection. It wants to stay close and be sure it is protected by someone against enemies, cold and hunger. Its understanding does not reach through a door, over a ""normal"" distance or differ between nature and your home. Because of that, it needs short distance to its protectors (you and your family) to feel good and be the best puppy it could be."
How can I tell if a breeder is ethical?,"I don’t see any red flags - in fact, some of the points in your first list are what I would consider pros not cons. Let’s go through them: Puppies, like people, have different personalities, temperaments and traits, yes, even from the same litter. A good breeder will be able to recognize them very early and will strive to match applicants and dogs. It simply doesn’t make sense to place the most sensitive and timid puppy with the family with four rambunctious kids and a loud and hectic lifestyle or a dominant dog with the elderly lady who just wanted a peaceful companion just because someone fell in love with the specific pup. At worst, this may even mean that even someone high on the priority list of applicants ends up empty handed and the puppy goes to someone further down if it appears a significantly better fit.
When we applied for our puppy (GSD, working line, some Schutzdienst champions in the ancestry, so not entirely uncomplicated), the breeder asked me after the first visit whether we had a favorite and we had two “not this one” candidates - the two with the most drive and dominance. She confirmed that she would never have given them to us either. When we finally picked one, it was the one that she’d had in mind for us right from the start.
Conclusion: Not a red flag, rather a plus. Supply and demand? And if they have just a litter every few months or years, that’s not much money for them. Good vet care and good dog keeping are expensive and time consuming. Higher prices also keep the “bargain hunters” away. If the first question of a buyer is “how much?”, many reputable breeders will see that as a red flag and decline immediately.
Conclusion: Not a red flag. That may be personal preference - for example if you are keeping your dogs in your living room, you may not be comfortable to post your private space for everyone to see. Or it’s just not “photogenic” - and dogs couldn’t care less about it. On the other hand, pretty pictures don’t necessarily mean much either, as Instagram etc. have taught us. I always would insist on meeting with the breeder and the dogs at their place. Then you will see and sense for yourself whether it’s a good fit or not (see also first bullet point). Don’t be afraid to say “no thanks”, if your gut feeling is bad, no matter how far you have traveled or how excited you are to get a puppy. This is a puppy, not a coffee machine. We are talking about a very limited number of dogs, so the number of people that could have posted reviews (where, btw.?) is also limited. They are probably more busy with training, walking and loving their dogs than writing reviews. In my opinion, it’s the other way around: Lots of reviews would make me wonder how many puppies they have produced and why they need the advertising. Good kennels are known by word of mouth (we had a few inquiries about our puppy’s line and origin already) and if they breed for a specific use, by the achievements of their dogs. Memberships in reputable organizations is also a plus, certifying that the kennel for example mates only health dogs and monitors the health of their offspring. The biggest red flag for me is any kind of sales focus - when a breeder is more interested in selling a puppy than in their future home. If they don’t ask questions about you, your life and circumstances and your plans with the dog (don’t lie, remember you want a good fit - we were clear that we would be working with our dog, also depending on his fortes, but not necessarily compete in Schutzdienst, no matter how successful his ancestors were). Ask whether they will be available for questions in the future. Some kennel have “reunions” or keep up otherwise with their doggy clan. Some contracts also include a passage that if you sell the dog within a certain time frame, the breeder gets  the right of first refusal."
Why does my dog urinate when I call her?,"Just because both dogs have been getting the same reprimands does not mean they will react the same way. If the female has more of a submissive personality to begin with, which it sounds like from your other statements, she is very likely to have a stronger fear response. As a result, she is learning to associate her name -- or at least, her name when called by you -- with punishment. You can try positively loading the word by saying her name and then reinforcing with something positive: a treat, a favorite toy, a gentle scritch, whatever she likes. Start by doing that several times in a row -- name, treat, name, treat -- a couple of times a day. Since she seems to be afraid that the male will intervene, do this with the male closed in another room to remove that external stimulus.  Once she is more comfortable with you calling her name, reintroduce the male during these times, but be ready to remove him again if he does try to interfere with your affection to the female. (On a side note, the best way to discourage jumping, I've found, is to just turn your body away from them when they jump, and give a firm ""No!"" or ""No jump!"" Follow that with an alternate command, like ""Sit"" and then treat and pet when they do. The point is to let them know that if they want affection, they have to ask for it the right way -- by sitting, not jumping. Always replace a negative behavior with a positive one so they can learn what they should do.)"
How best to discipline a kitten?,"Punishing him by locking him in a cage is NOT the answer. In fact, punishment when it comes to litter-training issues in general is counterproductive, but locking the poor mite in a cage is just plain cruel. Assuming there are no medical issues going on (and it doesn't sound like there are, as you say you've had him checked over) then you just need to double down on the litter training. Make sure his tray is clean, has anti-odor, non-clumping litter in it and is not right next to the area where his food is. If your house/apartment allows, consider adding another tray somewhere else in the house to ensure ready access. Lift him onto the tray every time he shows signs of needing to go (look not just for squatting but also for pawing at whatever surface he is on). And every time he uses the tray, either to urinate or defecate, heap praise on him, maybe even a treat or two. If this is a recent development and litter use in general isn't affected, then I'd be wondering whether there is something that is causing him to feel territorial.. you mention a dog, how do they get on? Also, if the dog sleeps on your bed at all, there might be a bit of scenting going on here either to communicate or to compete over territory."
How is a dog's health affected if he's (almost) never bathed?,"When was the last time you saw a wolf showering? :) We've got a pure breed Siberian Husky and an Alaskan Husky for 3.5 and 2 years now. The older one was bathed twice so far (before we got him and once last year due to excessive dirt). This does not include the dogs bathing on their own in bodies of water such as the kids pool we bought for them or our pond. Both have zero health issues as expected. We only clean them with pure water if there's stuck mud or similar. Both have almost perfect fur - typically groomed once a week by us - and don't smell or anything. In fact, too much bathing can be an even bigger issue, since it can and will affect the oils protecting fur and skin for example. Edit: Just forgot to mention that this also heavily depends on the actual breed of the dog. The more ""natural"" (i.e. closer to original wolves) their hair is, the less likely it is to need extra attention. For example, a Poodle will have significantly more issues with dirt than a German Shepard or Siberian Husky. And regarding the oily residue: This can be similar to human skin, i.e. old skin cells, dirt, etc. mixed with oils from the skin. It's hard to interpret from that description, but I wouldn't worry too much, especially if the dog looks and behaves healthy."
Why do dogs look humans directly in the eyes?,"Many people (including myself) believe that dogs can read and understand human emotions. Studies attempting to look at this claim from a scientific point of view have shown that humans display emotions and feelings through their eyes. It was found that when two people meet, they look into the right side of human face first and the same behaviour was found with dogs - dogs look at the right side of human face first as that side displays the strongest of emotion.  I recently watched a BBC documentary that was very closely related to this article and what I took away from that is the key why dogs are so close to humans are because they can ""understand"" your emotions and feelings and react accordingly, and they do that by reading into your facial expressions, esp. your eyes. (See the relevant sequence of the documentary on Youtube) I cannot speak for wolves, but dogs at least seem to gaze into humans eyes to gauge our emotions."
Cat in a electronics hobbyist house,"As background, my husband has a similar electronics hobby and I sew. We lived in a house where we did our hobbies in the living room for a few years, but eventually moved into a house large enough that we each have a 'hobby room' and can shut the door to keep the cats out. I honestly believe this is the best long term solution. While we lived in our small house, we relied on self-discipline, supervision, and training. Self-Discipline Basically, if we weren't actively working on a project, all of the dangerous parts had to be put away into containers that the cats couldn't open or swallow.  One way to make this easier (especially if you have things intricately laid out), you can work in the lid of an underbed storage box. When it's time to put things away, put the body of the box on top and hope the cat doesn't knock the whole thing off your table. I'd recommend a box with a locking lid. Supervision  Make sure that you can easily see all of your dangerous parts at all times so you can shoo away the cat before he starts disturbing stuff.  One method we've used for distraction is to keep a large supply of toys nearby. When the cat starts looking interested in the dangerous stuff, throw a toy into the next room. Catnip mice in bulk are a good option for distraction.  Training Train your cat to not ever get on your work surface.  First, you need to make sure that you provide other surfaces that meet the same needs (generally, height, interesting toys, and easy interaction with you).  Then, you need some sort of discipline system that is not associated with you. We use ssscat, which uses a motion detector to shoot a puff of air at the cat. People also sometimes use carpet protectors placed nubby side up. Finally, when you are working if the cat jumps onto your work station, you need to quickly, firmly, and with no emotion, put the cat on the floor. Once the cat is on the floor (or their own nearby surface), then pet the cat or give him a treat. Additionally, when he's nearby (on his own surface or the floor), you should also reward him with treats or affection."
Is distilled or spring water better for fish tanks?,"Distilled or reverse osmosis water does not have the minerals necessary to buffer pH. If used exclusively you will have a very unstable pH which is dangerous for fish. Spring water can vary in composition, in terms of minerals and pH, again creating an unstable environment. Bottled water can even be chlorinated. Combine this with the instability and you're better off using dechlorinated tap water in most cases.  If you want to go down that route distilled/RO is preferred, but this must be remineralised.  References Following page lists pH of various bottled waters, ranging from 3.37 to 11, highlighting the varying composition.
http://phconnection.com/Bottled_Water_pH_List.html Following article from fishkeeping.co.uk, a popular online community, talks about the use of RO water, remineralising and buffers.
http://www.fishkeeping.co.uk/articles_109/ro-freshwater.htm Article from a manufacturer of RO systems stating 'RO water has little or no buffering capacity. That means that the addition of even a small amount of acid will have a large effect on pH.' 
http://www.puretap.com/ph.htm Article on water chemistry for fish keepers which states 'changing the pH by more than .3 units per day is known to stress fish.'

A dog who doesn't want to have a walk,"A very good answer there but there are ways to help your dog enjoy a walk, especially with the others.  First, understand that a stray dog is very different from dog raised home from a puppy. At a basic level, a dog is like a wolf(an ancestor) but unfortunately, due to centuries of human contacts, not as efficient. A stray dog’s survival is based on his ability to find food efficiently. They usually set off at dawn and look for substance all day if they have to. If other strays are in the area, there is competition and food become scarce.  If the dog is successful, it will return to the den satisfied until the next meal which usually is in the evening before dusk. Again, success will be important there, to return to the den. If you look carefully, you’ll notice that any dogs are most active in the morning and early evening, as long as they are satisfied, mimicking the above. As per the above answer, it’s very clear that this dog is associating being outside with bad experiences, probably because he struggled greatly and now he is content with what you are offering. You could do nothing and he probably would be fine. However, You must ask yourself if this dog would be happy living like this? Is he true to himself, does he have the best quality of life he really deserve? I have trained many dogs and it is possible to help him. Basically, a dog can get stuck in his memories: Outside = pain/hardship  As a leader, you must start thinking you can help, first by erasing the above. Dogs can feel what you feel. They have now been proven to be capable of reading human emotions, understanding them and replicate as per study mentioned here: Dog emotions study Think positive and the dog will also. The next stage is to change the dog’s memory of outside and replacing it with positive associations. Initially you start inside. Training in basic commands with rewards is a must. It will help the relationship between you and the dog, establishing trust. The others must also be involved to create a pack unity, giving the stray dog a place and a positive purpose. Next: play time, also with rewards. Not always food, sometimes hugs and cuddles or the usual”good dog!”  Start small. Small things. Little and often is best.  Slowly move towards a door, then do it with the door open or in the garden. Then do it just outside by the door. Then a bit further and so on...  It takes work but it’s worth it... I’ve had lots of strays in my life and if you put the work in, you’ll be amazed how great they become. It will also benefit your other dogs... it will stretch them as well and really fill their lives and yours... It takes a lot of patience and effort... I am happy to help if you have more questions.  Good luck!"
How fast do rabbits really breed?,"As noted in Monicas answer Gestation period is generally 28-31 days.  It varies greatly by breed.  My English lops usually go on day 29 but I have had a few that went on 30 and a few instances where they went over 31 days with the latest being 36 days(no that did not go well).  Netherland dwarfs on the other hand go day 30-31.  I have never had one go earlier or later.  Some of the commercial breeds like M70 (a New Zealand cross for commercial production) have been selected for short cycle times to maximise their production value.  A breeder friend of mine reports periods of as short as 24 days in his M70 herd. The number of rabbits varies by several factors.  First is breed.  Smaller breeds tend to have smaller litters.  For my netherlands my average has been 3-4 per litter with the largest being 7, though only one survived the first day and all were very small.  My english lops tend to be 8-12 depending on the lines.  There are definitely lines that I have noticed greater numbers from than others.  My friends M70's typically have 12-16 per litter. In a domestic setting most breeders will wait at least 60 days between breedings.  This gives the doe time to recover from the stress of having the babies as well as to care for the litter.  I personally give at least 90 days to allow the rabbit to fully recover.  Most quality breeders will recommend no more than 3 litters in a year.  Rabbits that are bred right back seem to have less healthy and lower quality litters than those that are given an opportunity to recover fully. In the wild rabbits are not constrained like a domestic herd and breed pretty much right back so long as there is an alpha buck near by.  Cottontails typically have litters of 6-10 about 6-7 times a year.  Given a 50% mortality rate a breeding pair of rabbits can easily grow to to 50 in just one year.  Repeat that for just 2 years and you have over 30000 rabbits provided there is food and shelter enough to support them.   The phrase arose because sailors would seed islands as they explored with rabbits.  In just few years, with few predators, a half a dozen rabbits could fill a good size an island with a source of food to hunt, and this is the origin of the phrase breeding like rabbits."
"Do cucumbers spook cats? If so, why?","Cats in general are often very jumpy when faced with an unknown or unexpected object.  My cat has jumped and hissed at me when I've done nothing in particular except surprise her by being there when she didn't expect it.  It's become an Internet meme that cats are afraid of cucumbers, and as a result, people are going out of their way to have cucumbers suddenly ""appear"" at their pets.  I suspect the reaction would be similar to other suddenly appearing objects the cat isn't really familiar with."
Which shrimp will co-exist with my loaches and schooling fish?,"Amano shrimp are good tank mates for community fish.  They'll ignore your fish altogether.  And they eat algae 24x7, which never hurts.  Amano shrimp require brackish water for breeding, so won't breed in most tanks.  This also makes them difficult to find. Cherry shrimp (and their color varieties) will also be no threat to your fish.  But, they are very small, so aggressive fish (barbs, for example) may go after them.  They breed quite easily and rapidly, so if you want more of them make sure you have plenty of hiding places for the young shrimp.  Cherry shrimp are also algae eaters, though being so small you'll need huge quantities of them to have an real impact if algae controll is a goal. Really, for most shrimp in tanks, the issue isn't if they are a danger to the fish, but if the fish will be a danger to the shrimps.  Even larger shrimp may find their extremities and tails the target of nipping.  The tetras shouldn't be a problem for the shrimp, but the loaches may go after them. Edit: One heads up about shrimp (and most aquarium invertebrates, actually).  A lot of medications and chemicals you might use in a tank are poisonous to them.  So once they are in there, you'll need to be extra careful with what you put into the tank, and check that it is safe for shrimp."
How do I switch from free-feeding my cat dry food to meal-feeding her wet food?,"Cats have a natural hunt-eat-groom-sleep cycle that you can take advantage of in this sort of situation. Hunt: About a 10-30 minutes (depending on your cat's energy level) before meal time, start playing with your cat with an interactive wand toy such as Da Bird. You want to simulate prey movements with the toy. Try out moving along the ground (like a snake or mouse) as well as in the air (like a bird) until you know what most interests your cat. Hunting will stimulate your cat's appetite. Eat: Once your cat shows signs of getting tired (loosing interest), then feed your cat its wet food meal. Leave the food out for 30 minutes and then pick it up (discard). Your cat will eventually learn that it needs to eat during meal time! Groom/Sleep: You should then observe the groom and sleep phases of the cycle. We do a feeding right before bed so they let us sleep :-) Weigh your cat frequently Anytime you are changing your cat's meal structure you should weigh your cat every few days to make sure that she doesn't loose more than ""1%-2% of their current body weight per week."" (per Lisa A. Pierson, DVM). If your cat starts to loose weight faster than that because she's still not eating a full meal, try a food that has more calories per ounce (there are some cat food composition charts like this one available on the web)."
How do I euthanise crickets?,"First of all, don't release them into the environment without checking with your local authorities whether it's okay to do so. Chances are that the captive crickets you have bought are not local to your area. The introduction of non-native animals to an environment unused to them can disrupt the local wildlife by introducing new predators, spreading disease and introducing competition for food sources. Freezing The most humane and efficient way of disposing of them, especially if you have large numbers, is to tip them into a bag, seal it closed and place the bag in the freezer for 24 hours. (You can double-bag it if you're worried about contaminating your food.) After 24 hours all the insects will be dead* and you can dispose of them with your normal household waste. Insects are ectothermic, which means that in cold temperatures their metabolism just slows down until they die. The insects go into a cold-induced coma from which they do not recover. In fact freezing - albeit a more slow reduction in temperature - is the preferred humane method of culling for some insect farms: Little Herds when they're culled we lower the temperature so that there's no violent death or change in state (because insects are exothermic their metabolism slows until they go into a coma-like sleep without any pain). I can't think of a more humane way to raise our meat. Big Cricket Farms Our crickets are harvested by freezing. As with many insects, crickets will slow down in low temperatures, and reach a state called diapause. Once they've gone dormant, we freeze them in a deeper freeze. Not only does this humanely kill the crickets, it also ensures that the bugs remain as fresh as possible until they're ready to be prepared as food or dehydrated and processed. You could attempt to emulate the more gentle freezing method, perhaps by use of a water bath or by repeatedly taking them in and out of the freezer. Or you could accept that freezing, even the quick kind, is probably as humane a death as the death they would have got from being eaten ;) Crushing I have also heard the suggestion that you can crush their heads with feeding tongs or tweezers as a humane way of killing them. However, it's not very practical if you have hundreds of them. There is also some debate as to how humane this method is, because the insects remain alive for a while after having their heads crushed. I found a method for killing cockroaches on a forum which suggests a more humane adaptation of the ""crushing method"": If you need to swiftly kill them [...] crush the head and make two quick incisions on their ventral side (between the last two pairs of legs and in the middle off the abdomen) you will humanely euthanize the roach. The roach's nervous system runs ventrally and making those two incisions after crushing the head will [e]nsure that the body does not go through excessive pain, since it will still be (by many definitions) alive after the head has been dealt with.  This suggestion was for a single insect at a time and is even less practical than simple head-crushing if you have large quantities. However, if you need to kill only a few insects it sounds like a humane option. * Note that you may see reports of frozen crickets reviving, but these crickets have typically been frozen under carefully-controlled conditions. For example, the ones in this study (the one referenced by the report I linked to) slowly cooled the crickets from 25°C to 0°C over 1 hr 40 minutes, then held then at 0°C. In contrast, a typical home freezer is -18°C and the crickets will reach that temperature within minutes due to their low body mass:surface area ratio, subjecting them to cold shocks, unrecoverable tissue damage and death.

What is wool block in rabbits?,"‘Wool Block’ and ‘Hairball’ are the same thing, and the terms may be used interchangeably, bunnies groom themselves and the hair stays in their gut.  They are incapable of vomiting so the only avenue is for it to pass through. The primary cause is lack of GI mobility generally combined with a lack of fiber.  Hay should be available at all times to a bunny, to maintain digestive health. There are a lot of opinions on treatments, but as far as I am aware there are not any hard scientific studies on best treatments.   There are many folk remedies, they all focus on getting something into the bunny to help break-up and move the blockage.  The following is a case study of bunny with extreme examples of a hairball and weight issues.  Common sense also dictates that keeping your pet rabbit, well brushed will decrease the amount of fur that is available for digestion Case Study At this Writing Baxter is about 11 Years old, and has been in our family since July 2009.  He is a brown and white Dutch.  He spent his early years in a first grade school class room.  He came to us when the teacher was no longer able to keep him in the class room.  He was morbidly obese as seen in the pictures below, with a similarly rabbit of normal weight.  
 I must admit that at the time we did not realize the severity of his condition, we took him to a vet who was an exotic vet, but not as skilled in rabbits as we had thought.   I won’t go into details, but the visit turned out to be less then helpful.  Harmony on the left was our first bunny rescued from the local humane society WPHS a couple of months previously.  Baxter and Harmony were bonded and living together in about 2 weeks (these photos are an early bonding session). Over the next several months we became more active in the local bunny community, started volunteering at the shelter and interacting with the Pittsburgh House Rabbit Club, Baxter was losing weight and we were getting more educated about bunnies.  Baxter and Harmony were sharing an endless supply of hay, Fresh greens twice a day and about two table spoons of pellets twice a day, plenty of water and a salt lick. In about February 2010, Baxter had an “Episode” he stopped eating, seemed to be in some pain, and possibly having seizures.  This was our first bunny medical emergency, we reached out to the bunny community and were put in touch with one of the founders of Rabbit Wranglers, we managed to get through the episode with a live bunny, and scheduled a visit with an exceptional rabbit vet.   The exam revealed a large mass in Baxter’s stomach, on x-ray he was found to have a huge hairball in his stomach (I have an x-ray but the scanner will not pick up the image).  The hairball was about twice the size of his head.  He had some irregular labs (CA 13.3 mg/dl; ALT 78U/L ; ALKP 46 U/L; CHOL 30 mg/dl) and the vet was worried about his kidneys.  His molars needed to be trimmed.  Several options were discussed for treating the hairball. We learned that a rabbit always has some hair in their stomach so the goal was not to completely eliminate it, just get it to a point that it did not interfere with GI mobility Sluggish Motility in the Gastrointestinal Tract, Susan Brown, DVM  We went home worried about the long term health of our bunny.  It was obvious that months of “proper diet” had not controlled the hairball.  We tried raw pineapple juice for a couple weeks, but did not notice a notable change in the hairball (it was very easy to feel just by touching his belly), nor did we notice an increase in linked poops (when passing hair bunny poop is often connected by the hair).  Realizing the risk of prolonged consumption of high sugar foods we discontinued the pineapple.  Digestibility in the Rabbit Diet, Marinell Harriman in consultation with Carolynn Harvey, DVM  There is some question if it is the increased moisture or the enzymes that impact the hairball, and as I have said previously there is not overwhelming scientific data for any solution.  We began adding canned pumpkin to his diet (NOT Pumpkin pie filling).  Pumpkin is a popular remedy for diet replacement in sick bunnies and those who have lost all their teeth due to massive dental issues.    Over the next couple of years, there have been multiple reoccurrences of the episode; presumably GI Stasis, but his presentation is slightly different then I have heard others described, and it has not reoccurred while in the presence of others more skilled.  The possibility also exists that gas is part of the issue.  For the first couple of years every episode was followed by a vet visit, a regime of Reglan (and occasional other GI drugs).   Our current emergency response to any suspected GI Stasis is to give gas drops right away (He will often lick berry flavored “Little Tummys Gas Drops” out of a spoon) force feed if necessary.  If we don’t see positive results within an hour or two, we feed baby food, carrots, banana or squash are all good choices, again by force if necessary.  So far he has always returned to his normal diet.  Sometimes within 12 hours, but occasionally it has taken a couple weeks.  Prolonged delay in return to normal, general involves a vet visit and Reglan.  We discussed the possibility of surgical removal of the hairball but, our vet strongly discouraged this, he says that half of the bunnies do not survive stomach surgery. Baxter continued to lose weight, it was probably six months before he could see his front paws around his dewlap.  Even today his dewlap has not retracted, it is no longer full of fat, but is just baggy skin (See image of a normal sixed Baxter and two friends).  The increase in Pumpkin resulted in a decrease in hay consumption.  We know of several bunnies that lived years with pumpkin as their only source of fiber so this does not cause us undue worry, one side effect in Baxter has been a decrease in the size of his poop, and a need for teeth trimming a couple times a year.  At some point around a year after joining our family it became clear that Baxter was getting too skinny.  We increased the pumpkin and added extra food pellets to his diet, the hairball was shrinking and by around 2 years it had shrunk to an acceptable size.  But much like the skin of his dewlap that had not receded, it seems his stomach also did not rebound from the stretching.  It is difficult to diagnosis but it seems that his stomach is no longer as effective at digesting food.  Baxter will occasionally binge on salt and water, licking the salt lick and then drinking water, repeating for several minutes.  There is no doubt that it took years for the hairball to get to a reasonable size.  In our estimation it was the salt and water, and/or the pumpkin that ultimately dissolved the hairball.   Currently Baxter is part of a bonded trio (Lyra is the white bunny) He shares regular meals and a “proper diet” with the girls, in addition twice a day he has two heaping table spoons of pumpkin, a teaspoon of rolled oats and two table spoon of pellets (this is easily doubling the normal diet for the other two). His weight is stable but remains a little under ideal.   Update 2 years later: Baxter continued to have digestive issue and bouts of stasis.  As he got older his interest in food slacked, and it became more difficult to keep his weight up.  At the age of 13 he passed, with issues related to age and digestive health. "
What are healthy treats for a house rabbit?,"Treats can be a very important part of training your bunny.  Like many pets, bunnies can be motivated by attention and/or food rewards, so using treats can be a great training device.  Any high-sugar treat like fruit should be only a small part of bunnies diet, so moderation is important. It has been recommended that fruit is not more than 10% of a bunnies diet.   Carrots (also high in sugar) are recommended to be not more then 15% of the diet. For my pets, I try and keep the total of all high-sugar treats to not more then 5%;  occasionally days will pass without added sugar.  This makes the reward more effective and is better for bunny health. Depending on metabolism and/or proportionate to veggies, you should be limiting the amount of pellets your bunny receives to 1/4 to 1/2 cup pellets per 6 lbs. (2.7 kg) body weight.  Part of this daily pellet allowance can be used as a treat, for general behavior, and for training.   For the big events requiring high motivation, I use raisins.  They keep well and are small enough that I can give as many as 3 daily for really difficult challenges.  Your rabbit is very trainable so using a keyword when calling your bunny for a treat can be very rewarding for you both. When calling them, we use the word ""quick"" followed by their name.  You don't need to have a high-sugar treat every time they come on command.  Their being unsure if the reward will be high-sugar, providing a pellet or a pet will increase their responsiveness (this is why gambling can be so addictive).   Remember, no amount of treat will entice a bunny into a situation that makes them feel threatened. Socialization of the bunny and moderation of the visitors behavior are both important parts of the interaction, and it sounds like you are doing a great job making this part of your process. "
My cat suddenly stopped using the litter-box to defecate,"An anal gland infection/impaction may cause him to associate pain with the litter box.  In the early stages, there will be no evidence of a problem. http://cats.about.com/cs/healthissues/a/analglands.htm Other than the issues noted already, this is the only thing I can think of that would cause your cat to avoid the litter box."
"My cat will only play with silicone earplugs, which is concerning. How do I fix that?","James Jenkins' answer is very near what I would have suggested, but I see from your comment that you've tried alternative toys with little success. Before I go on, I want to repeat what James said about the existing headphones: get rid of them.  All of them.  Keeping your cat entertained isn't worth the risk of an intestinal blockage. Since new toys haven't worked for you, try creating safer versions of the preferred toy.  Find something made out of safer material that is of a size and shape similar to the earplug.  In fact, a cat treat or piece of dry cat food tied to a string may work, and could conceivably be even more attractive to the cat than the earplug. If food doesn't work, try other small objects of a safe material.  If you can entice your cat to play with something different, even briefly, you will eventually be able to get your cat to forget the earplugs altogether. Just be sure to not leave the string itself unattended where the cat could possibly get to it; an ingested string can be very dangerous if it becomes tangled in the intestines (we had a cat that the vet suspected of doing that, and we wound up having extensive surgery to address the concern)."
"What is the difference between ""Open Door"" and ""Limited Access"" shelter policies?","I don't know if it varies from area to area, but I believe that 'Open Door' implies that the shelter accepts any animal, any time of the day in pretty much any condition. Limited access shelters might not take certain kinds of animals, or animals with what appear to be serious health or behavioral concerns. They can also accept certain kinds of animals, but disallow specific breeds. This is a term that I first became aware of when I discovered Alley Animals, an organization that feeds, rescues and places strays in the Baltimore / Washington area. They came into existence broadly because so many of the shelters and animal hospitals were / are limited access - and generally won't accept known feral animals. The only agency accepting these animals was animal control, which meant an almost certain unpleasant outcome for the animal. If you've found a stray or injured animal, you definitely want to look for an open door shelter. Lost pets with collars, tattoos, etc would generally be welcome in a limited access facility, but your best bet is to just call them if you can to be sure. Worth noting, limited access facilities aren't necessarily bad places, and I certainly don't want to portray them as such. They just have very limited facilities, and cope with that by limiting what comes in."
Is there a way to prevent another dog from pooping on our grass?,"Some ideas, since you are unable to identify the other dog:"
Why is my rabbit / bunny angry?,"Rabbits have two traits that can cause this behavior, they are very territorial and they have a strong grooming hierarchy.     I assume your rabbit enjoys getting petted, If you sit on the floor she will probably come lay next to you and let you pet her for long periods.  She may also jump up on the couch or bed to spend time with you. She is the Princess and you are required to pet/groom her on demand. If this is the case, she will likely have her head low and be in the ""you should pet me now position"" after ""attacking"" you. The fault here is yours, you have failed to recognize her superior position as the Princess and provide the grooming she demands. When passing her, you should always acknowledge her ""Princess"" status by bending down and giving her at least one pet.  If your rabbit is not a Princess, she may have tired of you invading Her space, she it telling you to ""Get Out"".  Her head is probably high, ears forward (if she has stand up ears), she may box at you with her front feet.  The difference in behavior between ""Princess"" and ""Get Out"" may be subtle.   Growling. Some rabbits do growl, it is more common in the smaller rabbits, lion heads are more likely to growl then other breeds (in my opinion). It is a communication trait, it does not correlate with dog growls.  It can have many meanings. We have a growling rabbit, if it has specific meaning we have not translated it yet. "
Why do cats act like their food bowl is empty when there is still food left?,"I have noticed this and wondered about it too.  My very vocal cat was crying at me the other day, since I was 30 minutes past the normal feeding time. I looked and they still had some dry food from the morning. I decided to experiment and went over and just shook their food plate making it sound like I dumped food on their plate. It is a flat plate so no whisker contact is involved.  This satisfied him and he stopped crying and ate happily. I believe some of it has to do with them noticing that the food adding event did not occur and becoming worried that there is a break in the normal pattern. Taken a bit further; the patterns and the routines in which we care for and interact with our cats seems to be comforting to them. They may become a little upset when the routine changes or does not proceed according to schedule."
Can rabbits fart?,"While I did not find any reliable references that clearly put it as boldly as the question, there can be little doubt that rabbits do fart. Lets begin by looking at a rabbits digestive track.  Image from Wikimedia Commons Notice that the stomach is very early in the digestive track, this is the usual problem area noted for gas accumulation in bloat.  Then follows the small intestine, and the at the beginning of the large intestine is the caecum/cecum.  The rabbit cecum is much more developed than in most other animals.  Food products stop in the cecum and ferment (Nutritional Ecology of the Ruminant By Peter J. Van Soest Page 67) generally staying there until night, with gas as one of the products of fermentation.  The rabbit cecum is described in veterinary imaging references as a ""large gas chamber that contains a mixture of food and gas"" (Diagnostic Imaging of Exotic Pets: Birds, Small Mammals, Reptiles By Maria-Elisabeth Krautwald-Junghanns, Michael Pees, Sven Reese, Thomas Tully), which is particularly noted for it's difficulty to image (i.e. Xray, etc)  Disruption of motility of the cecum is called ""cecolith"" and can be diagnosed by an increase in the amount of gas in the cecum. (Ferrets, Rabbits and Rodents: Clinical Medicine and Surgery By Katherine Quesenberry, James W. Carpenter).   So we know that gas is produced in the cecum, and if there is decreased motility the gas increases, the logical conclusion is that in the healthy rabbit the gas continues through the colon, and is expelled from the anus. At this point there can be little doubt that healthy rabbits fart. One of the recognized treatments for gas in rabbits is Simethicone, an anti-foaming agent that helps in the passing of gas (Rabbit Health in the 21st Century: A Guide for Bunny Parents By Kathy Smith).  Note that gas accumulation in rabbits is potentially (often) fatal, so prevention of accumulation is extremely important."
How should I teach my cats to use a cat door?,"What I would do is that I would first move the door flaps up and hold them up with tape. Once both the flaps are open call your cat through the door and present it to a nice treat, I'm sure he'll make it through the door very when he smells what he can get on the other side. One your cats go through the door without any issues you may remove the tapped door flaps in order to take them on to the next level which is just to simply push forward and passing through to get the treat. Like any other training, it just takes patience, don't get frustrated if they don't do it right away and do it in small lapses of 10 to 20 mins for 2 to 3 times per day. You'll see this resolved in a matter of a few days. Don't worry if they don't do it right away, don't be too pushy with the training, I happen to know that cats are extremely curious in their nature and I'm sure you won't have any trouble with the cat door training."
How do I know when I need to replace the charcoal in my aquarium filter?,"The usefulness of carbon in your tank is, well, debatable... there are some pros and cons, some not always grounded in good science. Anyways, the useful life of the carbon portion of the filter is about two weeks and it's good for removing any contaminants or medications you may have needed to add to the system in that time. Beyond that, the filter is less useful. What you want to make sure is that when you're changing your filtration, you don't remove the bacteria (or minimize it) that are actually working to keep the tank, and your fish, healthy. What will keep your system in good shape is proper water maintenance and so you might want to read up on the nitrogen cycle as a way of keeping your scaly friends healthy."
"Goldfish unresponsive, what should I do?","Your goldfish has ammonia poisoning. First aid for this is to change 50% of the water at once. You need to change 20% of the water on day 2 and day 3, and from day 4 you need to change 10% water daily. Test the water for ammonia every day until the level is safe. Do not feed your fish until the ammonia level is safe, and after the ammonia level is safe start feeding once every 3 days and only a little food each time. Here is some important information you need to read: https://www.fishlore.com/NitrogenCycle.htm. Clean your gravel to get the bioload down but do not clean the filter unless it is clogged up or have reduced waterflow. Your filter will contain important bacteria that you need to take good care of to keep your tank in biological balance."
Are there sure signs I can see my cat might have arthritis?,"90% of cats have arthritis by age 12. Signs of arthritis are: How to help Veterinary consultation for anti-inflammatories - this will require blood work to check for signs of kidney or liver failure as these medications can be hard on those organs. Have large low-rise litterboxes on each floor of the house for ease. Brush fur daily and dry bath once a week - some cats are VERY sore so pain medications will be required prior to brushing. Check claws periodically and trim as needed to prevent them from overgrowing into the paw pads. Veterinary approved joint supplements. You will see a major difference in your cats well-being with appropriate pain control. What to expect during a senior health exam At the age of 8 our cats and dogs are considered to be heading into their senior years, with that means a few things: Study from IDEXX labs CKD is a common disease in cats. Previous studies have found that 1 in 3 cats are likely to develop kidney disease in
their lifetime.1 However; earlier studies used azotemia to make the diagnosis of kidney disease and likely missed
nonazotemic cats with CKD, particularly those with IRIS CKD Stage 1 or Stage 2 disease. In a recent study in cats, the
prevalence of CKD was even higher than previously believed, with 50% of cats of all ages and as high as 80.9% of cats
15 years of age and older diagnosed with CKD. Your veterinarian will discuss joint supplements such as glucosamine, chondroitin, omega-3's, green-lip mussel and devils claw to help ease the discomfort and damage to the join. A product we sell often is Flexadin. I would stay away from human supplements as there are no regulations ( i.e 500mg glucosamine only contains 20mg). This is true for Canada so I would check with the regulations in your country. Typically your veterinarian will assume at 16 your cat has some form of arthritis - they may ask you how they are getting along with day to day life. It is not standard for veterinarians to give pain medications for arthritis (they will suggest joint supplements first unless case is severe) so it is important for you to bring up that you feel your cat is painful if this is the case. Diet - There will also be a discussion on switching your cat to a senior formula, this food will be formulated to prevent or slow down common diseases in our cats such as heart disease, kidney disease and arthritis. Along with these discussions your vet will do a thorough exam of heart, chest, eyes, mouth, abdomen, paws, skin, uro-genital and address what's needed."
What's the best way to clean a contaminated aquarium?,"Step 1: Quarantine the fish. Any fish still alive need to be moved into a new tank set up only for them. It doesn't need to be fancy. Just clean water, and nothing you can't stand to risk exposure to. If you notice any fungus growing on the fish, you'll need to treat them with an antifungal treatment. [Note: Antifungal treatments are very bad for invertebrates so don't keep them in a tank that's being treated with it] Step 2: Boil the contents. To sanitize the contents of the aquarium, simply boil it. The gravel, decorations, anything that can fit in a pot of boiling water should be done. It's especially important for decor like driftwood, which is the perfect harbor for bacteria and fungus as it's so porous. A few minutes of being boiled should kill the fungus/bacteria attached. For plastic decorations that might melt in boiling water, just getting them to a simmer should be hot enough. I've heard suggestions of putting them through the rinse cycle in a dishwasher, but I personally don't think it's safe because of the possibility for soap residue. Soap is extremely toxic to fish, and should be avoided at all cost. Step 3: Clean anything too big to fit in a pot, including the aquarium. Really, if you want to clean an aquarium thoroughly, taking the silicon off, and cleaning the glass, then putting it back together is the most effective way (since silicon is a bit porous and can hold any cleaning solution if not rinsed thoroughly). Since no one want to really go through that process, there are two solutions. The first would be to scrub everything with a mixture of hot water and antifungal fish medicine. This might not be terribly effective as most antifungal medicines need time to work. Another solution which is more effective but also more risky, is to use a bit of bleach diluted in water. Scrub everything with the bleach water, then scrub and rinse with dechlorinator, then rinse it thoroughly with plain water. [Note: If you want to get the glass clear of calcium buildup while you're at it. Scrubbing with vinegar helps to clear the glass.] Step 4: Re-Cycle the tank. Since now you've basically started from scratch, you'll need to set the tank up like it's brand new. Set it up how you want it, and fill it with new water. I would even wait a few days longer than normal before moving the fish back to that tank, to see if the fungus grows back.  [Note: I'm basing this on the assumption that it is indeed a type of fungus growth in the aquarium. Although it's pretty common to see white growth in gravel after overfeeding, as the old food deteriorates and molds. That's generally kept in the gravel and not around the glass, so I suspect this is something more serious than decomposing leftovers.]"
"What is ""crating"" a dog?","""Crating"" a dog is putting a dog in a crate with the door closed for whatever reason. The major benefit of using a crate with a young puppy is to prevent the puppy from learning bad habits when it is not being closely supervised. A puppy that is confined to its crate will not be peeing on the floor or chewing up your shoes. It also teaches the pup to settle down when you are just hanging out at home. Of course, the pup should spend plenty of time out of the crate as well, but only when you are able to keep an eye on them. For a well-trained adult dog there is rarely any need to close the crate door. The major exceptions would be:"
Can I change my cat's food?,"You can, of course, change his food without ill effect and he may quite enjoy having variety. However, in my experience, most cats seem to prefer that you don't mess with their diet and routine, especially as they get older. If your cat is young, they may be more tolerant of the switch, but don't assume that their eating as a result of hunger is actually enjoyment of the variation."
My leopard gecko sometimes has trouble shedding. How can I help?,"Firstly, gecko shedding doesn't happen all at once. It happens over about 24 hours. So if there's still some skin present the next day, don't worry about it - that's normal. If a few days have gone by and you can still see some patches of old skin, it might be time to step in. If a patch of old skin is left on the toe (toes are often a problem area) and not shed, it can lead to lack of circulation as the gecko grows, which will mean the toe will eventually drop off. There are a few things you can try to help soften the skin. A luxurious bath. See this great description of bathing a bearded dragon to help it shed from Matt S. The same method can be followed for a leopard gecko. A decadent sauna. A similar principle. Line a small container with warm, wet paper towels, put the gecko in and put the lid on. (Geckos feel safe in small spaces, so if she's used to you handling her and you put her in gently it should be fine.) Let her sit in there for about 30 minutes then gently rub the dead skin and it should come off. If it doesn't, put her back in for another 30 minutes and try again. Here is a site describing the sauna method, with pictures and a video. A sensuous massage. This method is best combined with one of the two above. Use a moistened cotton bud to gently rub the dead skin. If it's around a toe, rub in and around all the toes until the skin loosens. If none of these work, don't force it. Maybe the skin isn't quite ready. Wait a few days and try again. If you keep having trouble, you may have to get help from a vet. If your gecko often has trouble shedding, this could be a sign of poor humidity in the terrarium. Make sure your moist hide is moist enough. If the gecko spends most of her time in the hot end of the terrarium and the moist hide is at the cool end - or the other way round - try moving it to make sure she actually uses the hide. You could also try misting the terrarium when your gecko's about to shed, to temporarily increase the humidity. (Don't do this at feeding time as excess humidity will kill most insects.) Geckos also need something to rub against to loosen the skin and help it come off. In the wild it would probably be a big rock. If your terrarium doesn't have anything like this (all your hides etc. are very smooth) consider getting something. Finally, some geckos just seem to have more difficulty shedding than others! If you've done all the above and it still happens every shedding time, don't worry about it, just help your gecko out when the time comes."
Why do dogs lick faces?,"Domesticated dogs inherited this trait primarily from wolves, and more specifically, wolf pups.  Wolf pups will lick the faces of their mother to try and induce her to vomit some of her last meal.  For a weaning pup this is far easier for them to digest and eat than meat and bones right from a carcass. Source Part of the selective breeding that went into creating the domesticated dog species thousands of years ago involved breeding of more timid wolves and wolves that exhibited more puppy like behavior. Most adult wolves would have an untenable and difficult relationship with humans so a more fitting companion to a human would be a wolf that is less aggressive and more willing to follow the human pack. Other wolf puppy behaviors that dogs carried is play.  Adult wolves rarely play while wolf pups play consistently as a means of learning."
Why is my dog so afraid of me?,"I think this might be a hard one to solve without seeing the behavior and interaction.  However there are a few things you might be able to do to try to narrow down the cause and help him work through it. Does the dog eventually warm up to you when you have been home a while? Here are some things to try: When you first come in do not acknowledge the dog. A big greeting may intimidate the dog. Instead go about you business like he doesn't exist and let him choose when to approach you. It is likely that he'll choose to do this at a time the house is settled. Take a shower and change clothes into something that has been in the house. Dogs first sense is smell, it could be a sent you carry home from your workplace that he is weary of. For example dogs can become conditioned to think of the smell of alcohol as associated with the vets office. When you are at home you should be the one to feed the dog his regular meals. It helps to establish a relationship and dependence on you as a caregiver."
Why are grain-free cat foods filled with vegetables instead of more meat?,"Why are vegetables put into commercial cat food? There's two reasons: cost and perceived health benefits. First, plant proteins are cheaper than animal proteins. When the food costs less to produce, the profit margin can be higher for the company. Second, people are accustomed to believing that vegetables are healthy (because for us, they are). Cats, on the other hand, cannot digest plants. Plants are not healthy for cats, they are filler. Since people buy the food, it's marketed to us and not to our cats directly. Does any cat food contain 100% meat Not quite. Cat food is required to contain a number of vitamins/minerals to make up for nutrients that are lost in the processing (cooking) of animal proteins. In addition, dry foods cannot contain a large percentage of meat because they do not hold together into kibbles. Kibble is a cereal (I believe it's often spray-dried) and so requires some amount of plant material to act as glue. The highest meat content I've ever seen in a dry food is 87% (Evo Cat and Kitten). Canned foods, on the other hand, can be almost entirely made of meat. I'm familiar with Evo's venison and duck varieties, which are 95% meat and are particularly good for cats with allergies since they have a very limited ingredient list (though my cat who has allergies doesn't like them and we have to put something else on top). There are several smaller companies that make 90%+ meat canned foods (I suspect the manufacturing is easier than high meat dry foods), I'm just not very familiar with them. There are also smaller companies that make frozen 90%+ meat frozen foods. I'm able to find them in my local organic market's freezer section."
What does it mean when the skin on my cats' backs twitches?,"It is perfectly normal for a cat's back to twitch from time to time. Cats have a sheet of muscle under the skin of their trunk called the cutaneus trunci muscle (CTM). There are  involuntary responses to being touched on the skin, which result in twitching. This involuntary twitching  may assist in flicking away insects that may land on the cats fur.  This reflex can be stimulated by emotion in cats, fear and/or excitement. It is possible your cats are excited to see you, anticipating food, fun or affection (I would doubt they are fearful of you!).  Cats tend to do this when patted in certain places, and for some, it can lead to agitation if they are being patted in a repeated fashion, like tapping, as opposed to stroking (this I learnt in a neuroscience lecture for humans, where tests were done on cats!). In terms of this being a communication tool between cats, I have not found any studies about this (there may be), but as with many features of animal body language, many of these twitches can be tells or signals to other animals that an animal is frightened, agitated or excited. A decreased or absent reflex may show: ...
   excitement and fear.
  An exaggerated reflex .... may simply be due to excitement
  and fear. (1) The cutaneous trunci reflex is frequently absent in the cat. (2) References: Descending pathways to the cutaneous trunci muscle motoneuronal cell group in the cat.

Does a pond have to be covered with a net during fall?,I'm not an expert at fishes but your pond needs to be covered with nets during fall to prevent leaves and others (just like you said). You should be more concerned with hygiene (clean state) of the pond which will affect the health of the fishes rather than how beautiful or ugly it looks hence the need for a net during fall.  I mean what is the essence of a beautiful pond which is very dirty? Read more : Fall and Winter Care for Your Ponds
Dog urinating when greeting people,"You are doing the right things so far. Another thing to watch out for is eye contact.  My dog does the same thing and when she greets people I ask them to ignore her and avoid eye contact. Sometimes even eye contact will be enough to make her pee when she is really excited and wanting the visitor to pay attention to her. Once he is starting to calm down, but before he pees, see if you can get him to sit for you. That might take enough focus that it distracts him from whatever he is feeling when he puts his tail between his legs and urinates. Make sure you treat him every time he sits. Once he is sitting reliably then only treat him when he doesn't pee."
How to remove a tick on a dog?,"We have a lot of ticks in the South-West Finland and so I have been removing ticks from our dogs on regular basis every spring. We never seem to treat the dogs with tick repellent early enough. To remove ticks I have used normal tweezers, special ""tick-tweezers"", bare fingernails and a tick lasso. So far the absolutely best device for removing ticks has been a tick lasso. I'm not affiliated with the company named in the picture, but for the old saying; a picture talks a thousand words. A tick lasso:  Using this device is easy, safe, almost 100% success, and you don't even need protective gloves in hand. Push the button on the other end of the ""pen"" and a lasso of a thin nylon string will come out from the other end. Ease the lasso over the tick so that it goes around the tick near the dog's skin. Release the button, which tightens the lasso, and raise the pen straight outwards from the skin, then rotate the ""pen"" while simultaneously pulling gently out. Tick comes out whole, usually still alive even. Drop the tick in a toilet and flush. I have removed ticks from real tough places, like from the corner of a dog's eye, where you would not dare go with normal tweezers. I won't recommend anything but a lasso for removing ticks.

How would I socialise my puppy with other animals and people?,"Puppies should be socialized as early as possible.  A neat thing about puppies is that, when they are younger than roughly 5 months, most other dogs will tolerate a lot more of the behavior which characterizes puppies (overly excited and playful, sometimes rude). This is because dogs tend to sexually mature around 5-6 months. If you know of other dogs who are older, and who are well-adjusted and you trust them, I would let your dog just be herself around the older ones.  The older dogs will correct your puppy if it does something rude or out-of-line, and your pup will ""naturally"" learn what is and isn't acceptable behavior. If you don't have access to older dogs like that, a dog park isn't a bad place to start.  But beware that people tend to bring their dogs to dog parks without fully knowing how their dog will react.  Just a few weeks ago, a friend's 8-month-old pup was viciously attacked by a 2-year-old dog, and the owner's comment was ""we're trying to socialize him"". In order for your puppy to grow up to be adept at socialization - both with dogs and humans - it is crucial to expose her as a young pup to many different dogs and humans, in many different situations.  Doing so every day isn't out of the ordinary.  And as always (especially with puppies), set your dog up for success: don't put her in dangerous situations, or in unknown environments with too many strangers at once.  Simply start slow,  keep things interesting and fun, and be sure to work on socialization early and often."
How to react to a mouse biting?,"Luckily it's incredibly easy to 'train' mice not to bite at hands. Although it's not so much of training as it is getting them comfortable with hands. Small rodents like mice, gerbils, and hamsters, have it pretty rough at the pet store. Children will come into the store and immediately run to see the cute fluffy rodents, banging their hands against the glass. Not to mention all the awful tapping. This is incredibly stressful on them, and they learn that it's the hands that are the cause of all their stress. So the last thing they want is one of the hands anywhere near them. A light nip is their way of saying ""I don't really like this"". So how to fix it? It's going to be tough on the kids, but the best way to dissociate hands with stressful feelings is to leave them alone for three to four days. The only things you're allowed to do during this time is give them new food and water, and clean their cage as necessary. Absolutely no trying to pick them up or pet them during this time. It's important that they're allowed to get used to their new home, the way it looks and smells, and to forget about their previous experiences with hands. It's easier to show them that hands are good things if you have a fresh start. After this adjustment period, don't just jump in to grab the mice. The goal is to get them to want to spend time with you. Start by hand-feeding them. Offer them bits of food out of your hand, and little treats every so often (the little pink yogurt treats are a popular favorite I've found, just break them up as they're a bit big for mice). Just hold the food out to them and wait for them to take it from you. It shouldn't take too long before they start to realize that your hand means food. Once they're comfortable eating out of your hand, you can start petting them as they're eating in your hand to get them used to that feeling. After that you should have no problem picking them up and holding them without having to worry about them nipping at you."
Can cats get depressed?,"I don't know whether it's the same as human-style grief and depression, but cats can certainly show signs of depression and grieving.  In my experience, cats who lose a close companion cat can show signs of grieving such as: Whether the behavior changes indicate the cat is depressed or not could be argued endlessly, since we can't tell how much is anthropomorphism and how much is the cat's natural response to the loss of a close companion. In my view, it's close enough to count. "
What does a horse need in terms of land?,"People's opinions on this will likely vary widely. Personally, I favour a set-up that allows enough pasture for horses to graze without need for supplementation in fair weather. I also feel strongly that it is better for the horse if they can be outside as much as possible. I know that many horses spend much of their lives in stables, but I have seen many negative consequences from this approach (both physical and psychological) and prefer to reserve stabling for harsh weather or other exceptional circumstances. That being said, I would say the more space you can provide, the better. (It is nice to be able to have two or more paddocks available so that you can ""rotate"" in the spring when the grass is just starting to grow, etc.) But I would give ~1 acre per horse as a rough lower limit. Unless you are planning on keeping miniature horses or possibly small ponies or similar. In that case you might be able to get away with half an acre per horse, but I wouldn't really feel comfortable keeping any type of equine on less land than that."
What signs should I look for in my children to know they are ready for a pet [closed],"First and foremost, I would suggest making sure that your children can, and will, perform regular chores every day without fail. If you don't already have a pet, then you can establish some other daily chore as a surrogate.  If they're not already doing such a chore, you can assign a new one, and explain that you're doing so to see how they would handle the responsibility of a pet. Make sure they do the chore every single day.  I'd suggest waiting at least a month, to make sure they don't lose interest over time, and you should probably avoid establishing a clear timeframe with them (its much easier to keep up that chore in the third week knowing you only have 7 more days until you get that pet you wanted!). You can also expose them to other aspects of taking car of pets by finding friends who have a pet of the type you are considering, and arranging for your children to help out with some of the less fun tasks.  Walking someone else's dog (supervised), and then being responsible for picking up their droppings is a big test of a child's commitment, as would scooping litter for a cat, or cleaning out a rabbit's cage, or cleaning a fish tank. However, since it sounds like you already have a dog, then the best demonstration is that they simply take on the responsibility of feeding and walking your dog.  Its fine if you supervise, particularly if they aren't physically big enough to safely walk your dog, but you should put them in charge of picking up the droppings and disposing of them safely.  If they can't shoulder a portion of the burden of caring for a pet already in the household, they won't be ready for their own pet."
Snake not interested in food,"First off, since I don't know what she looks like now vs before, it's going to be up to you to decide if the loss of weight is severe enough to take her to the vet. It also doesn't hurt to make sure that nothing else is going on. There are two reasons other than brumation that I can think of that would explain why she doesn't feel like eating. Now, on to ways you can encourage your snake to eat: You're already doing this part, so good for you, but bringing the temperature of the mouse to a normal body temperature is a good way to encourage a snake to eat. It's more important with vipers and pythons, as their heat pits will sense if the mouse is too cold to be of interest, but heating it up helps it smell stronger.Snakes also tend to let go of rodents that feel cold when they bite them. Another way to make the mouse smell stronger or more enticing, is to either cut it's stomach a bit to expose the insides, or it's skull to expose the brain. It's not for someone with a weak stomach, but sticking a toothpick in and getting a bit of brain matter onto the mouse's face/nose is very effective (referred to as braining a mouse). I think you can get some scents that are supposed to be the same idea, but I can't say that they're as effective. You might want to try feeding her something different, to see if she's being picky for some reason. I don't know the size of your snake right now, but feeding her a hopper mouse would give her some nutrients, though they wouldn't last long with a larger snake. Gerbils are also something to try, or if you can find some, baby rats. If you find that she like the smell of a different kind of rodent, but you want to feed her mice still. Like if she likes gerbils, but they're small enough that you'd have to feed her too often to make them a feasible food source. You could keep a pet gerbil, then run your feeder mice through the cage to make them smell like the gerbil. I'm listing this last because I personally don't like it. But dipping a mouse in a can of chicken soup and offering it to snakes is another pretty effective method of getting snakes to eat. The reason I don't like it is because the soup has so many additives and preservatives that it's hard to say how good it is for a snake's health. I don't think it would hurt to do it once in an emergency, but I wouldn't rely on it as an option myself. Another thing I'd like to mention is that switching sources for your feeders can actually make a difference. As mice from different breeders will have different scents. It could be as simple as finding someone else to buy some, or maybe the person you're buying from switched sources and you didn't know it. And finally, one last thing to consider, is keeping a growth chart. By weighing her every few weeks, you can keep track of what kind of weight loss is normal when she stops eating (while she sheds/brumates). You can add how long it takes her to shed/brumate too. Just as an extra way of gauging what is normal for her."
How many shells should be made available for a growing hermit crab?,"I don't have much to say about terrestrial hermit crabs specifically, but the marines ones I have experience with can definitely be picky. Somebody else offered a great answer to another hermit question a few weeks ago, so hopefully they'll see this one as well. I've personally seen hermits go through on average 2-3 good choices before they pick a new shell, and when you have more than one hermit, they sort out who gets what for themselves. Shell possession is a really big factor in their social interactions: I've seen hermits pull others from their shell, take it over, and then not let the naked hermit into the old one. (Again, that's my local marine species -- land species might not be so aggressive, I don't know.) And there's been interesting research lately into vacancy chains that form when a big hermit finds a new shell, the next hermit shifts into the old one, and so on down the line. Different species of hermit crab prefer shells from different types of snail, and that preference can change as the animal grows, but my feeling is that the shells you see at most decent pet stores are probably an acceptable shape for the hermits they're selling. A safe bet would be to just get a shell that looks like a bigger version of the one your hermit came in. Besides the snail species, the two most important factors I've noticed are: A. is the shell the right size, and B. is it in good condition.  For size, the crab needs to be able to actually carry the shell around (obviously), and generally it needs to be able to withdraw its entire body into it, with the claws acting as the ""plug"". Having a shell that fits well is very important to their overall health, so keep an eye out for hermits that are starting to look a bit cramped. For quality, avoid any shells with holes, or with pitted or crusty interiors. The marine ones that I know don't seem to care much about coralline algae, hydroids, or other growth on the outside, as long as it doesn't weaken the shell itself."
How can I help hermit crabs survive their first molt?,"Diet: Make sure your crabs are getting a good diet pre-molt. A varied diet including lots of high-energy and high-calcium foods. Natural peanut butter, honey, cuttlefish bone, and sesame seeds are all good choices. Fresh or dried fruit and vegetables or even unseasoned meat trimmings can be added to this to help round things out. Humidity: 80% RH is recommended for most species of hermit crabs. This is especially important during molting. Certain species, such as the strawberry hermit crab from Australia, require even higher humidity. 90% RH is usually sufficient for them. Substrate: It's important that hermit crabs be provided with a substrate that they can burrow into. Again, this is especially important during molting as surface molts almost always prove to be fatal. The substrate should be light and loose enough for the crabs to dig in, but should also be able to hold its shape so that the crabs' tunnels don't collapse in on them.
A smooth, round-grained sand, such as play sand can work well. Add enough water to make it ""sand castle"" consistency.
EcoEarth (shredded coconut husk) is also an excellent choice. I find that it holds moisture better than play sand, has a nice texture, and helps keep the humidity in the terrarium up. Temperature: 80 °F (27 °C) is generally a good temperature to shoot for. Strawberries tend to like it a bit warmer (85-90 °F / 29-32 °C). You can achieve this with a UTH (under tank heater) and/or a heat lamp. Try to create a gradient within the terrarium to help the crabs thermo-regulate. Other than that, try not to disturb your crabs when they're molting. Don't stress them out. And just leave them be until they re-surface on their own. Sometimes older, larger crabs might disappear for quite a while, several months at a time. With any luck, they should re-appear just fine! ETA: Water: It is important to provide water for hermit crabs. The dish should be deep enough for the crabs to submerge themselves in, but shallow enough that they can easily climb out. Tap water is fine to use as long as it is dechlorinated first. Use a crab or reptile formula to dechlorinate as most fish/aquarium dechlorinators contain slime coat and other additives that could be harmful to your crabs. Ideally, salt water should be provided as well. This should be made by mixing dechlorinated water with a marine salt formula (eg. Instant Ocean). Both fresh and salt water can be prepared in bulk and dispensed as necessary. Providing a dish of each allows your crabs to regulate the osmotic balance of their shell water. However, some people prefer to give their crabs weekly salt water baths rather than keeping two water dishes in the terrarium with them. Both approaches seem to work."
How would I get my dog down from our 3rd floor bedroom if there was a fire?,"There are a number of harnesses and even an escape bag, commercially available and designed for lowering a pet (or a child) to the ground. Your budget, the dog's temperament and your physical ability will affect your purchase decision. Several things to consider. The anxiety of your family and your pets is likely to be elevated during a fire emergency. The more you practice, the less stressful it will be. Practicing with the fire alarm ringing as well as in peace and quiet will both be helpful. Using a pulley system to lower a larger pet will be a good choice.  You probably do not want to expose the pet to actually being lowered from the window until an actual emergency, as it may cause undue anxiety (use your judgement). But you will want to practice lowering a weight equal to your pet.   If possible two rescuers should be used: one on the ground to lower the pet (pulley system) and one upstairs and going down the people escape to guide the pet. If your practice time is more than a minute, from bed to everyone on the ground, consider that smoke inhalation is a big risk. Have a plan so everyone does not die trying to save one.  A pet who is scared is going to be more likely to accidentally harm their rescuer with claws or teeth, so devices that enclose the pet may be more appropriate than a simple harness.  If there are lower floor windows below your escape window, anticipate there may be flames coming out of them.  Fire alarms that communicate with each other provide an earlier warning, decreasing risks occurring during escape.  If the escape path must cross a lower flow window, consider shutters capable of providing a fire block and/or fire appropriate clothing (like firefighters wear). For small pets, like cats, rabbits and small dogs: use a pillow case as an emergency pet carrier. Take the pillow out of the case and gently slide the pet into the pillow case. Large pillow cases, you can tie a knot in the open end. For small pillow cases, tie the top with rope or clothes line.   This can also be used to lower pets from heights (with the rope) or transporting to the vet.  Most cloth pillow cases allow sufficient air circulation for the pet to breathe. Don't use plastic bags or heavy waterproof bags without air circulation.   I have used (long ago) a pillow case for rescuing cats from trees as well as for short transports to the vet. "
How do I make sure my fish tank is safe after my apartment has been fumigated?,"This is a tough one, because you haven't been given a lot of time. Most likely, the bug bombs will be using some combination of pyrethrins or pyrhethroids, which are some of the most common insecticides around. Unfortunately, these are also toxic to fish, so you're right to take action to protect them. Ideally, your landlord would have given you a bit more warning about this. If nothing else, you have a right to know what's being sprayed around your apartment, in case you have any allergies, asthma, or other conditions that might be sensitive to the insecticides. Also, if this fogger is their only plan of attack against cockroaches, don't expect it to solve the problem for very long. But this is a digression. The plus side is that these do break down in the environment after a day or two, primarily I believe from exposure to ultraviolet light. So if I were in your shoes, I think I would do something like this: In the meantime, remember your fish are in a very crowded holding tank. Feed them very lightly every other day, and if you weren't able to move the biofilter with them, pay very close attention to the water quality. At this point, anything else that might ever go in the tank should be either under the tarp, or ideally, out of the apartment with your fish. Once it's safe for you to return to your apartment: At this point, I think you're ready to move the fish and biofilter back in. I hate to say it, but if you have one or two fish you're not quite as emotionally attached to, I'd move that one back in first and see how it does. If it still looks healthy after a day, move the the rest in. I've never gone through this process before, so these steps are just what sounds good to me. It might be overkill, it might not be nearly enough -- I really don't know from experience. It sounds like a lot of hassle and risk, but I think it's doable. Good luck!"
Is chocolate harmful for dogs?,"The short answer is ""yes, it could kill your dog"".  According to WebMD (one of many, many references), the problem is that theobromine, a compound in cocoa beans that's similar to caffeine, is something dogs don't metabolize terribly well, so it affects them much more for their body weight than it would a human.  That means that the darker the chocolate, the more dangerous it is. It also means that a smaller dog (or a puppy) would be much more severely affected than a big adult dog - which is just as well, considering the box of chocolates my parents Old English Sheepdog ate once! (That was the last time Christmas gifts of food items went under the tree) "
Should I feed my cat milk?,"No, you should not if you're seeing signs of runny stools! Just like humans, cats can be lactose intolerant.  While some cats seem to handle milk fairly well, many get diarrhea from it.  Some cats may also get an upset stomach, or it may even trigger vomiting. From the WebMD article: Most of us have probably given our cats a bit of milk and never noticed a problem. That’s because some cats tolerate milk just fine, Wynn tells WebMD. How can you tell? Try offering your cat a tablespoon or two of milk. If you don’t see symptoms within a day, chances are good your cat will do fine with milk as an occasional treat. Still, most veterinarians don't recommend it. Cats don’t need milk, and the potential problems outweigh the potential benefits. Remember that treats of all sorts -- such as tuna, meat, cheese, or other “people foods” -- should make up no more than 5% to 10% of your cat’s diet. The rest of your cat's calories should come from a high-quality, nutritionally complete cat food. Note that some cats apparently do not have a problem digesting milk, even as an adult.  There is speculation that this may be an evolutionary response to the domestic relationship between cats and humans, due to human cultivation of cows as a food source: However, early during the domestication of sheep, cattle, and goats, humans appreciated the milk of these animals as an extremely valuable food resource. Interestingly, as humans began using dairy products in their diet, nature selected for those individuals in whom production of lactase persisted into adulthood, which gave them an advantage over those who could not digest lactose but instead became ill from consuming milk. Lactase Persistence is a gene. Those individuals in whom the gene expressed itself were healthier and longer-lived due to the superior nutrition received from milk. They were more likely to have more children, and so the lactase persisting gene got passed on and spread. Lactase persistence is most prevalent in people of European descent, because very early in this period, cattle spread with humans from the “Fertile Crescent” into Europe with the Neolithic Expansion. The gene mutation, enabling Lactase production into adulthood, originally occurred in the region of today’s Austria and Hungry, and began spreading 7500 years ago from there throughout Europe – especially northern Europe. By nature, cats are attracted to foods rich in protein and fat from animal source. 9000 years ago, milk and simple dairy products would have caught their attention as much as these foods do today. Thousands of years ago, people most likely delighted in gaining an animal’s affection by offering it food in the same way as we do today. By which other way could domestication have occurred? Cats may have been exposed to milk and dairy product as food past their infancy for nearly as long as people have. The possibility exists, that some cats have developed Lactase Persistence in a similar way that people have. In fact, there are some strong hints made among those who study evolution, that domestic cats , especially from European descent, have. Such a suggestion was re-published, for example, by Jerry A. Coyne, Ph.D, Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago in an entry in his blog."
Cat sometimes becomes aggressive,"It does sound like your cat is upset about something, and trying to communicate it to you. Try to take note of what's happening immediately preceding these bouts.   Is his food dish full?  Is his litter clean?  Has he been meowing at you, or trying to get your attention?  Were you interacting with someone or something else prior? I've seen cats attack their owners (the attacks ranging from swatting with claws out, as you described, to full ambushes from behind, with claws latched onto the persons temples, and teeth buried in the top of their head!) over everything from getting affectionate with the person's significant other (making the cat jealous) to leaving the litter box too full. Until you can find the trigger, one possibility is trying to scruff the cat when he attacks.  This helps establish you as the dominant member of the family, while clearly communicating that the behavior is undesired."
Low Quality Dog Food - What are the risks?,"Yes, there are some studies. I've found this article which mentions two studies:  A study conducted in Stockholm, Sweden by Dr. Kollath showed that young animals fed a cooked, processed diet initially appeared to be healthy, but once they reached maturity, they began to rapidly age and develop degenerative disease symptoms. The control group that was raised on a raw, uncooked diet did not age as fast and showed no degenerative disease symptoms but remained healthy. Unfortunately they mentioned no source for this study. For the second study they linked this source: Another study out of Belgium used data gathered from more than 500 domestic dogs over a consecutive five year time period (1998-2002). The authors, Lippert and Sapy, were able to statistically show that dogs fed a homemade diet, consisting of high quality foods used from their owners’ meals versus dogs fed an industrial, commercial pet food diet had a life expectancy of 32 months longer – that’s almost 3 years! Nutritional imbalance Just reading this it seems that raw feeding is really the best. But I found a summary of studies about the risk of raw food diets: Hypervitaminosis A was reported in a cat fed a pork liver-based raw food. The cat returned to normal health when the diet was changed back to a commercial canned food. Feline pansteatitis was reported in 10 cats fed a homemade diet of cooked pig brain or raw and cooked oily fish. Nutritional osteodystrophy was reported in 2 litters of 6-week-old large breed puppies fed a bones and raw food (BARF) diet from about 3 weeks of age. Nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism has also been reported in a litter of German shepherd puppies fed a diet of 80% rice with 20% raw meat. The diet contained excessive amounts of phosphorus. Not all puppies fed the diet experienced problems, suggesting individual or genetic susceptibility. A nutritional analysis of 5 raw food diets (2 commercially produced and 3 home-made) found low calcium and phosphorus in 3 of the 5 diets. Two commercial diets were high in vitamin D. Two of the diets were deficient in potassium, magnesium, and zinc. These are just some individual cases so it is not possible to say that in general the raw food diets are bad. So the same article mentions: Supporters of raw food will argue that feeding a variety of foods will lessen the risk of nutritional imbalance. Infectious disease risk The same article mentions a study about the infectious disease risk: There are several studies that document the presence of infectious agents in raw foods and the potential for contaminating or shedding these agents in the pet’s environment. A recent study analyzed 240 samples from 20 commercially prepared raw meat dog diets (beef, lamb, chicken, or turkey), 24 samples from 2 commercial dry dog foods, and 24 samples from 2 commercial canned foods. The commercial foods were collected on 4 different dates, 2 months apart. Three samples were collected from each product at each sampling point and were evaluated by culture for Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter, and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Cryptosporidium, Neospora, and Toxoplasma. The PCR was performed only during the third and final sampling period. Almost 6% of the raw food diets were positive for Salmonella, while none of the conventional diets were positive. Escherichia coli were isolated from all types of diets. It 
  was found in almost 50% of the raw food diets but in only 8/24 (33%) dry and 2/24 (8%) canned diets. There were no significant association between the type of raw meat and the agents isolated. In conclusion you should know which incredients your dog needs to avoid nutrition imbalance and you should keep the food fresh and cool in a clean environment, if you want to feed your dog with homemade raw food diet.  I do not know what kind of food the dogs of the Belgium study were fed. In Germany dog food is handled by the German food law and the German Feedstuffs Act. That means that only ingredients humans are able to eat are allowed to used for dog food. The quality has to be the same as for humans. Indeed scrapings of slaughter are used, too, but from pigs, cows, birds, etc. which were slaughtered for human food. So the quality of the meat is very good. There is still the question if the meat has to be raw. To answer that it is worth reminding what is happening in the stomach of a dog. The gastric acid degenerates the proteins of the meat, so that the enzyms are able to degrade the proteins. The same degenerating process is happening by cooking meat. So for old dogs it can be comfortable to eat cooked meat, because it is easier to digest. Today there are many good dry or canned food diets for dogs. It is possible to adapt the food to the age and health condition of the dog. That is a big benefit as compared to homemade food. So a good quality canned food is as good as a raw diet food but less risky of infectious disease. At the end it is a question of believe if you prefer raw food diet or not. It may depend on the region where you live, if you can trust the dried and canned dog food. If you buy it, (if possible) take care of the quality and how much meat is in there. The main ingredient have to be meat. If you decide to feed raw meat homemade food, please inform yourself about the needs of a dog. They are different to humans. Take care of the quality of the food and that it is kept clean and fresh."
Dog jumps and bites when another dog is around,"One of the best ways to calm her down is repetitive training. Trust me -- I have a 7 month old, and I know it sounds a lot easier than it is. But training really is the best way for this. Unfortunately, this issue is extremely common and hard to break. Every dog is different. Below I'll list a few methods/tips, but it's up to the trainer to exhaust themselves with the methods and evolve them to work around their dog. The best way to train your dog behaviorally starts with her obedience. You don't say how well-trained she is this far, but I'd start with making sure she has a few basic commands down. As a general guide for future people having the same question, a few of the most important commands are: Once your pup understands these commands (this can take up to a few months! Don't expect it to happen overnight), your dog should be more controllable, especially around dogs that don't appreciate your dogs energy. I'll list a few tips below that should begin to help your puppy with high energy situations. Good luck."
Why are red bulbs bad for my bearded dragon?,"Note: This will be true for most, if not all, lizards, but not necessarily for snakes and possibly turtles, as their eyes are different. The idea behind the red bulbs was that reptiles couldn't see the red spectrum of light. With this in mind, the idea was you could have the red light on all night, keeping them warm, but not keeping them awake. It's pretty well accepted to be false now, as there wasn't any research to back the claim up, and research has shown that reptiles, while they see things differently than us, are capable of seeing color and lights (If you watch TV with your dragon, you might notice him watching it with you). So unless you give your lizard a really nice place to hide out of the light, it will keep them from sleeping well. Think of it like if you slept in a room with the light on each night. You might be able to sleep, but you might not sleep quite as well as you would with the light off. As far as red lights in the day: in my opinion they're just colored lights, and I'm not aware of any long-term effects from having them as day lights. But they won't give off any UV light, and they likely won't give off enough heat for a bearded dragon, so they're effectively useless to have. For a bearded dragon, you will want a good UV light that's meant for desert reptiles, and a good heat lamp that will keep the basking side at about 100 degrees fahrenheit. Personally, I use ReptiSun 10.0 UV lights ( the straight tube not the coils), and a ceramic bulb for the basking area. I've actually used normal 100 watt light bulbs for my basking lamp before and they worked fine. Although they burnt out too quickly for my taste (about once a month), which is why I switched to a ceramic lamp."
How large territory does a Maine Coon cat have?,"I'm not sure how breed affects the range of a cat, but food source (if the cat is provided food by owners, or if the cat has to hunt food) is known to affect how far a cat may travel. A study by in 2011 performed by the University of Illinois using radio collars determined: The mean home range for pet cats in the study was less than two hectares (4.9 acres). It's often thought (using studies that track cat movement though observations of people instead of radio collars) that gender and season affect the range of a cat, but they couldn't find a relationship in the radio collar study. A surprising result of that study is that Most of the cats in the study stayed within about 300 meters of human structures, said co-author Nohra Mateus-Pinilla, a wildlife veterinary epidemiologist at the Illinois Natural History Survey at Illinois. “Even feral cats were always within range of a building,” she said. “That shows that even though they’re feral, they still have a level of dependency on us.” So if you have no neighbours, this result may be more applicable to your situation than the previous ""average housecat""."
Why does my European pond turtle rest on the back of my red-eared slider?,"The thing is, they lived together for 8 years in a smaller tank, so that does mean that they can live together. Ideally, you would mix turtles of similar size, as that reduces some risk, but from your description I don't think there's much in the way of aggression going on here. What I do think is happening, and the larger tank is the key to having me think this, is that the smaller turtle is stacking on the larger one to get closer to the basking light(s), which is actually fairly normal. However, this irritates the larger turtle because your RES also wants (and needs) to bask. If it's happening all the time, this could be an issue for the RES since sufficient UV radiation is necessary for shell and bone health. If it really is infrequent, as you kind of indicate, then I don't think it's a risk.  However, you might want to help out the situation, perhaps ensuring a larger basking area and bringing the lamps closer in, if possible. If the tank is large enough, you might also want to consider a couple of basking areas."
What are the long-term effects of overfeeding tropical fish?,"Well, not exactly about ""pets"", but there is at least on study about overfeeding fish. This article from Aquaculture International, published by Springer, studied the effects of overfeeding Tench. Some conclusions related to the nutritional value the fish will have (like it´ll have more fat deposits and smaller minerals content). But some of the findings could be applied to pet fish, too: incidence of uneaten food (that will cause some unbalance in your aquarium, increasing ammonia content, etc) deformities of the caudal penduncle retarded growth and although no mortality was observed, it´s perhaps because the study was done in 70 days, but the high rate of deformities might lead to deaths in the future."
How can I tell whether my corn snake is over- or underweight?,"While it's sometimes normal to see your snake's skin between the scales immediately after feeding, that's because they swallow their food whole and it's pressing on their skin. If you're seeing the skin between the scales otherwise, then your snake is definitely overweight. I wouldn't use the spine as a reference for whether your snake is over/under weight, as all snakes, except for the obese ones, will still show their spine. A more accurate method is too look at the shape of the snake. Despite how they're portrayed, they aren't actually round. Another thing you might be able to notice are hips/rolls on you snake. All snakes will have creases when they're coiled up, but an overweight snake will have more fat in those creases and it can cause noticeable rolls, or even misshapen scales. The misshapen scales are generally the worst cases I think, they come from the pressure of the extra fat in the creases. (source) [Notice here too, the stomach doesn't lay flat] As far as feeding schedules go, you should always keep a strict feeding schedule for all pets. It's especially important for corn snakes since they're opportunistic feeders, they'll eat even when they shouldn't. Common feeding schedules for adult corn snakes are more like once every 12-14 days. That might seem like a pretty open schedule, but that all depends on what you're feeding him. Larger or fattier food needs to be fed less often. I would say start by feeding him only once every 12 days, and give him some exercise. You can give him some exercise by having him climb up and down a set of stair if you have some, or if he doesn't hate baths, you could encourage him to swim every so often in the bathtub. One trick I really like, is giving them a box full of cardboard tubes, from paper towels and stuff. Just the new environment will encourage them to explore, and you'll have fun watching him explore the maze of tubes. It will take quite a while to see some improvement. Just like with humans, snakes won't lose weight within a week. I know some cases where it's taken a whole year for people to get their snakes back to a healthy weight. Stick to a longer feeding schedule, and encourage your snake to exercise as much as possible, and he'll be fine."
Giving a dog in a high rise enough potty breaks,"It has only been the last few years that we have lived in an apartment and been faced with dilemma, with the advent of increased housing density in many cities globally this is a very good question. Firstly a healthy house trained adult dog has different requirements to a puppy, sick or elderly dog. Healthy house trained adult dog. As a bare minimum dogs need to be taken out at least three times a day. Morning when they first wake, as most people know, this is a time the bladder has been accumulating bodily fluids and there is usually the most pressing need to go. During the day, after lunchtime and before bedtime. People (including myself) have successfully homed dogs with this type of routine. When a dog is taken for such a toilet break, the break needs to include a min-walk at least on each occasion, this allows the dog opportunity to relax and relieve themselves several times before returning inside. Exceptions to this will be, if the dog indicates it needs to go out, or the dog is unwell, or there has been a change in the feeding routine. Puppies. The number of times a puppy needs to be taken out is very age dependent (for this purpose I am assuming that the puppy is actively being house trained). To begin with, young puppies 8-12 weeks age, need to be taken out every time they wake from a nap, after they eat and whenever they sniff around in a manner that indicates they need to relieve themselves. This can be reduced as they gain bladder control. The biggest thing with puppies is going to the toilet when they wake up from sleep, it seems to be a time when the first thing they want to do is urinate. This is also a key time to help successfully house train a puppy. Sick dogs. Depending on the ailment, whether a dog is recovering from surgery or ill in some way, this will usually increase their need to relieve themselves. It is best to go by advice from a Vet and cues from the dog, when they need to relieve themselves. Like puppies, unwell dogs will often need to urinate when they wake from a sleep. Elderly dogs. As bladder control is reduced and a dog is unable to hold for either urination or defecation, it is better to take an older dog to the toilet more frequently. To begin with a dog will show signs, by going to the door asking to go out, that they are not coping with a previously successful toileting regime.  So, a dog that previously was happily let out three times a day for the toilet, may start needing two toilet breaks during the day, or an early evening, then late night break. It is something that develops gradually and cannot be definitely said, [this many] breaks is the magic number. The key is to know your dog and read his/her cues."
Can older tarantulas become reaccustomed to being handled?,"It's possible, it'll just take a bit of patience. Tarantulas can't really be tamed like other animals, they're just too primitive. But, you can get them used to your presence, and used to being picked up, which is close enough I think. The first thing you need to know is how to pick up a tarantula. Since the goal is for the tarantula to be comfortable with you picking it up, it's best to know how to pick it up in ways that won't cause it to be defensive. It's up to you which method you're comfortable with, and which one works best. If your tarantula is really stressed out by you trying to pick it up right away, you might want to try getting it used to your hand first. Just have your hand present in the terrarium for a few minutes each day, so that it doesn't consider you threatening. then try touching it without it getting defensive. Finally, try picking it up again."
Do freshwater snails in aquariums pose any harm to the fish in my aquarium?,"According to thinkfish.co.uk, snails are a potential disease vector.  However, this is usually only an issue if the snails come from the wild, or from a tank that already has a disease infecting the residents. So long as you are reasonably certain of the provenance of your snails, you should be safe.  Keep in mind, though, that snail eggs can be easy to miss, so if you replace some of your expensive plants with free ones that you found in a pond or stream somewhere, you run the risk of introducing wild snails."
My dog runs after children who have taunted him,"This is a normal reaction from a dog. My sister's dog behaves similarly when he sees the children who shout at our gate and want to play with him, but when they see our dog they run in random directions and excite our dog. It never harmed any children, but there is a risk of the children getting injured. Some neighbors even started talking about it, and blamed us for this noisy behavior. The solution we concluded is that we stopped reacting to the children's shouts and bell ringing and stopped our dog from meeting them. We changed the time of our dog's evening walk to make sure he didn't see those children. After a few weeks, the children stopped coming to our house and this trouble ended."
What are the safe materials for an aquatic turtle aquarium?,"After spending some hours researching, I couldn't find any list of turtle safe materials.  The only material I could think about was wood: if it´s too soft, perhaps you turtle could begin to bite it and remove small chips, and could cause some problems. If the wood is chemically treated, the problems with chemicals could be more intense. And if it´s not treated, the humidity could cause fungus, and it would be even worst. For other materials: I think that everything that is safe for human use would be safe for turtles too, just remember that they will be wet (and so some materials could decompose, melt, get weird, I don´t know)."
How should I feed sturgeons during winter?,"According to What Sturgeons Want, sturgeons need to be fed during winter or they will starve. Unfortunately, the amount they eat is trial-and-error: throw some pellets, wait until they eat, and track how long it took.  If they quickly, throw more pellets, etc. Remember they are carnivores, so choose appropriate food; don't hope that they will eat plants during winter. :)"
Is there any effective solution to stop a bird from habitual plucking?,"As you  state the change in carer, her nervousness and resulting lack of attention could all have combined to bringing it on. These birds seem to be attuned to human emotion and it is important to stay calm with them, in spite of this behaviour, as a negative reaction before the bird, may exacerbate the problem. However, it's always sensible to get your bird checked by a professional, to exclude health issues that may be causing the behaviour change. After excluding health problems, there is a few things that can be done, all the advice stems around health, diet and environment:   Cage – is their cage large enough? Is it clean? Hygienic animals by
  nature, a dirty, unkempt cage is detrimental to a Grey's mental as
  well as physical health.   Baths / Showers – your Grey should be getting
  regular baths or showers to keep them clean and healthy. Also expose
  them to moist air – put them in the bathroom to enjoy the steam while
  you're taking a shower. No one likes to be itchy and dirty, least of
  all an African Grey.    Fragrances - Room fresheners, candles, perfumes,
  hair sprays etc, can irritate an African Grey’s skin Give your African Grey self-confidence – encourage it to explore and be curious. Expose it to change – take it into different rooms in the house, show it different colors and toys, socialize with other people; so it learns change is okay and these things shouldn't make it afraid. A happy bird is a healthy bird  (1) African Grey Feather Plucking / Feather Picking african-grey-parrot.com (1) The following article also confirms this type of solution and adds some more tips about diet and feeding. Contrary to the title, they are acknowledging that African Grey Parrots can pluck, but don't like them being referred to as ""pluckers"".   They suggest checking for seed and peanut allergies and reactions. Some seeds can also carry toxins, depending where they are sourced from. These things can lead to feather plucking.

How often should a hermit crab tank be cleaned?,"Ideally you should spot clean daily (removing uneaten bits of food, etc.).
Deep cleans (taking everything out, rinsing it off, replacing substrate, etc.) should be done about twice a year. That being said, sometimes your crabs have different ideas. If one or more of them is down for a molt when you want to clean, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Just wait until they're all on the surface again, put them in an iso tank, and do your cleaning then. I've had to go a year+ between deep cleans before due to molting schedules and uncooperative crabs!"

How to prepare a pond for crayfish?,"I'm no expert at crayfish (or ponds), but I know a little The pond shouldn't be close to trees, bush or bush piles. Provisions should be made to enable the pond to drain automatically. The pond water should be dechlorinated, with a pH of 7.2-8.2. Make sure to check and test pond water frequently to ensure ammonia and nitrite levels are not too high or low. Sudden death of crayfish are often due to an ammonia or nitrite excess. Their water should contain a good amount of calcium. Also check : How to Make a Crawfish Pond"
How do I determine when my tortoise is sated?,"Tortoises can overeat and being chronically overfed (whether they are  overweight or not) can cause long term health problems. Determining when your tortoise is sated is more of an issue of looking at your tortoise's growth and overall well being than on how much he is eating in one sitting. Many tortoises will eat and overeat on prepared commercial foods for  dogs and cats (yes people feed their tortoises commercial dog and cat food) and the high protein content of this food can cause an enormous health problem. I have found no articles supporting the use of commercially prepared tortoise pet food, the experts all seem to agree that this does not meet the needs of any type of tortoise. How much should I feed my tortoise? General rule for feeding Mediterranean tortoises In captivity, a high fiber, low fruit content, low protein and calcium rich diet will ensure good digestive tract function and smooth shell growth. A tortoise's dietary needs will vary depending on whether it is kept indoors, outdoors, it's activity level, and whether it is a herbivore or omnivore. However, determining what your individual tortoise's needs are is not clear cut and cannot be answered with a generalised answer. Tortoises have such a range in growth rates and hence feeding needs it's impossible to give a quantifying amount of what to feed tortoises generally, in terms of overall quantity. One good tip is to give the tortoise an off day, this has also shown to improve growth smoothness. This article, Mediterranean Tortoises: How much to feed? By A C Highfield, The Tortoise Trust gives a good overview of the varying nature of tortoise needs and growth. Determining whether your tortoise is eating enough is more a scientific endeavour, rather than an intuitive one. This FAQ with The Tortoise Trust: Therefore study the natural habits of your animal and keep accounts of how much, when and what you offer. Keep regular weight measurements and make adjustments if you notice weight lost or gains. After awhile you'll learn the specific requirements to keep your individual animal well fed and healthy. Problem associated with overfeeding: Finding the right balance of vitamin D, calcium and protein is essential for any tortoise's health, this is done through diet, and environment, so the tortoise's diet cannot be examined in isolation from the environment."
How can I help my cat with chronic congestion and sneezing?,"The symptoms that you describe seem to describe feline herpes (also known as FHV-1).  The ASPCA lists symptoms of a feline herpes infection as  While most cats can suppress the infection once their immune system learns it, a few cats are never able to fully rid themselves of the symptoms of feline herpes. One of my four has daily sneezing and nasal discharge from it. Otherwise he's fine and lives a normal life, we just sometimes wipe his nose (and our walls). Even though I'm not a vet, feline herpes is extremely common in rescued cats, so it's a reasonable suspicion. Your vet probably sees this problem daily and didn't take the time to explain it. I don't have a particularly good feeling about a veterinarian that doesn't realize as common as it is to THEM, it's new to YOU. I also check with my vet regularly (once a year or so) to see if there are any new treatments for feline herpes, so that's another thing you can do. There are a few treatments that are being researched, but there is not any evidence that they work yet.   Investigational Treatments Probiotics. There isn't any evidence either way that this works, but it doesn't hurt and can be helpful if there are also gastrointestinal issues. L-Lysine. Again, the evidence at this point is conflicting but it is made into treats and palatable pastes so you can try it without any harm to your cat. Managing Symptoms Most of the current treatments focus on managing symptoms.  My vet recommends saline nasal drops (example, commonly marketed for children/babies). Any drops you use should NOT contain any medications without the advice of your veterinarian.  You can keep your cat in a steamy area (like the bathroom while you take a shower, or a large carrier near a humidifier) to help break up the mucous. If your cat develops a secondary infection, antibiotics can be helpful (talk to your vet). Keeping your cat hydrated is important (the mucous will be thinner and easier to deal with). Consider switching to wet food if you feed dry. Additionally, make sure that you monitor your cat's food intake. If your cat cannot smell her food, she may not want to eat it. You can heat wet food for a few seconds in the microwave or add smelly tuna juice to it to increase palatability. If she doesn't eat for a few days she can become seriously ill. Sidenote: Corneal Ulceration One of the most damaging affects from feline herpes is the development of eye ulcers. Cornell University gives the symptoms of a eye ulcer: The clinical signs of corneal ulceration include inflammation of the tissue surrounding the cornea; seepage of discharge from the eye; clouding of the cornea; and apparent hypersensitivity to bright light. An affected cat may squint, rub its eyes, and behave as if it is having vision problems. If you notice these signs in the future, you should take your cat back to the vet to be evaluated for an ulcer. While most ulcers will heal on their own, they can cause severe discomfort and in rare cases can permanently affect the cat's vision."
Do cats have a preference of being in the light or being in the dark?,"Cats are crepuscular, which means they prefer to be awake at dawn and dusk.  As such they've evolved to prefer neither complete darkness or bright light. That said, human sight is also suppose to be best at dawn and dusk as well.  However, cats proportionally have more rods than cones in their eyes than we do.  (Rods are what give us are ability to see in very low light and their placement in our eyes is why we can see better out of our peripheral vision in very low light.)  Thus cats likely prefer a lower light levels than we do, and are able to see better in darker environments."
How do I determine the age of my turtle?,"From the information I could find, there is no definitive way of determining the age of an adult yellow-bellied slider, unless you've owned it from a baby. Counting rings on the shell is not significant in determining years of age. For young females the yellow mark behind the eye is more striking, as is the underside of the belly. These feature tend to fade with age.  The males tend to grow darker.  So without asking the previous owners if they know how old she was when they took her, it's hard to guess. It is understandable that you would want to know. They can live for many years, but it would be good to know where on her lifeline she is. They are brown or olive green, usually with a prominent patch of yellow on the side of the head. The lower jaw is rounded. The shells of yellow-bellied slider turtles average in size from 5 to 8 inches; the record is about one foot. The yellow blotch behind the eye is the most conspicuous marking and is most prominent in juveniles and females. The yellow underside of the turtle's shell sometimes is marked with round dusky smudges; these markings may be reduced in older turtles. Also, adult males may become very dark. Yellow-Bellied Slider Turtle Fact Sheet Factsheet  produced by the Outreach Program of the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, The University of Georgia  Yellow-bellied sliders are omnivorous, however, juveniles tend to be more carnivorous than adults.

Cats fight over who sleeps further up on the bed,"This is pretty typical in my experience. I have 2 cats and the older one is very jealous (I call him ""Jealous Jack""). If the younger cat (Henry) is laying next to me, Jack will actually try to squeeze between us or annoy(biting, licking) Henry until Henry moves. I don't allow Jack to be a bully and usually just wrangle him into my opposite side and give him lots of pets. So, the short answer, yes this is totally normal behavior. Science says that your head area is warmer than your feet which is why they want to move up further on the bed. My advice to stop their fighting is to hold them separately on the bed and give them lots of pets and that should encourage both to be on the bed at the same time in their own spaces and not fight."
My turtle cracked his plastron,"Is there blood? Do you see any notable difference in the way he walks? or the way he is acting?  The picture is blurry but the break doesn't look as bad as it could have been. In simplified terms, a turtle's shell serves the same purpose as a bug's exoskeleton. If the break is complete the vet may wire it shut or they may even use super glue. This is still what most would consider an emergency, so if you have the cash then please take him in sooner rather than later. Monitor his behavior overnight. Note any changes and take him into the vet right when they open tomorrow. If you notice any oddities in his behavior, then please take him into a 24 hour vet. Otherwise, I think he will be okay until the morning. "
Cat won't use cat flap,"We had a cat that wasn't too bright and didn't get the idea of the catflap. We eventually grabbed him and pushed him back and forth through the catflap a few times, then it seemed to get through to him."
Can two cats live in one room?,"You have a cat, you both are going to be working more and you have an allergic roommate? I'm sorry, but are you sure it's a good idea to get a second cat? I understand it looks like choosing between two evils here, but I'd ask you to reconsider. I'd definitely wait till the move is complete. Moving is already stressful for a cat, I doubt it will be easier with two. A new cat takes some extra time and effort too, which you may not have available with both of you going to work more. Besides, what happens when the move doesn't go through for whatever reason? A lot can happen in 6 months. I wouldn't take the risk. Find a different approach to keeping your cat happy, there are plenty of cats that don't have an animal friend yet are not unhappy. If the cats have significantly more room at your new place, them getting used to each other will actually be easier after the move than before. After all, they have more territory so won't be forced to be close to each other all the time if they can't stand each other initially."
How to keep the neighbour's cat out of my home with a cat door?,"As your cat Pablo has a chip, he always carries a unique method of identification. I would suggest you swap your current cat flap for one that reads microchips and opens up just for your cat. Yes, they are not exactly cheap, especially if you have a perfectly fine regular flap, but it should pay for itself over time in cat food, cleaning bills and a happier Pablo."
Cat oscillating claws at me whilst being stroked,"Some cats have weird habits. I don't think you can discourage this, because you would be sending mixed signals (I'm petting you, which feels good, at the same time as scolding you). One of my cats only likes to be petted while standing (if he's sitting or laying down, he'll stand up when being petted), and then he'll stick one of his front paws out at 90 degree angle away from his body (just into the air). It's just a weird variation of kneading, and I suspect that your cat is doing something similar. If it hurts because his claws are digging into you, I would recommend trimming his claws or using nail caps (Softpaws are a popular brand)"
Why does my cat insistently meow at me when I shower?,"First, don't worry, this behavior is entirely normal thing that many cats do. I once visited a friend of mine and she warned me that her cat would visit me on the bathtub ledge between the two shower curtains during my shower. He did, but didn't talk to me, so I was super startled to see him there when I pulled back the curtain! There are actually a couple of reasons she could be exhibiting this behavior, or it could be a combination of multiple reasons. If your cat normally follows you around the house, this is just a normal part of her keeping tabs on you. As Dan S says, she wants to join you but doesn't want to get wet, so she's telling you to get out of there. Another possibility is that if you coo at her and give her attention (verbal, eye contact, etc), she's looking for that attention and knows if she yells at you long enough, you'll give it to her. Cats are also creatures of habit. If you get up in the morning and immediately jump in the shower and get dressed before heading downstairs to feed her (or whatever), then she's trying to rush you through your morning routine and get to the part where you feed her faster. If this behavior is bothering you, the best thing to do is close the door so she can't come in, or ignore her when she does talk to you in the shower. We broke one cat of the habit by switching to an opaque shower curtain so she couldn't see us anymore (and ignoring her cries), so that's another option."
How can I get my cat to let me study his wound?,"In my experience the easiest way is to be sneaky about it and peek at the wound while the cat is eiher relaxed or sleeping. The best way to achieve that is by petting. You may have to invest some time to really get them to relax and lay down. You also may have to try several times. If your cat lays down in a way you cannot see the wound and you try to move it around, the cat is probably going to be suspicious and walk away. A small hand mirror may come in handy to really look at the wound from all angles without making your cat suspicious. You may try shining a flashlight at it to see better, but again, that might make your cat suspicious of the object and walk away."
My fish are disappearing :(,"The most reasonable explanation is that it died and was eaten by the other fish / snails. Note that some snails are carnivorous. Many fish are cannibalistic if the opportunity arises. Some leftovers of the missing fish might be found inside the aquarium, if you look carefully. Or in the filter. Some fish have the idea to jump out of the water. With this occasion, they might even jump out of the aquarium entirely (that is why aquariums have lids). Look around, even behind furniture. You might find it. Quite probable, it will not ever move again by itself. Ask your family. Maybe they collected it dead from the water and disposed of it. Funny or not, I once found in the ""aquarium"" (actually bowl) the skeleton of a fish (possibly molly or something similar) - the way seen in cartoons (head, spine, bones, tail). It died, and the other inhabitants were happy with the diet change. Update: if the aquarium does not have a lid (or if you find the lid removed ""without explanation""), and at the same time you own a cat, then it is the time to have a serious chat with the cat :)"
What's wrong with this kitten's eyes and how do I take care of them?,"Dude, don't try to treat that cat yourself, no matter what the advice you get on here. Get it to a vet as soon as you can, or find someone else who can. It looks pretty bad (a lot worse than ""encrusted dirt and dust""). I realize you are trying to help the poor guy - and I applaud you for that - but please be careful to be sure you are doing more good than harm (and really, only a vet can tell you that). A little sustenance (water and a small amount of wet cat food) I'm sure is good, but beyond that, get him to a pro. Also, shivering/tremors can be caused by things other than being cold, so take caution overheat him if he feels warm. Also, don't listen to me - I'm not a vet! :)"
"My cat is gaining too much weight, how often should I be feeding her?","The answers provided so far are quite good already: overweight is dangerous for the cat's health and frequent, smaller meals are better than one/two big meals. So your solution is to reduce the quantity of each meal, possibly keeping two or three meals a day. What I would like to add is that it is normal for cats to be on the hunt all day long. The innate instinct of cats is to hunt their preys, which are usually rather small. The way we feed our cats usually goes against their predatory instinct and cats can become bored about food or feel uncomfortable not having a possibility to access food (reference). Additionally hunting or ""playing for food"" is an excellent mental stimulation that will benefit the cat mentally and physically. So I would recommend giving the cat access to some kind of food puzzle. A few well known options are (see links and pictures): As you are now feeding your cat ""the usual way"", you could proceed step by step: give your cat half of his meal in a bowl, when he's done put the other half in one of the toy and given him access to the toy. If he likes it, you can then just fill the toy twice a day. I assumed that you feed your cat dry food, the question ""Should my cat be allowed some wet food every day?"" has excellent answers about wet food. One good solution would be to give your cat wet food once a day, and free access to a toy with dry food during the day. If you control the quality of the food and its quantity this is not incompatible with preventing the cat to gain weight. You can also have a look at this paper: Environmental enrichment for indoor cats which is a detailed discussion (problems and possible solutions) in reference to the AAFP (American Association of Feline Practitioners) position statement on Environmental enrichment for indoor cats. Both cover cats' feeding issues.    "
Can I put any other fish in with a male betta?,"Most male bettas will fight with anything that even remotely resembles another male in finnage or coloration. Some will attack any fish indiscriminately, regardless of its appearance. It is inherently risky to house bettas with other fish. Some bettas are too aggressive to be kept with any species, and many community species will damage the finnage of a betta. This species does best when kept solitarily due to its special environmental and social needs.  However, community keeping is possible with careful monitoring and appropriate tank-mates if the betta's personality permits. Communal housing should always be approached on a case by case, individual basis! Placid males and females can often be housed in a well-planted community tank with mellow, dully-colored fish, as well as some aquatic invertebrates or amphibians. Careful monitoring is demanded, and the positives and negatives of the housing situation should be thoroughly evaluated prior to mixing species, but the community betta is not an impossibility. Alternately, or in conjunction with other fish, consider offering a mirror as a safe companion."
How should I respond when my cat wants to wrestle?,"I've found that when my cats want that kind of play, I get the best results by substituting a decent-sized stuffed toy (catnip is optional).  I don't mean one of the tiny mice designed for batting around, but, rather, a toy that's at least 3-4"" around, something that the cat can reasonably hold onto with both front paws and/or its mouth while rolling around on its back.  (I don't know where to buy toys of this sort commercially; mine are hand-made.  If you want to make your own, a rectangular stuffed toy is pretty easy.) I've tried offering a thing on a string, but when my cats want to wrestle they don't seem to want to chase an airborne object.  They want to grab something and hold on; the key is for that thing that they grab to not be a body part or anything else that is Not A Toy. Our dogs (when we had dogs) used to like ""tug of war"" with a cloth knotted on both ends.  I've never tried this with a cat, but that might work too -- it gives the cat something to grab onto (unlike the thing on a string) and allows you to put a little more distance between your hands and the cat."
Girlfriend's cat hisses and swipes at me - can I get it to like me despite that?,"Use less threatening body language. While it sounds like you've come to this conclusion on your own, I reiterate this point to write a more general answer. In cat body language, staring down a cat is very aggressive and threatening. Instead, if you notice a cat looking at you, avert your eyes, and slowly blink instead. This is how cats communicate they are relaxed and just want to hang out. Similarly, cats respond best when you are quiet, but still confident and deliberate when interacting with them. If you are loud, make sudden movements, or loom over them, they will be intimidated or scared. But, contrary to human intuition, being tense, nervous, and skittish when interacting with them will also make them nervous and more likely to swipe. Give the cat better places to go. The cat has ended up essentially guarding certain locations, making it difficult for you to get past. Instead, encourage the cat to be some place else where it will be out of the way and won't feel as threatened by you brushing past. For example, put cat trees nearby, but more out of the way. If it's on the cat tree when you go by, hopefully by being high up, it won't feel as threatened by your going past because it will be more at the same level. You might even consider getting a bunch more cat furniture in general, such as cat trees, shelves, window perches, and so forth. Some cats feel trapped and anxious when they have nowhere to go but the floor or human furniture that's the center of people bustling around, and become much calmer if they are given cat furniture that they can escape to, and is definitely just theirs. Use toys and treats as a distraction. If you still need to walk past the cat, then try to get it distracted with toys or treats. Hopefully you could even get it to move out of the way entirely, so you can simply go where you need to go. Step up your efforts to be friends. The treat while entering the home is a good idea, but that's not going to make you friends with the cat. You need to increase the treats and playtime, so hopefully the cat will come to genuinely like you. You should also work on actually petting the cat, but be mindful of what I said earlier on body language. Your interaction will not be positive if you are too nervous with your attempts to pet it. Use treats as a distraction, and then try to pet it, but start out just with a little petting either under the chin or at the base of the ears. As you grow more confident, you can try more petting. As a side note, you might want to decrease its meal portions, so that you can feed it more treats without worry of the cat gaining weight. Improve the catsitting situation. As you're probably already aware, moving the cat from its home to a strange territory is very stressful. But I also think your situation is even worse than that, because the cat already doesn't get along with you, but it has been forced into what it perceives as your territory. As a result, it's gotten even more aggressive. If possible, do not catsit the cat in your home. Instead, visit the cat at its own home. But if this is not possible, you can improve the situation a little by bringing the cat's things along with it, and placing them about your home. This will spread its smell around, and make it feel more like it owns this space. Do not use negative reinforcement. A point I wanted to add is that in a situation like this, I do not recommend using negative reinforcement such as squirt bottles, shouting, and so forth. The cat is behaving this way because it's unhappy about something, and not because it just wants to be mean. Negative reinforcement could very possibly make the problem worse because it could make the cat dislike you even more. Or at least, negative reinforcement will surely make the cat even more unhappy, when the ideal should be to make everyone, including the cat, happy. So when it does swipe, I think your current reaction of just ignoring it is the best approach."
Can I repair a leaking aquarium without removing all the water and fish?,"Silicone itself is harmless, as it is nontoxic, non-organic and pretty much unreactive. During the hardening process silicone sealant will produce acetic acid, this causes the stench that smells like vinegar. Depending on the amount of silicone, you should not need to worry about some of that acid contacting your water (if you spill something), the amount should be too minimal to have an influence on your aquariums pH. Some silicone sealants intended for use in bathrooms (or similar) might contain fungicides which may negatively affect your aquariums life. Disclaimer: I have not tried to do this before, but everything I knew about silicone sealant told me that this would be safe and a quick search on Wikipedia confirmed my thoughts."
How should I refresh an overheated cat or prevent him from overheating in the first place?,"No need to refresh your cat, he will be perfectly capable of staying inactive for longer periods of time during the hot hours of the day. They are genetically programmed predators that are good at conserving their energy and finding secluded spots, lurking on their prey in ambush when conditions are too hot and they might exhaust themselves and overheat too fast. Make sure your cat has a shade to retreat to and access to fresh water. The place it stays at should be well ventilated, with fresh air coming into it, preferably with access to the outdoors, if at all possible. Cats will often retreat into the bushes or high grass during the hottest hours of the day, but it's also perfectly normal for them to enjoy a bit of the sun too. Don't worry about their fur getting too hot, it's well insulated and with most cat species, it will take a very long time for that heat to propagate onto their body. Cat species with shorter fur will only have this heat tolerance threshold ever so slightly lower than longer fur ones. They also exchange the heat mostly through breathing and pads, and not through their fur, so perhaps giving your cat access to areas laid with floor tiles or any other cooler surfaces wouldn't be a bad idea either. In short though, as long as your cat has all the essentials provided for, like access to fresh water, shade and well aired areas, they will do all the refreshing on their own well enough even in the hottest of climates during the hottest of hours. Do not use however some water sprinkler or a spray bottle on them with intention of helping them cool down. Cats utterly dislike that and when they learn what to run away from, they will and you'll only achieve the opposite with it, stressing and overheating your cat further."
How do I motivate a cat to drink more water?,"Cats don't have much of a natural thirst drive and instead have evolved to get much of the moisture that they need instead from their prey. I focus my efforts on making sure that the cat's entire diet has enough moisture rather than just worrying about plain water intake. So, first, make every effort to feed wet food instead of dry food. According to Lisa A. Pierson, DVM: A cat's normal prey is ~70% water.  Canned food is ~78% water. Dry
  food is ~5-10% water.  Cats have a low thirst drive and they do not
  make up the deficit at the water bowl.  They are designed to get water
  with their food. Cats on canned food have been shown to consume at least double the
  amount of total water when compared to dry food-fed cats when all
  sources of water (food and water bowl) are considered. There's also a supporting study - Effect of dietary water intake on urinary output, specific gravity and relative supersaturation for calcium oxalate and struvite in the cat. Catherine M. F. Buckley, Amanda Hawthorne, Alison Colyer and Abigail E. Stevenson. British Journal of Nutrition / Volume 106 / Supplement S1 / October 2011, pp S128-S130 Other environment enrichment activities (such as the addition of water fountains) can be considered after changing the cat's diet. From observation I've noticed that my cats have very different preferences for what type of water they like to drink. Some of my cats like falling water, some like water that is rising up (from a pump), while others like to drink from a flat surface of water. Since I have a multi-cat home I have fountains that provide all of these different types of water environments.   Cats definitely prefer clean water, so cleaning the water bowls/fountains regularly must be part of the household routine. I choose fountains made of ceramic or stainless steel since plastic can harbor bacteria. I also make sure that they are dishwasher safe so they can be sanitized easily."
Why does our cat suddenly bite us?,"Have you ever watched videos of cats hunting? Ever notice that the cats are relaxed, even appear dozing, and then suddenly explode into action? Cats are sit and wait predators and are able to go from a more covert monitoring of the surroundings to sudden action extremely quickly. That does make spotting the signs very challenging, but it's supposed to. As a quick comment: physical punishment is very unlikely to be effective. I used to be of the ""squirt bottle"" mindset, but it's effectiveness is extremely suspect. Basically, you're assuming that the cat is connecting your aggression properly, rather than seeing it as a reason for their own. In other words, you may be teaching it the exact opposite to what you want to be teaching them here... Based on various research, cats have a socialization sensitivity period of about 12 weeks and during that period need to be handled and socialized with humans and with other cats. Based on your description, you were handling the kitten from earlier periods, but it was not fully socialized with other cats and that is how it learns some of its interaction skills. In the absence of the other cats, the sole source of learning in this respect has come from your efforts. Also, as you noted, your cat is skittish, which is another reason I think they problem is insufficient socialization time. Not being especially affectionate is also another sign. The cat is likely to retain this general pattern even if she eventually completely trusts you and your partner. The one thing to be aware of us that a suspicious, distrusting, cat being confined is only going to enhance aggression, not subdue it. At this point, your better options are to look for ways to encourage the more desirable behaviour and this takes some real patience. When I was much younger, we adopted a persian that had been horribly abused by the ""man"" (I have a very poor opinion of animal abusers) of the house and as a consequence he was terrified of males and male voices. I spent many, many, hours on my side and stomach talking to him and coaxing him with treats and short pets until he eventually came to trust me and no longer fear. At which point, he became a huge lap cat, one that would happily lie on you and enjoy petting for hours on end. I think a similar approach may help here. Basically, start out with very short duration pettings and reward her with a treat at the end of the session if she doesn't react aggressively. As time goes by, slowly increase the duration of the sessions, maintaining the reward for success until she overcomes her biting desire. She may never really react to other humans positively, but if you can get her to a place where she will with you, that's something at least. Patience is the key, it can take many months."
Can I use human shampoo to wash a dog?,"The most common reason not to use human shampoo on a dog is that dogs have different pH levels than humans, as explained by petMD. The acid mantle can also be defined as the relative pH balance of the
  skin. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with levels less than 6.4
  considered high acidity, and levels more than 6.4 considered high
  alkalinity. The normal range of skin pH levels for humans is 5.2 to
  6.2, which means it tends to be on the acidic side, and shampoos and skin products are formulated specifically to maintain this balance. Now consider the relative pH balance for dogs. Depending on breed,
  gender, climate, and the anatomical size on the dog, the pH levels
  range from 5.5 to 7.5, tending toward a more alkaline concentration.
  Therefore, if a shampoo that is formulated for human skin is used on a
  dog, the dog's acid mantle will be disrupted, creating an environment
  where bacteria, parasites, and viruses can run rampant. A professional dog groomer, Barbara Bird, performed an observational study in 2011 on pet and human shampoos, ultimately collecting pH levels for 60 pet shampoos and 45 human shampoos. the human shampoo products are formulated in the more acidic range, as
  expected. However, it also shows how few of the pet shampoos are
  formulated in the range they would be expected to fall – above
  6.5. Forty of the sixty pet shampoos, two-­‐thirds of the sample tested at pH of
  6.5 or less, in the acidic range along with 89% of the human shampoos. She refers to two studies that look at the effect of acidifying skin: Matousek, J, Campbell, KL, Kakoma, I, Solter, PF, Schaeffer, DJ,
  Evaluation of the effect of pH on in vitro growth of Malassezia
  pachydermatis, Can J Vet Res>v.67(1); Jan
  2003. Matousek JL, Campbell KL, Kakoma I, Schaeffer DJ. The effects of four acidifying sprays, vinegar and water on canine cutaneous pH
  levels. J Am Anim Hosp Assoc. 39:29-­‐33 (2003) and concludes with: There is no scientific evidence that shampoo having a pH of
  5.0-­‐6.0 is harmful to pet skin. In fact, many pet shampoos share that pH range with human shampoos. There are, however, good reasons to
  use a good pet shampoo on dogs: Shampoos formulated for canine hair
  are designed to clean well and are often geared toward specific jobs
  or coat types. Human shampoos are designed for daily or weekly use and
  may not clean a dirty dog well. They are also mostly formulated to
  soften hair, which may not be desirable when scissoring a Bichon or
  maintaining a terrier coat. Human hair shampoos are less likely to
  have ingredients for whitening, promoting deshedding, or serious
  deodorizing. So, basically, it seems to be safe, but it may not be the most effective type of shampoo for your dog's coat (you may need to wash him several times with human shampoo to get him clean, or a dog shampoo may contain whiteners that will make him look better)."
How do I tell the sex of a bearded dragon?,"Some people will say that there are ways to tell the sex of a bearded dragon based on it's behaviour. Males in general might be more likely to show their beard, females in general might be more likely to wave their arms in greeting. I've even heard people saying that female bearded dragons are smaller than males. While these may be true sometimes, it's important to remember that these are all anecdotal, and isn't a definitive way of determining the sex of your bearded dragon. The only sure way is to look at what are called hemipenal bulges. While I wouldn't say that determining the sex by looking at the hemipenal bulges is 100% accurate, they are the most accurate method of sexing your dragon (Right after finding it laying eggs). Note: The male hemipenal bulges might be bulges might not be developed enough to see until the bearded dragon is grown 6-7 inches in length. Until then, it will probably look very similar to a female's. The hemipenal bulges on a male bearded dragon will be two bulges, one on each side of the tail following the vent.  (Source) The hemipenal bulges on a female bearded dragon will be one single bulge in the center of the tail following the vent.  (Source) If you are having trouble determining which sex you have, it can actually help a lot to take a small flashlight and shine some light through the tail. You should see the shadows of the testes if it's a male.  (Source) Bearded dragons are one of the lizards who have Femoral Pores. Commonly referred to as preanal pores. These are used to secrete pheromones, especially during mating season. These pores are located on the underside of the hind legs, running from knee to knee, and are generally more prominent on males. Though anecdotal, if you're unsure of the hemipenal bulge it might be the best you can use. Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room. It's called probing. Probing is the practice of forcing open the vent, and pulling the sex organs out, either with a pair of tweezers or what is essentially a pair chopsticks, in order to view them. If anyone suggests that probing your bearded dragon is an acceptable way of sexing your dragon, the proper response is to repeatedly smack them over the head with a rolled up newspaper until they leave in shame. Probing bearded dragons, or any lizard really, carries a huge risk for causing damage. It is one thing to force open the vent and pull the organs out, and another to put everything back in and close the vent without causing any damage. If anyone were to be able to successfully probe your bearded dragon, it would be a veterinarian that has a long history of treating reptiles. While I normally place a pretty high value to breeders, I cannot condone anyone performing this method of sexing lizards who has not dedicated their lives to the medical care of reptiles. Common issues that arise from probing bearded dragons include but are not limited to: Note: Probing snakes poses less risk than lizards, though I still disagree with it as a method personally. But because of it, probing kits are sold. I have seen people buy these kits thinking they can use them for lizards, and people selling them to people to use on their lizards. This should never be done for any reason."
Is it true that cats show their emotions through their tail?,"Cats do show their emotions through their tails.  However, the tail isnt enough to read their emotions perfectly.  You really have to observe an individual cat over time to link their emotions to their behaviors.   For one of my cats, an angry tail shake could mean she is annoyed or content.  It can also mean she is really interested in something.  While my other cat doesnt shake his tail in the same way at all."
How should I accomodate my cat if I travel for work?,"There are a few distinct ways you can tackle this: 1) Look into getting a quality cat sitter.  Talk to friends with pets, people in your neighborhood with pets, people at your vet's office.  The unfortunate thing is that you will have to filter through a lot of bad info, but eventually you should be able to find some really good pet sitters.  I'd concentrate on getting info from people who you know are REALLY close to their pets.  Vet offices can sometimes be misleading because they sometimes have a mutual backscratching deal.  The young techs get pet sitting referrals by default and so aren't necessarily the best pet sitters. 2) Fostering: can you find someone who would be willing to have your pet as their pet on a part time basis?  Say a friend of yours in the area.  Unfortunately this solution has the same issues that the next one does: namely, cats are instinctively attached to their territory.  A move, be it short or long distance, is always very stressful for them, unless they experience frequent moves and come to realize, ""hey, my territory is not the source of my food and all the other goodies"".  This is easier to do with a young cat than an older one who has been in the same place for a long time. 3) Take your cat with you.  Cats instinctively hate to travel but some people have broken them of that.  If you start when the cat is relatively young and frequently take it to different surroundings, the cat should be conditioned to lose its strong natural instinct that territory is what defines well-being.  There is a really stupid book on the subject (actually several) called The Cat Who Went to Paris.  Basically the owner traveled a lot and took his cat wherever he went. I can't recommend the rest of the book, but the parts about his cat I liked. It may be of use to you."
Why does my cat meow less than I expect it to?,"As John Cavan mentioned, cats vary considerably in how vocal they are.  There are a number of factors that determine how often they meow, including genetic (some species, such as siamese, are notorious ""talkers"", for example), upbringing, and general disposition. Some cats only vocalize when they want something.  Others walk throughout the house loudly meowing, simply to indicate they're happy.  Still others only vocalize when they are upset. While a hearing problem can't be ruled out, this sounds perfectly normal to me. As a side anecdote, one of the cats we rescued was identified as deaf.  Even in his foster home, he was completely unresponsive to sound, other than the vacuum cleaner, which the foster family chalked up to him feeling the vibrations.  Indeed, for the first few months at our house, he was both completely silent, and ignored anything audible. However, it turned out that he could hear just fine, and was simply ignoring us!  Once he got comfortable, he not only responded to sound and words, but also started vocalizing on his own.  He's got a very quiet meow (something I find to be fairly frequent in males who were neutered at a young age), but is no longer shy about using it! "
Why does my cat get aggressive when I'm inhaling loudly?,"So, cats can be fairly vocal animals and many of their vocalizations have some meaning with respect to how they may respond. The ones that indicate a level of aggression include: If your snorts (or the aftermath of them) sound like the above to her, it could be taken as aggression by her and so she could react accordingly. If you're conscious of this and see her reacting, then some steps to try are: Basically, this is calming the situation and teaching her that when this happens, you're not being aggressive. Do not: The above are seen as aggressive and will exacerbate the situation."
At what age cats should stop biting and scratching games?,"Kittens need to stay in with their mother for 12 weeks. That's three months and your kitten is already with you when only 1,5 months old. Being with the mother is not all about the mother cat nursing her babies, it is also an important period of time when they learn to play safely with their littermates and with their mother as well. Little kittens have the sharpest teeth and claws there is, at least that's how it feels to us humans. I got firsthand observations of this learning process when we got two male kittens at the same time. They were both 12 weeks old but from different homes and different mix of breeds. The other one came from a fluffy thick fur litter while the other one is from a slick short hair litter. They both naturally learned to adjust their play so as to not hurt their own littermates, but the one with thicker fur had learned to play rougher. It did not start well when these two started playing together here at us. A lot of meowing and hissing from the thin coat fellow went into educating his thick furred mate on safe play rules. After all it worked, they still play together but there's almost no hissing or such sounds nowadays. When does a kitten learn to play safe? At its first months of life, and that with the best playing pals; its own littermates. When a kitten in question has been taken away from his littermates at so very young age it means the play training is a job for his owner(s). How to do this is something for another Q&A. Play training by the kitten's owners is possible, I'm sure of that, it only takes time and effort. My best advice, given your kitten's young age, is to quickly get another kitten to play with this one. Just be sure to find one who is well past 12 weeks old already, one who has spent all that time with other kittens and thus knows the rules. In your place this is without a doubt what I would do."
Why do dogs turn around in a circle before lying down?,"Nobody's exactly sure why domestic dogs do this, long after the need for it is gone (is that carpet really that much different after spinning around on it?). However, there are plenty of theories running around. I'm not sure that it's possible to know the answer for sure, or if they do it for multiple reasons, in different situations. Here are some possible reasons that people have come up with: Whatever the reason, it's definitely a throwback to the wild days of the prairie, and one that hasn't been necessary to select against or stamp out."
What types of food and vitamins are appropriate for a leopard gecko?,"Leopard geckos are carnivorous, so they probably won't even consider eating any vegetation you put in with them. If you're worried about vitamins, gut-loaded crickets are the easiest, and best, option in my opinion. If you can't purchase crickets that are already gut-loaded at your local pet store, you can gut-load whatever crickets you purchase by feeding them Fluker's cricket food (I use the orange cubes). It's a good idea to continue feeding already gut-loaded crickets this food anyways, since once the food they were given is digested, any benefits are lost. I also dust my crickets with calcium occasionally. Just enough to help with bone growth, they require much less calcium when fully grown. You can also put a bit of vitamin/calcium powder in some water and most leopard geckos will drink it. I haven't heard of anyone feeding their leopard geckos locusts, but I don't see anything wrong with it. You might want to look up their nutritional value vs crickets to see where they stand. As far as waxworms go, personally, I say it's a good thing they don't like them. Waxworms are high in fat content, and their exoskeletons are difficult for reptiles to digest. So they really aren't the greatest of foods to offer. I know this isn't really part of the question, but I separate sexes of my animals unless I want them to breed. There's nothing you can really do to prevent the male from stressing the female out, and there's nowhere for her to escape the attention in a terrarium. They'll both do fine in separate 10 gallon terrariums, and if you're worried about expenses with new lights they don't require UV lights since they've been bred in captivity so long. Although some small studies have shown that even reptiles that don't require UV light will benefit from small amounts, so I still suggest it."
Stray dog or fox?,"Assuming this isn't a joke, that is a fox.  If you want to make absolutely sure, and assuming you can check safely, check the eyes.  Foxes have slit pupils when they're contracted, like a cat's.  Dogs always have rounded pupils.   Since this is a wild animal, however, do not handle it, and those who have interacted with it should possibly seek medical treatment as foxes can carry serious diseases such as rabies."
Kitten Food in an Emergency,"In an emergency situation, absence of an available vet or pet food store where you can get appropriate milk replacement, you can use a couple of options that should be readily available from a local convenience store: Simple option is an egg yolk mixed with a can of unsweetened evaporated milk. More complicated option (in absence of the evaporated milk) would be egg yolk, mixed with whole milk, multi-vitamin, and some crushed antacid pills. In both cases, this must be short-term, emergency feeding only. Ideally, as Matt S noted, you want to get proper milk replacement (powdered options are available) and kitten food for anything beyond a few feedings. For feeding, you can use an eyedropper or similar, just make sure it's been cleaned very thoroughly if you ever used it for medications."
Is overhead cable running leash suitable for all dogs?,"I have had dogs that loved being on a cable and I have had dogs that hated it. The placement of the cable, the personality and breed of your dog are very important. I had a German Shepherd who we once tried to put on a cable. He hated it so much he tore it off the side of the house. We got an electric fence after that, but that did not work either. We ended up putting up a wooden fence, which he was fine with, except the gate had to be short enough for him to see over or he freaked out. His protective personality made a running leash a very bad idea for him.  We had another dog who was a husky/border collie/chow-chow mix. She liked the runner leash. She was relatively strong, but never pulled the runner out. We did not have a fence when we had her and the runner leash was a good idea for her. She was a stubborn dog who loved to run. Our yard was long enough that she was fine with that leash. She also did not mind being on a chain when we were gardening in the front yard (which was important because we lived on a busy street at the time). She was not protective at all and would have been happy to sit on a leash outside all night (which we did for her safety when we went camping. A third dog, an Australian Shepherd, has always hated any from of leash. He comes well when called, but wanted to spend more time outside. We were in a different house at the time and chose a chain link fence. He loves being outside in his ""pen"" so much, that he stays in there even if we accidentally forget to close the gate. He is also a stubborn dog, but he listens to commands. Those are three different dogs I have owned that are different kinds of herding or hunting breeds.  As to your specific breed. The Pyrenean Shepherd was designed to be a sheepdog, and as such is full of the same sort of energy that other herding dogs have, but in a surprisingly small package. This adaptive dog wants to, and can, do all the jobs on the field, and is a natural herder. A dog that needs a job, its cleverness makes it ideal for other work and dog sports such as flyball, competitive obedience and agility. This dog is good with children that they were brought up with. They have a sense of protector over the children.
  Pyr Sheps are ""one-man"" dogs, attached and dedicated to their owners, with a desire to follow them around the house to help with daily chores. They sense every mood and often seem to be able to read their masters' minds, as they are constantly watchful. Because of this, they are extremely trainable.
  Their natural wariness, while valuable in a herding dog that may need to alert their shepherd of strange animals or people, combined with their herding bossiness, can lead to shyness or aggression in even the most friendly puppy if not properly managed. Frequent socialization from a very young age can help counter this trait. source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenean_Shepherd#Temperament Your dog, if they conform to breed standards, would be more like my old German Shepherd. If they are very loyal to you, they will hate being on a runner and would be much happier with a short fence. The runner would drive your dog crazy because it would not be able to be near you. They are naturally wary, which means that they have the chance of tearing out a runner chain if another dog goes by and your dog fears you are threatened. That is why a Pyrenean Shepherd would be happier in a fence."
Why do dogs wag their tails?,"Tail wagging can actually mean quite a few different things, depending on how the tail is held, how broad or short the strokes of the tail wagging are, and how quickly the tail is moving. I've seen dogs wag their tails to indicate that they were happily excited, such as upon seeing a favorite toy.  I've also seen dogs wag their tails in what seemed to be pitiful dejection, such as slowly wagging it back and forth while watching their human leave.  Sometimes it can suggest that the dog is nervous, or that the dog has done something wrong and knows it.  Sometimes it simply means that they're all wound up and have simply too much energy. There has been a fair amount of research on the subject, and research and experts have found some surprising (and not-so-surprising) nuances to tail-wagging in canines. A study using a remote-controlled lifelike dog replica simulated 4 different combinations of tail lengths and wagging: short/still, short/wagging, long/still, long/wagging. Larger dogs were less cautious and more likely to approach a long/wagging
tail rather than a long/still tail, but did not differ in their approach to a short/still and a
short/wagging tail. Using discriminant analyses of behavioural variables, dogs responded
with an elevated head and tail to a long/wagging tail model relative to the long/still tail model,
but did not show any differences in response to tail motion when the model’s tail was short. In other words, a clearly visible wagging tail made dogs more comfortable and confident in being able to safely approach the replica. In wolves, wagging tails typically indicate an increase in energy or excitement. There are two specific styles of tail wagging that wolves perform: rigid or fluid movement. A rigid tail (like a pendulum) wag means the wolf is excited and has dominant tendencies. A fluid, or snake-like wag typically is a signal of play or greeting toward other pack members. The elevation and movement of each wolf's tail work together to describe the behavior of each individual. So, a wolf who is rigidly wagging a T1 tail is exhibiting intense dominance, however a wolf fluidly wagging a T3 tail is probably soliciting social play with other pack members. One study showed that the direction of the wag (left->right or right->left) indicates different things in domestic dogs: Dogs wag their tails to the right when they see something they want to approach, and to the left when confronted with something they want to back away from, say researchers in Italy. Over a series of trials, they videoed each dog's response to being shown either their owner, a human stranger, a cat, or a Belgian shepherd malinois, a large dog breed similar to a German shepherd. Shown a human or a cat, tails wagged consistently to the right. The unfamiliar person elicited less wagging than the owner, and the cat the least wagging of all — probably because the dog was so interested in giving chase that it was distracted from wagging, says Vallortigara. Shown a large, unfamiliar and intimidating dog, the dogs wagged their tails more to the left. Dogs also wagged to the left when left on their own without anyone to look at, the researchers report in Current Biology (Quaranta A., Siniscalchi M. & Vallortigara G.. Curr. Biol., 17 . 199 - 201 (2007).) Other research indicates that how widely a dog's tail wags, and how quickly, has meaning, too: The speed of the wag indicates how excited the dog is .The breadth of the wag shows whether the dog's emotional state is negative or positive Here are some combinations that Dr Coren describes- A slight wag-with each swing of only small breadth-is usually seen during greetings as a tentative 'Hello there,' or a hopeful 'I'm here.' A broad wag is friendly; 'I am not challenging or threatening you.' This can also mean, 'I'm pleased,' which is the closest to the popular concept of the happiness wag, especially if the tail seems to drag the hips with it. A slow wag with tail at 'half-mast' is less social than most other tail signals. Generally speaking slow wags, with the tail in neither a particularly dominant (high) nor a submissive (low) position, are signs of insecurity. Tiny, high-speed movements, that give the impression of the tail vibrating, are signs the dog is about to do something - usually run or fight. If the tail is held high while vibrating, it is most likely an active threat.'"
"Trained dog to ring bell to go out, now he rings it all the time","I found something, but this really depends on making the dog bored of leaving the house... Playtime vs. Potty Time Once they discover that bell ringing makes the door open, many clever dogs ring the bells whenever they’d like go outside—even when they don’t need to relieve themselves. If this sounds like your dog, you need to teach him that bell ringing is only about potty time. When he rings the bell to go out, praise him, clip on his leash and take him directly to the place where you’d like him to eliminate. Don’t play with him. Just give him three to five minutes to urinate or defecate. If he does, great! Praise him again and give him a treat before taking him back in. If he doesn’t do his business, just take him back inside. Source I have no idea how this is supposed to work if your dog is enthusiastic about just spotting another dog and/or sniffing the outside air, though. Is there an outside-spot the dog is plain not interested in you could use?"
Is there a pet which eats flies,"My answer's going to be the same as one I've previously given. I would avoid getting an animal and expect it to take care of any insect problems. If the flies can get in, the animal that's going to eat the flies can get out. Then you're not only back where you started, but possibly responsible for introducing an invasive species into your area. If you let an animal loose around your house to eat the flies, you're also letting them loose to defecate in your house. Wild insects can come into contact with pesticides and parasites. Which could in turn, infect, make ill, or even kill the animal eating them. You're also going to want to consider the needs of the animals you're considering. The first animals that come to mind are amphibians and reptiles, but amphibians need constant moisture otherwise you're going to find some nasty surprises around your house. Reptiles need certain temperatures and UV light in order to digest their food, so you'd be living in a tanning bed. My cats have been effective at chasing down and killing flies, but they also have been effective at ""killing"" everything else that's been in their way. Fly on the good china? Not anymore. Of course you have'll want to consider the responsibilities of taking care of a cat if you go that route (they're not going to survive off of bugs). If it's just a matter of not wanting to put fly traps around the house (I get it, they're gross), I'd suggest a plant that eats insects. The only downside to a plant is the amount of sunlight it needs, and making sure that it gets enough water. There's the classic venus fly trap, the sundew plant, and various types of pitcher plants. I would ask gardening.se about the specific care for the plants though. Otherwise if it's just about getting rid of the flies, I'd suggest one of the bag fly traps. They work in the same way that the pitcher plants do, in that the flies go in, get stuck, and drown."
How can I help a cat who seems afraid of his harness?,"It looks like a ""pure"" training problem. I'll divide the answer in two parts: the choice of a training method and then implementation of the training. The reaction of the cat is not that surprising. There are many training strategies available the ones I would use in this case are: The first two points are about physiological modifications while the third one is more focused on the behavioural modification. So you're not doing anything wrong and the model/size of the harness is probably not the cause of the problem. Desensitisation is about making the cat feel comfortable with something new and that he considers undesirable. Counter-conditioning addresses a possible negative reaction he might have learned, possibly after just a few exposures to the harness. Positive reinforcement training is particularly suited in this case and with a cat (compared to punishment based training or other useless ideas). In any proceed much more slowly and stop immediately to try to force the harness on the cat (you don't seem to be in a hurry anyway). In those situations we usually make the mistake to proceed at the pace we want things to go, not at the pace the pet is comfortable with. So think about the whole thing as if you would like to teach a gorilla to jump through a hoop: no frustration, no yelling, no intimidation, etc. First thing is desensitisation and/or counter-conditioning: habituate the cat to the harness. At the beginning that means without wearing the harness. Take the harness with you anytime you interact with the cat or anytime you groom him, pet him, etc. Depending on how you feed the cat, you might want to start just before feeding time. If he's crazy about his food, try to have him interact with the harness for a while, then feed him. Progress slowly and after some time you could try to put the harness on the cat and then giving him access to his food. The goal is not to try to fit the harness on the cat while he's eating. You can also invent games with the harness, or bring it with you in any other positive activity you do with the cat. The goal of this first part is mainly to obtain the correct physiological response to the harness, i.e. a good state of mind, not a particular behaviour. Of course some behaviour is associated with everything, but here you just want the cat to feel good with the harness close to him or on him. Then the next part is to obtain the correct behavioural response, that's more in line with what we usually mean with training (e.g. teaching a cat or dog to sit, no real ""emotion"" to overcome). That's only possible if the first part is attained. When you're able to fit the harness on the cat without provoking excessive reaction, start to positively reinforcement any good behaviour with the harness on: not moving for 1 second: reinforce him (treat or praise or play, all of the that, etc), coming to you, etc. You get the idea. Your cat will decide what's a reinforcer: maybe he'll like a particular food treat, his favorite toy, etc. With cats it is in my experience a bit harder than with dogs. My cats get either overexcited or just not interested. On top of all of these you could also apply the same principles without harness, just with a collar, and gradually manipulating the collar more and more (more or less tight, attaching a leash, etc.)."
Is chewing cardboard normal for a cat?,"Chewing cardboard, amongst other things, can be a sign of pica in cats. Basically, this is an eating disorder that could be a consequence of dietary deficiencies or cognitive dysfunction (old age, senility), and some others. This isn't entirely normal, though not all that uncommon, so it would be a good idea to get him checked out by a vet to make sure that he's generally healthy (he looks it though)."
What types of pet birds can be house-trained?,"The parrot family appears to be quite trainable, likely a function of being highly intelligent. However, any bird species that you're likely to allow to fly freely can be trained with appropriate patience. Several articles out there also describe the basics of it: Essentially, the idea is to watch for signs that your bird is about to poop and then move them to an appropriate poop spot and then tell them to go. Reward them when they do it correctly. Having said all that, this training is not without some risks. Birds only have one sphincter and they urinate and defecate from that one opening, so this is a biological structure that is not intended for long-term ""holding it in"" activities. The single biggest risk here is the prolapsed cloaca which poses serious danger to the health of the bird. At any rate, I had a pet budgie once and allowed him to fly freely around my apartment at the time. The thing is, he tended to hang out at two general places: some rings I'd set in front of the balcony and in the cage I had hung on the wall. If you know that birds tend to poop when they take off before flying and for a while after eating, appropriate paper/plastic cover at their hangouts is a good way to avoid any significant cleaning chores. Summation: pick the variety that appeals to you the most. The parrot family is good if you like to talk with them and budgies (it is a small variety of parrot), in particular, are really, really, easy to keep."
How many times a day should I feed a cat?,"When studying animal husbandry, we were taught that cats, in nature, generally fed on many small meals throughout a 24 hours period. An example being they may catch mice at different points throughout the day and night. They don't have the same circadian rhythms as human beings, or dogs, and, naturally, spend as much time active during the day and night. I mention this, as it is different to feeding dogs, that will usually thrive on one good meal a day and then sleep afterwards. From my experience and study, it is best to feed for cat at least three smaller meals a day. If the cat does not have a weight problem, and feeding the cat frequently is an issue, that is where dry food comes in handy, as the cat can munch on this on and off throughout the day. So to answer the question: is there an ideal frequency for feeding a cat?  Yes, 5-6 small meals a day is the ideal feeding regime. It's not that pets cats are being mistreated being fed less than this, the question is asking for ideals. Certainly feeding a cat once a day, and not having dry food left out, is not a pleasant experience for the cat, as they get hungry and are prone to prowling. Any frequency under three times a day, it would be preferable to have dry food left out, but this does cause problems in households with multiple pets and obese pets."
Cat Sits in Front of the TV,"When a cat has some undesirable habit, rather than just trying to stop the behavior, you should offer it some alternative that you're okay with. Make the alternative seem better to the cat than what it was doing before, and the cat will naturally want to do what you want.  You can achieve this by both making the alternative even more pleasing to the cat than what it was originally doing, and also by making the thing you don't want it doing less pleasing. The dissuasion I'm not sure your scat mat is, but searching for the term turned up electrified mats. If that's what your item is, I would get rid of it. Electric shocks are meant to actually cause the animal pain. Surely no one wants to hurt their pet, and there are plenty of alternatives that don't cause actual pain: The alternative In this case, you want to make some spot that the cat would like to hang out in even more than the TV. Cats like their hang out spots to be elevated, warm, and comfy. And in this case, it seems located at the center of human attention. Therefore, I suggest placing cat furniture close to the TV, with a soft blanket and maybe even a heating pad. If the cat is hesitant to try the new furniture, use treats or catnip to help attract the cat to the new spot. You can even try playing with toys and using the toy to lead the cat to the new spot. Experiment It will take some experimentation to figure out the right combination of things that will make your cat gravitate to the behavior you want. You should be careful while you're experimenting to make sure the cat doesn't decide that the furniture is a good ladder to the top of your TV. You might even move the new furniture away from the TV while you aren't going to be watching things to make sure the cat doesn't attempt to jump while you aren't there. Alternatively, make it impossible for the cat to continue the behavior. This type of alternative is often more expensive or more work, but it is a foolproof solution. In this case, you can change your TV setup entirely so that the cat can no longer sit there. One obvious way to accomplish that is to get a wall mount for your TV."
Should I take my cat to the vet after a big fall/jump?,"Cats don't like admitting that they're hurt. Observe, and if there's significant behavior change, the vet is probably a good idea. Cats in good condition can survive some surprising falls -- if you don't have problems with the concept, web search ""feline high-rise syndrome"" for some surprising results that suggest how -- but they don't always land well. My previous cat once fell about 20' off a roof, and almost got away with it -- but she didn't hit quite right and broke her jaw. My cats now have an 8'-tall cat tree. They'll jump from the 5' and 6.5' platforms at times... but when possible they'll aim for the sofa, which is both a shorter fall and a padded landing."
How can I prevent a dog from removing a splint/bandages?,"I would suggest using a sleeve over the bandage. The problem with this is finding the right balance between too loose, hence he can remove it and too tight. First port of call, the vet would most likely have a suitable sleeve. Second option, DIY sleeve. Using some firm and tubular fabric, like a sock. The sock is put over the bandage (like the dog is wearing a sock).  Before doing so, attach long  ties to the tops of the sock, so these ties can be brought up around the dogs chest and back and tied, so the dog is unable to pull the sock off. Much like your principle of bringing the bandage up over the chest, but unravelable.  Be sure to use a material that won't cut into the dog's fur, broader apron like strips or even use some of the excess bandages purchased to create a stretchy sling attachment to the sock. All you need it someone able to thread a needle, as the presentation is not important. Let me know if this works. Third option, which I am reluctant to recommend is, using a sticky backed elastoplast product (I am in Australia here) or adhesive bandaging and wrapping this around the crepe bandage, in a similar fashion to how you would use the crepe bandage. I would not suggest putting this against the dog's fur. If this is done sufficiently firmly, it will make it harder for the dog to remove.  The only issue is that it is not too tight to restrict blood flow, as you don't want to damage the tissue in the dog's toes or leg. Wrapping an adhesive gauze around a led like this can easily restrict blood flow. To get the right balance between too loose (and the dog being able to remove it) and too tight is a tricky. note.
I would not recommend a  compression type bandage, it will hold the bandage firmly in place, but may also compromise blood flow.  My homemade pictures of how it would look (no dogs were injured in creating this image)   With the bandage

What are the most common dietary allergies in cats?,"When I had a cat with severe (anaphylaxtic shock severe) allergies, we were able to have the vet do a blood test which gave us a list of foods that we had to avoid. It was definitely easier than randomly guessing which food to try next."
Cats and string: will a toy make this better or worse?,"I believe that there isn't an association between strings on toys and shoelaces.  Two of our cats (Hunter and Juliet) would rather play with the strings on wand toys than whatever the strings are attached to (feathers or whatever), but they haven't really carried that connection to other similar objects. We first knew that we had a problem with strings when we tried a specific type of toy. There are some toys that are meant to be tied to a doorknob and left, a string (or elastic) will help keep them entertaining for the cats without your direct participation. Hunter and Juliet just sat there chewing on the string until it broke, and then they tried to eat the string.  Yet, we leave random string objects around the house all of the time and they don't mess with them (I looked around the living room this evening and found charging cables for various electronic devices, lanyards from conferences/events, a soft measuring tape, and other string like objects). Our cats have never made the connection between these objects and their string toys.  One thing that I do try to do is pay attention to their body language, and if they get that attentive ""I'm going to jump on something!"" look when looking at something that is Not Their Toy, we try to focus their attention elsewhere so they don't make the connection that (for example) the drawstring on my pajamas is a toy.  The methods (and success) differ depending on each cat and their personality. For example, Hunter thinks the sun rises and sets on whatever my husband wants, so if he tells Hunter ""no"", Hunter will stop whatever it is (and sulk a bit). Kendall is still very young and kittenish (by my standards, he's about 4), so I generally have to give him something that IS his toy to distract him. With most of the cats, we don't generally try to punish them, but try to focus more on redirecting (give me that, here have this instead).  I think that an existing belief that shoelaces are toys can be retrained. When we first got Juliet, she also loved to chew on electrical cables. We went through, removed all of the cables we couldn't supervise (or covered them in protectors), and gradually broke the association. After about a year of paying close attention to it, she was apparently out of the habit of it, because now we leave cables and stuff out all of the time without any harm. Most behavior problems can be lessened by giving them more play, so if they have enough playtime they are less likely to be looking for hunting opportunities at other times. One thing I've seen people do is put a wand toy in their belt loop as they move around the house cleaning (or whatever), which can lessen the time investment for you and may focus their attention on the toy rather than your shoelaces, but it may just train them to be underfoot when you're busy. I haven't ever done it regularly (some times when I'm playing and have to go stir something on the stove or change laundry I've done it, but not as a regular thing). The last suggestion I have is if they are playing with your shoes in your bedroom while you're trying to sleep, train yourself to put your shoes away. Ginger likes to lick plastic (bags, tape, all sorts of things), so we have to look around the bedroom for things she might lick in the middle of the night. It's annoying, but she doesn't wake us up with rustling plastic sounds."
Why should I give salt to a horse?,"Salt controls the hydration level of the horse and is generally absent from their normal diet, in comparison to mineral requirements such as potassium, hence the reason you need to provide it. If the sodium level of the horse is below optimal, the horse's body will act to conserve the salt levels in their body at the expense of other minerals and water, leading to dehydration. Basically, for the horse to maintain a healthy water level, you need to provide sufficient salt to prevent them from shedding too much water to relieve heat in the body."
Why is one of my cats licking walls and windows?,"A cat licking glass should generally be unharmful depending on your window cleaning methods. If you use a commercial cleaner (which would be harmful if ingested), then I would recommend switching to something non-toxic. I usually use water and microfiber towels. I've also heard that folks have good results with a vinegar/water mix, and this may also have the added benefit of tasting terrible and discouraging her from doing it. I am definitely concerned about her licking the walls. Cat tongues are rough and she may be able to get paint (or wall material, depending on your construction) off. If she licks in only certain areas, I would try cleaning those areas with an enzyme or CO2 cleaner - there may be something there that she's attracted to. You could also try breaking her of the habit by blocking the areas with furniture, sheets, or other objects. Older homes have an added danger of the possibility of lead based paint. If your home could potentially have lead paint, you should immediately take her to the vet and ask for a lead screening. According to the EPA (in the USA): Most homes built before 1960 contain heavily leaded paint. Some homes built as recently as 1978 may also contain lead paint. This paint could be on window frames, walls, the outside of homes, or other surfaces. Indoor Air Quality: Lead-Based Paint If she continues to lick walls/windows even after you've thoroughly cleaned the surfaces, I would suggest taking her to the vet and explaining her behavior. One of our boys chews on things because he had terrible mouth problems (we ended up pulling out all of his teeth), and one of the girls licks everything because she has some anxiety issues. If the behavior is the result of an underlying medical issue, there are medications and treatments that can help!"
How to teach a dog how to bark?,"If your teach your dog how to bark on command then it will be easier to teach him to bark when he wants to come in. Teaching your dog to bark on command will require a lot of patience and dedication. METHOD 1 Firstly, pick a command that will be suitable and comfortable for you to use like ""Bark"", ""Speak"", ""Yes"", etc. Hold a toy that makes your dog and call the command to make your dog bark. Once he barks, give him the toy along with treats and praise him. Repeat the process in 2 for a few times. Very soon he will get used to the command and understand what you want him to do. METHOD 2  Pick a command that will be suitable for you to use like ""Bark"", ""Speak"", ""Yes"", etc. Put your dog in a situation of frustration because frustration will likely lead him to barking. An Example is tying him and going to a corner and calling his name. He will try to break loose and come and meet you, since he cannot he will most likely start to bark. Another example is tying him and then putting a favorite toy close to him (but not within his reach). This will most likely cause him to bark. Try putting the command before your dog barks. When he barks praise him with treats (Continue the process in 2 until your dog is now regularly barking. Very soon he will realise what you want him to do and will bark once you give the command). Once you have trained your dog to bark on command, whenever he is at the door and doesn't bark, Give him the command and once he barks, open the door and praise him. Repeat this for a few times and soon your dog will get used to it and will bark when he is at the door even without you giving him the command.

Why do dogs eat wood and how to fix that?,"Every dog I have had in the last 12 years (which is 31) has enjoyed gnawing on sticks, especially the younger ones, and since we live in the woods, there is never any shortage of nice ones. I don't know if it's more common in Border Collies (that's all I've had recently) but it sure does happen a lot. Dogs like chew toys. A lot. If I let them, they would eat an entire stick. Thankfully none of the dogs ever suffered significant problems with that activity. Now, bones have really caused problems. :-( However, I don't let my dogs outside alone for prolonged periods of time. On walks, I often throw balls for them, especially if they pick up a stick. I try to keep them moving (which stops them from settling down with a stick.) They also know ""leave it"". If they are sufficiently entertained on their walks (lots of interesting smells, water to play in, balls, etc.) the stick eating is minimized (the adults won't do it at all.) From watching the younger ones, it seems it feels good, so I replace it with a chew toy. Keeping your dog on a leash will lessen the need to run at him to remove sticks. So will a soft basket muzzle. There are some good tips in this article."
How should I select a puppy from a litter?,"Well first you should rule out health problems. Examine the puppies eyes, ears, mouth, skin and genitals for anything unusual. Gently hold and feel the puppy for any wounds, deformities or sensitive areas. Watch the puppy move and play to ensure he has healthy joints, is strong, and is well developed. One advantage of picking the energetic puppy is that sick or defective puppies often don't have a lot of energy. Energetic dogs may be more energetic when it comes to learning so its hard to say if that impacts training one way or another. If the puppy strikes you as unusually energetic and you want a more mellow dog then select a more mellow puppy. Sure there is some truth to puppy behavior and appearance relating to adult behavior but it is more of an art than a science. Runts can be more aggressive than regular sized puppies and may not be as gentle around children. One thing that makes cats, dogs and a few other species attractive to people is that these animals bond with us. Not all animals will bond strongly with a particular person.  So observing the animal's reaction to you is important in selecting an animal you intend to bond with. The animal approaching you and readily engaging in play is a good indicator that you two are compatible. Picking a puppy or kitten should also be an intuitive process. You should be able to just observe the puppies for a bit and one may stand out as your favorite. Think of it like identifying an actor, a tree, a story, or a television show you really like; there is no test, or any real thought put into it. One simply is your favorite for some collection of reasons you may or may not be aware of. Trust your intuition and judgment."
How do I control weeds with dogs present?,"Using a herbicide such as Round-Up on your lawn, as well as insecticides, are not only harmful to the environment in general, but especially harmful to dogs and other pets using the lawn. Pets and pesticide use fact sheet:  http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/petspest.pdf Animals can be exposed to pesticides when they breathe in the product, absorb it through their skin, or ingest the product.
  Your pet’s risk of developing a health problem depends on how much pesticide your pet is exposed to and the toxicity of
  the pesticide to that specific type of animal. Pet owners can minimize the chance of their pet having a problem by following
  label directions, selecting lower toxicity pesticides, and minimizing the amount of exposure their pet has to the pesticide
  during and after the application. A new study also found that these chemicals can be passed on from dogs to their owners : ""Gastrointestinal upset is the most common sign seen when ingestion of fertilizer and herbicide occurs,"" she says. ""However, if large amounts or concentrated products are ingested, veterinary intervention may be necessary. In addition, very young, very old, and debilitated animals may be more sensitive to exposures."" There are other, safer ways to control weeds and other problems in your lawn, such as organic mixtures (concentrated vinegar and salt solution) as well as a spot-spray weed killer, so it does not affect your whole lawn and will be overall healthier for you and your pet. http://www.lawnsmith.co.uk/lawn-care-advice/lawn-faqs/kids-pets-wildlife-safety/ "
What problems may arise if you raise two puppies from the same litter in the same household?,"The term of interest here is, I think, Littermate Syndrome and it happens because we naturally think that the best friend for our puppy is one they're already familiar with. If you stop to think about that, it doesn't even make sense for us. While the vast majority of us like and get along with our siblings, there comes a point that we don't want to live with them.   Littermate syndrome is, basically, a situation where the two dogs bond excessively to each other to the point that they don't socialize and bond with humans nor socialize well with other dogs. Not all pairings will fall into this, but there seems to be a huge consensus amongst trainers that this much more likely to happen than it isn't. Once the dogs have fallen into the syndrome, the only real option for fixing the issue is to rehome one of the dogs, often a pretty hard thing to do and is a big factor in trainers recommending you don't raise littermates together. Note well, this risk is also prevalent when mixing two developing puppies from different litters. Understand that they both are developing socialization skills with humans at this stage and having them together interferes with that. At any rate, it is possible to train them, house them, and feed them separately, in all aspects, but that's quite the burden on you. Only you can state if that's worth it, but for the most part I think it's better to avoid."
How would I deal with a choking cat?,"First things first - remain calm. The cat will pick up on your distress, and since it is already in trouble, the last thing you want to do is make it more upset.  You will want to try to remove whatever is obstructing the cat's airway, UNLESS IT IS A NEEDLE. If it is a needle, DO NOT try to remove it, as you can cause a lot of pain and injury to the cat - take the cat to the vet RIGHT away if you notice they are choking on a needle. One of the easiest ways to open a cat's mouth (and the method I use to get my cat to open his mouth when I need to give him pills and the like when he is ill), is to wrap your hand over the top of the cat's head (so the top of the head is against your palm), and use your thumb and index finger to press against the jaw (near the longer fang teeth) and the cat should open its mouth for you, and you should be able to reach in with your fingers (or needlenose pliers if you can't get a grip on the obstruction) and pull it out. If it doesn't, you can also (as terrible as it might sound), pick the cat up by the back legs and turn it so its head is facing the floor, and shake vigorously. It might seem like a really horrible thing to do, but it can save the cat's life! If you cannot get the object out, take the cat to the vet RIGHT AWAY, so they can help you.  Source: a pamphlet my vet gave me when I got my cat, and this site that also explains cat CPR!"
How do I choose a good brand of cat food?,"There's no simple formula for this activity, the dietary needs of cats will vary over time. Nevertheless, there are a couple of things to consider: Meat content. Cats are obligate carnivores, so foods overloaded with non-meat fillers is not really a sign. Some non-meat portions are not unexpected and may be added for other purposes, but meat needs to be the majority and it should clearly show that. AAFCO ""complete and balanced"" food. This means that the food has been properly tested to meet the dietary needs of your pet. I know that both Canadian and American foods will be labelled with that, if appropriate, not sure beyond that. However, I would expect similar in many jurisdictions and it is worth checking this. Vet's advice on current needs is something to factor in to your choices. They may recommend certain dietary content in the food, or avoidance of some, and so are always good to consult. You should make a habit of having that discussion with them regularly if possible because, as I noted, dietary needs can change over time. Price is definitely not an indicator! However, really cheap knock-off brands (or ""no name"" products) are probably best avoided, but going for the caviar of food isn't a requirement either. Hope that helps a bit, getting a food that is good for the cat and that they'll enjoy can be an adventure."
How to correctly clean my dog's ears?,"There are (in the US anyway) several ear cleaning solutions available at most (all?) pet supply stores.   It is a liquid in a bottle, the label directions generally include putting some amount of the fluid in the dogs ear, rubbing the base of the ear, and allowing the dog to shake out any residue. I always keep this in my rabbit grooming/first aid kit. As mentioned in comments ""you should never, ever, put a swab or other cleaning tool into the ear canal of"" any pet."
How do I motivate my rabbit to eat more hay?,"You are correct the keeping food moving through the rabbit is critical.  The primary foods you are feeding are closer to treat foods than the are to an optimal diet.  Some arguments are even made to move to a completely pellet free diet Giving your rabbit a healthy diet is not Punishment, it is the most kind thing you can do (see case study of poor diet. It is important that you make a slow transition from the current diet to  healthy diet (see Do I need to do anything special when I change what I feed my rabbit?). If your rabbit has not had enough hay he may any of several issues (see Why is adding hay to a rabbit's diet important?) a visit to a qualified rabbit vet may be warranted.  If he has teeth issues, it will take a vet to address the issue. The first step in correcting the diet, is to begin substituting old favorites for newer healthier choices.  One healthy treat that should be easily transitioned in is hay cubes, over a few days replace carrots and fruit peels with hay cubes. The carrots and fruit peels are the are probably the worst part of your you rabbits current diet (see Are carrots a healthy part of a rabbit diet?) as is any high sugar item (like honey).  Next step is to include high quality leafy greens vegetables, this should be a cup a day.  Timothy hay is probably the best choice for a mature rabbit, but orchard hay will also work.  It should be avaible at all times for your rabbit.  As he moves away from the sweet foods, and gets appropriate quanties of healthier foods, he should migrate to eating more hay.  He should never have an endless supply of pellets or greens, so durring the times those are not available he will naturally eat the hay to fill out his diet. Lastly, consider the type of pellets you are feeding. There are a lot of different choices out there.  Oxbow and zupreem are two quality brands.  Anything with bright colors and lots of different items in the bag are marketing to the consumer, not to health of the rabbit.  Bulk feed from a farm supply store, is a slightly better option than color pet food feeds, but it is formulated for putting weight on production rabbits quickly, not for long term maintenance of a pet rabbit. Quality foods are dark uniform shaped and formed pellets with a timothy hay base.  If you should encounter any difficulties in the transition."
How can I train my dog to stop eating everything?,"It might help:  What you need to do here is to make him calm down. Pull on the leash time to time, don't make noise, just something like ""hey"" or ""it's okay"", you should not being angry or aggressive at all. You can also touch him, so he can gently cool-down. At this point you must be about 5 meters from the trash and you should keep him there like that until he gives-up. Then you will see something like this probably:  From now onward, you have to walk with him like this, slowly going closer to the trash or object. He should NOT pull the leash, you should keep him calm. If he is pulling, then stop and wait until he calms down, then one step closer. Go closer until you get to the point that you're just a little bit far from the trash or object (but he still can't reach it), and let him sit down there. Seems you're waiting for someone, just wait there. You will get to the following point soon or late:  Now bring the other dogs. Let them sit down there for a while. Like a normal summer day in your backyard. Then give some of their toys or even some food as a treat. Let them be there for a while and then start walking to the next point. If he is already tired, that's a good news, go back home and repeat it again another day. Just remember this is the correct way of walking with a dog with a leash. He/she should not pull for any reason.  Update BTW I forgot to mention two things:"
What is the ideal frequency and time to feed my 11-year-old bichon frisé?,"For my Bichon (she's 10 months) and my Mother's bichon (4 year old) the rationing has been the most effective (for the 4 year old, we tried the unlimited method, but she gained weight because she's greedy like most dogs!). The numbers on the package are a rough guideline and (as others have said) can often be slightly higher than what's recommended, they are a good base line to use though. If you don't have one already, invest in a Dog food measuring cup, something like:  First thing on a morning, fill up the cup with the dog's daily allowance and then give her a portion of it throughout certain times of the day (We do breakfast, late dinner, supper, but you do what works for you :))"
How to react when a dog lashes-out at his dog friend?,"Aggression in a dog is usually not a natural behavior but an attitude and frame of mind within the dog that they learn as a potential way to deal with a situation that they find highly uncomfortable.  When feeling uncomfortable with a situation a dog usually lets out a number of warning signs to let others know that they do not like the situation, such as averting gaze, growling, baring teeth, hair standing up, body tensing up.  When all else fails the dog may resort to a corrective nip or even a full out attack.  This is normal behavior for a dog. Abnormal behavior is if the dog is so used to his warning signals being ignored or so used to being in generally uncomfortable situations that the dog quickly goes from giving no warning at all to full on attack mode.  The dog learns that aggression is the only way to deal with what makes it uncomfortable. A truly aggressive dog is not calm, is excited, their tail may even be wagging.  They look at who they are attacking or about to attack with an intense predatory gaze, they intend to kill or be killed.  When attacking or being held back from attack you may hear them whine or yelp and get increasingly high pitched.  Trying to physically hold them back may cause them to turn on you and attack you.  If your dog is in this state of mind ever then immediately try to remove the dog from the situation until it has calmed down.  Do not try to yell or provide corrective action to a dog in this state of mind, you will only foster and encourage the aggression.  Furthermore if your dog ever gets in this state around humans then you should absolutely never allow this dog to be around children without a muzzle. You need to determine if your dogs are truly trying to hurt each other or if they are just engaged in excited play.  Growling while rough housing is normal, but high pitched barks and yelps are usually a sign that they aren't playing anymore. They lick each others wounds when they have exited that state of mind because dogs ALWAYS live in the present.  What happened in the past doesn't really matter anymore, in the present they are hurt and they are a pack so they will tend to each others wounds and may take a nap together like nothing ever happened. I think because you have trouble pointing out a single cause for these outbursts, because they don't exhibit aggression towards humans and because these incidents are relatively rare that the best thing to do is immediately remove them from this situation when it occurs until they have calmed down. Do not yell and do not do anything that might get yourself hurt.  Try to pick up on aggressive cues before an outburst and correct the dog exhibiting aggressive warning signs before this happens.  Also correct the behavior of the other dog if you see it is doing something that is inadvertently antagonizing the other.  They will both learn to trust you more by doing this."
Are there any animal charities that focus on preventing pets from being rehomed in the first place?,"I can't find one and it might be something you could start if you believe in the cause. However, I don't see it as being a feasible option, in the way you probably mean it. There are currently so many animals without homes that they can't keep them in the shelters they currently have. They have to destroy many, many animals that could have a good home life, otherwise. They simply don't have the space or resources to care for more than they are already caring for. So it's unlikely that most people will help a pet that already has a home. They might not be getting the best home, but they have it better than the ones who are put down. Another issue you have is dishonest benefactees. Just like now, you would have so many people abusing programs designed to help people, like food stamps and medicade. I was once working at a temp job and overheard the supervisor telling someone that her food stamps were coming in and she'd be ready to sell them. That program was meant to help people who couldn't feed their families and there are people who can obviously afford food, because they're selling their food stamps to buy extra unapproved items. That's money that could have gone to someone who really needed it. You'll have the same thing. You'll have people that can afford to take good care of their pets, but will refuse to, because they have a work around they can exploit in the charity. The current system is better, because the dogs that are helped are in the sole custody of the care providers and can then be rehomed to someone who will foot the bill for future care. If someone were to create a system to help pets before they're rehomed, that would be great, but you'd need to really police it and think about how people could screw over the system. For instance, it wouldn't be hard at all to design a website where you can add all kinds of information. You have lots of people who are moving into areas that don't allow pets. You could have a place where citizens can submit the names of dwellings that would allow them to keep their pets. If people have medical bills for their pet and they can't afford to pay for them, so are looking at putting their pet down, you can potentially find an institution willing to help them until they can pay it back, though most vets will work with you and get you on a payment plan. Providing links to volunteer trainers that have some kind of basic certification and are willing to help people with their behavior problems, which cause many dogs to be rehomed. Several of these ideas can only benefit the pet without the owner being able to scam the charity. Something I think is very important that such an organization could do is fund groups going into schools to talk to children about proper pet care. Giving children an idea is a powerful thing. I see some groups who realize it and some who don't. Marketers certainly have a grasp on how giving a child and idea can have a huge impact. I can give you examples. Happy Meal toys are an excellent example. This included toys, collectable glasses, etc... The fast food chains can put one commercial on tv and show one of the toys with an exciting commercial and the kids really want it. Even if the adult knows it's a piece of junk and an overpriced, unhealthy meal, they will often get it because they want their child to be happy. Once there, they see there are often a whole set to collect and you can't request one, you just have to keep buying them till you get them all. So where a parent might only buy a single happy meal every few weeks to months, now they get into a loop of buying many in a small period of time, massively driving up sales. Another example from my own childhood. In kindergarten I was taught to put a line over the capital 'J' in my name. Then in first grade they said some educators had changed their minds and we shouldn't do it anymore. Well, the first way I'd learned to do it was with a line over the top and it was such a strong impulse that I was unwilling to change it. The next year they came back and said they were back to putting lines over the J's. I'd been doing it all along. I was also taught in school that Pluto was a planet. I still consider it to be one and I heard recently that they might be adding it back in. The point to those stories is that kids get their first impression on many subjects in school and they stick with them. There are plenty of things my parents do one way, but because I was taught in school that they were done another way, I do them that way. If it's something major I might not make a big deal about it with them, but I just do things the way I think they should be done. That same concept will work with kids now. If people go into schools they can give kids the first impressions they should have. You can help nip fear of animals in the bud, you can explain why spaying and neutering are important, you can tell them that buying a puppy from a breeder is perfectly fine, but they need to find a responsible breeder, also that their are many great dogs in shelters that need good homes. I know at least two adults right now who have un-neutered male dogs. One of them lets his wander. I can ask them both why they don't fix them and they'll both say that it's because they don't want to take away their manhood or make them feel like less of a man. The truth is that they're projecting and that as opposed to making them feel less, you're reducing frustration, testosterone, behavioral issues, and potential medical issues. If you stick it in their heads as kids, they'll lean that way in the future. For those people reading my remark about buying bred puppies and shaking their heads, that's okay. I still think buying a puppy is just fine. I heard the same arguments when the horse market fell through. They'd try to castrate you if you mentioned buying instead of rescuing. While I really support rescue animals and have had many over the years, I've also had good bred dogs, bought from responsible breeders. Dog breeds have been bred for many, many, many years. They were bred for specific purposes and there is nothing wrong with supporting and celebrating those breeds any more than there is in rescuing a shelter animal. The charity could also offer information on good breeder to contact in your area as well. That would be an excellent resource. Also, what to look for in a good breeder. There is lots of information out there, but having it consolidated in one place really makes a difference. This site is a good example. I've been saying kids all along, but adults will benefit from all the educational resources as well. The more good information that is out there the better. So I know I've gotten kind of long winded with this reply, but I feel like it's all on topic with your question. While I couldn't find any specific charities in my searches that do what you are asking about, I do think that you could start or encourage an organization to develop that could provide a large number of resources to help owners and give them the tools and resources that if they were lacking, could cause an owner to loose their beloved pet. Crowd sourcing is an excellent device and if you can find a forum or a place suggested by this site, where you can find like minded people who think this is a good idea. Once you get a group of people together on something like this, it can really take off. Maybe you find someone that either has some extra storage room on a server or they know a business that would be willing donate money to pay the minor fee to get the site storage space and the domain name(s). Maybe there is a web developer who loves his cat and would be willing to donate his time to develop the site and do the coding. Maybe he or she will help maintain it or other volunteers will, though a good developer will make a  back end that is easy for users to maintain the site. The point is it can easily snowball and before you know it you have an organization and all kinds of people looking to help out. Good luck and I hope I answered your question."
How should I react to two fighting cats?,"Should I Stop The Fight? Sometimes cats play fight, and a little squabbling is normal to establish territorial dominance. Signs of a serious cat fight that should be interrupted: How Do I Stop The Fight? The most important thing is to not go near a pair of fighting cats. You risk injury to yourself, the cats, and the cats may associate you with the fight and loose their trust in you. The best way to stop a cat fight is to distract them and interrupt the fight. From a hidden position (you don't want them to associate the distraction with you), create a loud noise (like bang some pots or clap your hands). Often this noise will startle the cats for a few seconds, allowing the victim cat to flee. Occasionally you'll need to interrupt the aggressor cat's sight of the victim cat in order to allow the victim cat time to get to a safe location. This should be done with a towel, pillowcase, or piece of cardboard so that you remain safe and somewhat removed from the situation."
Is there a substrate for a Redfoot tortoise that won't retain excess moisture?,"I find EcoEarth (shredded coconut husk) makes a nice substrate. It can be used wet or dry and even in high humidity environments, I've never had any problems with mold. It's not topsoil, but you might find it useful nonetheless. You could also try a mixture of topsoil and coconut husk. This could give you some of the moisture-balancing properties of coconut husk along with some of the texture and other properties of top soil. I don't find EcoEarth to be terribly exorbitant price-wise. Looks like a three-pack of compressed bricks goes for ~$10 at PetCo. Each brick can be re-hydrated to make 7 or 8L of substrate. Then again, I don't know how big your terrarium is or how deep you want your substrate to be."
Why is my one dog's hobby chewing my other dog's fur?,"I wouldn't worry about it since it's a case of a dog grooming another dog. If it was compulsively grooming itself, it could be a case of dry/irritated skin, allergies, or parasites among others. I think what probably happened is that sometime during their playing Dewey starting the behaviour and it just became a habit for whatever reason. It could be that it's a mild case of Pica, where he just likes the texture. I know some dogs that will compulsively lick their owner's suede couch because they like the texture of it. Wolves will practice a type social grooming when they're relaxed, picking fleas, ticks, and burs, out of each other's fur. So it's possible that it's stemming from that behavior, or started as that behavior and evolved into just something they do after wrestling."
How can I keep vermin out of outdoor pen or enclosure?,"My partner had a similar problem with a bird enclosure and a local company recommended she use a fairly heavy mesh that worked well and solved the problem. The following Garden Zone 403010 1/2"" x 1"" Mesh 16-Gauge Galvanized Wire Fence available on Amazon looks pretty similar. It was fairly tedious but I left a little overlap on the inside and tacked the wire to the inside of the enclosure using 5 minute epoxy so the rats couldn't simply push it out of the way. In the case of chickens maybe you could do something similar and leave straw over the top so they don't notice the difference. Regarding the mesh size the following source states this that seems likely: The smallest diameter hole a small rat might fit through is an important consideration when rat-proofing an outdoor structure against wild rats, and when choosing a cage which will house baby rats. Generally, wire mesh with 1"" x 1"" holes is considered too large a spacing for young rats, while 1"" x 1/2"" and smaller dimensions are narrow enough to keep even the smallest rats inside. For rat-proofing an outdoor enclosure the recommendation is usually 1/2"" x 1/2"" mesh or smaller. So you might like to consider 1/2"" x 1/2"" mesh if available in your area to error on the side of caution, but the larger size worked well in her particular case."
How vulnerable are crossbred (hybrid) dogs to genetic disease?,"I'm going to interpret the genetics portion of the Wikipedia article you cited in plain English, and add what I know from college Biology class: It depends on the parents you use. Crossbreeding dogs (hybridization) is a tactic used by breeders to reduce the chance of inheriting a poor trait from a parent.  Before breeding, it is important to already know the chance of disease for the particular source breed, and knowing the disease / genetic history of the individual source parent.  Genetic testing of the parents prior to breeding may help disqualify parents for crossbreeding. As a bastardization of theory, inbreeding has traditionally shown to produce poor genetic results; while the introduction of additional genes through cross-breeding may introduce different traits to a line, based on the rules of evolution, the resulting crossbred dog most likely to survive will be the one with the best genes.

How much calcium and vitamin D₃ supplementation is beneficial to an adult tortoise who may be deficient?,"It's actually quite common with different species of tortoises to pick at, and even eat, pieces of white gravel. I don't think anyone has come up with a solid reason why, although I haven't really studied it too much to be honest. I can tell you the different reasons I've come across. It could be an indication that they are lacking in something in
their diet. It wouldn't hurt to review your tortoises diet, and make
sure there's not something that he might be missing. Here is a
decent resource to get you started Although it sounds like
you've had yours for a while, so I don't think this is likely. It could also aide in digestion. Kind of like how dogs will eat
grass. It's not that hard to believe, as birds and several reptiles
will do this. Especially since tortoises beaks don't allow for the
the type of grinding that would be useful for a vegetarian diet. One that I found interesting wast that shells and bones would be
bleached white under the sun in the wild. So that color of white is
instinctually recognized as a source of calcium.  As long as you keep an eye on her to make sure she doesn't swallow any overly large stones, I haven't heard anyone have trouble with impaction from it. Although I wouldn't say it's not a risk. I'm also not sure if there's any way to discourage it."
Dad accidentally sat on my cat,"If she’s behaving completely normally (other than probably avoiding your dad) rather than hiding, walking funny or being lethargic, she’s probably fine. I’d keep an eye on her for the next couple days and take her to a vet if you see any strange behavior, but if she’s running and playing as usual, it doesn’t sound like she was hurt."
Why does my cat bite my face while being affectionate?,You said it happens when your are gazing into your cats face..  As a human that is a good thing but to a cat and especially a stray eye contact or stareing is a sign of aggression and that you are going to attack.  To disarm the cat you need to blink slowly and look away.  Don't stare at their face.  
What should you do with kittens when the mother runs away from you?,"Kittens can be taken from their mother without physical risk to their health as soon as they are weaned, which should be at about six weeks of age. The advice to wait longer is based on the idea that staying with mom and their siblings longer helps them to be better socialized pets. It may reduce behavior problems like play aggression because they learn from their family not to do that. But if it's a choice between learning to trust humans, so they could actually happily live as an indoor pet, or become fully socialized with their family, I think most people giving advice would agree that acclimating them to humans is better for them. The younger you can attempt to acclimate them, the more likely you'll succeed. Three months is already well past that key period where you'll be most likely to convince them to accept humans. Therefore, the best option, that will give them longest, healthiest life, is to attempt to catch them as soon as they are weaned, socialize them, and then home them as pets. If they are definitely too old to accept humans, then the most humane option is TNR or ""trap-neuter-return."" This is when you catch the cats in order to neuter or spay to prevent future kittens, then return them to where you caught them, so they can live out their lives in peace. There might be local groups willing to help you attempt to trap-neuter-return, so if you decide on this route, it's a good idea to see if such a thing exists in your area. If there are no such groups, then the safest way to catch them is to use live traps designed for catching but not harming cats. Once you catch them in the trap, take them directly to the vet in the trap, where they can sedate the animal while still in the trap, and no one will ever get close enough to them to be injured. But on that note, you should consult with a vet before you make the attempt, to make sure they will be available to actually do the procedure when you catch a cat. Since you live on a farm, there's a decent likelihood that if you removed all of your feral cats, new ones will discover your farm is now free of cats and move in, so having some neutered animals remain might also help in that way, besides also continuing their pest control services."
What is the maximum age of cats?,"The current Guinness World Record for longest-lived domestic cat belonged to Creme Puff, who lived to be 38 (1967 - 2005). The typical lifespan for indoor domestic cats is estimated at ~15 years."
What can I do for my turtle that fell down three floors?,"As covered in the other answers, your only option is to see a vet in order to have surgery done. Or in the worst case, have it humanely put to rest. I want to stress how important it is that a professional veterinarian/surgeon takes care of this injury. A turtle's shell is not only its spine, but its ribs as well. Below is a diagram of how turtles came to develop their shells that we see today. In the diagram of the modern turtle's skeleton, you can see how the ribs are spread out through the carapace (upper half of the shell). 
(Source) Turtles are slow growers, so unless it's a small crack, it's unlikely that it will heal naturally. A crack as large as yours will have to be rebuilt and sealed in order to prevent water and air from entering the inside of the shell. As far as what's sticking out of the carapace, I'm not very good with identifying internal organs, but based on its location I would say it's either the liver, or some intestines. You can reference the diagram below to see for yourself. 
(Source) Now, as you can see, the crack in your turtle's shell is extremely close to where the lungs should be. You should not try simply press the intestines back inside as you could risk pressing against the lungs, collapsing them, or interrupting the heartbeat, causing a stroke. I imagine your turtle is pretty stressed out from the injury, so the shock of moving his insides, even if you managed to avoid the lungs and heart, could very well kill him. If it is the intestines sticking out, you have the risks I've mentioned, but also the risk of placing them back inside in a way that would encourage impaction. Hopefully you've been able to get him to a vet. Otherwise be sure to keep the wound clean with pure water, keep the turtle out of the tank, but rinse him twice a day to keep him hydrated until the vet appointment."
Should I worry about my cat jumping out the window?,"Yes you should worry, lots of bad things could happen: The cat may get frightened or be chasing an insect and bolt for the
window then fail to stop in time, slip and fall. The cat may sleep in the windowsill in the sun, roll over, and fall. The cat may run out on a ledge outside or jump down to someone's air
conditioner sticking out below or otherwise trap themselves someplace
that would require trained rescue specialists to retrieve them. Cats are thought of as extremely coordinated and agile but they slip, trip, fall and fail in estimating jump distances all the time. "
My cat is a houdini and keeps escaping her cone [duplicate],"The cone can be tightened so it is very snug. As long as you can fit two fingers under it, the cone is not too tight, but she should also not be able to get it off. For most cats, it doesn't take very long for them to get accustomed to the cone, and resigned to the fact that they can't get it off. Of course, some cats are amazingly adept at getting them off despite every attempt to avoid this.  There are other types of cones (Elizabeth collars) which you can pick up at vets and pet stores. Some pets do better with hard collars, others better with soft collars. As a short term solution, if you cannot keep the cone on and she is licking at the incision, then you can fashion something for her to wear to cover the incision, such as a small t-shirt. The other most important part after surgery such as this is keeping her confined to a small area. The less area she has to jump and run and rub against objects, the easier it is to control things like the cone."
Can a bath really kill a rabbit?,"Kind of...  bathing can be very stressful to a rabbit; stress can cause body function changes that can kill a rabbit. Rabbit digestive systems are fairly fragile, and stress can upset the balance in their gut causing them to go into GI Stasis.  When this happens, the GI tract shuts down and unless this is dealt with in the first few days, it is usually fatal.  The problem is it can take a day or two before you can tell for sure that your rabbit is in stasis, so the rabbit is often beyond help before the problem is noticed.  GI Stasis kills more rabbits than any other cause.   I have a few rabbits that have needed a bath from time to time.  These are the tips I have for bathing your rabbit: Make sure you have rabbit safe shampoo. Many human, dog, and cat shampoos contain chemicals that are toxic to rabbits.  Make sure you are going to use a cleaning product that it is rabbit safe.  If it does not state that it is, assume that it is not, just to be safe.  Make sure that you really need shampoo.  If you just have urine on the hindquarters (this is pretty common in male rabbits), that can usually be rinsed away with water on the surface of the fur, without the need for thorough cleaning with shampoo. Use warm, but not hot water.  Rabbit fur generally protects your rabbit from the effects of water, but when you are bathing them, the water will soak through to the skin.  If it is too hot or too cold, your rabbit could go into shock.  My rule of thumb is water that I could put my hand in with no immediate discomfort, and leave in without any discomfort.  If it is too hot/cold for you, it is too hot/cold for your rabbit.   Do not make your rabbit sit in a pool of water.  I have a raised grate that I use for rabbit baths.  It is not normal for rabbits to sit in water, and doing so causes them stress.   Keep your rabbit properly supported. - A rabbit spine can break relatively easily.  And even if it does not break, if your rabbit is not being supported properly, it can be painful and cause stress.  Most of the time, your rabbit will want its back feet supported.  When you need to clean that area, flip the rabbit over into Trance position.  Make sure that the rabbit's back is properly supported, then clean the feet, and genital area. Bathe only the areas needed.  The most common problem I see is that some of my rabbits will get some poop caked on their feet and/or underside.  When this happens, I do my best only to wash the areas that need cleaning.  This will reduce the time spent in the bath.  Also when you bathe your rabbit, the process will wash away some of the natural oils that protects the rabbit and its fur.  Limiting the areas you bathe reduces the impact of this. Try to avoid getting water in their nose. This is as uncomfortable to a rabbit as it is to you, and they do not have the ability to blow their nose like we do.  For this reason, I try my best to avoid getting my rabbits' heads wet at all.  When it happens, I immediately try to help the rabbit by drying their nose with cotton balls.  Just hold it for a second or two on each nostril, repeating until it comes away dry.    Dry your rabbit as thoroughly as possible.  When the bath is done, if the rabbit is not dried well, they will get cold and this causes stress, and may even send them into shock.  I dry my rabbits with towels.  If the rabbit has angora fur, you may want use a blow dryer on low heat. YOUR RABBIT SHOULD NOT SMELL LIKE FRUIT OR FLOWERS! Rabbits are very attuned to scents, and changing the scent on them can be traumatic to the rabbit, which may cause problems with any of its companions.  Rabbits normally have a gamey smell to them.  This is their natural scent and using scented soap or perfumes on them can be very stressful. I would also note that my rabbits are used to being picked up, held, petted, posed, and thoroughly examined.  We do this partly because they are show rabbits and need to be able to handle that, and partly because we love them very much and they get a lot of attention.  I believe that their being used to this treatment helps reduce the stress when a bath is needed."
What can be done to stop roosters from crowing all day and night?,"Roosters are very territorial animals. They crow to mark their territory and warn other roosters off or establish their order of rank if there are several roosters in the flock. The easiest solution would be to have all the hens living in one big coop together and reduce the number of roosters to 1. You'll still hear him, but much less constantly. If your neighbor isn't willing to get rid of his excess roosters, he should at least divide his yard into clear territories for each rooster and put an opaque barrier in between. The remaining roosters will probably start a little crowing battle as soon as one of them starts crowing, but the lack of sight should calm the situation down after a short back-and-forth. Living in close proximity with other roosters is a constant stressor. The ""alpha"" rooster will not stop intimidating the other ones in the flock, even if they do not challenge his status. And once one rooster starts crowing they will all follow, one after the other. Read here for more information. The next problem arises if the area is too small or otherwise unsuited for the flock. You write ""He's put up a few pens with chickens"". If these pens are too small for the number of chickens, they get bored and cannot entertain themselves with scratching holes or anything. If you're lucky, there are local or national directives concerning how much space each chicken must have that your neighbor is required to follow. Hens should also have free access to a hen house or any kind of hiding spot or roof in addition to a rail that is raised from the ground. If they feel like they cannot hide away from a bird of prey (therefore the roofs) or a land predator (therefor the rail) they may crow to warn each other of every little thing that seems remotely dangerous. And lastly, roosters can crow if they're out of food and/or water. (source) If there actually is only one rooster, you cannot expect your neighbor to get rid of it. Not having a rooster causes stress to the hens. And unfortunately, some rooster just like to crow constantly... There are some tricks to stop them from crowing at night, but it's your neighbor who must implement them."
What bad breath solutions exist for dogs?,I can think of three options:
How do I prevent my cat from getting on the table?,"Your cat does not understand you when you tell her to stay off the table. At 7 months old, she's still a kitten (really more like an adolescent, actually, which makes it even more difficult). If you sometimes let her up on the table, then you're not sending a clear message to her.  You have to be consistent. If you want to ban her from the table, then you have to remove her immediately after she gets on the table, whenever you see her doing it.  Every. Single.  Time.   If she persists in treating it like a game, you have a couple of options. The first is to remove her from the room altogether.  If she jumps on the table, immediately pick her up and put her back on the floor.  If she tries to immediately jump back up again, pick her up and carry her out of the room, then put her down.  Removing her from the room sends a much clearer message that you aren't playing, and that her being on the table is undesirable behavior. Another option is to make the table much less inviting.  As it stands now, you've made the table top a very attractive and entertaining place for your cat to be.  There's water to drink, games to play, and possibly even sometimes a snack available. If she's drinking water out of the container on the table, remove the container of water from the table.  Make sure an alternate, more appropriate water source is available somewhere nearby, instead.  If her normal water source isn't in the same room as the table, consider adding a dish of water for her (or a pet water fountain nearby. If all else fails, you can try making the table top actively uncomfortable for her to be on.  Put a tablecloth on the table, and place long strips of double-sided tape along the top.  She will almost certainly dislike stepping on the tape, and it should dissuade her from being on the table top.  After a week or two, you can try removing the tape to see if she's learned to avoid the table."
"Cat REALLY wants to leave his ""safe"" room after 1 day at our house","If your cat wants to explore the area you should let him do so, but leave the door to his safe spot open so he can hide there if or when he gets scared. Every cat is different and some are brave and face changes head on while others are shy and need more time to feel comfortable in a new place. Unless you have other pets there is no reason to put him in a separate room, but you should make a few safe resting places for him like a cat tree or other elevated places where he can observe the area in safety."
What factors should I use to decide when its time to euthanize my elderly cat with kidney disease?,"I've had two cats who ultimately died because of kidney disease.  In both cases, the cats let me know and the final drop-off was pretty fast.  Definitely consult your vet, but it sounds like your cat's quality of life is still good.   A 6-pound cat will eat less than a 12-pound cat.  There are ways to get more calories into your cat even if she doesn't eat much; your vet can advise you on this.  Keeping her hydrated is important.  If you're dealing with late-stage kidney disease then you're probably already giving her subcutaneous fluids; ask your vet if you should adjust the amount. I said my cats let me know when it was time.  For the first one (age 18.5), he'd been declining but was still enjoying life -- and then one morning he didn't want to get up, and when I picked him and carried him to the food dish he took a couple steps and fell.  I spent the next several hours with him in my lap and intermittently talking with my vet.  He didn't seem to be in pain, but he wasn't trying any more. The other one (at least 16; we didn't know exactly), she started sleeping a lot and found some hiding places, and on that last day she walked very slowly and unsteadily (and didn't want to at all).  Again it was clear, especially after the experience of the first one. Make your cat comfortable, let her enjoy her remaining time, make sure she continues to get nutrients and water, and consult your vet."
Why don't cats eat snails?,"Yes, there is something inherently repulsive in snails: their slime, which is sticky and sometimes stinks or tastes bad. Snails not only produce it to slither over surfaces, when they are attacked or injured, they produce lots of it as a defensive mechanism, relying on the attacker being grossed out by the sticky slime in their mouth. Most animals find it repulsing, not only cats. This article states: Land snail defenses against predators include cryptic coloration and texture; thickened shells and aperture barriers; defense mucus production including irritating smells and tastes; hiding behaviors, and rapid withdrawal or dislodging movements Another reason is that cats evolved to eat small mammals, like rodents, and birds. Those have a very specific mixture of protein, fat, minerals (like calcium) and fiber in their bodies that the cat relies on for nutrition. Snails, on the other hand, don't contain as much protein, very little fiber and almost no fat at all, as pointed out in this paper about feeding snails to livestock: In general, only a portion of the normal diet should be replaced by snail meal because of the possible lower protein content and poorer amino acid profile compared to the normal high quality fish meal diet. '* All values indicate the percentage by weight of dry matter, which means the numbers are even worse for fresh (slimy) snail meat. And lastly cats are lie-in-wait hunters whose prey drive is stimulated by movements and shuffling sounds, instead of foragers who would pick up a snail as an easy snack. As pointed out in several comments, this does not mean that cats never eat snails. That your particular cat doesn't like snails can be personal preference - or rather aversion."
Teaching a dog to play fetch,"Teaching a retrieve is a great example of when you can use backchaining to get your desired effect. Essentially, when backchaining a sequence (in this case, go get something and bring it back), you start with the last thing in the sequence and add a ton of value into that, then slowly add in the steps backwards. Because you've built so much value into the last steps, the dog is always looking forward to them and so the earlier steps are reinforced by the later steps. Here's a plan that we've been going though lately to teach our dog, Nova, to bring things back. We had a lot of work to do because she'd always run away with toys and wasn't into tugging much, but she's improved immensely and is finally starting to retrieve automatically and with enthusiasm. Prequisites If you have a dog that loves to tug, you have a huge advantage. If you don't, you may want to spend some time building value into playing tug (here are some reasons to play tug), but you can use food as a reward too. Sample Steps The first step is to get your dog to bring the toy to you from almost no distance. Just drop the toy, back up a bit (start off with one step or less), and encourage your dog to come to you. If he does, reinforce that decision (click and treat, just treat, play tug, etc). If that's too much right now and your dog runs off, start in a small space (bathroom, closet, corner) where the dog can't run off and self-reinforce. You can even do this sitting and simply ask for a hand-touch. As your dog gets more confident, slowly increase the distance after you drop the toy. Allow the dog more freedom to make bad choices, while reinforcing the good ones. Eventually, you can play games such as running all around the yard or house with your dog chasing you with a toy. If he drops the toy, end the game and try again. When he catches up to you, have a party and play tug / give treats. Try doing this with different toys and things. Eventually you'll have a dog who loves bringing you things. Now it's time to continue backchaining. Start with dropping the toy on the ground and letting your dog pick it up to play the chase game. As you progress, increase the distance you're throwing the toy and pretty soon you'll have a dog who runs out with enthusiasm, and immediately runs back with the toy. Remember to only reward average or better responses and not to compare your dog's ""average"" to others. Further Reading Denise Fenzi Series series on behavior chains."
Crate-training our puppy is not working - help!,"Housebreaking doesn't work simply by putting a dog in his crate. There are things you need to work on even when the dog isn't inside his crate to make sure he learns where he can go and where he cant. The first thing you have to realize is what you're doing is working. Your dog isn't broken, and your on the right track. Many people have similar issues, and it's going to take time (more than 6 weeks!) to housebreak your puppy. A few tips below: Remember to use praise when he goes outside. Good luck."
Why is a female orange tabby rare?,"The color orange has to be present on all X-chromosomes that the cat has. A male cat has 1 X-chromosome, while a female cat has 2 X-chromosomes. Therefore, a male cat has to inherit the color orange only from his mother (his father's color does not matter). A female cat must inherit the orange color from both her mother and father, and so that is statistically more rare (but not exceptionally so). It's explained in more detail, with approximate percentages for the UK, in David Greene's book Light and Dark: An Exploration in Science, Nature, Art and Technology. The presence of orange fur arose from a mutation of the non-orange gene on the X-chromosome into the orange gene. The effect of the orange gene is to replace dark colours with orange and to suppress the action of any non-agouti gene. Consequently, the orange colour is never uniformly dark but is always associated with some kind of pattern, although the contrast between the two shades of orange may be slight. Because male cats have only one X-chromosome, the occurrence of the orange gene in a large population equals the faction of male cats that have orange fur. This is commonly around 30% in Britain. On female cats the equivalent orange coat occurs only when the non-orange gene is absent, which requires both X-chromosomes to carry the orange gene. The fraction of such females is 30% of 30% which equals 9%.... Female cats with no orange gene on either X-chromosome form 70% of 70%, i.e. 49% of the female population. The remaining 42% of the female population have the orange gene on one X-chromosome and the non-orange gene on the other. Instead of one gene being dominant and the other recessive, both genes contribute to the colour. Patches of orange fur and of dark fur occur side by side, and the cat is described as a tortoiseshell or 'tortie'. The combination of these two colours, with our without additional white patches, is found on female cats only. The very rare male tortie has two X chromosomes and one Y, and is invariably sterile. Another book, John Bradshaw's Cat Sense: How the New Feline Science Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet, is also in agreement. Also note from this logic, for a cat to inherit the color orange from its father, the father must be orange. However, if the cat inherits the color orange from its mother, the mother can be orange OR tortoiseshell. "
"Is the ""Million Bubble Air Pump"" necessary for the long-term health of sea-monkeys?","Is there any actual benefit to this? Will using one have a noticeable impact on either the individual lifespan of the shrimp, or the long-term survival of the ecosystem? It depends entirely on your current method of aerating your tank. If you aren't adding oxygen to the water (usually by bubbling air through it) then the answer to both questions is yes - any aeration is better than none. If you are already aerating your tank enough to meet their needs, then there's no additional benefit to using this method, other than ease of use if that compares more favorably to your current method. Brine shrimp (Sea MonkeysTM) survive in low level oxygen environments.  They can live long lives with low oxygen levels, so if your only concern is making sure they live a long time, then as long as they aren't dying, it's very likely that you are putting enough oxygen into their environment. It only takes a few seconds a day with a straw for a human to blow enough bubbles in their water to sufficiently oxygenate the water for survival. To reproduce, though, they will require more oxygen than mere survival requirements dictate: ...with a good oxygen supply, the brine shrimp are a pale pink or yellow, or if they are heavily feeding on microalgae they will look green in color. In this ideal condition, growth and reproduction is rapid, and a self-sustaining supply is possible. (source) So by observing the color of the shrimp, you should be able to deduce whether you are oxygenating enough for reproduction or not.  Note, however, that reproduction requires several other good tank conditions, so even if you don't plan on having them reproduce, color is a decent indicator of oxygenation. Typically you don't want too much oxygen - not because it'll hurt the shrimp, but to prevent algae and other undesirable life in the tank.  One of the reasons brine shrimp are so popular is because they are easy to take care of, and one of the reasons this is the case is because they do well in low oxygen level environments which acts as a deterrent to other life."
